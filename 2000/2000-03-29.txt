An emergency resolution urging
the State of Ohio use funds from the
tobacco settlement to convert Mt.
Sinai-East, Mt. Sinai-Univeristy Circle, St. Michael, and Deaconess Hospital from for profit-to-not-for-profit
facilities.
Whereas, over the past recent
weeks the Greater Cleveland community has seen the results of an
antiquated regulatory health delivery system that has resulted in the
proposed closure of Mt. Sinai-East,
Mt. Sinai-University Circle, and St.
Michael as well as the possible sale
of Deaconess Hospital; and
Whereas, these proposed closings
will have a detrimental impact in
Cleveland inner city neighborhoods
since the residents that reside in
these communities must now travel
outside
their
neighborhood
to
receive health care services at other
suburban hospitals; and
Whereas, these hospital closings
have resulted in the closure of emergency rooms and trauma centers,
which
drastically
decrease
the
accessibility of emergency medical
care to residents in the City of
Cleveland; and
Whereas, these hospital closings
have greatly reduced the accessibility of hospital care to the City’s population of indigent, elderly, and
working poor who reside in Cleveland and are in most need for medical services; and
Whereas,
State
Representative
John E. Barnes has proffered a plan
to eradicate an antiquated regulatory health delivery system that has
resulted in hospital closings by
proposing
that
specific
funding
streams be used for these hospitals
in order to keep them open; and
Whereas, a resolution has been
introduced in the State General

March 29, 2000
Assembly by State Representative
John E. Barnes urging the State of
Ohio to use funds from the tobacco
settlement to prevent to the closings
of these hospitals; and
Whereas, this resolution calls for
the State to use these specific funds
for converting these hospitals from
for-profit to not-for-profit facilities
as well as providing direct capital
assistance and bonds totaling $100
million to implement such conversion; and
Whereas,
this
resolution
also
urges the State to set aside $10 million from the Victims of Violent
Crimes fund to reestablish the trauma care unit at Mt. Sinai-University
Circle and emergency room care at
other hospitals serving victims of
violent
crime
and
to
establish
Health and Economic Solvency Commissions to review long term implications of acquisitions that convert
not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit
hospitals; now therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland supports the resolution proffered by Representative
Barnes urging the State of Ohio to
use funds from the tobacco settlement to convert Mt. Sinai-East, Mt.
Sinai-University Circle, St. Michael,
and Deaconess Hospitals from forprofit to not-for-profit facilities in
order to keep these institutions open
to serve the residents in their
respective communities.
Section 2. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland strongly urges
Ohio Governor Robert Taft to support the House Resolution introduced by State Representative John
E. Barnes.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to transmit
