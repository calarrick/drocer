I am vetoing Ordinance No. 1769-2000
passed on October 9, 2000, which
would have allowed certain persons
to engage in peddling in Ward 1.
During my evaluation of this ordinance, I considered a variety of factors. The overwhelming reason that
I have vetoed this ordinance is
because of the concerns of the residents of Ward 1.
The residents of Ward 1 have displayed a long history of opposition
to peddling. As the Mayor of this
City, I have a responsibility to
respect the wishes of the residents
of Cleveland and to do what is best
to maintain the quality of life in our
in our City. To ignore this responsibility would be disrespectful to the
residents of Ward 1, and to the
office, which they have bestowed
upon me. For the reasons stated
above, I am vetoing Ordinance No.
1769-2000.
Sincerely,

Without objection. Appointment

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 1416-2000.
By Councilman Coats.
An emergency resolution urging
the President of the United States
and the United States Congress to
take certain actions and make necessary changes to improve the quality of life in the United States.
Whereas, this Council recognizes
that there are some communities in
the United States where certain
basic needs are not met and the
quality of life is substandard; and
Whereas, the federal government
has an obligation to ensure that all
United States citizens receive adequate health care, education, job
training and safe housing; and
Whereas, the federal government,
in carrying out this obligation, must
seek solutions to the inequities within the system, including providing
funding for social service and economic development programs; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety in
that United States citizens who are
poor, destitute, or underprivileged
have a right to a decent quality of
life, now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the President of
the United States and the United
States Congress are hereby called
upon to do the following in order to
improve the quality of life in our
nation:

homeless and for homelessness.
Provide more funding for seniors
for health care and prescription
medicine.
Provide
economic
development
programs in Empowerment Zones in all
impoverished communities throughout
the United States.

poor communities and provide additional funding to keep hospitals
open in those communities.

October 25, 2000

Refuse to condone the use of the

Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit

Speaker of the House.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period

Whereas,
Minister

word
regardless of religious affiliation;
and
Whereas,
Minister
Louis
Farrakhan has requested all men to
return to Washington, D.C. with
their families for the Million Family March recognizing the anniversary of the Million Man March; and
Whereas,
the
Million
Family
March is necessary to bring about
change in our community, to unify
all families, regardless of race,
creed, class, color or religious
affiliation
and
to
encourage
fathers
and
mothers
to
come
together for the benefit of their
children; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for
the immediate preservation of public peace, property, health or safety in that it is essential that people speak out in a unified voice
against crime and violence and on
behalf of good will, peace and
kindness toward all, now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of

which information was provided, in
order for City Council to perform its
due diligence review of the technical, legal and financial ability of
Adelphia to perform the obligations
of the Franchise and consider the
effect of the proposed Transfer on
the health, safety and welfare of the
citizens of the City of Cleveland;
and
Whereas, after extensive review
of Cablevision’s compliance with the
Franchise and Adelphia’s technical,
legal and financial ability to perform the obligations of the Franchise, which review included public
hearings, this Council entered into
negotiations with Cablevision and
Adelphia
to
address
the
issues
raised by the proposed Transfer;
and
Whereas, City Council, pursuant
to Section 617 of the federal Cable
Act [47 U.S.C., 537], was required to
act on the request to approve the
Transfer of the Franchise within
one hundred twenty (120) days of
receiving a complete FCC Form 394,

The City Record
which time period was to expire on
August 8, 2000, or the Council would
lose its rights with respect to the
proposed
Transfer,
because
the
Transfer would have been deemed
approved if no action was taken
prior to said date of August 8, 2000;
and
Whereas, despite negotiations by
representatives
of
City
Council,
Adelphia and Cablevision, the parties were unable to reach agreement
prior to August 8, 2000 on relevant
issues raised by the proposed Transfer including terms and conditions
to address issues of non-compliance
by Cablevision and the ability of
Adelphia to perform under this
Franchise; and
Whereas, in order to preserve its
rights under federal law by acting
on Cablevision’s and Adelphia's
request
within
the
time
period
allowed by the Cable Act, this Council determined, pursuant to Ordinance No. 1219-2000, passed July 17,
2000, that it was in the best interests of the residents and Subscribers
of Cleveland, to disapprove the
Transfer of the Franchise from
Cablevision to Adelphia; and
Whereas, after continued negotiations with Cablevision and Adelphia
to address the relevant issues raised
by the proposed Transfer, this Council has determined that it is in the
best interests of the residents and
Subscribers of Cleveland to approve
the Transfer of the Franchise from
Cablevision to Adelphia provided
that Cablevision and Adelphia are
willing to accept certain terms and
conditions of the Transfer as set
forth in this Ordinance, and to execute the Franchise Transfer Ordinance
Acceptances
(the
“Acceptances”) attached as File No. 17292000-A; and
Whereas, Cablevision and Adelphia have agreed to accept such
terms and conditions and to execute
the
Acceptances;
Adelphia
has
agreed to execute the Guaranty
attached as File No. 1729-2000-B; and
the parties have agreed to extend
the date of the expiration of the
Franchise Agreement from September 15, 2001 to September 15, 2006;
now, therefore,
