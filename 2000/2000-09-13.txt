VETO
File No. 1514-2000-A.

Council President
Cleveland City Hall, Room 216
601 Lakeside Avenue
Cleveland, Ohio 44114
Re: Ordinance No. 1514-2000
Dear Council President Polensek:
I am vetoing Ordinance No. 15142000 passed August 28, 2000, which
would have amended Ordinance No.
1748-99. I must do so because City
Council’s attempt to correct the
amendments
that
Council
had
attached to the original legislation
comes, as you are aware, after my
Administration had already moved
to comply with the Ordinance by
placing
the
Rockefeller
Park
improvements under contract. Further explanation for this action is
provided below.
Ordinance
No.
1748-99,
passed
April 17, 2000, was intended to
authorize public improvements of
numerous
City-owned
parks
and
recreation facilities for the Department of Parks, Recreation and Properties. The monies listed therein
were originally allocated according
to the needs of the individual parks
and facilities as defined by the
experts within the Administration
who did holistic evaluations of all
of the City owned facilities. Based
on these opinions, $350,000.00 was
allocated to improvements under the
heading of “Rockefeller Park Phase
VI”, which was to include, but was
not limited to, improvements for several of the Cultural Gardens and the
tennis courts.
As you are aware, at the hearing
before the Parks, Recreation and
Properties Committee of City Council, chaired by Councilman Edward
Rybka, the Committee reallocated
the funds directed to Rockefeller
Park in the Ordinance. The Committee voted to take $82,000.00 from
Rockefeller Park, including the Cultural Gardens, and authorize the use
of those funds for the “Gunning
Park Recreation Center Phase II
Improvements” in Ward 21 for Councilman Michael Dolan. This raised
the total allocation for Gunning
Park
Recreation
Center
to
$118,000.00, and lowered the Rockefeller Park allocation to $268,000.00.
As you know, my Administration
has always supported the Cultural

The City Record

4
Gardens as one of Cleveland’s most
unique and serene park settings, as
well as a fitting tribute to our diversity. I feel we must continue to
embrace our ethnicity and provide
sanctuary for each of the many cultures
that
make
Cleveland
the
vibrant community that it is. I am
dismayed that the City Council
moved to abscond funds dedicated
for this purpose to help one of their
members and are now trying to disguise that fact in the form of
untimely, illegal legislation.
Once Ordinance No. 1748-99 had
been
passed,
my
Administration
moved forward in compliance with
the law. The Department of Parks,
Recreation and Properties consulted
the City Record in an attempt to
determine
how
the
$268,000.00
remaining for the Rockefeller Park
improvements was to be divided, but
the City Record provided no guidance. Accordingly, the Department
proceeded to allocate the funds in
the manner most economical and
advantageous for the City, despite
the unfortunate impact the amendments had on the Department’s ability to properly improve the Park,
and, most significantly, the Cultural
Gardens. The City entered into a
contract with R.J. Platten on August
19, 2000 in the amount of $267,698.72
to perform the improvements at
Rockefeller Park, and the work is
scheduled to commence September
11, 2000. Clearly this action predated the passage by City Council of
Ordinance No. 1514-2000.
After consultation with the Law
Department, I have been advised by
a City attorney that the City Council cannot unilaterally amend a contractual obligation properly entered
into by the City on the basis of
existing legislative authority; hence,
Ordinance No. 1514-2000 is illegal. As
the Administration’s actions fully
complied with all the legal requirements for entering into a public
improvement contract, including the
authority granted in the original
ordinance, the amendment proposed
by Ordinance No. 1514-2000 cannot be
imposed on the Administration and
its contractor retroactively.
For the reasons stated above I am
vetoing Ordinance No. 1514-2000 and
I have directed the Director of the
Department of Parks, Recreation
and Property to continue moving
forward with the Rockefeller Park
Phase VI project.

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES REFERRED
Ord. No. 1574-2000.
By Councilmen Jackson, Melena,
Cimperman and Patmon (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the acquisition and disposition
of
real
property
and
the
improvements located thereon comprising
Longwood
Apartments,
accepting a grant from the United
States Department of Housing and
Urban Development in connection
with the redevelopment of that property, authorizing agreements with
the United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and
with new Longwood Associates L.P.
in connection therewith and authorizing and approving related matters.
Whereas, pursuant to the authority of Section 203 of the Housing and
Community Development Amendments
of 1978, 12 U.S.C. §1701z-11, as
amended by Section 101(b) of the
Multifamily Housing Property Disposition Reform Act of 1994 (as so
amended, the “Act”) and regulations
promulgated pursuant thereto (the
“Regulations”), the United States
Department of Housing and Urban
Development, acting by and through
the Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development (“HUD”), has determined to dispose of certain real
property
and
the
improvements
thereon located in the City of Cleveland (the “City”) known as Longwood Apartments (the “Property”);
and
Whereas, pursuant to the Act and
the Regulations, HUD has determined that it is necessary and
appropriate to make available an
up-front grant in an amount presently
estimated
not
to
exceed
$25,160,000 in connection with demolition,
rebuilding,
redevelopment
and other related development of
the Property; and
Whereas, in order to provide the
up-front grant in the most economically
efficient
manner
possible,
HUD wishes to convey title to the
Property to the City pursuant to a
Contract for Sale (the “HUD Contract for Sale”) between HUD and

September 13, 2000
the City, and to make the up-front
grant available pursuant to an
Upfront
Grant
Agreement
(the
“Grant Agreement”) between HUD
and the City, a copy of which is in
File No. 1574-2000-A (the “File”); and
Whereas, New Longwood Associates L.P., or its designated successors or assigns (the “Developer”)
has offered to purchase the Property from the City and to redevelop a
portion of the Property into a multifamily housing complex containing
629 affordable living units, together
with related and supporting facilities, at an estimated total development
cost
of
approximately
$110,000,000; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that the acquisition of the Property
from HUD pursuant to the HUD Contract for Sale and the sale of the
Property to the Developer by private
negotiation and the redevelopment
of the Property by the Developer
pursuant to a Redevelopment Agreement (the “Redevelopment Agreement”) is in the best interest of the
City and is the best means of accomplishing the necessary redevelopment of the Property in order to
carry out the City’s public purpose
of providing safe, decent and sanitary affordable housing in the City;
and
Whereas, in order to complete the
redevelopment of the Property in
accordance with the Act, the Regulations
and
the
Redevelopment
Agreement, the City intends to loan
the proceeds of the up-front grant to
the Developer pursuant to the Redevelopment
Agreement
and
upon
mutually agreeable terms and conditions as provided in the Redevelopment Agreement; and
Whereas, this Council finds that
the proposed acquisition, sale and
redevelopment of the Property will
improve the welfare of the City and
its residents by accomplishing the
aforesaid public purpose; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. This Council determines
that, in order to carry out the City’s
public purpose of providing safe,
decent and sanitary affordable housing in the City, and notwithstanding
and as an exception to any provision of the Codified Ordinances of
the City, the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies is hereby authorized to execute and deliver, on

bodily substance at the time of the
alleged violation as shown by chemical analysis of the defendant’s
blood, urine, breath other bodily substance withdrawn within two hours
of the time of the alleged violation.
When a person submits to a blood
test at the request of a police officer under RC 4511.191, only a physician, a registered nurse or a qualified technician or chemist shall
withdraw blood for the purpose of
determining its alcohol, drug, or
alcohol and drug content. This limitation does not apply to the taking
of breath or urine specimens. A
physician, a registered nurse or a
qualified technician or chemist may
refuse to withdraw blood for the
purpose of determining the alcohol,
drug, or alcohol and drug content of
the blood, if in his opinion the physical welfare of the person would be
endangered by the withdrawing of
blood.
Such bodily substance shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Ohio Director
of Health by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by the
Director of health pursuant to RC
3701.143.
If there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than ten-hundredths of one percent (0.10%) by
weight of alcohol in the defendant’s
blood,
less
than
ten-hundredths
(0.10) of one gram by weight of
alcohol per 210 liters of his breath
or less than fourteen-hundredths
(0.14) of one gram by weight of
alcohol per 100 milliliters of his
urine, such fact may be considered
with other competent evidence in
determining the guilt or innocence
of the defendant. This paragraph
does not limit or affect a criminal
prosecution for a violation of division (c) of this section relating to

14
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol in the
blood, breath or urine.
Upon the request of the person
who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to him, his attorney or agent,
immediately upon the completion of
the chemical test analysis.
The person tested may have a
physician, a registered nurse or a
qualified technician or chemist of
this own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests in addition to
any administered at the request of
a police officer, and shall be so
advised. The failure or inability to
obtain an additional chemical test
by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to
the chemical test or tests taken at
the request of a police officer.
Any physician, registered nurse o
qualified technician or chemist who
withdrawn blood from a person pursuant to this section, and any hospital, first-aid station or clinic at
which blood is withdrawn from a
person pursuant to this section, is
immune from criminal liability, and
from civil liability that is based
upon a claim of assault and battery
or based upon any other claim that
is not in the nature of a claim of
malpractice, for any act performed
in withdrawing blood from a person.

An emergency resolution supporting early identification, diagnosis
and treatment of mental health and
substance
abuse
for
juveniles
charged with offenses.
Whereas, this Council believes
that the problem associated with
mentally ill juvenile offenders is of
national concern; and
Whereas, it has been established
that the vast majority of juveniles
entering the criminal justice system
suffer from both substance abuse
and mental illness; and
Whereas, it is estimated that ten
percent of the juveniles in correctional facilities are diagnosed with
a major mental illness or have
severe or chronic mental health
problems that require psychiatric
treatment; and
Whereas, it has been determined
that many mentally ill offenders can
be successfully treated if they receive early and appropriate intensive mental health treatment in
structured placement; and
Whereas,
the
current
juvenile
criminal justice system, both locally
and nationally, is not structured to
provide appropriate levels of treatment and care for mentally ill
offenders to ensure the safety of the
mentally ill, the other confined juveniles and persons in the community;
and
Whereas, it is essential for juveniles, whenever possible, to undergo
dual diagnosis of mental illness and
substance abuse in order to effectively determine the degree to which
such juveniles must receive substance abuse treatment and/or psychiatric treatment; and

Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the

By Councilman Coats.
An emergency resolution supporting passage of federal legislation
devoted to preventing hate crimes
and urging the federal government
to establish a grant program to
assist state and local investigations
and prosecutions of hate crimes.
Whereas, efforts must be taken at
all levels of government to respond
to the staggering brutality of hate
crimes that have shocked the nation;
and
Whereas, the incidence of violence
motivated by the actual or perceived
race, color, national origin, religion,
sexual orientation, gender or disability of the victim poses a serious
national problem; and
Whereas, many states have no
laws addressing violence based on
the actual or perceived race, color,
national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender or disability of the
victim, while other states have laws
that provide only limited protection;
and
Whereas, all people deserve to be
safe within their communities, free
to live, work and worship without
fear of violence and bigotry; and
Whereas, individuals who commit
crimes based on hate and bigotry
must be held responsible for their
actions and must be stopped from
spreading violence; and
Whereas, although local authorities will continue to be responsible
for prosecuting the overwhelming
majority of violent crimes, including
crimes motivated by hate, federal
jurisdiction
over
certain
violent
crimes motivated by hate are necessary to supplement state and local
efforts to ensure that justice is
achieved in each case; and
Whereas, any efforts undertaken
by the federal government to combat hate crimes must respect the primacy that states and local officials
have traditionally been accorded in
the criminal prosecution of acts constituting hate crimes; and
Whereas, expanding federal jurisdiction over certain violent crimes
motivated by hate enables federal,
state and local authorities to work
together as partners in the investigation and prosecution of such hate
crimes; and

The City Record
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports passage of federal hate crime
legislation so long as it does not
supercede the right of state and
local communities to legislate and
prosecute in the area of hate crimes.
Further, this Council urges the federal government to establish a grant
program to assist state and local
investigations and prosecutions of
hate crimes.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and is hereby directed to

Attorney General, to Senators Mike
DeWine and George Voinovich, and

An emergency resolution supporting the closure of loopholes in federal firearms laws and pending legislation.
Whereas, federal law presently
permits any individual, regardless of
age, to purchase any rifle, shotgun
or other long gun, including assault
weapons, in a private sale; and
Whereas, federal law also presently permits individuals over age 18
and under age 21 to purchase a
handgun, including an assault pistol, in a private transaction; and
Whereas, many firearms are now
sold privately at or in association
with organized gun shows; and
Whereas,
no
federal
agency
presently has jurisdiction to regulate or otherwise oversee the design,
safety and responsible marketing of
firearms; and
Whereas, the United States Senate
has approved a measure exempting
pawn shops from conducting background checks upon individuals redeeming firearms previously pawned;
and
Whereas, the Internet has the
potential to function as a wholly
unregulated “virtual gun show” and
presently features many sites devoted wholly to commercial sales of
firearms; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the closure of loopholes in federal firearms laws and pending legislation as follows:

2290

September 13, 2000
All persons between the ages of
18 and 21 should be prohibited from
purchasing or possessing an assault
rifle
or
handgun,
including
an
assault pistol.
All purchasers of firearms at private sales during organized gun
shows, and individuals who redeem
a weapon from a pawnshop, should
be subject to the same background
investigation to which individuals
who purchase firearms from federal
firearms licensees are subject.
The appropriate federal agency
should be vested with the authority
to regulate and otherwise oversee
the design, safety and responsible
marketing of firearms.
States
and
local
governments
should adopt stricter standards and
rules regarding purchase and possession of firearms.
To the extent it is Constitutional,
Internet-facilitated firearms sales
should be subject to the same regulation and oversight as all other
firearms sales.
All manufacturers should be required to include a trigger lock with
each firearm produced.
Minors should be prohibited from
purchasing a shotgun, or possessing
a shotgun if not under the supervision of a person over age 21.
Large capacity clips (i.e., more
than 10 rounds) should be prohibited.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Res. No. 1542-2000.
By Councilmen Rybka and Polensek.
An
emergency
resolution
condemning the practice of property
“flipping” and urging the Attorney
General of the State of Ohio and the
Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development
to
investigate
this
practice as it is occurring in the
City of Cleveland.
Whereas, there has been a resurgence in the purchase and rapid
resale of residential property at
huge mark-ups, a practice known as
property “flipping”; and
Whereas, property “flipping” usually consists of buying often condemned property, spending marginal amounts on improvements and
then selling the property at 2 to 4
times what was paid for it, even
though the property is still condemned; and
Whereas, property “flipping” has
squeezed tens of millions of dollars
of potential value out of Cleveland’s
old and often deteriorating housing
stock, allowing the middle-man to
reap huge profits, while little or no
improvements are being made to the
properties; and

76
Whereas, it is reported that from
1997 through April, 2000, nearly 1,000
quick-profit turn-around sales have
occurred in Cleveland, 80% in the
East Side neighborhoods, taking
over $31 million in potential value
out of the City housing stock; and
Whereas, the property “flipping”
phenomenon is characterized by
questionable
pre-sale
appraisals,
sometimes falsified property transfer records and “straw-man” borrowers; and
Whereas, although the practice of
property “flipping” may not in and
of itself be illegal, knowingly falsifying
property
transfer
records,
which is reported to occur in such
property “flipping” deals, is a third
degree felony; and
Whereas, this cycle of disinvestment only means that landlords will
be overextended, properties will not
be maintained and property values
will suffer; and
Whereas, this Council is disturbed
by the effects property “flipping” has
on its constituents, its neighborhoods and the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council condemns the practice of property “flipping” and urges both the Attorney
General of the State of Ohio and the
Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development
to
investigate
this
practice as it is occurring in the
City of Cleveland to determine any
wrongdoing.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
the Attorney General of the State of
Ohio and the Secretary of Housing
and Urban Development.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
