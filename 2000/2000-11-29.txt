An emergency ordinance authorizing the purchase by contract of
transformers, switchgear and circuitry for the Redundant Electrical
Source, for the Division of Cleveland
Hopkins
International
Airport,
Department of Port Control.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Port Control is hereby authorized to
make a written contract in accordance with the Charter and the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio,
1976, for each or all of the following items: transformers, switchgear,
and other equipment necessary for
the Redundant Electrical Source, to
be purchased by the Commissioner
of Purchases and Supplies for a
gross price, for the Division of
Cleveland
Hopkins
International

Section 2. That the cost of any

Fund Nos. 60 SF 001, 60 SF 104, 60
SF 105, 60 SF 106, and the fund

purpose of the Project authorized

hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of

it shall take effect and be in force

The City Record
Ord. No. 1965-2000.
By Councilman Cimperman.
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Public Service to
issue a permit to Network Parking
Company, LTD to encroach into a
four (4) foot area of the public

for landscaping and a parking lot.
RESOLUTION
Res. No. 1690-2000.
By Councilmen Dolan, O’Malley,
Rybka, Melena, Polensek, Patmon
and Lewis.
An emergency resolution strongly
opposing proposed mergers of major
air carriers including the proposed
merger of US Airways and United
Airlines and urging the U.S. Senate
to disapprove said proposed merger
as not being in the public interest.
Whereas, airport authorities, consumer groups, economists, and many
members of Congress have raised
many problems with the proposed
merger of United Airlines and US
Airways; and
Whereas, most observers agree
that the United Airlines/US Airways
merger would be the beginning of a
final industry consolidation that
could result in only three major carriers
(eg.
American/Northwest;
Delta/Continental/TWA; and United/US Airways) serving 80-90% of
domestic air travelers; and
Whereas, approval of proposed
mergers such as that of United Airlines and US Airways would substantially
reduce
competition
at
most airports, potentially increase
air fares for local travelers and
adversely affect existing relationships between airlines and airports;
and
Whereas, approval of proposed
mergers such as that of United Airlines and US Airways would cause
all airports to have a more difficult
time attracting low fare competitors;
and
Whereas,
such
mergers
could
enable the three remaining air carriers, without violating antitrust
laws, to divide the U.S. market into
three locational monopolies where
they would have absolute control of
pricing and schedules; and
Whereas, on July 25, 2000, Senate
Commerce
Committee
Chairman
McCain and Aviation Subcommittee
Chairman Gorton introduced Resolution 344 stating that the United Airlines/US Airways merger is not in
the public interest and should be
disapproved; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
strongly opposes proposed mergers
of major air carriers, including the
proposed merger of United Airlines
and US Airways and urges the U.S.
Senate to follow Resolution 344 calling for the disapproval of the United
Airlines/US Airways merger as not
being in the public interest.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
Senate Commerce Committee Chairman McCain and Aviation Subcom-

2937

13
mittee Chairman Gorton; to U.S. Senators Mike DeWine and George
Voinovich; to U.S. Representatives
Dennis Kucinich, Stephanie TubbsJones,
Sherrod
Brown,
Steven
LaTourette and Ralph Regula to
Airports Council International —
North America, and to Association of
American Airport Executives.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
