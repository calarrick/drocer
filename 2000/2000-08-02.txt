FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES REFERRED
Ord. No. 1304-2000.
By Councilmen Brady, Polensek,
Patmon and Dolan.
An emergency ordinance to amend
Section 181.19 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as
enacted by Ordinance No. 848-83,
passed June 13, 1983, relating to
excess personal property.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 181.19 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as by enacting Ordinance No. 848-83, passed June 13,
1983 is hereby amended to read as
follows:
Section 189.19 Excess Personal
Property; Use by Other Departments;
Sale
(a) Except as provided in Section
181.15., all personal property of the
City not needed by the department
or office in whose charge such property is, shall be turned over to the
Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies. If any such property is suitable to be used by any other department or office of the City, the Commissioner shall, when so directed,
sell such property at its current
value to such other department or
office, or shall place it in the City
storerooms or warehouses until such
time as it may be needed by some
department or office of the City. If

1958

August 2, 2000
such property is not needed or is not
suitable for the use of any department or office of the City, when so
directed by the Board of Control it
shall be sold by the Commissioner
and the proceeds of such sale shall
be turned in to the fund of the City
from which such property was paid
for. Such sale shall be posted and
advertised in every case in like
manner as are purchases in amounts
equal to the anticipated receipts
from such sales. However, in the
event the Board so directs, the Commissioner may sell such property at
public auction, to be held at a place
to be designated by the Commissioner, and named in the advertisement of sale to be posted and advertised for two consecutive weeks
prior to the date of such sale.
(b) When the Director of Public
Safety makes a determination in
accordance with Section 101 of the
Charter with respect to the service
weapon of a police officer with more
than twenty-one (21) years of service in the Division of Police or
with respect to the helmet of a fire
fighter with more than twenty-one
years (21) of service in the Division
of Fire, such weapon or helmet shall
be turned over to the Commissioner
of Purchases and Supplies. Notwithstanding the provisions of Division
(a) hereof, the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies shall, when so
directed by the Board of Control,
offer to sell such service weapon or
helmet to such police officer or fire
fighter for its fair market value. In
lieu of paying cash for the weapon
or helmet, such police officer or fire
fighter may elect to forego all or
any portion of any uniform or uniform
maintenance
allowance
to
which he is entitled at the time of
the purchase; provided, however,
that the sum of any cash payment
and the allowances devoted to the
purchase shall equal the fair market value of the item. In addition,
the Director of Public Safety shall
provide at no charge a badge to
each police officer and fire fighter
retiring with more than twenty-one
(21) years of service.
Section 2. That existing Section
181.19 of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as by enacting Ordinance No. 848-83, passed
June 13, 1983 is hereby repealed.
Section 3. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 1320-2000.
By Councilmen Brady, Polensek,
Gordon, Jones and Cintron.
An emergency resolution supporting the Cleveland AFL-CIO’s call for
a
publically
financed
non-profit
national health care insurance plan.
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland believes that all citizens, those with and without financial means, should have access to
affordable, quality health care as
evidenced by its participation in the
fight to save St. Michael Hospital;
and
Whereas, by numerous resolutions
concerning health care, this Council
has
advocated
and
encouraged
health care providers, insurance
companies and employers to be cognizant of the need to provide health
care for all members of our community; and
Whereas, it is estimated that 45
million Americans have no health
care insurance and 58% of the uninsured work full time; and
Whereas, the infant mortality rate
in the U.S. is higher and the life
expectancy rate is lower than every
other advanced nation; and
Whereas, the Cleveland AFL-CIO
Federation of Labor unanimously
adopted a resolution supporting a
non-profit
national
health
care
insurance plan which is publically
financed and guarantees comprehensive and lifetime coverage for
all; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland strongly supports
the position of the Cleveland AFLCIO Federation of Labor in calling
for a non-profit national health care
insurance plan which is publically
financed and guarantees comprehensive and lifetime coverage for
all.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby requested to transmit a copy of
this resolution to President Clinton,
Vice-President Gore, and John Ryan,
Executive Secretary of the Cleveland AFL-CIO Federation of Labor.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
