Whereas, the Ohio Works First

Whereas, the Ohio Works First
Program, as currently enacted, fails
to preserve food stamps benefits to
members of families otherwise ineligible to participate in the Program;
and
Whereas, the Ohio Works First
Program, as currently enacted fails
to
take
into
consideration
the
adverse effects an economic recession has upon Ohio’s low income

Whereas, it is estimated that in
the next six months, more than 7000
families in Cuyahoga County are, or
will, added to those already be
adversely affected by the Ohio
Works First Program, as currently
enacted; and
Whereas, this Council of the
City of Cleveland is deeply concerned about the negative impact
that certain provisions of the Ohio
Works First Program has on the

changes in the Ohio Works First
Program; now, therefore,

now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

hereby requested to transmit a
copy of this resolution to Speaker
of the Ohio House of Representatives and the President of the

Inc., DBA T & N Market, 831 East
140th Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44110;
and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best
interests of the entire community;
and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292; and

The City Record
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section

must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of
