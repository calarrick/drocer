An emergency resolution supporting early identification, diagnosis
and treatment of mental health and
substance
abuse
for
juveniles
charged with offenses.
Whereas, this Council believes
that the problem associated with
mentally ill juvenile offenders is of
national concern; and
Whereas, it has been established
that the vast majority of juveniles
entering the criminal justice system
suffer from both substance abuse
and mental illness; and
Whereas, it is estimated that ten
percent of the juveniles in correctional facilities are diagnosed with
a major mental illness or have
severe or chronic mental health
problems that require psychiatric
treatment; and
Whereas, it has been determined
that many mentally ill offenders can
be successfully treated if they receive early and appropriate intensive mental health treatment in
structured placement; and
Whereas,
the
current
juvenile
criminal justice system, both locally
and nationally, is not structured to
provide appropriate levels of treatment and care for mentally ill

By Councilman Coats.
An emergency resolution supporting passage of federal legislation
devoted to preventing hate crimes
and urging the federal government
to establish a grant program to
assist state and local investigations
and prosecutions of hate crimes.
Whereas, efforts must be taken at
all levels of government to respond
to the staggering brutality of hate
crimes that have shocked the nation;
and
Whereas, the incidence of violence
motivated by the actual or perceived
race, color, national origin, religion,
sexual orientation, gender or disability of the victim poses a serious
national problem; and
Whereas, many states have no
laws addressing violence based on
the actual or perceived race, color,
national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender or disability of the
victim, while other states have laws
that provide only limited protection;
and
Whereas, all people deserve to be
safe within their communities, free
to live, work and worship without
fear of violence and bigotry; and
Whereas, individuals who commit
crimes based on hate and bigotry
must be held responsible for their
actions and must be stopped from
spreading violence; and
Whereas, although local authorities will continue to be responsible
for prosecuting the overwhelming
majority of violent crimes, including
crimes motivated by hate, federal
jurisdiction
over
certain
violent
crimes motivated by hate are necessary to supplement state and local
efforts to ensure that justice is
achieved in each case; and
Whereas, any efforts undertaken
by the federal government to combat hate crimes must respect the primacy that states and local officials
have traditionally been accorded in
the criminal prosecution of acts constituting hate crimes; and
Whereas, expanding federal jurisdiction over certain violent crimes
motivated by hate enables federal,
state and local authorities to work
together as partners in the investigation and prosecution of such hate
crimes; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports passage of federal hate crime
legislation so long as it does not
supercede the right of state and
local communities to legislate and
prosecute in the area of hate crimes.
Further, this Council urges the federal government to establish a grant
program to assist state and local

investigations and prosecutions of
hate crimes.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and is hereby directed to
transmit certified copies of this resolution to Janet Reno, United States
Attorney General, to Senators Mike
DeWine and George Voinovich, and
to Representatives Dennis Kucinich,
and Stephanie Tubbs-Jones.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force

An emergency resolution supporting the closure of loopholes in federal firearms laws and pending legislation.
Whereas, federal law presently
permits any individual, regardless of
age, to purchase any rifle, shotgun
or other long gun, including assault
weapons, in a private sale; and
Whereas, federal law also presently permits individuals over age 18
and under age 21 to purchase a
handgun, including an assault pistol, in a private transaction; and
Whereas, many firearms are now
sold privately at or in association
with organized gun shows; and
Whereas,
no
federal
agency
presently has jurisdiction to regulate or otherwise oversee the design,
safety and responsible marketing of
firearms; and
Whereas, the United States Senate
has approved a measure exempting
pawn shops from conducting background checks upon individuals redeeming firearms previously pawned;
and
Whereas, the Internet has the
potential to function as a wholly
unregulated “virtual gun show” and
presently features many sites devoted wholly to commercial sales of
firearms; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the closure of loopholes in federal firearms laws and pending legislation as follows:
All persons between the ages of
18 and 21 should be prohibited from
purchasing or possessing an assault
rifle
or
handgun,
including
an
assault pistol.
All purchasers of firearms at private sales during organized gun
shows, and individuals who redeem
a weapon from a pawnshop, should
be subject to the same background
investigation to which individuals
who purchase firearms from federal
firearms licensees are subject.
The appropriate federal agency
should be vested with the authority
to regulate and otherwise oversee
the design, safety and responsible
marketing of firearms.

16
States
and
local
governments
should adopt stricter standards and
rules regarding purchase and possession of firearms.
To the extent it is Constitutional,
Internet-facilitated firearms sales
should be subject to the same regulation and oversight as all other
firearms sales.
All manufacturers should be required to include a trigger lock with
each firearm produced.
Minors should be prohibited from
purchasing a shotgun, or possessing
a shotgun if not under the supervision of a person over age 21.
Large capacity clips (i.e., more
than 10 rounds) should be prohibited.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

By Councilmen Rybka and Polensek.
An
emergency
resolution
condemning the practice of property
“flipping” and urging the Attorney
General of the State of Ohio and the
Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development
to
investigate
this
practice as it is occurring in the
City of Cleveland.
Whereas, there has been a resurgence in the purchase and rapid
resale of residential property at
huge mark-ups, a practice known as
property “flipping”; and
Whereas, property “flipping” usually consists of buying often condemned property, spending marginal amounts on improvements and
then selling the property at 2 to 4
times what was paid for it, even
though the property is still condemned; and
Whereas, property “flipping” has
squeezed tens of millions of dollars
of potential value out of Cleveland’s
old and often deteriorating housing
stock, allowing the middle-man to
reap huge profits, while little or no
improvements are being made to the
properties; and
Whereas, it is reported that from
1997 through April, 2000, nearly 1,000
quick-profit turn-around sales have
occurred in Cleveland, 80% in the
East Side neighborhoods, taking
over $31 million in potential value
out of the City housing stock; and
Whereas, the property “flipping”
phenomenon is characterized by
questionable
pre-sale
appraisals,
sometimes falsified property transfer records and “straw-man” borrowers; and
Whereas, although the practice of
property “flipping” may not in and
of itself be illegal, knowingly falsifying
property
transfer
records,
which is reported to occur in such
property “flipping” deals, is a third
degree felony; and
Whereas, this cycle of disinvestment only means that landlords will
be overextended, properties will not
be maintained and property values
will suffer; and
Whereas, this Council is disturbed
by the effects property “flipping” has
on its constituents, its neighborhoods and the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council condemns the practice of property “flipping” and urges both the Attorney
General of the State of Ohio and the
Secretary of Housing and Urban

The City Record
Development
to
investigate
this
practice as it is occurring in the
City of Cleveland to determine any
wrongdoing.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
the Attorney General of the State of
Ohio and the Secretary of Housing
and Urban Development.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
