FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES REFERRED
Ord. No. 897-2000.
By Councilman Patmon (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance providing for the issuance and sale of
Bonds in the maximum principal
amount of $8,820,000 for the purpose
of providing funds for improving
buildings and structures housing
and providing for the discharge of
governmental functions and services
otherwise benefiting the public safety, health and welfare and to pay
capitalized interest and all expenses incurred in connection with the
issuance of the Bonds; to authorize
agreements with respect to the
Bonds; and to authorize the issuance
of notes in anticipation of such
Bonds.
Whereas, this Council desires to
issue bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed Eight Million Eight Hundred Twenty Thousand
Dollars
($8,820,000)
(the
“Bonds”) to finance the cost of certain
permanent
improvements
described in Section 1; and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of the City, has certified to this Council that the estimated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be financed with
the proceeds of the Bonds is at least
five (5) years and the maximum
maturity of the Bonds is twenty (20)
years; and
Whereas, this Council passed Ordinance No. 1749-80 on October 8, 1980,
and thereafter amended that ordinance by Ordinance No. 1112-83,
passed on May 6, 1983, and Ordinance No. 944-96, passed on June 10,
1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so
amended and as the same may further be amended from time to time
in accordance with its provisions, is
referred to as the “General Bond
Ordinance”), providing the general
terms
and
provisions
for
the
issuance thereunder of unvoted general obligations of the City and the
General Bond Ordinance was passed
in contemplation of this Ordinance
and other ordinances authorizing
the issuance of bonds in accordance
with the provisions thereof (the
“Series Bond Ordinances”); and
Whereas, the issuance of the
Bonds is necessary to provide funds

to pay the costs of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1, which are urgently needed
for the benefit of the City, and as a
result, this Ordinance constitutes an
emergency measure providing for
the immediate preservation of the
public peace, property, health and
safety, and for the usual daily operation of a municipal department;
now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary to issue the Bonds in an
aggregate principal amount not to
exceed Eight Million Eight Hundred
Twenty Thousand Dollars ($8,820,000)
for the purpose of providing funds
for constructing, reconstructing, rehabilitating, installing, renovating,
enlarging and otherwise improving
buildings and structures housing
and providing for the discharge of
governmental functions and services otherwise benefiting the public
safety,
health
and
welfare,
including facilities in, of and for
the City Hall, police stations, fire
stations, service stations, centers
and other public facilities, and the
provision of necessary fixtures, furnishings, equipment, appurtenances,
utilities, and site improvements for
the purpose, and for the purpose of
paying capitalized interest and all
expenses incurred in
connection
with the issuance of the Bonds, including any financing costs within
the meaning of Revised Code Section 133.01(K), and such other costs
of the foregoing permanent improvements that may be financed
with the proceeds of securities as
permitted by Revised Code Section
133.15(B) and as otherwise permitted by law; and to authorized the
issuance of notes in anticipation of
such Bonds.
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Sections
133.01 to 133.70, inclusive, and other
applicable provisions of the Revised
Code, the Charter of the City, the
General Bond Ordinance and this
Ordinance in the principal amount
and for the purpose stated in Section 1. The Bonds shall be designated “Public Facilities Improvement Bonds, Series 2000”. The Bonds
shall be issued in one lot as fully
registered Bonds in denominations
of $5,000 or any integral multiple
thereof. The Bonds shall be numbered as determined by the Director
of Finance.
The Bonds shall be dated as of
August 1, 2000, or such other date,
but in no event later than December
31, 2000, specified in the certificate
of award providing for the final
terms of the Bonds and the sale of
the bonds and signed by the Director of Finance in accordance with
this Ordinance (the “Certificate of
Award”). The Bonds shall bear
interest at the rate or rates per year
specified
in
the
Certificate
of
Award; provided that if all the
Bonds bear interest at the same rate
per year, then such rate shall not
exceed eight percent (8%) per year,
and if the Bonds bear interest at
more than one rate per year, then
the weighted average of such rates
(taking into account the principal
amount and maturity of each Bond
to which a rate applies) shall not
exceed eight percent (8%) per year.
Interest on the Bonds shall be
payable, until the principal amount

1060

May 24, 2000
is paid, semi-annually on May 15
and November 15 of each year or on
the days specified in the Certificate
of Award as the dates on which
interest on the Bonds shall be
payable
(the
“Interest
Payment
Dates”), beginning November 15,
2000 or on such other Interest Payment Date specified in the Certificate of Award as the first Interest
Payment Date.
The
Bonds
shall
mature
on
November 15 in twenty (20) substantially equal annual installments,
beginning November 15, 2001, or
according to the schedule set forth
in the Certificate of Award, provided that (i) each principal payment
shall occur on an Interest Payment
Date, (ii) the first principal payment on the Bonds shall be no earlier than November 15, 2000 and no
later than August 1, 2002, (iii) the
final maturity date of the Bonds
shall be no later than twenty (20)
years from that date which is
twelve months prior to the first date
on which provision for payment of
principal is made, and (iv) the principal
amount
thereof
shall
be
payable in annual installments such
that the total principal and interest
payments on the Bonds in any fiscal year in which principal is
payable is not more than three times
the amount of those payments in
any other fiscal year.
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the
“Mandatory
Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption prior to stated maturity
as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys, to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent,
currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of
and interest on any Term Bonds
shall include amounts sufficient to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory

May 24, 2000
redemption obligation) of the City
for any Term Bonds. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate is
not timely furnished to the Escrow
Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding
mandatory
redemption
obligation) shall not be reduced. A
credit against
the
then
current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding
mandatory redemption obligation)
also shall be received by the City for
any Term Bonds which prior thereto
have been redeemed (other than
through the operation of the Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and canceled by the Registrar, to
the extent not applied
theretofore as a credit against any
mandatory redemption obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of
the principal amount thereof against
the then current Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement (and
corresponding mandatory redemption obligation). Any excess of that
amount
over
the
then
current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement shall be credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligations) in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(b)
Optional
Redemption.
The
Bonds may be subject to redemption
prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole on any
date, or in part on any Interest Payment Date, on the dates and for the
prices specified in the Certificate of
Award, or the Director of Finance
may determine that it is in the best
interests of the City for the Bonds
not to be callable prior to their stated maturity. In the event that the
Bonds are callable, the earliest date
for optional redemption shall be no
later than the tenth anniversary of
the first principal payment date and
the maximum redemption price shall
be no greater than 102% of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued
interest to the redemption date.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar, given upon the direction
of the Council of the City by passage of an ordinance. That notice
shall specify the redemption date
and the principal amount of each
maturity of Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar. In

The City Record
the event that notice of redemption
shall have been given by the Registrar to the registered owners as
hereinafter provided, there shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, funds
which, in addition to any other moneys available therefor and held by
the Registrar, will be sufficient to
redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus interest accrued to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice
of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Bonds by lot when Bonds of
denominations greater than $5,000
are then outstanding, each $5,000
unit of principal thereof shall be
treated as though it were a separate
Bond of the denomination of $5,000.
If it is determined that one or more,
but not all of the $5,000 units of
principal amount represented by a
Bond are to be called for redemption. then upon notice of redemption
of a $5,000 unit or units, the registered owner of that Bond shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i)
for payment of the redemption price
of the $5,000 unit or units called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption and any
premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity
of
the
proceedings
for
the
redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph hereof, the Bonds and

1061

5
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due, and payable
on the redemption date, and, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the
redemption
price,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date. If
money for the redemption of all of
the Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with interest
accrued thereon to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, so as to be available therefor on that date and, if
notice
of
redemption
has
been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date
those
Bonds
and
portions
thereof called for redemption shall
cease to bear interest and no longer
shall be considered to be outstanding. If that money shall not be so
available on the redemption date, or
that notice shall not have been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
those Bonds and portions thereof
shall continue to bear interest, until
they are paid, at the same rate as
they would have borne had they not
been called for redemption. All
money held by the Registrar for the
redemption of particular Bonds shall
be held in trust for the account of
the registered owners thereof and
shall be paid to them, respectively,
upon presentation and surrender of
those Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying agent. Principal shall be payable
when due upon presentation and surrender of the Bonds at the principal
corporate trust office of the Registrar. Interest on a Bond shall be paid
on each Interest Payment Date by
check or draft mailed to the person
in whose name the Bond was registered, and to that person’s address
appearing, on the Bond Register (as
defined in Section 3) at the close of
business on the date provided in the
Agreement authorized in Section 3
(the “Record Date”). Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the
General Bond Ordinance, so long as
the Bonds are held by a Depository
in a book entry system (as described
in Section 3), debt charges on the
Bonds will be payable in lawful
money of the United States by wire
transfer to the Depository made by
the Escrow Agent on each Interest
Payment Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance is hereby adopted by reference, and, except for the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 of the General Bond Ordinance
(pertaining generally to the periods
during
which
the
City is
not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under
the General Bond Ordinance), which
are not included in this Ordinance
and will not apply to the Bonds, the
General Bond Ordinance is included
as a part of this Ordinance as fully
as if restated herein. Words and
terms not otherwise defined herein
shall have the same meaning as set
forth in the General Bond Ordinance.

6
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their faces
the purpose for which they are
issued and that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to
Section 4 of the General Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be authenticated by the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee.
The Bonds shall be signed by the
City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor and
by the City’s Director of Finance or
Acting Director of Finance; provided, however, that in accordance with
Section 9.96 of the Code and the foregoing requirement that each Bond
bear the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee,
either or both of the signatures of
the City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor or
of its Director of Finance or Acting
Director of Finance may be a facsimile. The Bonds shall bear the
seal of the City, which seal may be
a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section
83 of the City’s Charter, the Director of Law or Acting Director of
Law shall prepare the Bonds and
shall endorse thereon his or her
approval of the form and correctness
thereof by his or her manual or facsimile signature.
Firstar Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent,
bond registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Bonds (the
“Registrar”);
provided
that
the
Escrow Agent shall also act as paying agent for the Bonds so long as
the Bonds are held in a book entry
system. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, the Registrar Agreement among the City,
the Registrar and the Escrow Agent
(the “Agreement”) in substantially
the form as is now on file with the
Clerk of Council in File No. 897-2000-A.
The Agreement is approved, together with any changes or amendments that are not inconsistent
with this ordinance and not substantially adverse to the City and
that are approved by the Director
of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Agreement or amendments to the
Agreement. The Director of Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and
for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Agreement
from the proceeds of the Bonds to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided
in this Section (the “Bond Register’). Subject to the provisions of
Section 5, the person in whose name
a Bond is registered on the Bond
Register shall be regarded as the
absolute owner of that Bond for all
purposes of this ordinance. Payment
of or on account of the debt charges
on any Bond shall be made only to
or upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and dis-

The City Record
charge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Bond at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner
or
by
a
person
legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of
this ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Bonds
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Bonds surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of

1062

May 24, 2000
Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized: (i) the
Bonds may be issued in the form of
a single, fully registered Bond representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the beneficial
owners in book entry form shall
have no right to receive Bonds in
the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for
transfer to another Depository or to
another nominee of a Depository,
without further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Bonds from the Depository,
and the Trustee and Registrar shall
authenticate and deliver bond certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking
Fund and, if not purchased by such
Trustees, shall be offered to the
Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased by
such Account, shall be sold to NatCity Investments, Inc., SBK Investment Corp. and Lehman Brothers
(collectively, the “Original Purchaser”); provided, however, that if, in
the reasonable opinion of the Director of Finance, an underwriter is
incapable of fully performing its
duties or meeting its obligations in
its capacity as Original Purchaser
with respect to the Bonds, the Direc-

May 24, 2000
tor of Finance is hereby authorized
and directed, in the name of and on
behalf of the City, to take whatever actions may be necessary to terminate that underwriter’s standing
as Original Purchaser.
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Bonds as set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement, including: the
principal amount of the Bonds, final
purchase price (which shall be not
less than 97% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate
or rates, the amounts and years in
which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements),
the
Interest Payment Dates and the
date of the Bonds (if different from
those set forth in Section 2) and any
other matters required in this Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. If it is determined advisable by the Director of Finance for
the sale of the Bonds, the Director
of Finance is authorized to sign
agreements with a municipal bond
insurer issuing a policy of municipal bond insurance for the Bonds
that are not materially inconsistent
with this Ordinance. The Mayor,
Director of Finance, Director of
Law and other appropriate officers
of the City are, and each of them
is, authorized and directed to take
such actions
as
are
necessary,
appropriate and in the best interest
of the City to establish the terms
and requirements for delivery of the
Bonds and to make such arrangements as are necessary with the
Original
Purchaser
in
order
to
establish the date, location, and procedure, and conditions for the delivery of the Bonds to the Original
Purchaser, to give all appropriate
notices and certificates, to cause a
true transcript of proceedings with
reference to the issuance of the
Bonds to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Mayor and the Director
of Finance are, and each of them is,
hereby
further
authorized
and
directed to execute and deliver on
behalf of the City a bond purchase
agreement
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, between the City and the Original Purchaser setting forth the
terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell and the Original
Purchaser agrees to buy the Bonds,
provided that such agreement shall
not provide for or require the terms
of the Bonds to be inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Bond Purchase
Agreement is approved substantially in the form now on file with the
Clerk of Council in the File referenced in Section 3, together with
any changes or amendments that
are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and not substantially adverse

The City Record
to the City and that are approved
by the Director of Finance on
behalf of the City, all of which shall
be conclusively evidenced by the
signing
of
the
Bond
Purchase
Agreement or amendments to the
Bond Purchase Agreement. It is
hereby determined that the terms of
the Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance and as may be provided in or
pursuant
to
the
Certificate
of
Award, are in the best interest of
the City and in compliance with all
legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an
Official Statement is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
original issuance of the Bonds, those
officers in their official capacities
are authorized to prepare or cause
to be prepared on behalf of the City
an Official Statement and any necessary supplements thereto, and on
behalf of the City to use and distribute, or authorize the use and distribution of, that Official Statement
and any supplements thereto in connection with the original issuance of
the Bonds, and each of those officers is authorized to sign on behalf
of the City and in his or her official
capacity, that Official Statement and
any supplements thereto approved
by such officer. Those officers are
and each of them is authorized to
sign and deliver, on behalf of the
City and in their official capacities,
such certificates in connection with
the accuracy of the Official Statement and any supplements thereto
as may, in their judgment, be necessary or appropriate. Such officers
are also hereby authorized to determine and certify on behalf of the
City that such disclosure document
is “deemed final” by the City within the meaning of Securities and
Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12
(the “SEC Rule”).
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under, the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
and directed to prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Bonds in accordance
with the SEC Rule. The performance
of that Agreement shall be subject
to the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that

1063

7
agreement or providing notice of the
occurrence of any other events, the
Director of Finance shall consult
with, as appropriate, the legal counsel and bond or other qualified independent special counsel to the City.
The Director of Finance, acting in
the name and on behalf of the City,
shall be entitled to rely upon any
legal advice provided by any such
counsel in determining whether a
filing should be made.
Pursuant
to
Section
133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds
with other bonds into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of their sale as a single issue to
be designated “Various Purpose General Obligation Bonds, Series 2000”.
Such bonds shall contain a summary statement of purposes encompassing the purpose for which the
Bonds are issued and shall state
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds
promptly when and as the same
falls due, and also to provide for the
discharge of the Bonds at maturity,
there shall be and is hereby levied
on all the taxable property in the
City, in addition to all other taxes,
a direct tax annually during the
period the Bonds are outstanding, in
an amount sufficient to provide for
the payment of that interest, when
and as the same shall fall due, and
also to discharge the principal of
the Bonds at maturity, which tax
shall not be less than the interest
and sinking fund tax required by
Section 11 of Article XII of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of those years are certified, extended and collected. The
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from the tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund as provided pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on
the Bonds when and as the same
fall due; provided, however, that,
subject to the provisions of Section
8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in
each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the
Bonds and are appropriated for such
purpose, the amount of such tax
shall be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25 and 5705.51 of the
Revised Code, and in accordance
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the
General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is nec-

essary to meet the annual
charges for the Bonds.

debt

Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended
and
applied
for
the
objects and purposes for which the
Bonds are issued. Accrued interest
and any premium received from the
sale of the Bonds shall be deposited in the Unvoted Tax Supported
Obligations Account of the Sinking
Fund to be applied to the payment
of the principal of and interest on
the Bonds.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Bonds are secured by a pledge and
lien on a parity with the pledges
and liens authorized by the General Bond Ordinance and, in addition
to the taxes and revenues specifically pledged pursuant to this Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance and the other covenants,
terms
and
agreements
provided
hereunder and in the General Bond
Ordinance to secure payment of the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds, the City hereby determines,
declares, warrants and covenants
that the Bonds are general obligations of the City and that the full
faith and credit of the City are hereby pledged for the payment of the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds in accordance with the laws
and Constitution of the State of
Ohio, this Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid
and discharged all the outstanding
Bonds, or there shall otherwise be
paid to the holders of the outstanding Bonds all debt charges due or
to become due thereon, and provision shall also be made for paying
all other sums payable hereunder,
then and in that event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of further
effect, and the covenants, agreements and other obligations of the
City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the
request of the City execute and
deliver to the City such instruments
in writing as shall discharge the
lien hereof and enter on the record
such discharge of the lien and such
other instruments as may be reasonably required by the City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or sub-accounts, in trust for and
irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold
in special accounts or sub-accounts,
in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations
of the United States certified by, an
independent public accounting firm
of national reputation or such other
qualified organization, to be of such
maturities and interest payment
dates and to bear such interest,
without further investment or reinvestment of either the principal

amount thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held
in trust and committed, except as
hereinafter provided), as will be sufficient,
together
with
moneys
referred to in (i) above, for the payment, at their maturities or redemption dates, of all debt charges on the
Bonds to their date of maturity or
redemption, as the case may be, or
if default in such payment shall
have occurred on such date then to
the date of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds
are to be redeemed prior to the
maturity thereof, notice of such
redemption shall have been duly
given or irrevocable provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall have
been duly made for the giving of
such notice. Any moneys held by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with
the provisions of this Section shall
be invested by the Escrow Agent in
direct obligations of the United
States of America maturing, or
redeemable at the option of the holder, at times and in amounts sufficient to meet payment of debt
charges on the Bonds, as directed by
the Director of Finance. Any income
or interest earned by, or increment
to, the investments held under this
Section shall, to the extent determined from time to time by the
Escrow Agent to be in excess of the
amount required to be held by it for
the purposes of this Section, be
transferred at the time of such
determination as provided in Section
17(a) of the General Bond Ordinance
for unclaimed funds held by a Paying Agent. In the event of nonpresentment of any Bond as described
in Section 17(a) of the General Bond
Ordinance, the moneys held pursuant to this Section shall be held
and paid as provided in said Section
17(a) for unclaimed funds held by a
Paying Agent.
Section 9. Bond Anticipation Notes.
For the purpose of raising money in
anticipation of the issuance of the
Bonds for the purposes set forth in
Section 1 hereof, notes of the City
may be issued in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed Eight
Million
Eight
Hundred
Twenty
Thousand Dollars ($8,820,000) (the
“Notes”) upon the direction of the
Director of Finance to be set forth
in a certificate providing for the
final terms of the Notes and the sale
of the Notes and signed by the
Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate of Award”).
Section 10. Term of the Notes. The

in order to enhance the marketability of the Notes, the Director of
Finance may cause the Notes to not
be redeemable for a period which
ends no later than the date which is

1064

two (2) years following the date of
issuance of the Notes; shall be designated “Public Facilities Improvement

be requested by the Note Purchaser
(hereinafter defined); and shall be

system) in denominations of $5,000
or integral multiples thereof. In connection with the issuance of the
Notes and the Bonds, Carmona Motley Hoffmann, Inc. shall serve as
the financial advisor of the City.
Interest shall be payable semi-annually on the dates set forth in the
Note Certificate of Award; provided
that if the Notes mature on or before
the end of the twelfth (12th) month
following their date of issuance,
interest on the Notes shall be
payable at maturity.
Firstar Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent, registrar, transfer agent and paying
agent for the Notes (the “Note Registrar”); provided that the Escrow
Agent also shall act as paying
agent for the Notes so long as the
Notes are held in a book entry system. The Director of Finance shall
sign and deliver, in the name and
on behalf of the City, an agreement
among the City, the Note Registrar
and the Escrow Agent (the “Note
Registrar Agreement”) providing for
services relating to the registration,
transfer, exchange and payment of
Notes. The Director of Finance shall
provide for the payment of the services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant
to the Note Registrar Agreement
from the proceeds of the Notes to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose.
So long as any of the Notes
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Note Registrar to maintain and keep at its principal corporate trust office all books and
records necessary for the registration, exchange and transfer of Notes
as provided in this Section (the
“Note Register”). Subject to the provisions of Section 5, the person in
whose name a Note is registered on
the Note Register shall be regarded
as the absolute owner of that Note
for all purposes of this ordinance.
Payment of or on account of the
debt charges on any Note shall be
made only to or upon the order of
that person; neither the City nor the
Note Registrar shall be affected by
any notice to the contrary, but the
registration may be changed as provided in this Section. All such payments shall be valid and effectual
to satisfy and discharge the City’s
liability upon the Note, including
interest, to the extent of the amount
or amounts so paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for
Notes of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Note Registrar, together with a request for exchange
signed by the registered owner or
by a person legally empowered to
do so in a form satisfactory to the
Note Registrar. A Note may be
transferred only on the Note Register upon presentation and surrender of the Note at the principal corporate trust officer of the Note Reg-

May 24, 2000
istrar together with an assignment
signed by the registered owner or
by a person legally empowered to
do so in a form satisfactory to the
Note Registrar. Upon exchange or
transfer the Note Registrar shall
complete, authenticate and deliver
a new Note or Notes of any authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner equal
in the aggregate to the unmatured
principal amount of the Note surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Note Registrar shall undertake the exchange
or transfer of Notes only after the
new Notes are signed by the authorized officers of the City. In all
cases of Notes exchanged or transferred, the City shall sign and the
Note Registrar shall authenticate
and deliver Notes in accordance
with the provisions of this Ordinance. The exchange or transfer
shall be without charge to the
owner, except that the City and Note
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Note Registrar may require
that those charges, if any, be paid
before the procedure is begun for
the exchange or transfer. All Notes
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security ,and benefit under
this ordinance, as the Notes surrendered upon that exchange or transfer.

for such purpose.
Section 14. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. During the year
or years while the Notes are outstanding there shall be levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes but within tax limitations, a direct tax annually not less than that which would

issued therefor without the prior
issue of the Notes.
Said tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same

however, that in each year to the
extent that revenues are available
from other sources for the payment
of the Notes and Bonds and are

of the taxable property in the City
may be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.

Whereas, this Council desires to
issue bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed Five Million Two Hundred Eighty Thousand
Dollars ($5,280,000) (the “Bonds”) to

Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of the City, has certified to this Council that the estimated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be financed with
the proceeds of the Bonds is at least
five (5) years and the maximum
maturity of the Bonds is twenty (20)

Whereas, the issuance of the

emergency measure providing for
the immediate preservation of the
public peace, property, health and
safety, and for the usual daily operation of a municipal department;
now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary to issue the Bonds in
an aggregate principal amount
not to exceed Five Million Two
Hundred Eighty Thousand Dollars
($5,280,000) for the purpose of providing funds to improve municipal

dental appurtenances in all cases,
including the acquisition of any
required real estate and interests in

Bonds.
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Sections
133.01 to 133.70, inclusive, and other
applicable provisions of the Revised
Code, the Charter of the City, the
General Bond Ordinance and this
Ordinance in the principal amount
and for the purpose stated in Section 1. The Bonds shall be designated “Parks and Recreation Facilities
Improvement
Bonds,
Series
2000”. The Bonds shall be issued in
one lot as fully registered Bonds in
denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. The Bonds
shall be numbered as determined by
the Director of Finance.
The Bonds shall be dated as of
August 1, 2000, or such other date,
but in no event later than December
31, 2000, specified in the certificate
of award providing for the final
terms of the Bonds and the sale of
the bonds and signed by the Director of Finance in accordance with
this Ordinance (the “Certificate of
Award”). The Bonds shall bear
interest at the rate or rates per year
specified
in
the
Certificate
of
Award; provided that if all the
Bonds bear interest at the same rate
per year, then such rate shall not
exceed eight percent (8%) per year,
and if the Bonds bear interest at
more than one rate per year, then
the weighted average of such rates
(taking into account the principal
amount and maturity of each Bond
to which a rate applies) shall not
exceed eight percent (8%) per year.
Interest on the Bonds shall be
payable, until the principal amount
is paid, semi-annually on May 15
and November 15 of each year or on
the days specified in the Certificate
of Award as the dates on which
interest on the Bonds shall be
payable
(the
“Interest
Payment
Dates”), beginning November 15,
2000 or on such other Interest Payment Date specified in the Certificate of Award as the first Interest
Payment Date.
The
Bonds
shall
mature
on
November 15 in twenty (20) substantially equal annual installments,
beginning November 15, 2001, or
according to the schedule set forth
in the Certificate of Award, provided that (i) each principal payment
shall occur on an Interest Payment
Date, (ii) the first principal payment on the Bonds shall be no earlier than November 15, 2000 and no
later than August 1, 2002, (iii) the
final maturity date of the Bonds
shall be no later than twenty (20)
years from that date which is
twelve months prior to the first date
on which provision for payment of
principal is made, and (iv) the principal
amount
thereof
shall
be
payable in annual installments such
that the total principal and interest
payments on the Bonds in any fiscal year in which principal is
payable is not more than three times
the amount of those payments in
any other fiscal year.
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as

The City Record
defined and further described below.
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the
“Mandatory
Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption prior to stated maturity
as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys, to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent,
currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of
and interest on any Term Bonds
shall include amounts sufficient to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City
for any Term Bonds. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds which
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and canceled
by the Registrar, to the extent not
applied
theretofore
as
a
credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of
the principal amount thereof against
the then current Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement (and
corresponding mandatory redemption obligation). Any excess of that
amount
over
the
then
current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemp-

1067

11
tion Requirement shall be credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligations) in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(b)
Optional
Redemption.
The
Bonds may be subject to redemption
prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole on any
date, or in part on any Interest Payment Date, on the dates and for the
prices specified in the Certificate of
Award, or the Director of Finance
may determine that it is in the best
interests of the City for the Bonds
not to be callable prior to their stated maturity. In the event that the
Bonds are callable, the earliest date
for optional redemption shall be no
later than the tenth anniversary of
the first principal payment date and
the maximum redemption price shall
be no greater than 102% of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued
interest to the redemption date.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar, given upon the direction
of the Council of the City by passage of an ordinance. That notice
shall specify the redemption date
and the principal amount of each
maturity of Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar. In
the event that notice of redemption
shall have been given by the Registrar to the registered owners as
hereinafter provided, there shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, funds
which, in addition to any other moneys available therefor and held by
the Registrar, will be sufficient to
redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus interest accrued to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice
of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Bonds by lot when Bonds of
denominations greater than $5,000
are then outstanding, each $5,000
unit of principal thereof shall be
treated as though it were a separate
Bond of the denomination of $5,000.
If it is determined that one or more,
but not all of the $5,000 units of
principal amount represented by a
Bond are to be called for redemption. then upon notice of redemption
of a $5,000 unit or units, the registered owner of that Bond shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i)
for payment of the redemption price

12
of the $5,000 unit or units called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption and any
premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity
of
the
proceedings
for
the
redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph hereof, the Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due, and payable
on the redemption date, and, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the
redemption
price,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date. If
money for the redemption of all of
the Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with interest
accrued thereon to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, so as to be available therefor on that date and, if
notice
of
redemption
has
been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
that money shall not be so available
on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held
by
the
Registrar
for
the
redemption of particular Bonds shall
be held in trust for the account of
the registered owners thereof and
shall be paid to them, respectively,
upon presentation and surrender of
those Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of

The City Record
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section
3) at the close of business on the
date provided in the Agreement
authorized in Section 3 (the “Record
Date”). Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond
Ordinance, so long as the Bonds are
held by a Depository in a book entry
system (as described in Section 3),
debt charges on the Bonds will be
payable in lawful money of the United States by wire transfer to the
Depository made by the Escrow
Agent on each Interest Payment
Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance is hereby adopted by reference, and, except for the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 of the General Bond Ordinance
(pertaining generally to the periods
during
which
the
City
is
not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under the
General Bond Ordinance), which are
not included in this Ordinance and
will not apply to the Bonds, the General Bond Ordinance is included as
a part of this Ordinance as fully as
if restated herein. Words and terms
not otherwise defined herein shall
have the same meaning as set forth
in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their faces
the purpose for which they are
issued and that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to
Section 4 of the General Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be authenticated by the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee.
The Bonds shall be signed by the
City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor and
by the City’s Director of Finance or
Acting Director of Finance; provided, however, that in accordance with
Section 9.96 of the Code and the
foregoing requirement that each
Bond bear the manual signature of
an authorized officer of the Trustee,
either or both of the signatures of
the City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor or
of its Director of Finance or Acting
Director of Finance may be a facsimile. The Bonds shall bear the
seal of the City, which seal may be
a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section
83 of the City’s Charter, the Director of Law or Acting Director of
Law shall prepare the Bonds and
shall endorse thereon his or her
approval of the form and correctness
thereof by his or her manual or facsimile signature.
Firstar Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent,
bond registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Bonds (the
“Registrar”);
provided
that
the
Escrow Agent shall also act as paying agent for the Bonds so long as
the Bonds are held in a book entry
system. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, the Registrar Agreement among the City,
the Registrar and the Escrow Agent

1068

May 24, 2000
(the “Agreement”) in substantially the
form as is now on file with the Clerk
of Council in File No. 898-2000-A.
The Agreement is approved, together with any changes or amendments that are not inconsistent
with this ordinance and not substantially adverse to the City and
that are approved by the Director
of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Agreement or amendments to the
Agreement.
The
Director
of
Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and
for
reimbursement
of
expenses
incurred pursuant to the Agreement
from the proceeds of the Bonds to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided
in this Section (the “Bond Register’). Subject to the provisions of
Section 5, the person in whose name
a Bond is registered on the Bond
Register shall be regarded as the
absolute owner of that Bond for all
purposes of this ordinance. Payment
of or on account of the debt charges
on any Bond shall be made only to
or upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Bond at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner
or
by
a
person
legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of
this ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge

May 24, 2000
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Bonds
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Bonds surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized: (i) the
Bonds may be issued in the form of
a single, fully registered Bond representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the beneficial
owners in book entry form shall
have no right to receive Bonds in
the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for
transfer to another Depository or to
another nominee of a Depository,
without further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do

The City Record
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Bonds from the Depository,
and the Trustee and Registrar shall
authenticate and deliver bond certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking
Fund and, if not purchased by such
Trustees, shall be offered to the
Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased by
such Account, shall be sold to NatCity Investments, Inc., SBK Investment Corp. and Lehman Brothers
(collectively, the “Original Purchaser”); provided, however, that if, in
the reasonable opinion of the Director of Finance, an underwriter is
incapable of fully performing its
duties or meeting its obligations in
its capacity as Original Purchaser
with respect to the Bonds, the Director of Finance is hereby authorized
and directed, in the name of and on
behalf of the City, to take whatever actions may be necessary to terminate that underwriter’s standing
as Original Purchaser.
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Bonds as set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement, including: the
principal amount of the Bonds, final
purchase price (which shall be not
less than 97% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate
or rates, the amounts and years in
which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements),
the
Interest Payment Dates and the
date of the Bonds (if different from
those set forth in Section 2) and any
other matters required in this Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. If it is determined advisable
by the Director of Finance for the
sale of the Bonds, the Director of
Finance is authorized to sign agreements with a municipal bond insurer issuing a policy of municipal
bond insurance for the Bonds that
are not materially inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Mayor, Director
of Finance, Director of Law and
other appropriate officers of the
City are, and each of them is, authorized and directed to take such
actions as are necessary, appropriate and in the best interest of the
City to establish the terms and
requirements for delivery of the
Bonds and to make such arrange-

1069

13
ments as are necessary with the
Original Purchaser in order to establish the date, location, and procedure, and conditions for the delivery
of the Bonds to the Original Purchaser,
to
give
all
appropriate
notices and certificates, to cause a
true transcript of proceedings with
reference to the issuance of the
Bonds to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Mayor and the Director
of Finance are, and each of them is,
hereby
further
authorized
and
directed to execute and deliver on
behalf of the City a bond purchase
agreement
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, between the City and the Original Purchaser setting forth the
terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell and the Original
Purchaser agrees to buy the Bonds,
provided that such agreement shall
not provide for or require the terms
of the Bonds to be inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Bond Purchase
Agreement is approved substantially in the form now on file with the
Clerk of Council in the File referenced in Section 3, together with
any changes or amendments that
are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and not substantially adverse
to the City and that are approved by
the Director of Finance on behalf of
the City, all of which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing
of the Bond Purchase Agreement or
amendments to the Bond Purchase
Agreement. It is hereby determined
that the terms of the Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance and as may
be provided in or pursuant to the
Certificate of Award, are in the best
interest of the City and in compliance with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an
Official Statement is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
original issuance of the Bonds, those
officers in their official capacities
are authorized to prepare or cause
to be prepared on behalf of the City
an Official Statement and any necessary supplements thereto, and on
behalf of the City to use and distribute, or authorize the use and distribution of, that Official Statement
and any supplements thereto in connection with the original issuance of
the Bonds, and each of those officers is authorized to sign on behalf
of the City and in his or her official
capacity, that Official Statement and
any supplements thereto approved
by such officer. Those officers are
and each of them is authorized to
sign and deliver, on behalf of the
City and in their official capacities,
such certificates in connection with
the accuracy of the Official Statement and any supplements thereto
as may, in their judgment, be necessary or appropriate. Such officers
are also hereby authorized to determine and certify on behalf of the
City that such disclosure document
is “deemed final” by the City within the meaning of Securities and
Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12
(the “SEC Rule”).

14
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under, the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
and directed to prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Bonds in accordance
with the SEC Rule. The performance
of that Agreement shall be subject
to the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of the
occurrence of any other events, the
Director of Finance shall consult
with, as appropriate, the legal counsel and bond or other qualified independent special counsel to the City.
The Director of Finance, acting in
the name and on behalf of the City,
shall be entitled to rely upon any
legal advice provided by any such
counsel in determining whether a
filing should be made.
Pursuant
to
Section
133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds
with other bonds into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of their sale as a single issue to
be designated “Various Purpose General Obligation Bonds, Series 2000”.
Such bonds shall contain a summary statement of purposes encompassing the purpose for which the
Bonds are issued and shall state
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds
promptly when and as the same
falls due, and also to provide for the
discharge of the Bonds at maturity,
there shall be and is hereby levied
on all the taxable property in the
City, in addition to all other taxes,
a direct tax annually during the
period the Bonds are outstanding, in
an amount sufficient to provide for
the payment of that interest, when
and as the same shall fall due, and
also to discharge the principal of
the Bonds at maturity, which tax
shall not be less than the interest
and sinking fund tax required by
Section 11 of Article XII of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same

The City Record

tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from the tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund as provided pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on
the Bonds when and as the same
fall due; provided, however, that,
subject to the provisions of Section
8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in
each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the
Bonds and are appropriated for such
purpose, the amount of such tax
shall be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25 and 5705.51 of the
Revised Code, and in accordance
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the
General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt
charges for the Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended and applied for the objects
and purposes for which the Bonds
are issued. Accrued interest and any
premium received from the sale of
the Bonds shall be deposited in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund to be
applied to the payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Bonds are secured by a pledge and
lien on a parity with the pledges
and liens authorized by the General
Bond Ordinance and, in addition to
the taxes and revenues specifically
pledged pursuant to this Ordinance
and the General Bond Ordinance and
the other covenants, terms and
agreements provided hereunder and
in the General Bond Ordinance to
secure payment of the principal of
and interest on the Bonds, the City
hereby determines, declares, warrants and covenants that the Bonds
are general obligations of the City
and that the full faith and credit of
the City are hereby pledged for the
payment of the principal of and
interest on the Bonds in accordance
with the laws and Constitution of
the State of Ohio, this Ordinance and
the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.

City shall pay or cause to be paid
and discharged all the outstanding
Bonds, or there shall otherwise be
paid to the holders of the outstanding Bonds all debt charges due or
to become due thereon, and provision shall also be made for paying
all other sums payable hereunder,
then and in that event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of further
effect, and the covenants, agreements and other obligations of the

1070

May 24, 2000
City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the
request of the City execute and
deliver to the City such instruments
in writing as shall discharge the
lien hereof and enter on the record

other instruments as may be reasonably required by the City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or sub-accounts, in trust for and
irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold
in special accounts or- sub-accounts,
in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations

dates and to bear such interest,
without further investment or reinvestment of either the principal
amount thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held
in trust and committed, except as
hereinafter provided), as will be sufficient,
together
with
moneys
referred to in (i) above, for the payment, at their maturities or redemption dates, of all debt charges on the
Bonds to their date of maturity or
redemption, as the case may be, or
if default in such payment shall
have occurred on such date then to
the date of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds
are to be redeemed prior to the
maturity thereof, notice of such
redemption shall have been duly
given or irrevocable provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall have
been duly made for the giving of
such notice. Any moneys held by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with
the provisions of this Section shall
be invested by the Escrow Agent in
direct obligations of the United
States of America maturing, or
redeemable at the option of the holder, at times and in amounts sufficient to meet payment of debt
charges on the Bonds, as directed by
the Director of Finance. Any income
or interest earned by, or increment
to, the investments held under this
Section shall, to the extent determined from time to time by the
Escrow Agent to be in excess of the
amount required to be held by it for
the purposes of this Section, be

authenticated upon any exchange or
transfer shall be valid obligations of
the City, evidencing the same debt,
and entitled to the same security

and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,

and as the same falls due; provided,
however, that in each year to the
extent that revenues are available
from other sources for the payment
of the Notes and Bonds and are
appropriated for such purpose, the
amount of such direct tax upon all
of the taxable property in the City
may be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.

Director of Finance is hereby authorized to prepare, execute and deliver to the Note Purchaser, to the

Bonds to the governmental purpose
of the borrowing, (ii) restrict the
yield

Ord. No. 899-2000.
By
Councilman
Patmon
(by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance providing for the issuance and sale of
Bonds in the maximum principal

the municipal street system and
related facilities and to pay capitalized
interest
and
all
expenses
incurred in connection with the
issuance of the Bonds; to authorize
agreements with respect to the

of notes in anticipation of such
Bonds.
Whereas, this Council desires to
issue bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed Eleven
Million Ninety Thousand Dollars
($11,090,000) (the “Bonds”) to finance
the cost of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1;
and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of the City, has certified to this Council that the estimated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be financed with
the proceeds of the Bonds is at least
five (5) years and the maximum
maturity of the Bonds is seventeen
(17) years; and
Whereas, this Council passed Ordinance No. 1749-80 on October 8, 1980,
and thereafter amended that ordinance by Ordinance No. 1112-83,
passed on May 6, 1983, and Ordinance No. 944-96, passed on June 10,
1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so
amended and as the same may further be amended from time to time
in accordance with its provisions, is
referred to as the “General Bond

terms
and
provisions
for
the
issuance thereunder of unvoted general obligations of the City and the
General Bond Ordinance was passed
in contemplation of this Ordinance
and other ordinances authorizing
the issuance of bonds in accordance
with the provisions thereof (the
“Series Bond Ordinances”); and
Whereas, the issuance of the
Bonds is necessary to provide funds
to pay the costs of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1, which are urgently needed
for the benefit of the City, and as a
result, this Ordinance constitutes an
emergency measure providing for
the immediate preservation of the

safety, and for the usual daily operation of a municipal department;
now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

with the payment of all associated
preliminary costs and costs of site
clearance and all appurtenances
necessary and incidental thereto,
and to pay capitalized interest and

including any financing costs within the meaning of Revised Code Section 133.01(K); and such other costs
of the foregoing permanent improvements that may be financed with
the proceeds of securities as permitted by Revised Code Section
133.15(B) and as otherwise permitted by law; and to authorize the
issuance of notes in anticipation of
such Bonds.
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Sections
133.01 to 133.70, inclusive, and other
applicable provisions of the Revised
Code, the Charter of the City, the
General Bond Ordinance and this
Ordinance in the principal amount
and for the purpose stated in Section 1. The Bonds shall be designated
“Bridges
and
Roadways
Improvement Bonds, Series 2000”.
The Bonds shall be issued in one lot
as fully registered Bonds in denominations of $5,000 or any integral
multiple thereof. The Bonds shall be
numbered as determined by the
Director of Finance.
The Bonds shall be dated as of
August 1, 2000, or such other date,
but in no event later than December
31, 2000, specified in the certificate
of award providing for the final
terms of the Bonds and the sale of
the bonds and signed by the Director of Finance in accordance with
this Ordinance (the “Certificate of
Award”). The Bonds shall bear
interest at the rate or rates per year
specified
in
the
Certificate
of
Award; provided that if all the
Bonds bear interest at the same rate
per year, then such rate shall not
exceed eight percent (8%) per year,
and if the Bonds bear interest at
more than one rate per year, then
the weighted average of such rates
(taking into account the principal
amount and maturity of each Bond
to which a rate applies) shall not
exceed eight percent (8%) per year.
Interest on the Bonds shall be
payable, until the principal amount
is paid, semi-annually on May 15
and November 15 of each year or on
the days specified in the Certificate
of Award as the dates on which
interest on the Bonds shall be
payable
(the
“Interest
Payment
Dates”), beginning November 15,
2000 or on such other Interest Payment Date specified in the Certificate of Award as the first Interest
Payment Date.
The
Bonds
shall
mature
on
November 15 in seventeen (17) substantially equal annual installments,
beginning November 15, 2001, or
according to the schedule set forth
in the Certificate of Award, provided that (i) each principal payment
shall occur on an Interest Payment
Date, (ii) the first principal payment on the Bonds shall be no earlier than November 15, 2000 and no
later than August 1, 2002, (iii) the
final maturity date of the Bonds
shall be no later than seventeen
(17) years from that date which is
twelve months prior to the first date

1073

17
on which provision for payment of
principal is made, and (iv) the principal
amount
thereof
shall
be
payable in annual installments such
that the total principal and interest
payments on the Bonds in any fiscal year in which principal is
payable is not more than three times
the amount of those payments in
any other fiscal year.
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the
“Mandatory
Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption prior to stated maturity
as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys, to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent,
currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of
and interest on any Term Bonds
shall include amounts sufficient to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City
for any Term Bonds. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds which
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and canceled
by the Registrar, to the extent not

18
applied
theretofore
as
a
credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of
the principal amount thereof against
the then current Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement (and
corresponding mandatory redemption obligation). Any excess of that
amount
over
the
then
current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement shall be credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligations) in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(b)
Optional
Redemption.
The
Bonds may be subject to redemption
prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole on any
date, or in part on any Interest Payment Date, on the dates and for the
prices specified in the Certificate of
Award, or the Director of Finance
may determine that it is in the best
interests of the City for the Bonds
not to be callable prior to their stated maturity. In the event that the
Bonds are callable, the earliest date
for optional redemption shall be no
later than the tenth anniversary of
the first principal payment date and
the maximum redemption price shall
be no greater than 102% of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued
interest to the redemption date.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar, given upon the direction
of the Council of the City by passage of an ordinance. That notice
shall specify the redemption date
and the principal amount of each
maturity of Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar. In
the event that notice of redemption
shall have been given by the Registrar to the registered owners as
hereinafter provided, there shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, funds
which, in addition to any other moneys available therefor and held by
the Registrar, will be sufficient to
redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus interest accrued to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice
of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial
redemption of Bonds by lot when
Bonds
of
denominations
greater

The City Record
than $5,000 are then outstanding,
each $5,000 unit of principal thereof shall be treated as though it
were a separate Bond of the denomination of $5,000. If it is determined
that one or more, but not all of the
$5,000 units of principal amount represented by a Bond are to be called
for redemption. then upon notice of
redemption of a $5,000 unit or units,
the registered owner of that Bond
shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar
(i)
for
payment
of
the
redemption price of the $5,000 unit
or
units
called
for
redemption
(including, without limitation, the
interest accrued to the date fixed
for redemption and any premium),
and
(ii)
for
issuance,
without
charge to the registered owner
thereof, of a new Bond or Bonds of
any
authorized denomination or
denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unmatured and unredeemed portion of,
and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity
of
the
proceedings
for
the
redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph hereof, the Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due, and payable
on the redemption date, and, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the
redemption
price,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date. If
money for the redemption of all of
the Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with interest
accrued thereon to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, so as to be available therefor on that date and, if
notice
of
redemption
has
been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
that money shall not be so available
on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held
by
the
Registrar
for
the
redemption of particular Bonds shall
be held in trust for the account of

1074

May 24, 2000
the registered owners thereof and
shall be paid to them, respectively,
upon presentation and surrender of
those Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section
3) at the close of business on the
date provided in the Agreement
authorized in Section 3 (the “Record
Date”). Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond
Ordinance, so long as the Bonds are
held by a Depository in a book entry
system (as described in Section 3),
debt charges on the Bonds will be
payable in lawful money of the United States by wire transfer to the
Depository made by the Escrow
Agent on each Interest Payment
Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance is hereby adopted by reference, and, except for the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 of the General Bond Ordinance
(pertaining generally to the periods
during
which
the
City
is
not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under
the General Bond Ordinance), which
are not included in this Ordinance
and will not apply to the Bonds, the
General Bond Ordinance is included
as a part of this Ordinance as fully
as if restated herein. Words and
terms not otherwise defined herein
shall have the same meaning as set
forth in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their faces
the purpose for which they are
issued and that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to
Section 4 of the General Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be authenticated by the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee.
The Bonds shall be signed by the
City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor and
by the City’s Director of Finance or
Acting Director of Finance; provided, however, that in accordance with
Section 9.96 of the Code and the foregoing requirement that each Bond
bear the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee,
either or both of the signatures of
the City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor or
of its Director of Finance or Acting
Director of Finance may be a facsimile. The Bonds shall bear the
seal of the City, which seal may be
a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section
83 of the City’s Charter, the Director of Law or Acting Director of
Law shall prepare the Bonds and
shall endorse thereon his or her
approval of the form and correctness
thereof by his or her manual or facsimile signature.

May 24, 2000
Firstar Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent,
bond registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Bonds (the
“Registrar”); provided that the Escrow Agent shall also act as paying
agent for the Bonds so long as the
Bonds are held in a book entry system. The Director of Finance shall
sign and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of the City, the Registrar
Agreement among the City, the Registrar and the Escrow Agent (the
“Agreement”) in substantially the
form as is now on file with the Clerk
of Council in File No. 899-2000-A.
The Agreement is approved, together with any changes or amendments that are not inconsistent
with this ordinance and not substantially adverse to the City and
that are approved by the Director
of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Agreement or amendments to the
Agreement. The Director of Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and
for
reimbursement
of
expenses
incurred pursuant to the Agreement
from the proceeds of the Bonds to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided
in this Section (the “Bond Register’). Subject to the provisions of
Section 5, the person in whose name
a Bond is registered on the Bond
Register shall be regarded as the
absolute owner of that Bond for all
purposes of this ordinance. Payment
of or on account of the debt charges
on any Bond shall be made only to
or upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Bond at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner
or
by
a
person
legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new

The City Record
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of
this ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Bonds
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Bonds surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized: (i) the
Bonds may be issued in the form of
a single, fully registered Bond representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the beneficial
owners in book entry form shall
have no right to receive Bonds in
the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for
transfer to another Depository or to

1075

19
another nominee of a Depository,
without further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Bonds from the Depository,
and the Trustee and Registrar shall
authenticate and deliver bond certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking
Fund and, if not purchased by such
Trustees, shall be offered to the
Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased by
such Account, shall be sold to NatCity Investments, Inc., SBK Investment Corp. and Lehman Brothers
(collectively, the “Original Purchaser”); provided, however, that if, in
the reasonable opinion of the Director of Finance, an underwriter is
incapable of fully performing its
duties or meeting its obligations in
its capacity as Original Purchaser
with respect to the Bonds, the Director of Finance is hereby authorized
and directed, in the name of and on
behalf of the City, to take whatever actions may be necessary to terminate that underwriter’s standing
as Original Purchaser.
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Bonds as set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement, including: the
principal amount of the Bonds, final
purchase price (which shall be not
less than 97% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate
or rates, the amounts and years in
which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements),
the
Interest Payment Dates and the
date of the Bonds (if different from
those set forth in Section 2) and any
other matters required in this Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. If it is determined advisable
by the Director of Finance for the
sale of the Bonds, the Director of
Finance is authorized to sign agreements with a municipal bond insurer issuing a policy of municipal
bond insurance for the Bonds that
are not materially inconsistent with

20
this Ordinance. The Mayor, Director
of Finance, Director of Law and
other appropriate officers of the
City are, and each of them is, authorized and directed to take such
actions as are necessary, appropriate and in the best interest of the
City to establish the terms and
requirements for delivery of the
Bonds and to make such arrangements as are necessary with the
Original Purchaser in order to establish the date, location, and procedure, and conditions for the delivery
of the Bonds to the Original Purchaser,
to
give
all
appropriate
notices and certificates, to cause a
true transcript of proceedings with
reference to the issuance of the
Bonds to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Mayor and the Director
of Finance are, and each of them is,
hereby
further
authorized
and
directed to execute and deliver on
behalf of the City a bond purchase
agreement
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, between the City and the Original Purchaser setting forth the
terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell and the Original
Purchaser agrees to buy the Bonds,
provided that such agreement shall
not provide for or require the terms
of the Bonds to be inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Bond Purchase
Agreement is approved substantially in the form now on file with the
Clerk of Council in the File referenced in Section 3, together with
any changes or amendments that
are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and not substantially adverse
to the City and that are approved by
the Director of Finance on behalf of
the City, all of which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing
of the Bond Purchase Agreement or
amendments to the Bond Purchase
Agreement. It is hereby determined
that the terms of the Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance and as may
be provided in or pursuant to the
Certificate of Award, are in the best
interest of the City and in compliance with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an
Official Statement is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
original issuance of the Bonds, those
officers in their official capacities
are authorized to prepare or cause
to be prepared on behalf of the City
an Official Statement and any necessary supplements thereto, and on
behalf of the City to use and distribute, or authorize the use and distribution of, that Official Statement
and any supplements thereto in connection with the original issuance of
the Bonds, and each of those officers is authorized to sign on behalf
of the City and in his or her official
capacity, that Official Statement and
any supplements thereto approved
by such officer. Those officers are
and each of them is authorized to
sign and deliver, on behalf of the
City and in their official capacities,
such certificates in connection with
the accuracy of the Official Statement and any supplements thereto

The City Record
as may, in their judgment, be necessary or appropriate. Such officers
are also hereby authorized to determine and certify on behalf of the
City that such disclosure document
is “deemed final” by the City within the meaning of Securities and
Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12
(the “SEC Rule”).
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under, the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
and directed to prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Bonds in accordance
with the SEC Rule. The performance
of that Agreement shall be subject
to the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of the
occurrence of any other events, the
Director of Finance shall consult
with, as appropriate, the legal counsel and bond or other qualified independent special counsel to the City.
The Director of Finance, acting in
the name and on behalf of the City,
shall be entitled to rely upon any
legal advice provided by any such
counsel in determining whether a
filing should be made.
Pursuant
to
Section
133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds
with other bonds into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of their sale as a single issue to
be designated “Various Purpose General Obligation Bonds, Series 2000”.
Such bonds shall contain a summary statement of purposes encompassing the purpose for which the
Bonds are issued and shall state
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds
promptly when and as the same
falls due, and also to provide for the
discharge of the Bonds at maturity,
there shall be and is hereby levied
on all the taxable property in the
City, in addition to all other taxes,
a direct tax annually during the
period the Bonds are outstanding, in
an amount sufficient to provide for
the payment of that interest, when
and as the same shall fall due, and
also to discharge the principal of
the Bonds at maturity, which tax
shall not be less than the interest

1076

and sinking fund tax required by
Section 11 of Article XII of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of those years are certified, extended and collected. The
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from the tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund as provided pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on
the Bonds when and as the same
fall due; provided, however, that,
subject to the provisions of Section
8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in
each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the
Bonds and are appropriated for such
purpose, the amount of such tax
shall be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25 and 5705.51 of the
Revised Code, and in accordance
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the
General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt
charges for the Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended and applied for the objects
and purposes for which the Bonds
are issued. Accrued interest and any
premium received from the sale of
the Bonds shall be deposited in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund to be
applied to the payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Bonds are secured by a pledge and
lien on a parity with the pledges
and liens authorized by the General
Bond Ordinance and, in addition to
the taxes and revenues specifically
pledged pursuant to this Ordinance
and the General Bond Ordinance and
the other covenants, terms and
agreements provided hereunder and
in the General Bond Ordinance to
secure payment of the principal of
and interest on the Bonds, the City
hereby determines, declares, warrants and covenants that the Bonds
are general obligations of the City
and that the full faith and credit of
the City are hereby pledged for the
payment of the principal of and
interest on the Bonds in accordance
with the laws and Constitution of
the State of Ohio, this Ordinance and
the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.

Bonds, or there shall otherwise be
paid to the holders of the outstanding Bonds all debt charges due or
to become due thereon, and provi-

May 24, 2000
sion shall also be made for paying
all other sums payable hereunder,
then and in that event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of further
effect, and the covenants, agreements and other obligations of the
City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the
request of the City execute and
deliver to the City such instruments
in writing as shall discharge the
lien hereof and enter on the record

other instruments as may be reasonably required by the City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or sub-accounts, in trust for and
irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold
in special accounts or sub-accounts,
in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations
of the United States certified by, an
independent public accounting firm
of national reputation or such other
qualified organization, to be of such
maturities and interest payment
dates and to bear such interest,
without further investment or reinvestment of either the principal
amount thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held
in trust and committed, except as
hereinafter provided), as will be sufficient,
together
with
moneys
referred to in (i) above, for the payment, at their maturities or redemption dates, of all debt charges on the
Bonds to their date of maturity or
redemption, as the case may be, or
if default in such payment shall
have occurred on such date then to
the date of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds
are to be redeemed prior to the
maturity thereof, notice of such
redemption shall have been duly
given or irrevocable provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall have
been duly made for the giving of
such notice. Any moneys held by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with
the provisions of this Section shall
be invested by the Escrow Agent in
direct obligations of the United
States of America maturing, or
redeemable at the option of the holder, at times and in amounts sufficient to meet payment of debt
charges on the Bonds, as directed by
the Director of Finance. Any income
or interest earned by, or increment
to, the investments held under this
Section shall, to the extent determined from time to time by the
Escrow Agent to be in excess of the
amount required to be held by it for
the purposes of this Section, be

for unclaimed funds held by a Paying Agent. In the event of nonpresentment of any Bond as described

17(a) for unclaimed funds held by a
Paying Agent.

the Note Register shall be regarded

to the unmatured principal amount
of the Note surrendered and bearing

or transfer of Notes only after the
new Notes are signed by the authorized officers of the City. In all
cases of Notes exchanged or transferred, the City shall sign and the

the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Note Registrar may require
that those charges, if any, be paid
before the procedure is begun for
the exchange or transfer. All Notes
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security ,and benefit under
this ordinance, as the Notes surrendered upon that exchange or transfer.

the Note Purchaser.
Section 12. Sale of the Notes. The

for such purpose.
Section 14. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. During the year
or years while the Notes are outstanding there shall be levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in

Section 18. Federal Tax Covenants. The City covenants that it
will use, and will restrict the use
and investment of, the proceeds of
the Notes and the Bonds in such
manner and to such extent as may
be necessary so that (a) the Notes
and the Bonds will not (i) constitute
private activity bonds, arbitrage
bonds or hedge bonds under Sections
141, 148 or 149 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (the
“Code”) or (ii) be treated other than
as bonds to which Section 103(a) of
the Code applies, and (b) the interest thereon will not be treated as an
item of tax preference under Section
57 of the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the Notes
and the Bonds to be and to remain
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will
not take or authorize to be taken
any actions that would adversely
affect that exclusion, and (e) it, or
persons acting for it, will, among
other acts of compliance, (i) apply
the proceeds of the Notes and the
Bonds to the governmental purpose
of the borrowing, (ii) restrict the
yield
on
investment
property
acquired with those proceeds, (iii)
make timely and adequate payments
to the federal government, (iv)
maintain books and records and
make calculations and reports, and
(v) refrain from certain uses of
those proceeds, and, as applicable,
of property financed with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the
extent necessary to assure such
exclusion of that interest under the
Code.
Each covenant made in this section with respect to the Notes and
the Bonds is also made with respect
to all issues any portion of the debt
service on which is paid from proceeds of the Notes or the Bonds
(and, if different, the original issue
and any refunding issues in a series
of refundings), to the extent such
compliance is necessary to assure

assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose, reducing the
burden or expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or
payments or penalties, or making
payments of special amounts in lieu
of making computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as
rebate, or obviating those amounts
or payments, as determined by that
officer, which action shall be in
writing and signed by the officer,
(b) to take any and all other
actions, make or obtain calculations,
make payments, and make or give
reports, covenants and certifications
of and on behalf of the City, as may
be appropriate to assure the exclusion of interest from gross income
and the intended tax status of the
Notes and the Bonds, and (c) to give
one or more appropriate certificates
of the City, for inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Notes
and the Bonds, setting forth the reasonable expectations of the City
regarding the amount and use of all
the proceeds of the Notes and the
Bonds, the facts, circumstances and
estimates on which they are based,
and other facts and circumstances

interest on and the tax status of the
Notes and the Bonds.

law.

The City Record
Ord. No. 900-2000.
By
Councilman
Patmon
(by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance providing for the issuance and sale of
Bonds in the maximum principal
amount of $2,310,000 for the purpose
of
providing
funds
for
public
improvements of municipal properties and easements in residential
neighborhoods and to pay capitalized
interest
and
all
expenses
incurred in connection with the
issuance of the Bonds; to authorize
agreements with respect to the
Bonds; and to authorize the issuance
of notes in anticipation of such
Bonds.
Whereas, this Council desires to
issue bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed Two Million Three Hundred Ten Thousand
Dollars ($2,310,000) (the “Bonds”) to
finance the cost of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1; and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of the City, has certified to this Council that the estimated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be financed with
the proceeds of the Bonds is at least
five (5) years and the maximum
maturity of the Bonds is twenty (20)
years; and
Whereas, this Council passed Ordinance No. 1749-80 on October 8, 1980,
and thereafter amended that ordinance by Ordinance No. 1112-83,
passed on May 6, 1983, and Ordinance No. 944-96, passed on June 10,
1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so
amended and as the same may further be amended from time to time
in accordance with its provisions, is
referred to as the “General Bond
Ordinance”), providing the general
terms
and
provisions
for
the
issuance thereunder of unvoted general obligations of the City and the
General Bond Ordinance was passed
in contemplation of this Ordinance
and other ordinances authorizing
the issuance of bonds in accordance
with the provisions thereof (the
“Series Bond Ordinances”); and
Whereas, the issuance of the
Bonds is necessary to provide funds
to pay the costs of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1, which are urgently needed
for the benefit of the City, and as a
result, this Ordinance constitutes an
emergency measure providing for
the immediate preservation of the
public peace, property, health and
safety, and for the usual daily operation of a municipal department;
now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary to issue the Bonds in an
aggregate principal amount not to
exceed Two Million Three Hundred
Ten Thousand Dollars ($2,310,000)
for the purpose of providing funds
for public improvements of streets
and municipal properties and easements in residential neighborhoods
by
opening,
widening,
grading,
draining, curbing and paving designated
streets,
constructing
sidewalks, curbs and gutters and driveway approaches, installing storm
and sanitary sewers, water lines
and storm drainage facilities as necessary and installing street lighting
and signs, signals, markings and
other devices for traffic control
together with the provision of all

1079

23
necessary and incidental appurtenances in all cases, acquiring real
estate and interests in real estate,
including easements necessary for
such purpose, together with the payment of all associated preliminary
costs and costs of site clearance,
and to pay capitalized interest and
all expenses incurred in connection
with the issuance of the Bonds.
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Sections
133.01 to 133.70, inclusive, and other
applicable provisions of the Revised
Code, the Charter of the City, the
General Bond Ordinance and this
Ordinance in the principal amount
and for the purpose stated in Section 1. The Bonds shall be designated
“Residential
Neighborhood
Improvement Bonds, Series 2000”.
The Bonds shall be issued in one lot
as fully registered Bonds in denominations of $5,000 or any integral
multiple thereof. The Bonds shall be
numbered as determined by the
Director of Finance.
The Bonds shall be dated as of
August 1, 2000, or such other date,
but in no event later than December
31, 2000, specified in the certificate
of award providing for the final
terms of the Bonds and the sale of
the bonds and signed by the Director of Finance in accordance with
this Ordinance (the “Certificate of
Award”). The Bonds shall bear
interest at the rate or rates per year
specified
in
the
Certificate
of
Award; provided that if all the
Bonds bear interest at the same rate
per year, then such rate shall not
exceed eight percent (8%) per year,
and if the Bonds bear interest at
more than one rate per year, then
the weighted average of such rates
(taking into account the principal
amount and maturity of each Bond
to which a rate applies) shall not
exceed eight percent (8%) per year.
Interest on the Bonds shall be
payable, until the principal amount
is paid, semi-annually on May 15
and November 15 of each year or on
the days specified in the Certificate
of Award as the dates on which
interest on the Bonds shall be
payable
(the
“Interest
Payment
Dates”), beginning November 15,
2000 or on such other Interest Payment Date specified in the Certificate of Award as the first Interest
Payment Date.
The
Bonds
shall
mature
on
November 15 in twenty (20) substantially equal annual installments,
beginning November 15, 2001, or
according to the schedule set forth
in the Certificate of Award, provided that (i) each principal payment
shall occur on an Interest Payment
Date, (ii) the first principal payment on the Bonds shall be no earlier than November 15, 2000 and no
later than August 1, 2002, (iii) the
final maturity date of the Bonds
shall be no later than twenty (20)
years from that date which is
twelve months prior to the first date
on which provision for payment of
principal is made, and (iv) the principal
amount
thereof
shall
be
payable in annual installments such
that the total principal and interest
payments on the Bonds in any fiscal year in which principal is
payable is not more than three times
the amount of those payments in
any other fiscal year.

24
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the
“Mandatory
Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption prior to stated maturity
as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys, to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent,
currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of
and interest on any Term Bonds
shall include amounts sufficient to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City
for any Term Bonds. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds which
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and canceled
by the Registrar, to the extent not
applied
theretofore
as
a
credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of

The City Record
the principal amount thereof against
the then current Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement (and
corresponding mandatory redemption obligation). Any excess of that
amount
over
the
then
current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement shall be credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligations) in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(b)
Optional
Redemption.
The
Bonds may be subject to redemption
prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole on any
date, or in part on any Interest Payment Date, on the dates and for the
prices specified in the Certificate of
Award, or the Director of Finance
may determine that it is in the best
interests of the City for the Bonds
not to be callable prior to their stated maturity. In the event that the
Bonds are callable, the earliest date
for optional redemption shall be no
later than the tenth anniversary of
the first principal payment date and
the maximum redemption price shall
be no greater than 102% of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued
interest to the redemption date.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar, given upon the direction
of the Council of the City by passage of an ordinance. That notice
shall specify the redemption date
and the principal amount of each
maturity of Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar. In
the event that notice of redemption
shall have been given by the Registrar to the registered owners as
hereinafter provided, there shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, funds
which, in addition to any other moneys available therefor and held by
the Registrar, will be sufficient to
redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus interest accrued to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice
of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial
redemption of Bonds by lot when
Bonds
of
denominations greater
than $5,000 are then outstanding,
each $5,000 unit of principal thereof shall be treated as though it
were a separate Bond of the denom-

1080

May 24, 2000
ination of $5,000. If it is determined
that one or more, but not all of the
$5,000 units of principal amount represented by a Bond are to be called
for redemption. then upon notice of
redemption of a $5,000 unit or units,
the registered owner of that Bond
shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i)
for payment
of
the
redemption price of the $5,000 unit
or
units
called
for
redemption
(including, without limitation, the
interest accrued to the date fixed
for redemption and any premium),
and
(ii)
for
issuance,
without
charge to the registered owner
thereof, of a new Bond or Bonds of
any
authorized denomination
or
denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unmatured and unredeemed portion of,
and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity
of
the
proceedings
for
the
redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph hereof, the Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due, and payable
on the redemption date, and, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the
redemption
price,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date. If
money for the redemption of all of
the Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with interest
accrued thereon to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, so as to be available therefor on that date and, if
notice
of
redemption
has
been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
that money shall not be so available
on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held
by
the
Registrar
for
the
redemption of particular Bonds shall
be held in trust for the account of
the registered owners thereof and

May 24, 2000
shall be paid to them, respectively,
upon presentation and surrender of
those Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section
3) at the close of business on the
date provided in the Agreement
authorized in Section 3 (the “Record
Date”). Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond
Ordinance, so long as the Bonds are
held by a Depository in a book entry
system (as described in Section 3),
debt charges on the Bonds will be
payable in lawful money of the United States by wire transfer to the
Depository made by the Escrow
Agent on each Interest Payment
Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance is hereby adopted by reference, and, except for the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 of the General Bond Ordinance
(pertaining generally to the periods
during
which
the
City
is
not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under
the General Bond Ordinance), which
are not included in this Ordinance
and will not apply to the Bonds, the
General Bond Ordinance is included
as a part of this Ordinance as fully
as if restated herein. Words and
terms not otherwise defined herein
shall have the same meaning as set
forth in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their faces
the purpose for which they are
issued and that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to
Section 4 of the General Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be authenticated by the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee.
The Bonds shall be signed by the
City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor and
by the City’s Director of Finance or
Acting Director of Finance; provided, however, that in accordance with
Section 9.96 of the Code and the foregoing requirement that each Bond
bear the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee,
either or both of the signatures of
the City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor or
of its Director of Finance or Acting
Director of Finance may be a facsimile. The Bonds shall bear the
seal of the City, which seal may be
a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section
83 of the City’s Charter, the Director of Law or Acting Director of
Law shall prepare the Bonds and
shall endorse thereon his or her
approval of the form and correctness

The City Record
thereof by his or her manual or facsimile signature.
Firstar Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent,
bond registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Bonds (the
“Registrar”);
provided
that
the
Escrow Agent shall also act as paying agent for the Bonds so long as
the Bonds are held in a book entry
system. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, the Registrar Agreement among the City,
the Registrar and the Escrow Agent
(the “Agreement”) in substantially
the form as is now on file with the
Clerk of Council in File No. 900-2000-A.
The Agreement is approved, together with any changes or amendments
that are not inconsistent with this
ordinance
and
not
substantially
adverse to the City and that are
approved by the Director of Finance
on behalf of the City, all of which
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Agreement or
amendments to the Agreement. The
Director of Finance shall provide for
the payment of the services rendered
and for reimbursement of expenses
incurred pursuant to the Agreement
from the proceeds of the Bonds to the
extent available and then from other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for that
purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided
in this Section (the “Bond Register’). Subject to the provisions of
Section 5, the person in whose name
a Bond is registered on the Bond
Register shall be regarded as the
absolute owner of that Bond for all
purposes of this ordinance. Payment
of or on account of the debt charges
on any Bond shall be made only to
or upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender
at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together with
a request for exchange signed by
the registered owner or by a person
legally empowered to do so in a
form satisfactory to the Registrar. A
Bond may be transferred only on the
Bond Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Bond at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an assignment signed by the registered
owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in a form satisfactory
to the Registrar. Upon exchange or
transfer the Registrar shall complete, authenticate and deliver a new
Bond or Bonds of any authorized
denomination or denominations requested by the owner equal in the
aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond surrendered
and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date.

1081

25
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the
new Bonds are signed by the authorized officers of the City. In all
cases of Bonds exchanged or transferred, the City shall sign and the
Registrar shall authenticate and
deliver Bonds in accordance with
the provisions of this ordinance.
The exchange or transfer shall be
without charge to the owner, except
that the City and Registrar may
make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any tax or other governmental charge required to be
paid with respect to the exchange
or transfer. The City or the Registrar may require that those charges,
if any, be paid before the procedure
is begun for the exchange or transfer. All Bonds issued and authenticated upon any exchange or transfer shall be valid obligations of the
City, evidencing the same debt, and
entitled to the same security and
benefit under this ordinance, as the
Bonds surrendered upon that exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and
the principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii)
physical Bond certificates in fully
registered form are issued by the
City only to a Depository or its
nominee as registered owner, with
the Bonds “immobilized” in the custody of the Depository. The book
entry maintained by others than
the City is the record that identifies the owners of beneficial interests in those Bonds and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a
book entry system is utilized: (i)
the Bonds may be issued in the
form of a single, fully registered
Bond representing each maturity
and registered in the name of the
Depository or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the
custody of the Depository; (ii) the
beneficial owners in book entry
form shall have no right to receive
Bonds in the form of physical securities or certificates; (iii) ownership
of beneficial interests in book entry
form shall be shown by book entry

26
on the system maintained and operated by the Depository and its Participants, and transfers of the ownership of beneficial interests shall
be made only by book entry by the
Depository and its Participants; and
(iv) the Bonds as such shall not be
transferable or exchangeable, except for transfer to another Depository or to another nominee of a
Depository, without further action
by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Bonds from the Depository,
and the Trustee and Registrar shall
authenticate and deliver bond certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking
Fund and, if not purchased by such
Trustees, shall be offered to the
Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased by
such Account, shall be sold to NatCity Investments, Inc., SBK Investment Corp. and Lehman Brothers
(collectively, the “Original Purchaser”); provided, however, that if, in
the reasonable opinion of the Director of Finance, an underwriter is
incapable of fully performing its
duties or meeting its obligations in
its capacity as Original Purchaser
with respect to the Bonds, the Director of Finance is hereby authorized
and directed, in the name of and on
behalf of the City, to take whatever actions may be necessary to terminate that underwriter’s standing
as Original Purchaser.
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Bonds as set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement, including: the
principal amount of the Bonds, final
purchase price (which shall be not
less than 97% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate
or rates, the amounts and years in
which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements),
the

The City Record
Interest Payment Dates and the
date of the Bonds (if different from
those set forth in Section 2) and any
other matters required in this Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. If it is determined advisable by the Director of Finance for
the sale of the Bonds, the Director
of Finance is authorized to sign
agreements with a municipal bond
insurer issuing a policy of municipal bond insurance for the Bonds
that are not materially inconsistent
with this Ordinance. The Mayor,
Director of Finance, Director of
Law and other appropriate officers
of the City are, and each of them
is, authorized and directed to take
such actions
as
are
necessary,
appropriate and in the best interest
of the City to establish the terms
and requirements for delivery of the
Bonds and to make such arrangements as are necessary with the
Original
Purchaser
in
order
to
establish the date, location, and procedure, and conditions for the delivery of the Bonds to the Original
Purchaser, to give all appropriate
notices and certificates, to cause a
true transcript of proceedings with
reference to the issuance of the
Bonds to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Mayor and the Director
of Finance are, and each of them is,
hereby
further
authorized
and
directed to execute and deliver on
behalf of the City a bond purchase
agreement
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, between the City and the Original Purchaser setting forth the
terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell and the Original
Purchaser agrees to buy the Bonds,
provided that such agreement shall
not provide for or require the terms
of the Bonds to be inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Bond Purchase
Agreement is approved substantially in the form now on file with the
Clerk of Council in the File referenced in Section 3, together with
any changes or amendments that
are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and not substantially adverse
to the City and that are approved
by the Director of Finance on
behalf of the City, all of which shall
be conclusively evidenced by the
signing
of
the
Bond
Purchase
Agreement or amendments to the
Bond Purchase Agreement. It is
hereby determined that the terms of
the Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance and as may be provided in or
pursuant
to
the
Certificate
of
Award, are in the best interest of
the City and in compliance with all
legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an
Official Statement is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
original issuance of the Bonds,
those
officers
in
their
official
capacities are authorized to prepare
or cause to be prepared on behalf
of the City an Official Statement
and
any
necessary
supplements

1082

May 24, 2000
thereto, and on behalf of the City
to use and distribute, or authorize
the use and distribution of, that
Official Statement and any supplements thereto in connection with
the original issuance of the Bonds,
and each of those officers is authorized to sign on behalf of the City
and in his or her official capacity,
that Official Statement and any
supplements thereto approved by
such officer. Those officers are and
each of them is authorized to sign
and deliver, on behalf of the City
and in their official capacities, such
certificates in connection with the
accuracy of the Official Statement
and any supplements thereto as
may, in their judgment, be necessary or appropriate. Such officers
are also hereby authorized to determine and certify on behalf of the
City that such disclosure document
is “deemed final” by the City within the meaning of Securities and
Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12
(the “SEC Rule”).
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under, the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
and directed to prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Bonds in accordance
with the SEC Rule. The performance
of that Agreement shall be subject
to the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further authorized and directed to
establish procedures in order to
ensure compliance by the City with
its
continuing
disclosure
agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices.
Prior to making any filing in accordance with that agreement or providing notice of the occurrence of
any other events, the Director of
Finance
shall
consult
with,
as
appropriate, the legal counsel and
bond or other qualified independent
special counsel to the City. The
Director of Finance, acting in the
name and on behalf of the City,
shall be entitled to rely upon any
legal advice provided by any such
counsel in determining whether a
filing should be made.
Pursuant
to
Section
133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds
with other bonds into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of their sale as a single issue to
be designated “Various Purpose General Obligation Bonds, Series 2000”.
Such bonds shall contain a summary statement of purposes encompassing the purpose for which the

May 24, 2000
Bonds are issued and shall state
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds
promptly when and as the same
falls due, and also to provide for the
discharge of the Bonds at maturity,
there shall be and is hereby levied
on all the taxable property in the
City, in addition to all other taxes,
a direct tax annually during the
period the Bonds are outstanding, in
an amount sufficient to provide for
the payment of that interest, when
and as the same shall fall due, and
also to discharge the principal of
the Bonds at maturity, which tax
shall not be less than the interest
and sinking fund tax required by
Section 11 of Article XII of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of those years are certified, extended and collected. The
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from the tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund as provided pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on
the Bonds when and as the same
fall due; provided, however, that,
subject to the provisions of Section
8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in
each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the
Bonds and are appropriated for such
purpose, the amount of such tax
shall be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25 and 5705.51 of the
Revised Code, and in accordance
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the
General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt
charges for the Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended and applied for the objects
and purposes for which the Bonds
are issued. Accrued interest and any
premium received from the sale of
the Bonds shall be deposited in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund to be
applied to the payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Bonds are secured by a pledge and
lien on a parity with the pledges
and liens authorized by the General
Bond Ordinance and, in addition to
the taxes and revenues specifically
pledged pursuant to this Ordinance

The City Record
and the General Bond Ordinance and
the other covenants, terms and
agreements provided hereunder and
in the General Bond Ordinance to
secure payment of the principal of
and interest on the Bonds, the City
hereby determines, declares, warrants and covenants that the Bonds
are general obligations of the City
and that the full faith and credit of
the City are hereby pledged for the
payment of the principal of and
interest on the Bonds in accordance
with the laws and Constitution of
the State of Ohio, this Ordinance and
the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid
and discharged all the outstanding
Bonds, or there shall otherwise be
paid to the holders of the outstanding Bonds all debt charges due or
to become due thereon, and provision shall also be made for paying
all other sums payable hereunder,
then and in that event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of further
effect, and the covenants, agreements and other obligations of the
City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the
request of the City execute and
deliver to the City such instruments
in writing as shall discharge the
lien hereof and enter on the record
such discharge of the lien and such
other instruments as may be reasonably required by the City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or sub-accounts, in trust for and
irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold
in special accounts or sub-accounts,
in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations
of the United States certified by, an
independent public accounting firm
of national reputation or such other
qualified organization, to be of such
maturities and interest payment
dates and to bear such interest,
without further investment or reinvestment of either the principal
amount thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held
in trust and committed, except as
hereinafter provided), as will be sufficient,
together
with
moneys
referred to in (i) above, for the payment, at their maturities or redemption dates, of all debt charges on the
Bonds to their date of maturity or
redemption, as the case may be, or
if default in such payment shall
have occurred on such date then to
the date of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds
are to be redeemed prior to the
maturity thereof, notice of such
redemption shall have been duly
given or irrevocable provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall have
been duly made for the giving of
such notice. Any moneys held by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with
the provisions of this Section shall
be invested by the Escrow Agent in
direct obligations of the United
States of America maturing, or
redeemable at the option of the hold-

1083

27
er, at times and in amounts sufficient to meet payment of debt
charges on the Bonds, as directed by
the Director of Finance. Any income
or interest earned by, or increment
to, the investments held under this
Section shall, to the extent determined from time to time by the
Escrow Agent to be in excess of the
amount required to be held by it for
the purposes of this Section, be
transferred at the time of such
determination as provided in Section
17(a) of the General Bond Ordinance
for unclaimed funds held by a Paying Agent. In the event of nonpresentment of any Bond as described
in Section 17(a) of the General Bond
Ordinance, the moneys held pursuant to this Section shall be held
and paid as provided in said Section
17(a) for unclaimed funds held by a
Paying Agent.
Section 9. Bond Anticipation Notes.
For the purpose of raising money in
anticipation of the issuance of the
Bonds for the purposes set forth in
Section 1 hereof, notes of the City
may be issued in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed Two Million Three Hundred Ten Thousand
Dollars ($2,310,000) (the “Notes”)
upon the direction of the Director of
Finance to be set forth in a certificate providing for the final terms of
the Notes and the sale of the Notes
and signed by the Director of
Finance (the “Note Certificate of
Award”).
Section 10. Term of the Notes. The

(7%) per year, as may be fixed by
the Director of Finance of the City
in the Note Certificate of Award;

set forth in the Note Certificate of
Award, which shall be no later than
five (5) years from such date of

shall
be
subject
to
redemption by the City at any time
prior to maturity without penalty,
provided that, if the Director of
Finance, based on the advice of the
financial advisor of the City, determines that it is in the best interest
of the City in order to enhance the
marketability of the Notes, the
Director of Finance may cause the
Notes to not be redeemable for a
period which ends no later than the
date which is two (2) years following the date of issuance of the
Notes; shall be designated “Residential Neighborhood Improvement
Bond
Anticipation
Notes,
Series
2000”; shall be issued in such numbers and denominations as may be
requested by the Note Purchaser
(hereinafter defined); and shall be
issued
in fully registered
form
(which may be in a book entry only
system) in denominations of $5,000
or integral multiples thereof. In connection with the issuance of the
Notes and the Bonds, Carmona Motley Hoffmann, Inc. shall serve as
the financial advisor of the City.
Interest shall be payable semi-annually on the dates set forth in the
Note Certificate of Award; provided
that if the Notes mature on or
before the end of the twelfth (12th)
month
following
their
date
of
issuance, interest on the Notes shall
be payable at maturity.
Firstar Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent, registrar, transfer agent and paying

28
agent for the Notes (the “Note Registrar”); provided that the Escrow
Agent also shall act as paying
agent for the Notes so long as the
Notes are held in a book entry system. The Director of Finance shall
sign and deliver, in the name and
on behalf of the City, an agreement
among the City, the Note Registrar
and the Escrow Agent (the “Note
Registrar Agreement”) providing for
services relating to the registration,
transfer, exchange and payment of
Notes. The Director of Finance shall
provide for the payment of the services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant
to the Note Registrar Agreement
from the proceeds of the Notes to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose.
So long as any of the Notes
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Note Registrar to maintain and keep at its principal corporate trust office all books and
records necessary for the registration, exchange and transfer of Notes
as provided in this Section (the
“Note Register”). Subject to the provisions of Section 5, the person in
whose name a Note is registered on
the Note Register shall be regarded
as the absolute owner of that Note
for all purposes of this ordinance.
Payment of or on account of the
debt charges on any Note shall be
made only to or upon the order of
that person; neither the City nor the
Note Registrar shall be affected by
any notice to the contrary, but the
registration may be changed as provided in this Section. All such payments shall be valid and effectual
to satisfy and discharge the City’s
liability upon the Note, including
interest, to the extent of the amount
or amounts so paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for
Notes of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Note Registrar, together with a request for exchange
signed by the registered owner or
by a person legally empowered to do
so in a form satisfactory to the Note
Registrar. A Note may be transferred only on the Note Register
upon presentation and surrender of
the Note at the principal corporate
trust officer of the Note Registrar
together with an assignment signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Note Registrar. Upon exchange or transfer
the Note Registrar shall complete,
authenticate and deliver a new Note
or Notes of any authorized denomination or denominations requested
by the owner equal in the aggregate
to the unmatured principal amount
of the Note surrendered and bearing
interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Note Registrar shall undertake the exchange
or transfer of Notes only after the
new Notes are signed by the authorized officers of the City. In all
cases of Notes exchanged or transferred, the City shall sign and the
Note Registrar shall authenticate
and deliver Notes in accordance
with the provisions of this Ordinance. The exchange or transfer
shall be without charge to the
owner, except that the City and Note

The City Record
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Note Registrar may require
that those charges, if any, be paid
before the procedure is begun for
the exchange or transfer. All Notes
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security ,and benefit under
this ordinance, as the Notes surrendered upon that exchange or transfer.
Pursuant
to
Section
133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Notes
with other bond anticipation notes
of the City into a single consolidated ‘issue of bonds for purposes of
their sale as a single issue to be

for which the Notes are issued and
shall state that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 11. Execution and Payment of the Notes. The Notes shall
be executed by the Director of
Finance and the Mayor, provided
that one of such signatures may be

upon their face the purpose for
which they are issued and that they
are issued pursuant to this ordinance, and may be payable in Federal Reserve funds of the United
States of America if requested by
the Note Purchaser.
Section 12. Sale of the Notes. The
Notes shall be sold at private sale
to the Note Purchaser by the Director of Finance in the principal
amount set forth in a certificate of
award to be executed by the Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate
of Award”) at not less than par and
accrued interest and at a rate not
exceeding that set forth in Section
10 hereof. The Notes shall be sold to
NatCity
Investments,
Inc.,
SBK
Investment Corp. and Lehman Brothers (collectively, the “Note Purchaser”). The proceeds of such sale shall
be paid into the proper fund and
used for the purpose for which the
Notes are being issued under the
provisions of this Ordinance.
Section 13. Security for the Notes.
The Notes shall be the full general
obligations of the City, and the full
faith, credit and revenue of the City
are hereby pledged for the prompt
payment of the same. The par value
to be received from the sale of the
Bonds and any excess funds resulting from the issuance of the Notes
shall, to the extent necessary, be
used for the retirement of the Notes
at maturity, together with the interest thereon, and are hereby pledged,
for such purpose.
Section 14. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. During the year
or years while the Notes are outstanding there shall be levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes but within tax limitations, a direct tax annually not less than that which would
have been levied if bonds had been
issued therefor without the prior
issue of the Notes.

1084

May 24, 2000
Said tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of said year are certified, extended and collected. Said
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the fill amount thereof. The funds
derived from said tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account, which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of the principal and interest of
the Notes or the Bonds in anticipation of which they are issued, when
and as the same falls due; provided,
however, that in each year to the
extent that revenues are available
from other sources for the payment
of the Notes and Bonds and are
appropriated for such purpose, the
amount of such direct tax upon all
of the taxable property in the City
may be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
Section 15. Preparation of Disclosure Document for the Notes. The
Director of Finance is hereby authorized to prepare, execute and deliver to the Note Purchaser, to the
extent required by law, a preliminary and final Official Statement or

this Ordinance and the General
Bond Ordinance shall not apply to
the Bonds or the Notes authorized
herein.

herein of the provisions of the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) and the
third paragraph of Section 4 of the
General Bond Ordinance pursuant to
Section 2 of this Ordinance.
Section 17. Captions. The captions

for convenience only and in no way
define, limit or describe the scope or
intent of any provisions or sections
of this Ordinance.
Section 18. Federal Tax Covenants. The City covenants that it
will use, and will restrict the use
and investment of, the proceeds of
the Notes and the Bonds in such
manner and to such extent as may
be necessary so that (a) the Notes
and the Bonds will not (i) constitute
private activity bonds, arbitrage
bonds or hedge bonds under Sections
141, 148 or 149 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (the
“Code”) or (ii) be treated other than
as bonds to which Section 103(a) of
the Code applies, and (b) the inter-

May 24, 2000
est thereon will not be treated as an
item of tax preference under Section
57 of the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required of
it for the interest on the Notes and
the Bonds to be and to remain
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will
not take or authorize to be taken any
actions that would adversely affect
that exclusion, and (e) it, or persons

governmental purpose of the borrowing, (ii) restrict the yield on
investment property acquired with
those proceeds, (iii) make timely and
adequate payments to the federal
government, (iv) maintain books and
records and make calculations and
reports, and (v) refrain from certain
uses of those proceeds, and, as
applicable, of property financed with

the Bonds is also made with respect
to all issues any portion of the debt
service on which is paid from proceeds of the Notes or the Bonds
(and, if different, the original issue
and any refunding issues in a series
of refundings), to the extent such
compliance is necessary to assure
exclusion of interest on the Notes
and the Bonds from gross income for
federal income tax purposes, and the
officers identified above are authorized to take actions with respect to
those issues as they are authorized
in this section to take with respect
to the Notes and the Bonds.
The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer of
the City having responsibility for
issuance of the Notes and the Bonds
is hereby authorized (a) to make or
effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or
waiver on behalf of the City with
respect to the Notes and the Bonds
as the City is permitted or required
to make or give under the federal
income tax laws, including, without
limitation thereto, any of the elections

assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose, reducing the
burden or expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or
payments or penalties, or making
payments of special amounts in lieu
of making computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as
rebate, or obviating those amounts
or payments, as determined by that
officer, which action shall be in
writing and signed by the officer,
(b) to take any and all other
actions, make or obtain calculations,
make payments, and make or give
reports, covenants and certifications
of and on behalf of the City, as may
be appropriate to assure the exclusion of interest from gross income

purposes.

of housing located on upper floors
of historic buildings in the district;

the provisions of this section, the

diesel or other powered emergency
generator) shall be placed along the
designated pedestrian-oriented shopping street on the first floor, second
floor or in the sidewalk area.
(j) Exceptions. Notwithstanding
the variance powers outlined in Section 329.03, the Board of Zoning

application of these provisions in
harmony with the general purpose

of substantial property rights.
