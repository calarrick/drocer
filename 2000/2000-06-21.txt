ORDINANCE READ IN FULL
AND PASSED
Ord. No. 2009-A-99 (As a substitute
for Ord. No. 2009-99).
By Councilmen Polensek, ~Brady,
Britt, Cimperman, Cintron, Coats,
Dolan, Gordon, Jackson, Johnson,
Jones, Lewis, Melena, O’Malley, Patmon, Robinson, Rybka, Sweeney,
Westbrook, White and Willis.
An ordinance to supplement the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, by enacting new Chapter
189 relating to the Cleveland Fair
Employment Law.
Whereas, it is beneficial to the
health and welfare of all citizens of
the City of Cleveland that all workers are paid an hourly wage which
enables them to live above the level
of poverty and reduces the amount
of taxpayer funded social service
programs in the City of Cleveland;
and
Whereas, this legislation provides
for a fair employment wage for
employees employed by persons or
entities, which are awarded contracts by, for, or on behalf of the
City of Cleveland and receive economic
assistance
in
conjunction
with such contracts; and
Whereas, some employers who
receive financial assistance from
the City do not provide reasonable
health insurance to their employees,
thereby negatively affecting work
performance
and
absenteeism,
resulting in a decrease in the quantity and quality of services rendered
by such employees to the City and
to the public; and
Whereas, the City is greatly concerned with the general health and
welfare of its citizens and such
interest is furthered when its citizens are provided reasonable health
care insurance coverage; and
Whereas, when the City uses contractors or subsidizes businesses
which do not provide health insurance to their employees, this often
imposes the cost of their medical
care on the City, county, state and
federal governments, an impact that
can be avoided only if employers
provide health insurance in a reasonable form; and
Whereas, because employees are
far likelier to be healthy and, therefore, more productive workers if
their employers provide an adequate
level of compensation, including reasonable health insurance for them
and their dependents, this legislation both mandates the payment of
a fair employment wage and provides incentives to encourage contractors with the City to provide
health insurance benefits to their
employees; and
Whereas, the purpose of this legislation is to provide for a fair
employment
wage
and
promote
health insurance benefits for workers employed by employers receiving assistance from the City and, as
a result, enhance the welfare of
workers in the City of Cleveland;
and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes a measure providing for the
preservation of the public health,
safety, and welfare of the citizens
of the City of Cleveland; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

authorizing a contract for Assistance.

Employer for an incentive as provided in the previous section, the
reasonable health care insurance
provided to employees must be comparable to a family health care

from the requirements of this Chapter on the following grounds:
(A) A hardship exemption for otherwise Covered Employers that can
demonstrate a specific, particular
harm that would be felt uniquely by
the Covered Employer if this chapter were to be applied. Economic

other actual competitor for the contract, subcontract or lease. The following types of specific particular
harm may provide grounds for a
hardship exemption:
(i) a loss of profitability that will
result in the elimination of jobs;
(ii) a loss in profits that will substantially
impact
the
Covered
Employer’s long-term stability;
(iii) as to not-for-profit community or social service agencies or organizations, a substantial hindrance in
the ability to deliver service.

exemption shall be made to the
Applicable Department. If the need
for the exemption is known to the
applicant at the time it applies or
during the term of the contract for
a Service Contract or Assistance, the
application for the exemption should
be submitted with the application
for the Service or Assistance Contract.

The City Record
(A) The Director of the Applicable Department shall review and
make a determination on the application within ten (10) days and
respond to the applicant in writing,
setting forth the reasons for the
determination.
(i) Notice of the request for an
exemption shall be forwarded to the
Fair Employment Wage Board and
the Clerk of Cleveland City Council.
(ii) A copy of the Director's determination regarding the application
for the hardship exemption shall be
forwarded to the Fair Employment
Wage Board and the Clerk of Cleveland City Council.
(B) Should the exemption be recommended by the Director, the
Director shall cause legislation to
be drafted and acted upon by Cleveland City Council granting the
exemption. At such time, the Director shall forward to Council along
with the recommendation all supporting documents and other materials, including those supplied by
the applicant for the exemption, as
provided in the next section. If the
exemption
is
recommended
and
Council adopts the recommendation
before the Service or Assistance contract is entered into, the legislation
authorizing
such
contract
shall
include a provision granting the
exemption.
(3) Contents of Exemption Request
(A) Hardship Exemption requests
shall include:
(i) the lower wage to be paid by
the Covered Employer;
(ii) a detailed explanation of how
the payment of the Fair Employment Wage will cause particular
harm; and
(iii) supporting financial statements and/or other documents.
Section 189.07 Evaluation
After a three (3) year period from

City Council, and the FEWB shall

evaluation and the scope of the evaluation. After one (1) year following

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 1845-96.
By Councilman Coats.
An emergency resolution opposing passage of HR 1020/S. 1271
which could lead to the transport
by railway and highway of high
level radioactive waste from other
states through the Cleveland area,
or failing the above, to amend these
bills to provide additional provisions.
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland has been advised of
legislation pending before the U.S.
Congress,
HR
1020/S.
1271,
the
Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1995,
which could lead to the transport by
railway and highway of shipments
of high level radioactive waste from
other states through the Cleveland
area; and
Whereas, the City Council and the
appropriate City departments have
attempted to inform themselves of
the procedures to be used in these
shipments and have taken all available precautions within their power;
and
Whereas, in spite of assurances by
responsible federal and state officials that shipment procedures are
safe, there remain questions still
unanswered regarding these procedures; and
Whereas, it is clear that the shipment of nuclear waste materials
through the City of Cleveland represents an undesirable risk in the
event of a catastrophic and unpredictable railway or highway accident; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that the City of Cleveland is without sufficient emergency

An emergency resolution urging
Rite Aid Pharmacies to keep the
Rite Aid Pharmacy branch located
on East 131st Street and Miles at

The City Record
located at the East 131st Street and
Miles Avenue location will be relocating to another part of the City;

Whereas, this Rite Aid Pharmacy
branch has recently closed its prescription services, which now makes
it difficult for Ward 2 residents
especially senior citizens to obtain
their medical prescriptions, since
there are no other pharmacies in the
neighborhood providing pharmaceutical services; and
Whereas, the absence of a pharmacy in Ward 2 will require many
residents especially senior citizens
to seek other pharmacies outside
their own neighborhood in order
obtain medical prescriptions; and

life for residents in Ward 2, now,
therefore;

Section 1. That Council strongly
opposes the decision by Rite Aid
Pharmacies to relocate the Rite Aid
Pharmacy branch that is presently
located on East 131st Street and
Miles Avenue to another location

would leave Ward 2 residents without a pharmacy service.
Section 2. That Council strongly
urges Rite Aid Pharmacies to maintain a pharmacy branch in the Ward
2 area at the East 131st Street and
Miles Avenue location, in order for
residents to have their medical prescriptions filled at a pharmacy in
their own neighborhood.

transmit two certified copies of this
resolution to the Rite Aid Pharmacies Chief Executive Officer Robert
Miller.
