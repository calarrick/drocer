FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 117-2000.
By Councilman Cimperman.
An emergency resolution urging
Governor Taft to examine the application and review procedures for the
Healthy Start/Medicaid program to
determine a more streamlined and
efficient way to ensure that the children of Ohio are provided with the
proper health care insurance coverage.
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland believes that comprehensive health care insurance coverage should be available to every
resident of the City of Cleveland,
particularly children; and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
that, in order to provide proper
health care coverage to children, it
is necessary for the federal, state
and local governments to provide
and support such programs with
public funds, and that such expenditures are necessary and appropriate; and
Whereas, of the 88 counties in the
State of Ohio, Cuyahoga County is
the leader in enrolling children in
the
Healthy
Start/Medicaid
Program; and
Whereas, despite the success in
enrolling children in the Healthy
Start/Medicaid Program, many children are being denied health care
insurance coverage because of burdensome paperwork required at the
State level; and
Whereas, there may be as many
as 375,000 children that are uninsured as a result of cumbersome
application and review requirements;
and
Whereas, parents are required to
reapply for the Healthy Start/Medicaid program every six months and
may be required to submit up to six
payroll stubs for income verification; and
Whereas, while this Council recognizes the State’s need to preserve
the integrity of the program by

The City Record
requiring certain paperwork, this
Council believes that many of the
burdensome requirements can be
minimized or streamlined so that
the interests of the children that
need proper health care coverage
can be more readily served; now,
therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges Governor
Taft to examine the application and
review procedures for the Healthy
Start/Medicaid program to determine
a more streamlined and efficient
way to ensure that the children of
Ohio are provided with the proper
health care insurance coverage.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby requested to forward a copy of
this resolution to Governor Robert
Taft.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Motion to suspend rules. Charter
