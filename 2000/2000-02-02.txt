FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 144-2000.
By Councilmen Melena, White,
Robinson, Patmon, Cintron, Rybka
and Brady.
An emergency resolution expressing the support of Cleveland City
Council for the Cleveland Housing
Network Limited Partnership XVII
proposal
to
the
Ohio
Housing
Finance Agency for the use of housing tax credits.
Whereas, each year the Ohio
Housing Finance Agency allocates
housing credits to affordable housing developments throughout Ohio,
using a competitive proposal process; and
Whereas, the Cleveland Housing
Network, in partnership with its
nineteen member community development corporations (CDC’s), is proposing to develop up to 100 single
family homes; and
Whereas, 100 percent of these
homes will be made occupied by
low-income families, and no market
rate units; and
Whereas, 20 percent of these
homes will be serve a special needs
population, specifically single parent households; and
Whereas, the Cleveland City Council supports the Cleveland Housing
Network Limited Partnership XVII,
therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Clerk of Council be and she is hereby directed to
transmit two copies of this resolution to the Executive Director of the
Cleveland Housing Network.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Res. No. 145-2000.
By Councilmen Polensek, Cintron,
Dolan, O’Malley, Sweeney, Rybka,
Patmon, Gordon, White, Cimperman,
Brady, Coats, Jones and Westbrook.
An emergency resolution opposing
the proposal of the Department of
Energy
to
transport
radioactive
nuclear waste by truck and rail
through the City of Cleveland and
urging the development of an alternative proposal for disposition of
the waste.
Whereas, the Department of Energy has proposed to consolidate 77,000
tons of nuclear waste fuel from the
country’s 109 nuclear power plant
and 5 government operated defense
plants
within
Yucca
Mountain,
approximately 100 miles northwest
of Las Vegas, Nevada; and

The City Record
Whereas, in order to accommodate
this plan, the Plain Dealer has
reported that it is possible that a
truck loaded with radioactive waste
would transport this lethal cargo on
Ohio highway’s more than once a
day, every day, for 24 years; and
Whereas, a spokesperson for the
Department of Energy has stated
that shipment by a combination of
trucks and rail is possible. Nine
casks a day containing radioactive
waste would pass through Ohio by
truck and two rail casks would travel through Ohio weekly, with a
route through Cleveland approximately 90% of the time; and
Whereas, the safety, health and
security
risks
associated
with
radioactive waste are well-known
and potentially devastating; and
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland is opposed to any plan
by the federal government to regularly
transport
nuclear
waste
through our community and through
the backyards of the residents of
the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, this Council strongly
urges the Department of Energy to

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 117-2000.
By Councilman Cimperman.
An emergency resolution urging
Governor Taft to examine the application and review procedures for the
Healthy Start/Medicaid program to
determine a more streamlined and
efficient way to ensure that the children of Ohio are provided with the
proper health care insurance coverage.
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland believes that comprehensive health care insurance coverage should be available to every
resident of the City of Cleveland,
particularly children; and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
that, in order to provide proper
health care coverage to children, it
is necessary for the federal, state
and local governments to provide
and support such programs with
public funds, and that such expenditures are necessary and appropriate; and
Whereas, of the 88 counties in the
State of Ohio, Cuyahoga County is
the leader in enrolling children in
the
Healthy
Start/Medicaid
Program; and
Whereas, despite the success in
enrolling children in the Healthy
Start/Medicaid Program, many children are being denied health care
insurance coverage because of burdensome paperwork required at the
State level; and
Whereas, there may be as many
as 375,000 children that are uninsured as a result of cumbersome
application and review requirements;
and
Whereas, parents are required to
reapply for the Healthy Start/Medicaid program every six months and
may be required to submit up to six
payroll stubs for income verification; and
Whereas, while this Council recognizes the State’s need to preserve
the integrity of the program by
requiring certain paperwork, this
Council believes that many of the
burdensome requirements can be
minimized or streamlined so that
the interests of the children that
need proper health care coverage
can be more readily served; now,
therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges Governor
Taft to examine the application and
review procedures for the Healthy
Start/Medicaid program to determine a more streamlined and efficient way to ensure that the children of Ohio are provided with the
proper health care insurance coverage.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby requested to forward a copy of
this resolution to Governor Robert
Taft.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force

immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted January 24, 2000.
Effective January 31, 2000.

Res. No. 118-2000.
By Councilman Cintron.
An emergency resolution supporting the development and construction of affordable housing for the
elderly by Catholic Charities Facilities Corporation at the corner of
Meyer and Fulton Avenues in Ward
14.
Whereas, Catholic Charities Facilities Corporation intends to develop
and construct a 40 unit apartment
complex for the elderly at the southwest corner of Meyer and Fulton
Avenues in Ward 14; and
Whereas, the project will be of
great benefit to the residents of the
City of Cleveland, and particularly
the residents of Ward 14, by providing affordable housing for its
senior citizens; and
Whereas, this project is part of
the comprehensive plan developed
by Catholic Charities Facilities Corporation to locate
and develop
affordable housing for those in
need throughout the area; now,
therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland supports, applauds
and greatly appreciates the efforts
of Catholic Charities Facilities Corporation to provide affordable housing for senior citizens of the City of
Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to transmit
a copy of this resolution to Bishop
Anthony Pilla and the Director of
Catholic Charities Facilities Corporation.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted January 24, 2000.
Effective January 31, 2000.

Res. No. 119-2000.
By Councilman Lewis.

February 2, 2000

Ord. No. 2175-99.
By Councilmen Johnson, Britt,
Melena, Cimperman and Patmon (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Economic Development to enter into agreements
with Shaker Square of Ohio, LLC,
the Board of Education of the
Shaker Heights City School District,
and the Board of Commissioners of
Cuyahoga County to provide tax
increment financing to partially
finance certain improvements as
part of the Shaker Square Commercial District redevelopment project
and to provide for payments to the
Shaker Heights City School District,
and to declare certain improvements
to real property to be a public purpose.
Whereas, by Ordinance No. 2174-99,
passed January 10, 2000, this Council designated the Shaker Square
Redevelopment Area (“Area”) and
approved the Shaker Square Commercial District Area Urban Redevelopment Plan (“Plan”); and
Whereas,
pursuant
to
Section
5709.41 of the Ohio Revised Code,
improvements to real property within the Area and consistent with the
Plan, may be declared to be a public purpose where fee title to such
real property was, at one time, held
by the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, pursuant to the authority of Ordinance No. 2176-99, passed
January 10, 2000, the City acquired
fee title to certain real property
within the Area, which is more particularly described in the documents
set forth in the file described in Section 1 of this ordinance (the “Real
Property”) prior to adoption of this
Ordinance; and
Whereas,
pursuant
to
Section
5709.41 of the Ohio Revised Code,
such improvements so declared to be
a public purpose may be exempt
from real property taxation; and
Whereas,
pursuant
to
Section
5709.42 of the Ohio Revised Code, the
owners of such improvements may
be required to make annual service
payments in lieu of taxes that
would have been paid had such
improvements not been exempt; and
Whereas, pursuant to Sections
5709.40 and 5709.41 of the Ohio Revised Code, said exemption may
exceed 75% of such improvements
for up to 30 years with the approval
of the board of education of the
school district within the territory
of which the improvements are or
will be located; and
Whereas, the Shaker Heights City
School District, pursuant to Resolution No. 99-12-225, dated December 1,
1999, approved the 100% real property tax exemptions for thirty (30)
years to be authorized by the Cleveland City Council in this ordinance

121

35
with respect to the real property
improvements to be made on the
parcels located in the portion of the
Project located within the Shaker
Heights City School District, such
approval being subject to the condition that a TIF Agreement be
entered into with the City of Cleveland incorporating the substance of
the terms included in the Cleveland
proposal referred to in the Resolution; and
Whereas, the Shaker Heights City
School District waived all notice
requirements under Ohio Revised
Code Sections 5709.40, 5709.41, and
5709.83, or any other law, with
respect to all of the aforesaid real
property tax exemptions and the
City of Cleveland TIF ordinances;
and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure in that
the same provides for the immediate
preservation of the public peace,
safety, property, and welfare, and
for the further reason that designation of the Area and approval of the
Plan will stimulate the creation and
preservation of job opportunities
and advance and promote commercial and economic development in
the Area; now, therefore,
