pedestrian retail area restrictions.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore;
Be it ordained by the Council of

Section 1. That Section 341.07 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as enacted by Ordinance No. 527-2000, passed April 17,
2000, is hereby amended to read as
follows:
Section 341.07 Pedestrian Retail
Area Restrictions
(a) Purpose. The regulations of
this
section
are
established
to
achieve, among others, the following
purposes.
(1) ensuring the continued economic viability of retail corridors
that depend on the patronage of customers who seek a shopping environment that is convenient and comfortable for pedestrians;
(2) enhancing the vitality of
downtown streets, thereby strengthening the district’s attractiveness as
a location for residences, offices and
tourism;
(3) increasing the marketability
of housing located on upper floors
of historic buildings in the district;
(4) providing necessary retail services to downtown residents and
office workers;
(5) reducing traffic congestion by
allowing downtown residents and
employees to patronize retail businesses by walking rather than by
traveling in automobiles or other
vehicles;
(6) furthering economic development in the City of Cleveland and

May 10, 2000
providing additional employment for
City residents.
(b) Applicability. The regulations
of this section shall apply to the
ground floor or “street-level floor
area” of any property located both in
the Public Land Protective District
and in a Retail Business District on
a
“pedestrian-oriented
shopping
street,” as defined herein. No use in
such location shall be established or
changed except in accordance with
the provisions of this section.
(c) Pedestrian-Oriented Shopping
Street. A “pedestrian oriented shopping street” is any side of any block
of a street characterized by a predominance of retail businesses situated at or near the public sidewalk.
The City Planning Commission shall
prepare and adopt a map designating pedestrian-oriented streets within the area to which the regulations
of this section apply. The Planning
Commission shall review and update
that map periodically. The Planning
Commission shall also consider for
designation as a pedestrian-oriented
shopping street any block that is
designated for retail use in the
adopted general plan for the development and improvement of the
City, regardless of the current uses
located on that block.
(d) Referral by Division of Build ing and Housing. The Division of
Building and Housing shall refer to
the City Planning Commission any
application
for
establishment
or
change of a ground floor use in a
building located both in the Public
Land Protective District and in a
Retail Business District.
(e) Planning Commission Deter mination. Upon receipt of an application to establish a new street-level
use in a location subject to the provisions of this section, the City Planning Commission shall determine
whether the space is located on a
pedestrian-oriented
street
and
whether the proposed use is permitted by the regulations of this section. The Commission shall make its
determination within thirty (30)
days of receipt of a complete application,
unless
the
applicant
approves an extension of time.
(f) Prohibited Uses. Street-level
floor area in a building located on a
pedestrian-oriented shopping street,
as determined by the City Planning
Commission in accordance with the
provisions of this section, shall not
be occupied principally for purposes
of storage or warehousing or operation of telecommunications devices,
telephone switching equipment or
other automated or remotely controlled machinery or equipment.
(g) Facade and Window Treat ment. If any uses prohibited in
street-level areas are proposed for
upper floors in buildings subject to
the provisions of this section, the
City Planning Commission or, if
applicable, the Landmarks Commission during its review shall ensure
that the entire facade and window
areas are treated in a manner that
does not convey the appearance of
a space used for storage or warehousing purposes, but rather conveys the appearance of a space used
actively by employees, customers or
residents.
(h) Nonconforming Uses. Legallyestablished uses made nonconforming by the initial adoption of this
section may continue but may not
be expanded or otherwise changed

The City Record
so as to create a greater degree of
nonconformity, unless approved by
the Board of Zoning Appeals in
accordance with Chapter 359.
(i) For any use subject to the regulations of this section, no exhaust
vents (including, without limitation,
any exhaust vents serving any
diesel or other powered emergency
generator) shall be placed along the
designated pedestrian-oriented shopping street on the first floor, second
floor or in the sidewalk area.
(j) Exceptions. Notwithstanding
the variance powers outlined in
Section 329.03, the Board of Zoning
Appeals may vary or modify the
application of these provisions in
harmony with the general purpose
and intent of the Zoning Code so
that
the
public
health,
safety,
morals and general welfare may be
safeguarded and substantial justice
done. The decision to vary or modify the application of these provisions shall consider the following
factors: (1) the proximity of the
proposed use to the pedestrian-oriented street frontage, in the case
of a use that will occupy only a
portion of the street-level floor
space; (2) the physical size, shape
or
other
characteristics
of
the
premises; and (3) whether refusal
of the variance appealed for will
deprive the owner of substantial
property rights.
Section 2. That Section 341.07 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as enacted by Ordinance No. 527-2000, passed April 17,
2000, is hereby repealed.
Section 3. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it

Res. No. 276-2000.
By Councilman Coats.
An emergency resolution urging
the President and United States
Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater to take the necessary
actions to permit United Parcel Service to conduct cargo business in
China.
Whereas, United Parcel Service
(UPS) is a fiscally sound, well-run
company,
being
recently
named
Forbes Magazine’s Company of the
Year for 1999; and
Whereas, in 1999, UPS was also
recognized by Fortune Magazine as
one of America’s 50 Best Companies
for Asians, Hispanics and African
Americans; and
Whereas, because of certain governmental restrictions, UPS has been
prohibited
from
conducting
air
cargo business from the United
States to China; and
Whereas, the U.S. Department of
Transportation will designate only
one new market entrant to serve
China later this year; and
Whereas, it is beneficial for the
citizens of the United States to
encourage trade and unfettered business operations, thereby promoting
economic strength and diplomatic
relationships; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland urges the President and U.S. Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater to take the
necessary actions to permit United
Parcel Service to conduct air cargo
business in China.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to forward a
copy of this resolution to President
Clinton and Secretary Slater.

Res. No. 669-2000.
By Councilmen Cintron, Patmon

An emergency resolution requesting certain MBE/FBE participation
information from LTV Steel Company, the Department of Economic
Development and the Office of Equal
Opportunity.
Whereas, pursuant to Ordinance
No. 1742-88, passed July 14, 1988 and

41
respectively, to provide for 10 year
tax abatements for certain tangible
personal property as an incentive to
modernize and improve its Cleveland Works Steel Facility; and
Whereas, because of the magnitude of the projects, LTV proposed
to complete the projects in successive calendar years, and as such, the
parties agreed that the tax abatements would commence at the outset of a number of different 10 year
exemption periods; and
Whereas, LTV Steel Company, Inc.
is still receiving the benefit of the
tax abatements granted in 1988; and
Whereas, as a condition of the
granting of the 1988 and 1992 tax
abatements, LTV agreed to, among
other things, comply with certain
MBE/FBE
participation
requirements; LTV’s failure to comply with
the MBE/FBE participation requirements was to result in the imposition of a penalty payment charged
against the tax abatements, and if
necessary, the repeal of the tax
abatements; and
Whereas, this Council has information suggesting that LTV may
not be in compliance with the terms
of its agreements with the City; and
Whereas, this Council requests
that the Directors of Economic
Development
and
the
Office
of
Equal Opportunity and LTV Steel
Company provide detailed statistical
and financial information concerning the MBE and FBE participation
for each year from 1990 through the
present; and
Whereas, once the information is
provided, this Council intends to
hold hearings before the various
Committees of Council to determine
whether LTV is and has been in
compliance with its agreements;
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
requests that LTV Steel Company,
Inc., the City’s Office of Equal
Opportunity and the Department of
Economic
Development
provide
detailed statistical and financial

and FBE participation from 1990-present,
separately
identifying
the
level of participation by certified
MBE and FBE companies for each
year, as required by LTV’s Enterprise Zone Agreements with the City
of Cleveland and Chapter 187 of the
Codified Ordinance of the City of
Cleveland, 1976.
Section 2. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland intends to hold
hearings before the various Committees of Council to determine
whether LTV is and has been in
compliance with its agreement.

of Equal Opportunity.

all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
