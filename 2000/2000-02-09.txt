and actively work towards eliminating or reducing the factors that
caused the area to be designated as
a watch area. In any area designated as a watch area, the Community Relations Board may seek a
voluntary real estate solicitation
moratorium for such length of time
as appropriate, but only if such voluntary moratorium is warranted in
the opinion of the Community Relations Board by the circumstances in
a given watch area.
(b) At any time that an area is
not under a non-solicitation area
designation
pursuant
to
Section
665.17, the Community Relations
Board may cancel a watch area designation if it finds that the factors
that caused the area to be designated as a watch area have been
eliminated or reduced and that the
designation is no longer warranted.
(c) Upon each designation or cancellation of a watch area, the Community
Relations
Board
shall
promptly notify the Mayor and the
Council, in writing, and publish a
notice in the City Record or newspaper of general circulation describ-

who is licensed or required to be
licensed pursuant to Chapter 4735 of
the Revised Code shall solicit the
owner or occupant of any housing
accommodation located within a
non-solicitation area designed by the
Community Relations Board.
(b) Any area that the Community
Relations Board has designated as
a watch area may be designated as
a non-solicitation area for an initial
period of up to forty-five (45) days
upon making written findings based
on substantial evidence introduced
at a public hearing that real estate
solicitation in the area is or is likely to cause or contribute to blockbusting or panic selling. A vote of
two-thirds (2/3) of the Community
Relations Board is needed in order,
to designate an area as a non-solicitation area. In determining whether
a non-solicitation area should be
designated, the Community Relations Board shall consider the following factors, and such other factors it may deem appropriate, as
they pertain to the area under consideration:
(1) the frequency of real estate
solicitation;
(2) the content of the solicitations;
(3) the racial composition and
rate of racial changes;
(4) the frequency of home sales
and other real estate activity; and
(5) the number, severity and history of racial incidents.
(c)
The
Community
Relations
Board may extend the designation
of a non-solicitation area for one (1)
additional
consecutive
period
of
forty-five (45) days upon making
written findings based on substantial evidence that continuation of
the solicitation ban is warranted. If
an area is designated as a non-solicitation area and the designation is
extended one more time, the designation shall cease after the extension expires.
(d) The Community Relations
Board may, following a public hearing, cancel the designation of a nonsolicitation area or extension of any
such designation made pursuant to
this section.
(e) If the designation of a nonsolicitation area expires without
extension or is canceled, or if an
extension made pursuant to division
(a) of this section expires or is canceled,
the
Community
Relations
Board may, no earlier than ninety
(90) days following such expiration
or cancellation, designate the area
anew as a non-solicitation area pursuant to division (b) of this section.
(f) Upon expiration or cancellation of a designation or extension of
a non-solicitation area, the area
shall remain a watch area until the
watch area designation is canceled
by the Community Relations Board
pursuant to division (b) of Section
665.16.
(g) Upon each designation, extension or cancellation made pursuant
to this section, the Community Rela-

The City Record
tions Board shall promptly notify
the Mayor and Council in writing
and publish a notice in the City
Record or newspaper of general circulation describing the boundaries
of the area by reference to streets,
census, tracts, or common landmarks. Each designation or cancellation shall take effect upon publication. The Community Relations
Board shall maintain a list of designated non-solicitation areas and
make it available to any person
upon request.

as
provided
in
Section
619.26.

18
Section 619.25 Action to Abate Nuisances
(a) Nature of action. The Director
of Law may file an action in rem to
abate any nuisance as defined by
Section 619.24. The standard of proof
shall be by a preponderance of the
evidence.
(b) Notice and opportunity to be
heard. Prior to the issuance of an
order under this section, a reasonably diligent search shall be conducted of the public records that
relate to the property that is the
subject of an abatement action to
identify the owner, lienholder, and
any other person with an ownership
interest in the property. Such persons shall be sent notice by certified
mail, return receipt requested, or
shall be personally served, and shall
be granted an opportunity to be
heard by the court.
(c) Innocent owners or lienhold ers. No abatement order shall be
issued pursuant to this section if an
owner or lienholder or other person
with an ownership interest in the
property that is the subject of an
abatement action establishes to the
court, by a preponderance of evidence after filing a motion with the
court, that the owner, lienholder or
other
person
neither
knew
nor
should have known after a reasonable inquiry that the property would
be used, or likely would be used or
involved in the commission of a
criminal offense, and further that
the owner, lienholder or other person with an ownership interest in
the property did not expressly or
impliedly consent to the use or
involvement of the property in the
violation, and that the lien or ownership interest was perfected pursuant
to law prior to the existence of the
nuisance.
(d) Family hardship. A family or
household member of the person
who is the owner of property used
to maintain a nuisance may file a
motion with the court having jurisdiction over the action to abate a
nuisance claiming that the order of
abatement and sale of the property
will create an undue hardship on
the family or household member. If
the court determines by a preponderance of the evidence that an
undue hardship would be caused to
a family or household member filing
the motion, and if the court further
finds that the moving party has not
in any previous case benefited from
a finding of family hardship relative to the property at issue, no
order of abatement shall issue. As
used in this section, “family or
household
member”
means
the
spouse, brother, sister or child of the
person who is the owner of property used to maintain a nuisance.
(e) Order of Abatement. If the existence of a nuisance is established, an
order of abatement as described in
this division shall be entered as a
part of the judgment in the case.
If the property involved in the
abatement action is a building or
other place, it shall be ordered
closed and kept closed for a period
of one (1) year, unless sooner
released by the court. The contents
and fixtures of such a building or
other place shall be given to a battered women’s shelter or similar
agency identified by the Director of
Law, if the agency desires to have
it, or if it does not, the same shall
be sold at public auction or as otherwise directed by the court, and the

The City Record
proceeds shall be distributed as provided in division (g) of this section.
If the property involved in the
abatement action is a vehicle, boat
or aircraft, the same shall be given
to a battered women’s shelter or
similar agency identified by the
Director of Law, if the agency
desires to have it, or if it does not,
the same sold at public auction or
as otherwise directed by the court,
and the proceeds shall be distributed as provided in division (g) of
this section.
The court may order any person
in charge of personally that is subject to sale under this division to
present the same at a time and
place directed by the court for the
purpose of conducting its sale. In
addition, the court may authorize
any law enforcement agency to
seize such personally.
(f) Use of closed building. Any
person who uses a building or place
ordered closed in accordance with
division (e) of this section, with
knowledge that such building or
place has been ordered closed, shall
be guilty of a misdemeanor of the
fourth degree.
(g) Sale of property, costs and
liens. Upon the sale of any furniture, fixtures, contents, vehicle, boat
or aircraft as provided in this section, the person executing the order
of the court shall, after deducting
the expenses of keeping such property and costs of such sale, pay all
liens according to their priorities
which may be established by intervention or otherwise at the hearing
or in other proceedings brought for
the purpose as being bona fide and
as having been created without the
lienor having any notice that such
property was being used or was to
be used for the maintenance of a
nuisance as herein defined, and
shall pay the balance to a battered
women’s shelter or similar agency
identified by the Director of Law.
Section 2. That it is hereby
declared that giving property that is
forfeited pursuant to Codified Ordinance Sections 619.23, 619.24 and
619.25 as enacted by this ordinance,
or the proceeds from a sale of such
property after payment of liens and
expenses, to a battered women’s
shelter or similar agency, constitutes a public purpose.
Section 3. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period

mils per kilowatt hour.
(d) At the end of each month, the
Division of Cleveland Public Power

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 144-2000.
By Councilmen Melena, White,
Robinson, Patmon, Cintron, Rybka
and Brady.
An emergency resolution expressing the support of Cleveland City
Council for the Cleveland Housing
Network Limited Partnership XVII
proposal
to
the
Ohio
Housing
Finance Agency for the use of housing tax credits.
Whereas, each year the Ohio
Housing Finance Agency allocates
housing credits to affordable housing developments throughout Ohio,
using a competitive proposal process; and
Whereas, the Cleveland Housing
Network, in partnership with its
nineteen member community development corporations (CDC’s), is proposing to develop up to 100 single
family homes; and
Whereas, 100 percent of these
homes will be made occupied by
low-income families, and no market
rate units; and
Whereas, 20 percent of these
homes will be serve a special needs
population, specifically single parent households; and
Whereas, the Cleveland City Council supports the Cleveland Housing
Network Limited Partnership XVII,
therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Clerk of Council be and she is hereby directed to
transmit two copies of this resolution to the Executive Director of the
Cleveland Housing Network.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted January 31, 2000.
Effective February 3, 2000.

Res. No. 145-2000.
By Councilmen Polensek, Cintron,
Dolan, O’Malley, Sweeney, Rybka,
Patmon, Gordon, White, Cimperman,
Brady, Coats, Jones and Westbrook.
An emergency resolution opposing
the proposal of the Department of
Energy
to
transport
radioactive
nuclear waste by truck and rail
through the City of Cleveland and
urging the development of an alternative proposal for disposition of
the waste.
Whereas, the Department of Energy has proposed to consolidate 77,000
tons of nuclear waste fuel from the
country’s 109 nuclear power plant
and 5 government operated defense
plants
within
Yucca
Mountain,
approximately 100 miles northwest
of Las Vegas, Nevada; and
Whereas, in order to accommodate
this plan, the Plain Dealer has
reported that it is possible that a
truck loaded with radioactive waste
would transport this lethal cargo on
Ohio highway’s more than once a

day, every day, for 24 years; and
Whereas, a spokesperson for the
Department of Energy has stated
that shipment by a combination of
trucks and rail is possible. Nine
casks a day containing radioactive
waste would pass through Ohio by
truck and two rail casks would travel through Ohio weekly, with a
route through Cleveland approximately 90% of the time; and
Whereas, the safety, health and
security
risks
associated
with
radioactive waste are well-known
and potentially devastating; and
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland is opposed to any plan
by the federal government to regularly
transport
nuclear
waste
through our community and through
the backyards of the residents of
the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, this Council strongly
urges the Department of Energy to
examine alternate plans for the disposition of this lethal material, so
as not to adversely jeopardize the
safety and welfare of the citizens of
Cleveland; now, therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland strongly opposes
the proposal of the Department of
Energy to transport thousands of
tons of lethal radioactive material
through Cleveland on a regular and
continuous basis and urges the federal government to develop an alternative plan for the disposition of
this nuclear waste.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby requested to transmit a copy of
this resolution to President Clinton;
Bill Richardson, U.S. Secretary of
Energy; Governor Taft; Senators
Voinovich and DeWine; and U.S.
Representatives Kucinich, LaTourette
and Brown.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted January 31, 2000.
Effective February 3, 2000.

No.
1547275,
Cleveland,
Lorain CVS Inc., DBA CVS/Pharmacy #2503, 13027 Lorain Avenue,
Cleveland, Ohio 44111; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and

174

February 9, 2000

permit is sought has not conformed

constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, safety
and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.

must be received by the Director of
