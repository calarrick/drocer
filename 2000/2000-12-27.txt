sell such property at its current
value to such other department or
office, or shall place it in the City
storerooms or warehouses until such
time as it may be needed by some
department or office of the City. If
such property is not needed or is not
suitable for the use of any department or office of the City, when so
directed by the Board of Control it
shall be sold by the Commissioner
and the proceeds of such sale shall
be turned in to the fund of the City
from which such property was paid
for. Such sale shall be posted and
advertised in every case in like
manner as are purchases in amounts
equal to the anticipated receipts
from such sales. However, in the
event the Board so directs, the Commissioner may sell such property at
public auction, to be held at a place

Commissioner
of
Purchases
and
Supplies shall, when so directed by
the Board of Control, offer to sell
such service weapon, helmet and/or

fighter or EMT/Paramedic for its
fair market value. In lieu of paying cash for the weapon, helmet,
and/or badge, such police officer,
firefighter, or EMT/Paramedic may
elect to forego all or any portion of
any uniform or uniform maintenance allowance to which he is entitled at the time of the purchase;
provided, however, that the sum of
any
cash
payment
and
the
allowances devoted to the purchase
shall equal the fair market value of
the item or items.

Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as by enacting Ordinance No. 848-83, passed

defendant’s blood, breath, urine or
other bodily substance at the time
of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the defendant’s
blood, urine, breath other bodily
substance withdrawn within two
hours of the time of the alleged violation.
When a person submits to a blood
test at the request of a police officer under RC 4511.191, only a physician, a registered nurse or a qualified technician or chemist shall
withdraw blood for the purpose of
determining its alcohol, drug, or
alcohol and drug content. This limitation does not apply to the taking
of breath or urine specimens. A
physician, a registered nurse or a
qualified technician or chemist may
refuse to withdraw blood for the

3190

December 27, 2000
purpose of determining the alcohol,
drug, or alcohol and drug content of
the blood, if in his opinion the physical welfare of the person would be
endangered by the withdrawing of
blood.
Such bodily substance shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Ohio Director
of Health by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by the
Director of health pursuant to RC
3701.143.
If there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than ten-hundredths of one percent (0.10%) by
weight of alcohol in the defendant’s
blood,
less
than
ten-hundredths
(0.10) of one gram by weight of
alcohol per 210 liters of his breath
or less than fourteen-hundredths
(0.14) of one gram by weight of
alcohol per 100 milliliters of his
urine, such fact may be considered
with other competent evidence in
determining the guilt or innocence
of the defendant. This paragraph
does not limit or affect a criminal
prosecution for a violation of division (c) of this section relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol in the
blood, breath or urine.
Upon the request of the person
who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to him, his attorney or agent,
immediately upon the completion of
the chemical test analysis.
The person tested may have a
physician, a registered nurse or a
qualified technician or chemist of
this own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests in addition to
any administered at the request of
a police officer, and shall be so
advised. The failure or inability to
obtain an additional chemical test
by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to
the chemical test or tests taken at
the request of a police officer.
Any physician, registered nurse o
qualified technician or chemist who
withdrawn blood from a person pursuant to this section, and any hospital, first-aid station or clinic at
which blood is withdrawn from a
person pursuant to this section, is
immune from criminal liability, and
from civil liability that is based
upon a claim of assault and battery
or based upon any other claim that
is not in the nature of a claim of
malpractice, for any act performed
in withdrawing blood from a person.
