center with retail floor area exceeding 150,000 square feet, excluding “outlots” with separate free-standing signs,
such sign may display the names of not more than two (2) businesses located within the center.
(2) Size. The maximum sign face area of a shopping center identification sign shall equal twenty (20) square
feet for each 10,000 square feet of gross floor area but shall not exceed 125 square feet. All shopping centers,
however, shall be permitted a sign of at least fifty (50) square feet.
(3) Other Regulations. All other regulations of this chapter applicable to identification signs shall apply to a
shopping center identification sign.
(4) Other Signs. A lot displaying a shopping center identification sign may display no other free-standing identification or business signs.
(5) Secondary Frontages and Entrances. One (1) additional shopping center identification freestanding sign and
one (1) additional shopping center identification wall sign shall be permitted for a shopping center with more
than one vehicular entrance, provided that such signs meet the requirements of division (b) of Section 350.20.
(6) Outlots. If a vehicular entrance or parking lot of a shopping center also serves a use located on a separate lot (i.e., “out lot”), the free-standing identification or business sign permitted for such lot shall be limited
to a maximum of twenty-five (25) square feet in area and seven (7) feet in height.
(7) Design Review. No sign identifying a shopping center or identifying two (2) or more businesses within a
shopping center and no permanent identification sign of any type located within a designated Shopping Center
District shall be erected or altered in appearance without the approval of the City Planning Commission or its
Director. In considering such approval, the Commission shall seek to ensure that the signs demonstrate a high
degree of graphic and architectural quality, legibility, and design compatibility with the shopping center, its signage and nearby development.
(8) Consolidation of Free-Standing Signs. In the case of a shopping center with more than the number of signs
allowed under this Chapter, which signs were legally established prior to the effective date of this ordinance, a
new free-standing sign identifying two (2) or more businesses may be erected if the following conditions are met:
A. the new multi-tenant sign shall display the name of the shopping center and tenant names no greater in
number than the tenant names currently displayed on free-standing signs in the shopping center, but in no case

B. all other free-standing business identification signs on the shopping center property shall be removed prior
to erection of the new sign, except that conforming signs permitted for outlots may be retained;
C. the sign does not, exceed twelve (12) feet in height;
D. the council member whose ward is affected approves, as expressed by an ordinance or resolution of Council.
(e) Gasoline Service Stations. Signs for gasoline service stations shall conform with all regulations of this chapter except for the maximum sign area regulations of division (a) of Section 350.14 and any regulations which
directly conflict with the regulations stated below:
(1) Free-standing Business Sign. Each station shall be permitted one (1) permanent free-standing business signs,
with total sign face area of the panel or panels not exceeding one hundred (100) square feet. Such sign shall be
limited to identifying the company name, management, fuel prices, and services offered.
(2) Signs at Service Islands. Stations shall be permitted information signs at fuel or other service islands which
display information regarding type of service or are necessary in directing or instructing the motorist who has
entered the station area. Signs not extending beyond the edges of fuel pumps are permitted and shall not be
counted as business identification signs.
(3) Wall and Canopy Signs. Each station shall be permitted permanent identifications, business, directional and
information signs displayed as wall or canopy signs and not exceeding one hundred (100) square feet in combined area. Non-opaque internally-illuminated canopy surfaces (“fascia”) shall be considered as sign panels for
purposes of sign area measurement.
(4) Temporary Signs. Temporary signs shall be permitted in accordance with the regulations of Section 350.12.
(f) Drive-Through Restaurants. For restaurants providing direct service to customers in motor vehicles, one (1)

permitted. Such sign shall not exceed forty (40) square feet in area and six (6) feet in height and shall meet
setback regulations applicable to free-standing identification signs (as specified in division (c) of this section).
(g) Regulations for Larger Projecting Signs. A projecting sign may exceed the otherwise maximum permitted
size of twelve (12) square feet and the otherwise maximum permitted projection of four (4) feet from a building wall if such sign meets the following standards:
(1) Such sign shall be set back from the closest interior side lot line and the closest tenant party wall line at
least one (1) foot for each one (1) square foot of sign area.
(2) Such sign shall in no case exceed thirty-six (36) square feet in area nor eight (8) feet in projection from
the building wall and shall be set back at least two (2) feet from the outer edge of any street curb.
(3) No Building Permit shall be issued for such sign without approval of the City Planning Commission, which
shall consider the design quality of the sign and its compatibility with the design character of the subject property and surrounding properties. In addition to considering such general design factors as placement, proportions,
color, materials, and consistency with signs to be seen as a series, the City Planning Commission may specifically
require use of non-rectangular, custom-shaped panels, exposed neon or reflected lighting, unobtrusive support structures, narrow-profile sign cabinets, or other design features necessary to ensure that a larger projecting sign will
enhance the appearance of the building on which it is placed and the district in which it is located.
(4) At least five (5) working days prior to the City Planning Commission meeting at which approval under
the regulations of this division will be considered, written notice shall be provided to the City Council member
in whose ward the proposed sign is to be located.
(h) Supplemental Regulations. Signs in Retail Districts shall also conform to regulations of Section 350.20.
Section 350.19 Nonconforming Signs and Uses

regulations, shall be deemed a legal nonconforming sign (hereinafter referred to as a “nonconforming” sign) and
shall be governed by the following regulations:
(a) Permitted Repair and Alterations. A nonconforming sign may be painted, cleaned or repaired as required
in Section 350.18 but shall not be otherwise altered, moved or replaced unless made to conform to current regulations. Such sign, however, may be altered to permit a change of message or change of face if such change does
not structurally alter the sign casing or support.

(b) Limitation on Reconstruction. A nonconforming sign or part thereof damaged or deteriorated to an extent
exceeding fifty percent (50%) of its replacement cost shall not be reconstructed or replaced unless made to conform to regulations of this Code. For a nonconforming sign damaged by a single incident (such as a storm), to
an extent less than fifty percent (50%) of its replacement cost, reconstruction is permitted only if such work is
begun within six (6) months of the incident and is completed within twelve (12) months of the incident.
(c) Discontinuance of Use. A nonconforming sign shall be removed or made to conform to regulations of this
Code if the use to which the sign refers has been discontinued for a continuous and immediately preceding period
of at least six (6) months, except as provided in division (f) of this section. In the case of a nonconforming
billboard, as defined in this chapter, such sign shall be removed or made to conform to regulations of this Code
if, for a continuous and immediately preceding period of at least twelve (12) months, the billboard has been blank
or has displayed copy which is faded or damaged so as to render it illegible or has referred to an event or activity which has ended or to a business or product or service which has been discontinued.
(d) Temporary Signs. All nonconforming temporary signs, including portable signs, shall be removed or made to
comply with the regulations of this Code within thirty (30) days after issuance of a violation notice by the City.
(e) Signs for Nonconforming Uses. For legal nonconforming uses, such as a retail use in a residential zoning district, the applicable signage regulations shall be those most appropriate to the nature of the nonconforming use.
(f) Landmark Signs. A landmark sign is one which is determined to be historically or architecturally significant
by the Landmarks Commission in accordance with the standards of divisions (a) of Section 161.04 of the Codified
Ordinances. A sign so identified by the Commission shall be exempt from the prohibitions regarding reconstruction
or retention as stated in divisions (a) and (b) of Section 350.19. Any proposed reconstruction of such sign shall be
permitted only if approved by the Landmarks Commission in accordance with its customary standards for review.
Section 350.20 Supplemental Regulations
The following supplemental regulations shall apply to permitted signs in non-residential zoning districts:
(a) Non-Ground Floor Uses. For uses not located on the ground floor and for ground floor uses which lack direct
access from the building exterior, the following signs shall be permitted in addition to signs otherwise permitted
for the building. Regardless of the number of such uses in a building, not more than one (1) wall or projecting
identification sign, a maximum of twelve (12) square feet in area, shall be placed at each ground floor entrance
providing access to the uses in question. In addition, for each such use, window signs not exceeding twenty (20)
square feet in total area shall be permitted for display on the inside surface of windows within the subject space.
(b) Secondary Frontages and Entrances.
(1) Secondary Frontages. A building or building unit with frontage on a second street or with a customer building entrance from a rear or side parking lot shall be permitted total additional wall, window, projecting and
canopy sign area not to exceed 50% of the sign area otherwise permitted. Such signs shall be displayed so that
the total sign area placed on any facade does not exceed the maximum sign area permitted for the building’s
primary frontage. This provision shall also apply to buildings or building units with secondary frontage along
the Cuyahoga River or Lake Erie and to buildings adjoining a freeway right-of-way.
(2) Secondary Entrances. For lots served by more than one (1) vehicular entrance, one (1) additional freestanding identification sign shall be permitted at each additional vehicular entrance if the minimum distance
between any two (2) such signs is five hundred (500) feet as measured along street lines. Where such distance
is less than five hundred (500) feet but more than three hundred (300) feet, a second free-standing identification
sign shall be permitted if the height of each such sign is no greater than twelve (12) feet and the combined
sign area of the two signs is no greater than one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the maximum sign area permitted for a single free-standing identification sign on the subject property.
(c) New Businesses. Upon its initial opening, a new business establishment may display a temporary identification sign for a maximum period of sixty-two (62) days prior to installation of a permanent identification sign.
Such temporary sign may be a wall, window or portable sign which shall conform with all regulations applicable to permanent signs (except clearly inapplicable structural requirements) and shall be counted as part of the
maximum permitted permanent sign area. In addition, temporary window signs for such new businesses may
cover up to 75% of window area. Strings of pennants, streamers, pinwheels, balloons and similar small lightweight objects shall be permitted for “grand openings” for a single period not exceeding seven (7) days within
the first six (6) months after issuance of the initial Occupancy Certificate for a new business.
(d) Open Lots. For uses without buildings, and for uses on lots where building frontage is less than 20% of
lot frontage, maximum sign face area for the use, including free-standing signs, shall be the greater of fifty (50)
square feet or the figure resulting from the following formula where “LW” equals the width of the lot frontage,
as defined in division (a)(2) of Section 350.05: LW x 1.0 = SQUARE FEET OF SIGNAGE. The area of a freestanding sign shall in no instance exceed one hundred (100) square feet.
(e) Major Public Assembly Facilities. For public assembly facilities located within the Central Business District and providing a minimum seating or attendance capacity of 5,000 persons, signage shall be permitted in
accordance with the following standards contained in this division (e) which recognize the unique nature of these
large-scale public assembly facilities. Except as provided in these standards, all other regulations of this Zoning
Code shall apply to such signage.
(1) Type, Number, Height and Location of Signs. The City Planning Commission may authorize variations in otherwise applicable regulations of this chapter to the extent necessary to provide adequate information to the public.
(2) Electronic Changeable Copy Signs. Information displayed through electronically changeable copy on signs
located on the premises of a qualifying public assembly facility or on property located within 500 feet of the
qualifying public assembly facility and owned or leased by the owners of said public assembly facility shall be
limited to the following:
A. identification of the facility or events held at the facility.
B. identification of the events held at other local public assembly facilities and identification of festivals and
other special events held in the City.
