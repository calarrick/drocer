ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 1333-98.

An emergency resolution urging
the adoption of laws prohibiting the
sale of alcohol near schools and
churches.
Whereas, it has been estimated
that the costs attributable to alcohol
problems in America exceed $70 billion per year; and
Whereas, according to the Department of Health and Human Services,
alcohol is implicated in nearly half
of all deaths caused by motor vehicle crashes and fatal intentional
injuries, and victims are intoxicated
in approximately one-third of all
homicides, drownings and boating
deaths; and
Whereas, the use of alcohol has
been shown to jeopardize physical,
mental and social development during the formative years and to
endanger the successful transition
from school to the workplace; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
Governor Robert Taft and the state
legislators to protect the youth of
Ohio by limiting their access and
proximity to the use of alcohol by
passing legislation prohibiting any
sale of alcohol within 500 feet of
any school or church or by passing
legislation allowing municipalities
to legislate such matters.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to transmit
a copy of this Resolution to Governor Robert Taft, Richard Finan,
President of the Ohio Senate, and
JoAnn Davidson, Speaker of the
Ohio House of Representatives, and
the Minority Leader of the Ohio Senate and House of Representatives.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted April 17, 2000.
Effective April 26, 2000.

An emergency resolution urging
the United Nations and the United

Whereas, a severe drought has
plagued many nations in Africa,
causing
a
widespread
famine
throughout east and central Africa;
and
Whereas, the United Nations has
warned that as many as 16 million
people in at least 10 countries in
Africa are at risk of starvation; and
Whereas, in Gode, Ethiopia, children have been dying at a rate of
over one dozen a day since February; and
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland is deeply concerned

The City Record
about the well-being of our African
brothers and sisters; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland urges the United
Nations and the United States federal government to immediately provide food and all other means of
assistance to the citizens of the
eastern and central African nations
who are suffering from starvation.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,

shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
