ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 337-2000.
By Councilman Cimperman.
An emergency resolution supporting the initiatives of the Tremont
Neighborhood
Opportunity
Center
and urging the Director and Board
of the Council for Economic Opportunities
of
Greater
Cleveland
(CEOGC) to begin a community
planning process to formulate a
long-term plan for the Tremont
Neighborhood Opportunity Center.
Whereas, the Tremont Neighborhood Opportunity Center and its
staff have ably served the Tremont
area and the residents of the City of
Cleveland for over thirty years; and
Whereas, the Tremont Neighborhood Opportunity Center serves hundreds of people a month in its capacity as a social services center; and
Whereas, the Tremont Neighborhood Opportunity Center not only
provides food and milk for those
hungry in our neighborhoods, it also
helps needy Cleveland residents find
jobs, housing and provides positive,
alternative activities for our City’s
youths; and
Whereas, the Tremont Neighborhood Opportunity Center is a leader
in its outreach to our senior citizens
residing throughout the west side of
Cleveland; and
Whereas, the Tremont Neighborhood Opportunity Center is a strong
advocate and trendsetter in the area
of childrens’ literacy, leading a public-private partnership with Tremont
schools to encourage neighborhood
tutors to read to our City’s children;
and
Whereas, while Tremont is a
neighborhood
that
has
recently
experienced tremendous growth and
revitalization, residents and community leaders must be mindful that
advances may be stifled with the
onset of welfare reform; as such, the
role
of
organizations
like
the
Tremont Neighborhood Opportunity
Center become more vital to stability of the neighborhood; and
Whereas, it is imperative for the
well-being of Tremont, and other
similar neighborhoods, that organizations such as the Tremont Neighborhood Opportunity Center remain
located in and accessible to the residents which they serve; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland supports the initiatives of the Tremont Neighborhood Opportunity Center and urges
the Director and Board of the Council for Economic Opportunities of
Greater
Cleveland
(CEOGC)
to
begin a community planning process
to formulate a long-term plan for
the
Tremont
Neighborhood
Opportunity Center, with such planning process to include residents of
the neighborhood, businesses, social
services agencies, local clergy and
elected officials.
Section 2. That this Council urges
the Tremont Neighborhood Opportunity Center to remain in its current
facility until a long-term plan is
determined.
Section 3. That the Clerk is hereby requested to transmit a copy of
this resolution to Jackie Middleton,
Director of the CEOGC.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives

The City Record
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted March 6, 2000.
Effective March 11, 2000.

Res. No. 338-2000.
By Councilman Cimperman.
An emergency resolution urging

Protection Agencies to review the
comments submitted by the St. Clair
Superior Neighborhood Development
Association
concerning
the
CEI
Lakeshore Plant and Day-Glo Color
Corporation and to promptly address
those concerns during the permit
review process.
Whereas, the St. Clair Superior
Neighborhood Development Association Environmental Committee has
been challenging the “Title V” air
pollution permit renewal for the CEI
Lakeshore Plant and Day-Glo Color
Corporation, contending that they
may be emitting hazardous air pollutants, and
Whereas, Title V of the 1990 Clean
Air Act calls for community involvement in the permitting process, particularly during the federally mandated
“comment
period,”
during
which a preliminary “draft permit”
is drawn up by the state Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
and is mada available for public
comment; and
Whereas, the St. Clair Superior
Neighborhood Development Association has submitted, both orally and
in writing, to the U.S. and Ohio
EPAs concerning the CEI Lakeshor
Plant and Day-Glo Color Corporation; and
Whereas, the St. Clair Superior
Neighborhood Development Association has requested that these cases
be examined to determine whether
there
are
environmental
justice
issues in accordance with Executive
Order No. 12898, issued by President
Clinton on February 11, 1994; and
Whereas, the St. Clair Superior
Neighborhood Development Association has requested that all records,
logs and other documents required
to be maintained in accordance with
the permits be made available permanently and locally for review by
the community within a reasonable
time frame and that the documents
be provided at no cost; and
Whereas, the residents of the City
of Cleveand should be provided with
the opportunity to live in a neighborhood free of injurious environmental contaminants; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland urges the U.S. and
Ohio
Environmental
Protection
Agencies to review the comments
submitted by the St. Clair Superior
Neighborhood Development Association and to promptly and thoroughly address those concerns during the
permit review process.
Section 2. That this Council urges
representatives of the U.S. and Ohio
EPAs to meet with representatives
of the St. Clair Superior Neighborhood Development Association to
carefully consider the concerns and
fears of the residents of the neighborhood and to respond to those
concerns.

hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives

Res. No. 339-2000.
By Councilmen Cimperman, Rybka,
Brady, Britt, Cintron, Coats, Dolan,
Gordon, Jackson, Johnson, Jones,
Lewis, Melena, O’Malley, Patmon,
Polensek, Robinson, Sweeney, Westbrook, White and Willis.
An emergency resolution opposing
the decision to close St. Michael Hospital and urging the federal government to conduct an investigation
into the recent rash of hospital closures in Cleveland; and urging that
the City join a lawsuit compelling
that St. Michael remain open.
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland is deeply concerned
about the recent announcement concerning the closing of St. Michael
Hospital, located in the heart of the
City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, this announced closure
comes on the heels of the closure of
Mt. Sinai Hospital and the announcement by MetroHealth Medical
Center that it intends to terminate
its agreements with Medicaid HMO
providers, negatively impacting over
30,000 residents of the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, the impact of the closure
of St. Michael’s is devasting to the
north and south Broadway communities, to the southeast region of our
City, as well as to the entire City of
Cleveland and Cuyahoga County; and
Whereas, this Council is especially disturbed that, at a time in which
our national and local economies are
booming, and at a time when there
is over $493 million dollars in new
hospital construction underway in
the Greater Cleveland area, and at
a time when institutions such as the
Cleveland Clinic are opening new
facilities in Florida, that our own
health community deems it appropriate to discontinue health care to
Cleveland residents; and
Whereas, with the closure of St.
Michael’s, over 400 jobs will be lost,
over 200 beds will become unavailable to serve the needs of our city,
and another emergency room will
shut its doors to the residents of the
inner city; and
Whereas, this Council finds it
especially troubling that our own
Cleveland Clinic, which at any time
provides care to foreign royalty and
various heads of state and other
high paying patients from abroad,
has deemed community health care
in Cleveland to be of little or no
value; and
Whereas, this Council is greatly
concerned about the quality and
accessibility of health care available to serve the needs of the residents of the City of Cleveland; now,
therefore,

40
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland strongly opposes
the decision to close St. Michael Hospital and urges that such decision
be reconsidered for the benefit of
the residents of the City and Greater
Cleveland community.
Section 2. That this Council urges
President Clinton, Attorney General
Janet Reno and Secretary of Health
and Human Services Donna Shalala
to conduct an investigation in to the
closures of hospitals in Cleveland.
Section 3. That this Council wishes to acknowlege the efforts of Congressman Dennis Kucinich for his
assistance and attention to this matter and to thank him for working
for the benefit of the citizens of
Cleveland.
Section 4. That this Council will
hold a public hearing on the issue
of hospital closures and the detrimental impact on the health care of
the residents of the City at 9:30 a.m.
on Friday, March 10, 2000.
Section 5. That this Council urges
that the City join in the proposed
lawsuit and/or injunction to keep
St. Michael Hospital open.
Section 6. That the Cleveland Clinic and PHS work together with our
residents,
Cleveland’s
community
development organizations, the St.
Michael Community Board, and the
Council of the City of Cleveland to
provide a proper standard of health
care that is accessible to all residents in the City of Cleveland.
Section 7. That the Clerk is hereby requested to transmit a copy of
this resolution to President Clinton,
Attorney General Janet Reno and
Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala, Congressman
Dennis Kucinich and the President
of the Cleveland Clinic and PHS.
Section 8. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted March 6, 2000.
Effective March 11, 2000, without
the signature of the Mayor.
