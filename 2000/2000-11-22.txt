and
Whereas, the risks and dangers

of
Cleveland,
Inc.

The term of the Lease shall be for

Lessee to extend the term of the
Lease for two (2) additional fiveyear periods (the “First Extended

to extend the term of the Lease,
Lessee shall, at least one hundred

The credits against rent shall be

Notwithstanding rent credits issued
by the City, Lessee shall pay to the
City a minimum annual guaranteed
rent of $7,500 during the Initial
Term. Any rent credits not applied

Section 2. That the Lease authorized herein shall contain the following provision:
The City reserves the right to

that City Council, by ordinance,
determines that such recapture of
the leased Premises or any portion

purposes. In the event of such recapture as described in this paragraph,
the Lessee shall not be entitled to a
credit, reimbursement, payment, or
any other type of compensation for
termination of the Lease and recapture of the Premises. Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, if the
City shall recapture the leased
Premises within the first five (5)
years of the Initial Term, Lessee
shall be entitled to compensation
equal to: (a) any unamortized facility investment cost; and/or (b) any
amortized rent credits approved by
the Director and not received by
Lessee. In the event of recapture,
the City shall work cooperatively
with Lessee to find a suitable location at which Lessee may operate,
under such terms and conditions as
may be mutually agreed to by the
City and Lessee.
Section 3. That the Lease authorized herein shall be prepared by
the Director of Law and shall contain such other terms and conditions

An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting
new Chapter 154 relating to creation
of the City Audit Committee.
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland concurs with the following statement of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board
(GASB) concerning the objective of
financial reporting: “Accountability
requires government to answer to
the citizenry, to justify the raising
of public resources and the purposes for which they are used. Governmental accountability is based on
the belief that the citizenry has a
‘right to know’, a right to receive
openly disclosed facts that may lead
to public debate by the citizens and
their elected representatives. Financial reporting plays a major role in
fulfilling government’s duty to be
publicly accountable in a democratic society;” and
Whereas, the Government Finance
Officers Association encourages the
government’s use of audit committees to ensure the integrity of the
audit process and to increase the

The City Record
level of confidence in the financial
reporting process; and

of Ohio recommends audit committees for all government subdivisions
in the State; and
Whereas, by letter dated September 27, 2000 to Mayor Michael R.

Michael D. Polensek, the State Auditor recommended the formation of
an audit committee in the City of
Cleveland comprised of members of
Cleveland City Council and the
Administration with the purpose of
such committee to become the focal
point between the City and its auditors; and
Whereas, in adhering to the recommendation of the State Auditor
and in order to monitor the effectiveness and efficiency of operations; to monitor the reliability of
financial reporting; and to ensure
compliance with applicable laws
and regulations, the Council of the
City of Cleveland seeks to form the
City Audit Committee; and

a municipal department to ensure
the fiscal responsibility of the City
of Cleveland; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
