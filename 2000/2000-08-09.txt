August 7, 2000
To The Honorable President and
Members of Cleveland City Council:
This correspondence in concerning
the report of the Mayor’s Appointment Committee on the Mayor’s
Appointments to the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority.
We have before us the Mayor’s
letter dated June 5, 2000 wherein he
recommends the appointment of Mr.
Daniel Clark to the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority.
Please note, that after careful consideration, the Mayor’s Appointment
Committee recommended the disapproval of the appointment of Mr.
Clark on May 22, 2000. The Council
of the City of Cleveland voted unanimously to disapprove the appointment of Mr. Clark on May 22, 2000.
While
the
Mayor’s
Appointment
Committee contends that the May
22nd disapproval of Mr. Clark was
suffient to warrant his removal
from the Board and that a subsequent disapproval is not necessary,
the Committee nevertheless again
recommends the disapproval of the
appointment of Mr. Daniel Clark to
the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port
Authority Board.
Members, Mayor’s Appointment
Committee,

Without objection, that the letter
dated August 7, 2000 from the

An emergency resolution urging
the federal government to require
labeling of genetically manipulated
foods and further urging a moratorium on the production of such foods
until acceptable testing systems are
in place.
Whereas, genetically engineered
foods have not yet been proven safe
and are not tested by any federal
agency; and
Whereas, the Food and Drug
Administration requires only that
companies producing such genetically engineered foods state, on the
“honor system”, that such foods are
safe with no further testing required, and
Whereas, a class action lawsuit
has been brought against the Food
and Drug Administration to prevent
it from continuing to rush such
untested foods on the market; and
Whereas, numerous bioengineers
and scientists have stated that the
technology
of
genetically
engineered foods is clearly different
from traditional methods and could
lead to a host of undesirable health
and environmental problems; and
Whereas, such technology further
has potential negative effects in
genetic cross-pollination of beneficial plants, insects and other fragile
ecosystems;

Res. No. 1320-2000.
By Councilmen Brady, Polensek,
Gordon, Jones and Cintron.
An emergency resolution supporting the Cleveland AFL-CIO’s call for
a
publically
financed
non-profit
national health care insurance plan.
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland believes that all citizens, those with and without financial means, should have access to
affordable, quality health care as
evidenced by its participation in the
fight to save St. Michael Hospital;
and
Whereas, by numerous resolutions
concerning health care, this Council
has
advocated
and
encouraged
health care providers, insurance
companies and employers to be cognizant of the need to provide health
care for all members of our community; and
Whereas, it is estimated that 45
million Americans have no health
care insurance and 58% of the uninsured work full time; and
Whereas, the infant mortality rate
in the U.S. is higher and the life
expectancy rate is lower than every
other advanced nation; and
Whereas, the Cleveland AFL-CIO
Federation of Labor unanimously
adopted a resolution supporting a
non-profit
national
health
care
insurance plan which is publically
financed and guarantees comprehensive and lifetime coverage for
all; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the

the position of the Cleveland AFLCIO Federation of Labor in calling
for a non-profit national health care
insurance plan which is publically

this resolution to President Clinton,
Vice-President Gore, and John Ryan,
