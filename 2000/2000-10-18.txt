The Honorable Michael D. Polensek

601 Lakeside Avenue
Cleveland, Ohio 44114
Dear Council President Polensek:
On April 20 of this year I submitted
to Council five outstanding candidates for the City’s new Air Pollution Advisory Committee. In a follow up letter dated June 22, I again
urged Council to act expeditiously
on these nominations in order to
take advantage of the City’s many
positive steps toward solving our air
pollution issues.
I am now given to understand that
your staff may have misplaced our
original
nomination
letter
and
accompanying resumes. At this time
I am resubmitting my nomination of
Chris Trepal, James A. Haviland,
Mark W. Pestak, Muqit Sabur, and
Kyle Dreyfuss-Wells, along with
copies of their resumes, to Council
for its consideration. I also urge
Council to quickly name its two
appointments so that the Committee
members may begin to meet.
Sincerely,

MOTION
On the motion of Councilman
Rybka, the reading of the minutes
of the last meeting was dispensed
with and the journal approved. Seconded by Councilman Cintron.

Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to

Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard

state; and

permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body

permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section

Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of

and
Whereas, the Corridor Management Plan has been submitted to the

Plan; and
5. provides no additional regulations for land use and/or zoning;
and
6. adds to the quality of life of
Northeast Ohio through support of
educational,
cultural,
community
and

programs; and
Whereas, the National Heritage

and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the

since preservation of the waterway
is in the best interest of our citizens; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
