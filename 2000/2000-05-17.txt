Interest Payment, if any, and the
costs of issuance of the Series 2000
Bonds
and
any
other
required
deposits to Special Funds attributable to Series 2000 Bonds issued for
that purpose), for the financing of
which this Governing Body determines that there is a substantial
need (Series 2000 Bonds issued for
that
purpose
being
hereinafter
referred to as “Series 2000 Project
Bonds”), and (ii) refunding (including, without limitation, paying the
costs of issuance of the Series 2000
Bonds
and
any
other
required
deposits to Special Funds attributable to Series 2000 Bonds issued for

determines, based on the written
advice of the Issuer’s Financial
Advisor, would, if refunded with
proceeds of the Series 2000 Bonds or

the purpose, be advantageous to the
Issuer due to a savings in Bond service charges or restructuring of the
currently scheduled Bond service
charges or otherwise to serve the
interests of the Issuer (Series 2000
Bonds issued for that purpose being
hereinafter referred to as “Series
2000 Refunding Bonds”), this Governing Body hereby authorizes the

This Governing Body finds and
determines that the issuance of the
Series 2000 Bonds serves proper,
public, municipal purposes by providing air travel facilities needed by
the people of the City of Cleveland.
The
Series
2000
Project
also
advances the economic welfare of
the City by increasing and promoting commerce by providing necessary transportation for individuals
and
commercial
enterprises
purchasing and selling services and
products in northeastern Ohio, and
the Series 2000 Project thereby creates and preserves jobs and employment opportunities in the City and
improves the economic welfare of
the City.
Section 3. Award and Sale of the
Series 2000 Bonds.
The
Fiscal
Officer
is
hereby
authorized and directed promptly to
negotiate the sale of the Series 2000
Bonds to the Original Purchasers
designated in Section 9 hereof on
terms consistent with this Series
2000 Bond Legislation. The Fiscal
Officer is hereby further authorized
and directed to execute and deliver
the Series 2000 Certificate of Award,
which
shall:
state
whether
the
Series 2000 Bonds shall be issued for
the purpose of refunding any outstanding Revenue Bonds; determine
whether any Series 2000 Bonds shall
be issued as Variable Rate Series
2000 Bonds and, if so, make the
other determinations with respect to
the Series 2000 Variable Rate Bonds
required to made by the penultimate
paragraph of this Section 3 for
Series 2000 Variable Rate Bonds;
and determine whether a book entry
system shall be used for the Series
2000 Bonds. The Series 2000 Certifi-

The City Record
cate of Award shall also specify and
designate the other details of the
Series 2000 Bonds required or permitted to be specified and designated therein in accordance with and
subject to the limitations set forth
in the Series 2000 Bond Legislation,
including, without limitation, the
following:
(a)(i) the aggregate principal
amount of the Series 2000 Project
Bonds, provided that such amount
shall not exceed Six Hundred Seventy
Five
Million
Dollars
($675,000,000) if the Series 2000 Project Bonds are to be initially offered
to the public at a price at least
equal
to
one
hundred
percent
(100%) of their aggregate principal
amount, but if any of the Series 2000
Project Bonds is to be initially
offered to the public at an original
issue discount (any such original
issue discount being hereinafter
referred to as an “Original Issue
Discount”),
then
the
maximum
aggregate principal amount of the
Series 2000 Project Bonds hereby
authorized shall be increased over
Six Hundred Seventy Five Million
Dollars ($675,000,000) by an amount
equal to the sum of the products
from multiplying the Original Issue
Discount at which each Series 2000
Project Bond to be sold with an
Original Issue Discount is to be initially offered to the public by the
principal amount of the Series 2000
Bond to be so offered;
(ii)
the
aggregate
principal
amount of the Series 2000 Refunding
Bonds, if any, provided that such
amount shall not exceed SeventyFive Million Dollars ($75,000,000),
which amount may be adjusted to
reflect any Original Issue Discount
for the Series 2000 Refunding Bonds
as is provided in (a)(i) above for
the Series 2000 Project Bonds;
(b) the date or dates of the Series
2000 Bonds;
(c) the Purchase Price;
(d) the Earliest Optional Redemption Date;
(e) the Redemption Prices;
(f) the Principal Retirement Dates;
(g) the Term Maturity Dates;
(h) the
Mandatory
Redemption
Dates;
(i) the
Principal
Retirement
Schedule, including the amount of
any
mandatory
sinking
fund
requirement to be paid on any
Mandatory Redemption Date;
(j) the Specified Interest Rates
for any Series 2000 Bonds that are
not Series 2000 Variable Rate Bonds;
(k) the Capitalized Interest Payment, if any, including any interest
accrued on the Series 2000 Bonds
from their dated date to the date of
the delivery thereof and payment
therefor;
(l) the Renewal and Replacement
Payment attributable to the Series
2000 Bonds;
(m) the Paying Agent;
(n) the amount of proceeds of the
sale of the Series 2000 Bonds to be
deposited
in
the
Bond
Service
Reserve Fund in order to cause the
balance
therein
to
equal
the
Required Bond Service Reserve, if
and to the extent required by the
Fourth Supplemental Indenture, and
any determination of the Fiscal Officer under Section 4 of this Series
2000 Bond Legislation as to whether
there shall be an alternative special
reserve fund for the Series 2000
Bonds of any series, separate from
the Bond Service Reserve Fund, or
a municipal bond insurance policy,
bank letter or line of credit, or other
form of credit or liquidity facility

981

13
enhancing
the
security
for
the
Series 2000 Bonds of that series in
lieu of a funded reserve fund; and
(o) the determination of the Fiscal Officer pursuant to Section 9 of
this Series 2000 Bond Legislation as
to whether any Series 2000 Bonds of
any series are to be secured by or
payable from a municipal bond
insurance policy, bank letter or line
of credit, or other form of credit or
liquidity facility.
The Series 2000 Certificate of
Award may also specify that the
Series 2000 Bonds may be issued in
one or more separate series, each
bearing a distinctive designation,
provided that the Series 2000 Bonds
of all such series satisfy the requirements of the Indenture and of this
Series 2000 Bond Legislation as
though all such Bonds were of the
same, single series. Separate series
of Series 2000 Bonds may be issued
at the same or different times, and
if separate series of Series 2000
Bonds are issued at different times,
a separate Series 2000 Certificate of
Award may be executed for each
series. If the Series 2000 Bonds
include both Series 2000 Project
Bonds and Series 2000 Refunding
Bonds but are not identified as such
through different series designations, then the limitations set forth
in (a)(i) and (a)(ii) above shall be
applied to the Series 2000 Bonds
allocated between those purposes on
a fair and reasonable basis.
In the event that the Fiscal Officer determines, based on the written
advice of the Issuer’s Financial
Advisor, that the Issuer’s best interests will be served by causing all or
a portion of the Series 2000 Bonds
to be Series 2000 Variable Rate
Bonds, then the Fiscal Officer is
authorized to cause such Series 2000
Bonds to be Series 2000 Variable
Rate Bonds by so specifying in the
Series 2000 Certificate of Award. If
the Fiscal Officer so determines,
then, in accordance with Section
3.02(c) of the First Supplemental
Indenture, the Fourth Supplemental
Indenture shall specify the method
and procedure by which the rate of
interest to be borne by the Series
2000 Variable Rate Bonds shall be
determined, provided that the Series
2000 Variable Rate Bonds shall not
bear interest at a rate in excess of
fourteen percent (14%). The preceding sentence shall not be deemed to
prohibit the inclusion in the Reimbursement Agreement with the Credit Provider of any liquidity facility
for the Series 2000 Variable Rate
Bonds of any provision that would
entitle the Credit Provider to additional interest during any period
when Series 2000 Variable Rate
Bonds
are
held
by
the
Credit
Provider as pledged bonds under
that
Reimbursement
Agreement.
The Fourth Supplemental Indenture
may also provide for the right of the
holders of Series 2000 Variable Rate
Bonds to tender their Series 2000
Variable Rate Bonds for purchase
by the Issuer at the times, on the
terms, and subject to the conditions
set forth therein, provided that such
tender rights shall be exercisable
only at such times as a credit or liquidity facility is in place that provides for the payment of the purchase price payable to the tendering
holder of a Series 2000 Variable
Rate Bond. If the Fiscal Officer designates any Series 2000 Bonds as
Series 2000 Variable Rate Bonds,
then the Fiscal Officer shall also
designate in the Series 2000 Certificate of Award the Credit Provider

14
or Credit Providers for any credit or
liquidity facility or facilities to
apply to the Series 2000 Variable
Rate Bonds, and the remarketing
agent or agents for tendered Series
2000 Variable Rate Bonds (if the
holders of the Series 2000 Variable
Rate Bonds are to be entitled or
required to tender the Series 2000
Variable Rate Bonds for purchase),
which designations shall be based
on the written advice of the Issuer’s
Financial Advisor that the parties
so designated possess the requisite
resources and experience to provide
the services required of them and
that the terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide
such services are fair and commercially reasonable.
It is hereby determined that the
Purchase Price, the Specified Interest Rates, and the other terms and
details of the Series 2000 Bonds as
so specified and determined in the
Series 2000 Certificate of Award
within the limitations set forth in
the Series 2000 Bond Legislation
will be in the best interest of the
Issuer and consistent with all legal
requirements.
Section 4. Application of Proceeds
of Series 2000 Bonds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Series 2000 Bonds shall be deposited
as follows:
(i) to the Bond Service Fund, that
portion, if any, of such proceeds constituting the Capitalized Interest
Payment;
(ii) to the Bond Service Reserve
Fund, that portion of such proceeds
required to be deposited in the Bond
Service Reserve Fund in order to
cause the balance therein to equal
the Required Bond Service Reserve,
subject to the provisions set forth
below for a lesser or alternative
deposit;
(iii) to the Renewal and Replacement Fund, the portion of such proceeds representing the Renewal and
Replacement Payment attributable
to the Series 2000 Bonds;
(iv) if Series 2000 Bonds are
issued for the purpose of refunding
outstanding Revenue Bonds, then to
a separate account established in
the Bond Service Fund for that purpose pursuant to Part First of Section 5.03 of the Original Indenture,
the
portion
of
such
proceeds
required to be deposited in that
account to cause the refunded Revenue Bonds to be deemed paid and
discharged
for
purposes
of
the
Indenture; and
(v) to the Construction Fund, the
balance of such proceeds.
Pursuant to Section 3.02(h) of the
First Supplemental Indenture, the
Fourth Supplemental Indenture may
provide that no deposit to the Bond
Service Reserve Fund shall be made
for or with respect to the Series 2000
Bonds, in which case: (i) the holders of Series 2000 Bonds shall have
no right or entitlement to have any
portion of the Bond service charges
on Series 2000 Bonds be paid from
amounts
in
the
Bond
Service
Reserve Fund, (ii) the lien of and
pledge on the Bond Service Reserve
Fund shall not extend to or be for
the benefit of the holders of Series
2000 Bonds, and (iii) the Bond service charges on Series 2000 Bonds
shall not be taken into account in
determining the Required Bond Service Reserve. In the event that the
Fourth Supplemental Indenture provides as described in the preceding
sentence, then such Supplemental
Indenture may also provide for the

The City Record
creation of a special reserve fund
solely for Series 2000 Bonds, separate from the Bond Service Reserve
Fund, and may provide for the
deposit therein, at the time of
issuance or in one or more subsequent deposits thereto, of an amount
specified in the Fourth Supplemental
Indenture
as
the
required
reserve for Series 2000 Bonds (which
amount shall in no event exceed the
Required Bond Service Reserve computed for the Series 2000 Bonds
alone, if it had applied), or may
require the Issuer to provide a
municipal bond insurance policy, a
bank letter or line of credit, or any
other form of credit or liquidity
facility to enhance the security for
Series 2000 Bonds in lieu of a funded reserve fund. If the Fourth Supplemental Indenture so provides for
such a special reserve fund and further requires that deposits be made
thereto from Airport Revenues at
any time, then such deposits may be
made only from moneys remaining
in the Operating and Maintenance
Fund on the last day of a month
before any deposit is made to the
General Obligation Debt Service
Fund (or the Subordinated Debt Service Fund, if it shall have been
established) or into any other Special Fund into which such moneys
may be deposited after any required
deposits to the General Obligation
Debt Service Fund. If the Fourth
Supplemental Indenture provides for
no reserve fund, or for a special
reserve fund as permitted by the
preceding
paragraph,
then
the
Fourth
Supplemental
Indenture
shall also provide that the amount
of any defaulted principal of or
interest on the Series 2000 Bonds
that would have been timely paid
had the Required Bond Service
Reserve for such Revenue Bonds
been fully funded in the Bond Service Reserve Fund shall be paid
only from moneys remaining in the
Operating and Maintenance Fund on
the last day of a month before any
deposit is made to the General
Obligation Debt Service Fund (or
the
Subordinated
Debt
Service
Reserve Fund, if it shall have been
established) or to any other Special
Funds into which such moneys may
be deposited after any required
deposits to the General Obligation
Debt Service Fund. The Fiscal Officer is authorized to determine, based
on the written advice of the Issuer’s
Financial Advisor, which of the
options permitted under this Section
4 for funding the Bond Service
Reserve Fund or for alternatives to
doing so best serves the Issuer’s
interests, shall specify that option in
the Series 2000 Certificate of Award,
and shall cause the provisions for
that option to be incorporated into
the Fourth Supplemental Indenture.
Section 5. Terms and Provisions
Applicable to the Series 2000 Bonds.
(a) Form; exchange and transfer.
Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the Original Indenture,
(i) all Series 2000 Bonds shall initially be issued in fully registered
form, and (ii) no Series 2000 Bond
shall be exchanged for or transferable into a coupon Revenue Bond or
Bonds unless and until the Indenture shall have been amended in
accordance with the terms thereof to
permit such exchanges or transfers.
To the extent that the Original
Indenture (particularly, but without
limitation, Section 2.05 thereof) permits fully registered Revenue Bonds
to be exchanged for or transferred

982

May 17, 2000
into coupon Revenue Bonds or Revenue Bonds payable to bearer, then
the Original Indenture is hereby
amended to prohibit such exchanges
or transfers for the Series 2000
Bonds unless and until the Indenture shall have been amended in
accordance with the terms thereof to
permit such exchanges or transfers.
The Series 2000 Bonds shall be
issued to a Depository for use in a
book entry system and, if and as
long as a book entry system is utilized: (i) the Series 2000 Bonds shall

the Depository; (ii) the beneficial
owners in book entry form shall
have no right to receive Series 2000
Bonds in the form of physical securities or certificates; (iii) ownership

(iv) the Bonds as such shall not be
transferable
or
exchangeable,
except
for
transfer
to
another
Depository or to another nominee of
a Depository, without further action
by the Issuer.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Series 2000 Bonds for use in
a book entry system, the Fiscal Officer and Trustee may attempt to
establish
a
securities
depository/book entry relationship with
another qualified Depository. If the
Fiscal Officer and Trustee do not or
are unable to do so, the Fiscal Officer and Trustee, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Series 2000 Bonds from the
Depository, and authenticate and
deliver registered Series 2000 Bond
certificates to the assigns of the
Depository or its nominee, all at the
cost and expense (including any
costs of printing), if the event is not
the result of Issuer action or inaction, of those persons requesting
such issuance.
The Executive Officer, the Fiscal
Officer, the Director of Port Control
or any one of them are authorized
and directed to the extent necessary
or required to enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with the book entry system
for the Series 2000 Bonds, after
determining (as evidenced by their
signing) that the signing thereof
will not endanger the funds or securities of the Issuer under the Indenture.
(b) Denominations and Dates.
The Series 2000 Bonds shall each
be in the denomination of $5,000 or
any integral multiple thereof and
shall be dated as of the date or
dates specified in or pursuant to the
Series 2000 Certificate of Award;
provided, however, that if, pursuant
to the Series 2000 Certificate of
Award, a book entry system is to be
used for the Series 2000 Bonds, then
the Series 2000 Bonds shall be issued
in the form of a single Series 2000
Bond for each maturity or mandatory redemption date of each series of
Series 2000 Bonds. Each Series 2000
Bond shall have only one principal

May 17, 2000
maturity date, except for interim
certificates or receipts issued pending preparation of definitive Series
2000 Bonds.
(c) Interest and Place of Payment.
The Series 2000 Bonds shall bear
interest at their respective Specified
Interest Rates from the most recent
date to which interest has been paid
or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid or duly provided
for, from their dated date. The principal and Redemption Price, if any,
of and the interest payable on each
Series 2000 Bond shall be payable at
the times, to the persons and in the
manner set forth in the Indenture,
including, without limitation, provisions
thereof
permitting
special

Depository.

Series 2000 Certificate of Award and
in accordance with the Indenture;
provided, however, that the Series
2000 Certificate of Award may specify that all or a portion of the Series
2000 Bonds will not be subject to
redemption at the option of the
Issuer. The Series 2000 Term Bonds
shall also be subject to mandatory
redemption prior to maturity at the
Redemption Price on each Mandatory Redemption Date in the aggregate amount of the mandatory sinking fund requirement to be paid on
such Mandatory Redemption date,
all as specified in the Series 2000
Certificate of Award and in accordance with the Indenture.
(f) Execution.
The Series 2000 Bonds shall be
executed by the Executive Officer
and the Fiscal Officer, and approved
as to form by the Legal Officer, provided that any or all of such signatures may be facsimiles, and shall
bear the corporate seal of the Issuer
or a facsimile thereof.

The Series 2000 Bonds to be
authenticated by the Trustee shall
be numbered and otherwise identified as specified by the Fiscal Officer in accordance with the Indenture.
Section 6. Refunding of Outstanding Revenue Bonds.
If Series 2000 Bonds are issued for
the purpose of refunding any outstanding Revenue Bonds, then the
Executive Officer, the Fiscal Officer
and the Director of Port Control or
any two of them are authorized and
directed to sign and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of the Issuer,
an escrow agreement between the
Issuer and the Trustee, as escrow

The Fiscal Officer shall provide for
the payment of the services rendered and for reimbursement of
expenses incurred pursuant to the
escrow agreement from proceeds of
the Series 2000 Refunding Bonds to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose. Provision shall be
made in the escrow agreement to
give the Trustee any written notice
of redemption required under Section 3.02 of the Original Indenture.
The Executive Officer, the Fiscal
Officer, the Director of Port Control
and other appropriate Issuer officials shall execute all documents
and take all other actions necessary
or appropriate on the part of the
Issuer to effect such refunding in
accordance with the Original Indenture and to cause the refunded Revenue Bonds to be deemed paid and
discharged.
Section 7. Arbitrage Provisions.
Some or all of the Series 2000
Bonds are to be issued and sold as
obligations bearing interest to be
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes (the “TaxExempt
Bonds”).
The
Issuer
covenants that it will use and will
restrict the use and investment of,
the proceeds of the Tax-Exempt
Bonds in such manner and to such
extent as may be necessary so that
(a) the interest on the Tax-Exempt
Bonds will be excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes and (b) in the case of any
Tax-Exempt Bonds intended to qualify as bonds, the interest on which
is not treated as an item of tax preference under Section 57 of the Code
(“Non-AMT
Bonds”),
such
TaxExempt Bonds will be treated as
Non-AMT Bonds.
The Issuer covenants that (a) it
will take or cause to be taken such
actions that may be required of it
for the interest on the Tax-Exempt
Bonds to be and to remain excluded
from
gross
income
for
federal
income tax purposes, (b) it will not
take or authorize to be taken any
action that would adversely affect
that exclusion, and c) it, or persons
acting for it, will, among other acts
of compliance, (i) apply the proceeds of the Tax-Exempt Bonds to
the governmental purposes of the
borrowing, (ii) restrict the yield on
investment
property,
(iii)
make
timely and adequate payments to
the federal government, (iv) maintain books and records and make
calculations and reports, and (v)
refrain from certain uses of those
proceeds and, as applicable, of property financed with such proceeds,
all in such manner and to the extent
necessary to assure such exclusion
of that interest under the Code.
The Fiscal Officer, or any other
officer of the Issuer having responsibility for issuance of the TaxExempt Bonds, is hereby authorized
(a) to make or effect any election,
selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or waiver on behalf
of the Issuer with respect to the
Tax-Exempt Bonds as the Issuer is
permitted or required to make or
give under the federal income tax
laws, including, without limitation
thereto, any of the elections provided for in Section 148(f)(4)(C) of the

983

15
Code or available under Section 148
of the Code, for the purpose of
assuring, enhancing or protecting
favorable tax treatment or status of
the Tax-Exempt Bonds or interest
thereon
or
assisting
compliance
with requirements for that purpose,
reducing the burden or expense of
such
compliance,
reducing
the
rebate amount or payments of penalties, or making payments of special
amounts in lieu of making computations to determine, or paying,
excess earnings as rebate, or obviating those amounts or payments, as
determined by that officer, which
action shall be in writing and
signed by the officer (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf
of the Issuer, as may be appropriate
to assure the exclusion of interest
from gross income and the intended
tax status of the Tax-Exempt Bonds,
and (c) to give one or more appropriate certificates of the Issuer, for
inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Tax-Exempt Bonds,
setting forth the reasonable expectations of the Issuer regarding the
amount and use of all the proceeds
of the Tax-Exempt Bonds, the facts,
circumstances
and
estimates
on
which they are based, and other
facts and circumstances relevant to
the tax treatment of the interest on
and the tax status of the TaxExempt Bonds.
Each covenant made in this Section with respect to the Tax-Exempt
Bonds is also made with respect to
all issues any portion of the debt
service on which is paid from proceeds of the Tax-Exempt Bonds
(and, if different, the original issue
and any refunding issues in a series
of refundings), to the extent such
compliance is necessary to assure
exclusion of interest on the TaxExempt Bonds from gross income
for federal income tax purposes, and
the officers identified above are
authorized to take actions with
respect to those issues as they are
authorized in this Section to take
with respect to the Tax-Exempt
Bonds.
Section 8. Fourth Supplemental
Indenture;
Amendments
to
Use
Agreements; Transcript of Proceedings.
The Executive Officer, the Fiscal
Officer and the Director of Port Control, or any two of them, are hereby authorized and directed, in the
name and on behalf of the Issuer, to
make, execute, acknowledge, and
deliver to the Trustee, a good and
sufficient
Fourth
Supplemental
Indenture, approved as to form and
correctness by the Legal Officer, for
the purposes hereinafter described
and substantially in the form put on
file with the Clerk in connection
with the Series 2000 Bond Legislation in File No. 833-2000-A. The form
of the Fourth Supplemental Indenture is approved with such changes
therein as are not inconsistent with
this Series 2000 Bond Legislation
and not adverse to the Issuer and
which are permitted by the Constitution and the laws of Ohio and as
shall be approved by the officers
signing the Fourth Supplemental
Indenture. The approval of those
changes, and the determination that
such changes are not adverse to the
Issuer, shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of the Fourth
Supplemental Indenture by those
officials. The Fourth Supplemental

16
Indenture shall expressly extend the
security of the Original Indenture as
thereby amended to the Series 2000
Bonds and shall cause the Indenture
to include, among other things: (i)
appropriate provisions for the use of
a book entry system for the Series
2000 Bonds, (ii) such covenants as
are necessary and appropriate for
the interest on the Series 2000 Bonds
to be exempt from gross income for
purposes of federal income taxation
under the Code, and (iii) such
covenants as are deemed necessary
and appropriate to obtain favorable
ratings on or credit enhancement for
the Series 2000 Bonds or to enhance
their marketability.
The Fourth Supplemental Indenture may also include such additional covenants of the Issuer as the Fiscal Officer and the Director of Port
Control of the Issuer deem necessary
and appropriate to obtain favorable
ratings on the Series 2000 Bonds and
to
enhance
their
marketability,
including, without limitation, covenants pertaining to the conditions
under which the City may acquire or
construct additional airport facilities
that may have an adverse impact on
the ability of the Airport to generate
sufficient Airport Revenues for purposes
of
the
Indenture,
and
covenants pertaining to the Issuer’s
obligations, if any, regarding the
lease and use agreements that may
replace the existing Use Agreements
upon their termination.
To the extent permitted by the
Indenture, the Issuer is authorized,
from time to time, to enter into one
or more agreements in connection
with, prior to, or subsequent to the
issuance of the Series 2000 Bonds,
for an interest rate swap, an interest rate cap, or any other such
arrangement to lower the effective
interest rate on the Series 2000
Bonds or to hedge the exposure of
the Issuer against fluctuations in
prevailing interest rates, and to
secure its obligations to the counterparties in such agreements on a
parity with its obligations to holders of Revenue Bonds under the
Indenture, subject to such conditions
and restrictions as may be specified
therein. The Fiscal Officer is authorized, on behalf of the Issuer, to execute and deliver any such agreement that meets the requirements of
the Indenture and that he determines,
based
upon
the
written
advice of the Issuer’s Financial
Advisor, will reduce the net Bond
service charges payable on the
Series 2000 Bonds or otherwise
enhance the timing and amount of
the
payments
thereof
for
the
Issuer’s purposes to an extent that
justifies the cost of the Issuer’s
entering into such agreement. In the
event that the Issuer’s entering into
any such agreement requires an
amendment to the Original Indenture as amended and supplemented
by the First Supplemental Indenture, Second Supplemental Indenture
and the Third Supplemental Indenture, then, provided that the consent
of holders of the requisite percentage of holders of outstanding Revenue Bonds is obtained in order for
such an amendment to become effective in accordance with Section 13.02
of
the
Original
Indenture,
the
Fourth Supplemental Indenture may
include an amendment to the Original Indenture as theretofore amended for the purpose of causing the
Indenture to permit the Issuer, from
time to time, to enter into one or
more agreements in connection with
or subsequent to the issuance of any

The City Record
series of Revenue Bonds, for an
interest rate swap, an interest rate
cap, or any other such arrangement
to lower the effective interest rate
on Revenue Bonds or to hedge the
exposure of the Issuer against fluctuations in prevailing interest rates,
and to permit the Issuer to secure
its obligations to the counterparties
in such agreements on a parity with
its obligations to holders of Revenue
Bonds under the Indenture, subject
to such conditions and restrictions
as may be specified in such amendment. If such an amendment is
required, the Fiscal Officer is authorized to seek such consent from the
holders of the Revenue Bonds to be
outstanding upon the issuance of
the Series 2000 Bonds, including the
Original Purchasers.
This Series 2000 Bond Legislation
shall constitute a part of the Fourth
Supplemental Indenture as therein
provided and for all purposes thereof, including, without limitation, the
application to this Series 2000 Bond
Legislation of the provisions of the
Indenture relating to amendment,
modification, supplementation and
severability.

directed to execute and deliver to
the Airlines such amendments to the

Agreements to reflect the issuance

execution and delivery of the Fourth
Supplemental Indenture and to be
consistent with the Fourth Supplemental Indenture.
The Clerk shall furnish to the
Original Purchasers of the Series
2000 Bonds a true transcript, certified by the Clerk, of all proceedings
had with reference to the issuance
of the Series 2000 Bonds, along with

not substantially adverse to the
Issuer as may be approved by the

Bonds on terms which are consistent
with the requirements of this Bond
Legislation or in the event that the

to the Issuer, but the execution of

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 276-2000.
By Councilman Coats.
An emergency resolution urging
the President and United States Secretary of Transportation Rodney
Slater to take the necessary actions
to permit United Parcel Service to
conduct cargo business in China.
Whereas, United Parcel Service
(UPS) is a fiscally sound, well-run
company,
being
recently
named
Forbes Magazine’s Company of the
Year for 1999; and
Whereas, in 1999, UPS was also
recognized by Fortune Magazine as
one of America’s 50 Best Companies
for Asians, Hispanics and African
Americans; and
Whereas, because of certain governmental restrictions, UPS has been
prohibited
from
conducting
air
cargo business from the United
States to China; and
Whereas, the U.S. Department of
Transportation will designate only
one new market entrant to serve
China later this year; and
Whereas, it is beneficial for the
citizens of the United States to
encourage trade and unfettered business operations, thereby promoting
economic strength and diplomatic
relationships; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland urges the President and U.S. Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater to take the
necessary actions to permit United
Parcel Service to conduct air cargo
business in China.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to forward a
copy of this resolution to President
Clinton and Secretary Slater.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Res. No. 669-2000.
By Councilmen Cintron, Patmon
and White.
An emergency resolution requesting certain MBE/FBE participation
information from LTV Steel Company, the Department of Economic
Development and the Office of Equal
Opportunity.
Whereas, pursuant to Ordinance
No. 1742-88, passed July 14, 1988 and
Ordinance No. 34-92, as amended by
Ordinance No. 1445-92, passed March
2, 1992 and June 15, 1992, respectively, the Council of the City of

Economic Development to enter into
an
Enterprise
Zone
Agreements
with LTV Steel Company, Inc., dated

July 14, 1988 and June 18, 1992,
respectively, to provide for 10 year
tax abatements for certain tangible
personal property as an incentive to
modernize and improve its Cleveland Works Steel Facility; and
Whereas, because of the magnitude of the projects, LTV proposed
to complete the projects in successive calendar years, and as such, the
parties agreed that the tax abatements would commence at the outset of a number of different 10 year
exemption periods; and
Whereas, LTV Steel Company, Inc.
is still receiving the benefit of the
tax abatements granted in 1988; and
Whereas, as a condition of the
granting of the 1988 and 1992 tax
abatements, LTV agreed to, among
other things, comply with certain
MBE/FBE
participation
requirements; LTV’s failure to comply with
the MBE/FBE participation requirements was to result in the imposition of a penalty payment charged
against the tax abatements, and if
necessary, the repeal of the tax
abatements; and
Whereas, this Council has information suggesting that LTV may
not be in compliance with the terms
of its agreements with the City; and
Whereas, this Council requests
that the Directors of Economic
Development
and
the
Office
of
Equal Opportunity and LTV Steel
Company provide detailed statistical
and financial information concerning the MBE and FBE participation
for each year from 1990 through the
present; and
Whereas, once the information is
provided, this Council intends to hold
hearings before the various Committees of Council to determine whether
LTV is and has been in compliance
with its agreements; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
requests that LTV Steel Company,
Inc., the City’s Office of Equal
Opportunity and the Department of
Economic
Development
provide
detailed statistical and financial
information concerning the MBE
and FBE participation from 1990-present,
separately
identifying
the
level of participation by certified
MBE and FBE companies for each
year, as required by LTV’s Enterprise Zone Agreements with the City
of Cleveland and Chapter 187 of the
Codified Ordinance of the City of
Cleveland, 1976.
Section 2. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland intends to hold
hearings before the various Committees of Council to determine
whether LTV is and has been in
compliance with its agreement.
Section 3. That the Clerk is hereby requested to transmit a copy of
this resolution to the President of
LTV Steel Company, Inc. and the
Directors of the Department of Economic Development and the Office
of Equal Opportunity.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as enacted by Ordinance No. 527-2000, passed April 17,
2000, is hereby amended to read as
follows:
Section 341.07 Pedestrian Retail
Area Restrictions
(a) Purpose. The regulations of
this
section
are
established
to
achieve, among others, the following
purposes.
(1) ensuring the continued economic viability of retail corridors
that depend on the patronage of customers who seek a shopping environment that is convenient and comfortable for pedestrians;
(2) enhancing the vitality of
downtown streets, thereby strengthening the district’s attractiveness as
a location for residences, offices and
tourism;
(3) increasing the marketability
of housing located on upper floors
of historic buildings in the district;
(4) providing necessary retail services to downtown residents and
office workers;
(5) reducing traffic congestion by
allowing downtown residents and
employees to patronize retail businesses by walking rather than by
traveling in automobiles or other
vehicles;
(6) furthering economic development in the City of Cleveland and
providing additional employment for
City residents.
(b) Applicability. The regulations
of this section shall apply to the
ground floor or “street-level floor
area” of any property located both
in the Public Land Protective District and in a Retail Business District on a “pedestrian-oriented shopping street,” as defined herein. No
use in such location shall be established or changed except in accordance with the provisions of this
section.
(c) Pedestrian-Oriented Shopping
Street. A “pedestrian oriented shopping street” is any side of any block
of a street characterized by a predominance of retail businesses situated at or near the public sidewalk.
The City Planning Commission shall
prepare and adopt a map designating pedestrian-oriented streets within the area to which the regulations
of this section apply. The Planning
Commission shall review and update
that map periodically. The Planning
Commission shall also consider for
designation as a pedestrian-oriented
shopping street any block that is
designated for retail use in the
adopted general plan for the development and improvement of the
City, regardless of the current uses
located on that block.
(d) Referral by Division of Build ing and Housing. The Division of
Building and Housing shall refer to
the City Planning Commission any
application
for
establishment
or
change of a ground floor use in a
building located both in the Public
Land Protective District and in a
Retail Business District.
(e) Planning Commission Deter mination. Upon receipt of an application to establish a new street-level
use in a location subject to the provisions of this section, the City Planning Commission shall determine

May 17, 2000
whether the space is located on a
pedestrian-oriented
street
and
whether the proposed use is permitted by the regulations of this section. The Commission shall make its
determination within thirty (30)
days of receipt of a complete application, unless the applicant approves an extension of time.
(f) Prohibited Uses. Street-level
floor area in a building located on
a
pedestrian-oriented
shopping
street, as determined by the City
Planning Commission in accordance
with the provisions of this section,
shall not be occupied principally for
purposes of storage or warehousing
or operation of telecommunications
devices, telephone switching equipment or other automated or remotely controlled machinery or equipment.
(g) Facade and Window Treat ment. If any uses prohibited in
street-level areas are proposed for
upper floors in buildings subject to
the provisions of this section, the
City Planning Commission or, if
applicable, the Landmarks Commission during its review shall ensure
that the entire facade and window
areas are treated in a manner that
does not convey the appearance of
a space used for storage or warehousing purposes, but rather conveys the appearance of a space used
actively by employees, customers or
residents.
(h) Nonconforming Uses. Legallyestablished uses made nonconforming by the initial adoption of this
section may continue but may not
be expanded or otherwise changed
so as to create a greater degree of
nonconformity, unless approved by
the Board of Zoning Appeals in
accordance with Chapter 359.
(i) For any use subject to the regulations of this section, no exhaust
vents (including, without limitation,
any exhaust vents serving any
diesel or other powered emergency
generator) shall be placed along the
designated pedestrian-oriented shopping street on the first floor, second
floor or in the sidewalk area.
(j) Exceptions. Notwithstanding
the variance powers outlined in
Section 329.03, the Board of Zoning
Appeals may vary or modify the
application of these provisions in
harmony with the general purpose
and intent of the Zoning Code so
that
the
public
health,
safety,
morals and general welfare may be
safeguarded and substantial justice
done. The decision to vary or modify the application of these provisions shall consider the following
factors: (1) the proximity of the
proposed use to the pedestrian-oriented street frontage, in the case
of a use that will occupy only a
portion of the street-level floor
space; (2) the physical size, shape
or
other
characteristics
of
the
premises; and (3) whether refusal
of the variance appealed for will
deprive the owner of substantial
property rights.
Section 2. That Section 341.07 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as enacted by Ordinance No. 527-2000, passed April 17,
2000, is hereby repealed.
Section 3. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives

all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
