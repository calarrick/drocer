the formula adopted by the Ohio

health care as evidenced by its participation in the fight to save St.
Michael Hospital; and
Whereas, the Ohio General Assembly established the Health Care
Assurance Program (HCAP) approximately 10 years ago to assist
in funding the provision of charity
care in Ohio hospitals; and
Whereas, the distribution of the
HCAP funds are currently governed
by a formula determined by the
Ohio Hospital Association, members
of the hospital industry; and
Whereas, the Ohio Hospital Association recently announced a new
formula that would drastically cut
the funding of MetroHealth Medical

July 26, 2000

approximately 15% from the prior
year’s funding; and

Community
Health
Partners (Lorain), Lake Hospital,

on the original guiding priniciples
that had previously governed the

Care Assurance funds.

hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,

has the right to own, operate and

30
maintain a cable system in the City

March 9, 1994, (the “1994 Amendment,” and together with the Franchise Agreement, the “Franchise”),
which Franchise shall expire on or

Whereas,
Adelphia
Communications Corporation and Cablevision
entered into a Purchase Agreement
dated as of December 8, 1999 (the
“Purchase
Agreement”),
whereby
Adelphia Communications Corporation shall acquire Cablevision of

which Purchase Agreement provides
that subsequent to the Transfer from
Cablevision,
Adelphia
Cleveland
LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Adelphia Communications Corporation (collectively, “Adelphia”), will
hold the Franchise and operate the

Whereas, in mid-February 2000,
Cablevision and Adelphia submitted
an FCC Form 394 dated February 4,
2000 to the City Council, which
described the Purchase Agreement
and Transfer and requested that the
City consent to the proposed Transfer; and
Whereas, after a review of the
FCC Form 394 and other information
submitted by Cablevision and Adelphia, it was determined that the FCC
Form 394 was incomplete and the
City Council’s consultants requested
additional information from Cablevision and Adelphia, which information was provided, in order for City
Council to perform its due diligence
review of the technical, legal and
financial ability of Adelphia to perform the obligations of the Franchise, to ascertain Cablevision’s compliance with the terms of the Franchise and to consider the effect of
the proposed Transfer on the health,
safety and welfare of the citizens of
the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, after reviewing Cablevision’s compliance with the Franchise
and performing a due diligence review of Adelphia’s technical, legal and
financial ability to perform the obligations of the Franchise, which reviews included public hearings, representatives of City Council, Cablevision and Adelphia have been and
are continuing to negotiate in good
faith relevant terms and conditions
to address issues of past compliance,
the ability of Adelphia to perform
under this Franchise and any new
franchise upon the Franchise’s expiration on September 15, 2001 and
other issues raised by the proposed

request to approve the Transfer of
the Franchise within one hundred
twenty (120) days of receiving a
complete FCC Form 394, which time
period expires on August 8, 2000, or
the Council will lose its rights with
respect to the proposed Transfer

The City Record
since the Transfer shall be deemed
approved if no action is taken prior
to said date of August 8, 2000, or
unless an extension of time is
agreed to by the parties; and
Whereas, this Council has determined that it is not in its best interest to approve the Transfer until
the City Council, Cablevision and
Adelphia
have
resolved,
and
reached agreement on, the appropriate terms and conditions of the
Transfer; and
Whereas, City Council intends to
continue negotiating in good faith
with Cablevision and Adelphia for
resolution
of
such
issues
but,
because an extension of time has
not been agreed to, Council has
determined to deny its consent to
the Transfer at this time in order to
retain its rights under federal law
by acting on Cablevision’s and Adelphia’s request within the time period allowed by the Cable Act so that
the City Council, Cablevision and
Adelphia can reach agreement on
certain appropriate terms and conditions of the Transfer as described
