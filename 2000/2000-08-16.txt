By Councilmen Brady and Jones.
An emergency resolution urging
the federal government to require
labeling of genetically manipulated
foods and further urging a moratorium on the production of such foods
until acceptable testing systems are
in place.
Whereas, genetically engineered
foods have not yet been proven safe
and are not tested by any federal
agency; and
Whereas, the Food and Drug
Administration requires only that
companies producing such genetically engineered foods state, on the
“honor system”, that such foods are
safe with no further testing required, and
Whereas, a class action lawsuit
has been brought against the Food
and Drug Administration to prevent
it from continuing to rush such
untested foods on the market; and
Whereas, numerous bioengineers
and scientists have stated that the
technology
of
genetically
engineered foods is clearly different
from traditional methods and could
lead to a host of undesirable health
and environmental problems; and
Whereas, such technology further
has potential negative effects in
genetic cross-pollination of beneficial plants, insects and other fragile
ecosystems;
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety in
that it is essential that the public
know and understand how the foods
it purchases are being produced and
the possible health and environmental risks of such production, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the federal government to require
labeling of genetically manipulated
foods and further urges a moratorium on the production of such genetically manipulated foods until acceptable testing systems are in
place.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
