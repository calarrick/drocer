Locker, 10218 St. Clair Avenue,
Cleveland, Ohio 44108; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor

qualify to be a permit holder and/or

state; and

permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and

permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and

on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, safety
and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
