THE CALENDAR
The following measures will be on their final passage at the next meeting:
ORDINANCES
Ord. No. 1435-99.
By Councilmen Robinson, Zone and Johnson (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance to amend Section 350.14, 350.19 and 350.20 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, as amended by various ordinances, relating to signs for shopping centers and other business uses.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of a municipal
department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the following Sections of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976:
Section 350.14, as amended by Ordinance No. 648-96, passed June 10, 1996,
Section 350.19, as amended by Ordinance No. 3076-A-89, passed December 10, 1990, and
Section 350.20, as amended by Ordinance No. 1131-93, passed June 14, 1993
are hereby amended to read, respectively, as follows:
Section 350.14 Signs for Retail Districts
Signs for uses in University Retail, Local Retail, General Retail and Shopping Center Districts shall be permitted as regulated below:
(a) Maximum Sign Face Area (Retail). The maximum sign face area of all permanent building-mounted signs
for each building or unit thereof shall be related to the width of the building or unit. (For lots without buildings or with unusually small buildings, see division (d) of Section 350.20.) Maximum sign face area, excluding
the area of free-standing signs, shall be determined according to the measurement standards of Section 350.05 and
the following formula where “W” is the width of frontage (in feet) of the building or unit thereof: (W x 1/5) +
25 = SQUARE FEET OF SIGNAGE.
(b) Permitted Types, Number, Area and Height (Retail).
Signs by use and structural type are permitted only in accordance with the regulations presented in the schedule
of Permitted Types, Number, Area and Height (Retail). Sign types not listed are prohibited except for political signs

other permitted signs and in accordance with the following regulations:

246

February 23, 2000

The City Record

5

(1) Display of Information. Each shopping center identification sign shall display only the name of the center
and the name of not more than one (1) business located within the center, except that, with approval of the
council member whose ward is affected as expressed by an ordinance or resolution of Council, for any shopping
center with retail floor area exceeding 150,000 square feet, excluding “outlots” with separate free-standing signs,
such sign may display the names of not more than two (2) businesses located within the center.
(2) Size. The maximum sign face area of a shopping center identification sign shall equal twenty (20) square
feet for each 10,000 square feet of gross floor area but shall not exceed 125 square feet. All shopping centers,
however, shall be permitted a sign of at least fifty (50) square feet.
(3) Other Regulations. All other regulations of this chapter applicable to identification signs shall apply to a
shopping center identification sign.
(4) Other Signs. A lot displaying a shopping center identification sign may display no other free-standing identification or business signs.
(5) Secondary Frontages and Entrances. One (1) additional shopping center identification freestanding sign and
one (1) additional shopping center identification wall sign shall be permitted for a shopping center with more
than one vehicular entrance, provided that such signs meet the requirements of division (b) of Section 350.20.
(6) Outlots. If a vehicular entrance or parking lot of a shopping center also serves a use located on a separate lot (i.e., “out lot”), the free-standing identification or business sign permitted for such lot shall be limited
to a maximum of twenty-five (25) square feet in area and seven (7) feet in height.
(7) Design Review. No sign identifying a shopping center or identifying two (2) or more businesses within a
shopping center and no permanent identification sign of any type located within a designated Shopping Center
District shall be erected or altered in appearance without the approval of the City Planning Commission or its
Director. In considering such approval, the Commission shall seek to ensure that the signs demonstrate a high
degree of graphic and architectural quality, legibility, and design compatibility with the shopping center, its signage and nearby development.
(8) Consolidation of Free-Standing Signs. In the case of a shopping center with more than the number of signs
allowed under this Chapter, which signs were legally established prior to the effective date of this ordinance, a
new free-standing sign identifying two (2) or more businesses may be erected if the following conditions are met:
A. the new multi-tenant sign shall display the name of the shopping center and tenant names no greater in
number than the tenant names currently displayed on free-standing signs in the shopping center, but in no case
shall more than six (6) tenant names be displayed on such sign;
B. all other free-standing business identification signs on the shopping center property shall be removed prior
to erection of the new sign, except that conforming signs permitted for outlots may be retained;
C. the sign does not, exceed twelve (12) feet in height;
D. the council member whose ward is affected approves, as expressed by an ordinance or resolution of Council.
(e) Gasoline Service Stations. Signs for gasoline service stations shall conform with all regulations of this chapter except for the maximum sign area regulations of division (a) of Section 350.14 and any regulations which
directly conflict with the regulations stated below:
(1) Free-standing Business Sign. Each station shall be permitted one (1) permanent free-standing business signs,
with total sign face area of the panel or panels not exceeding one hundred (100) square feet. Such sign shall be
limited to identifying the company name, management, fuel prices, and services offered.
(2) Signs at Service Islands. Stations shall be permitted information signs at fuel or other service islands which
display information regarding type of service or are necessary in directing or instructing the motorist who has
entered the station area. Signs not extending beyond the edges of fuel pumps are permitted and shall not be
counted as business identification signs.
(3) Wall and Canopy Signs. Each station shall be permitted permanent identifications, business, directional and
information signs displayed as wall or canopy signs and not exceeding one hundred (100) square feet in combined area. Non-opaque internally-illuminated canopy surfaces (“fascia”) shall be considered as sign panels for
purposes of sign area measurement.
(4) Temporary Signs. Temporary signs shall be permitted in accordance with the regulations of Section 350.12.
(f) Drive-Through Restaurants. For restaurants providing direct service to customers in motor vehicles, one (1)
free-standing or wall-mounted “menu board” sign (limited to information regarding the restaurant’s menu and
related instructions) shall be permitted for each drive-through lane in addition to signs and sign area otherwise
permitted. Such sign shall not exceed forty (40) square feet in area and six (6) feet in height and shall meet
setback regulations applicable to free-standing identification signs (as specified in division (c) of this section).
(g) Regulations for Larger Projecting Signs. A projecting sign may exceed the otherwise maximum permitted
size of twelve (12) square feet and the otherwise maximum permitted projection of four (4) feet from a building wall if such sign meets the following standards:
(1) Such sign shall be set back from the closest interior side lot line and the closest tenant party wall line at
least one (1) foot for each one (1) square foot of sign area.
(2) Such sign shall in no case exceed thirty-six (36) square feet in area nor eight (8) feet in projection from
the building wall and shall be set back at least two (2) feet from the outer edge of any street curb.
(3) No Building Permit shall be issued for such sign without approval of the City Planning Commission, which
shall consider the design quality of the sign and its compatibility with the design character of the subject property and surrounding properties. In addition to considering such general design factors as placement, proportions,
color, materials, and consistency with signs to be seen as a series, the City Planning Commission may specifically
require use of non-rectangular, custom-shaped panels, exposed neon or reflected lighting, unobtrusive support structures, narrow-profile sign cabinets, or other design features necessary to ensure that a larger projecting sign will
enhance the appearance of the building on which it is placed and the district in which it is located.
(4) At least five (5) working days prior to the City Planning Commission meeting at which approval under
the regulations of this division will be considered, written notice shall be provided to the City Council member
in whose ward the proposed sign is to be located.
(h) Supplemental Regulations. Signs in Retail Districts shall also conform to regulations of Section 350.20.
Section 350.19 Nonconforming Signs and Uses
A sign which is displayed pursuant to a Building Permit issued by the City, but does not conform to current
regulations, shall be deemed a legal nonconforming sign (hereinafter referred to as a “nonconforming” sign) and
shall be governed by the following regulations:
(a) Permitted Repair and Alterations. A nonconforming sign may be painted, cleaned or repaired as required
in Section 350.18 but shall not be otherwise altered, moved or replaced unless made to conform to current regulations. Such sign, however, may be altered to permit a change of message or change of face if such change does
not structurally alter the sign casing or support.

February 23, 2000

(b) Limitation on Reconstruction. A nonconforming sign or part thereof damaged or deteriorated to an extent
exceeding fifty percent (50%) of its replacement cost shall not be reconstructed or replaced unless made to conform to regulations of this Code. For a nonconforming sign damaged by a single incident (such as a storm), to
an extent less than fifty percent (50%) of its replacement cost, reconstruction is permitted only if such work is
begun within six (6) months of the incident and is completed within twelve (12) months of the incident.
(c) Discontinuance of Use. A nonconforming sign shall be removed or made to conform to regulations of this
Code if the use to which the sign refers has been discontinued for a continuous and immediately preceding period
of at least six (6) months, except as provided in division (f) of this section. In the case of a nonconforming
billboard, as defined in this chapter, such sign shall be removed or made to conform to regulations of this Code

Section 350.20 Supplemental Regulations
The following supplemental regulations shall apply to permitted signs in non-residential zoning districts:
(a) Non-Ground Floor Uses. For uses not located on the ground floor and for ground floor uses which lack direct
access from the building exterior, the following signs shall be permitted in addition to signs otherwise permitted
for the building. Regardless of the number of such uses in a building, not more than one (1) wall or projecting
identification sign, a maximum of twelve (12) square feet in area, shall be placed at each ground floor entrance
providing access to the uses in question. In addition, for each such use, window signs not exceeding twenty (20)
square feet in total area shall be permitted for display on the inside surface of windows within the subject space.
(b) Secondary Frontages and Entrances.
(1) Secondary Frontages. A building or building unit with frontage on a second street or with a customer building entrance from a rear or side parking lot shall be permitted total additional wall, window, projecting and
canopy sign area not to exceed 50% of the sign area otherwise permitted. Such signs shall be displayed so that
the total sign area placed on any facade does not exceed the maximum sign area permitted for the building’s
primary frontage. This provision shall also apply to buildings or building units with secondary frontage along
the Cuyahoga River or Lake Erie and to buildings adjoining a freeway right-of-way.
(2) Secondary Entrances. For lots served by more than one (1) vehicular entrance, one (1) additional freestanding identification sign shall be permitted at each additional vehicular entrance if the minimum distance
between any two (2) such signs is five hundred (500) feet as measured along street lines. Where such distance
is less than five hundred (500) feet but more than three hundred (300) feet, a second free-standing identification
sign shall be permitted if the height of each such sign is no greater than twelve (12) feet and the combined
sign area of the two signs is no greater than one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the maximum sign area permitted for a single free-standing identification sign on the subject property.
(c) New Businesses. Upon its initial opening, a new business establishment may display a temporary identification sign for a maximum period of sixty-two (62) days prior to installation of a permanent identification sign.
Such temporary sign may be a wall, window or portable sign which shall conform with all regulations applicable to permanent signs (except clearly inapplicable structural requirements) and shall be counted as part of the
maximum permitted permanent sign area. In addition, temporary window signs for such new businesses may
cover up to 75% of window area. Strings of pennants, streamers, pinwheels, balloons and similar small lightweight objects shall be permitted for “grand openings” for a single period not exceeding seven (7) days within
the first six (6) months after issuance of the initial Occupancy Certificate for a new business.
(d) Open Lots. For uses without buildings, and for uses on lots where building frontage is less than 20% of
lot frontage, maximum sign face area for the use, including free-standing signs, shall be the greater of fifty (50)
square feet or the figure resulting from the following formula where “LW” equals the width of the lot frontage,
as defined in division (a)(2) of Section 350.05: LW x 1.0 = SQUARE FEET OF SIGNAGE. The area of a freestanding sign shall in no instance exceed one hundred (100) square feet.
(e) Major Public Assembly Facilities. For public assembly facilities located within the Central Business District and providing a minimum seating or attendance capacity of 5,000 persons, signage shall be permitted in
accordance with the following standards contained in this division (e) which recognize the unique nature of these
large-scale public assembly facilities. Except as provided in these standards, all other regulations of this Zoning
Code shall apply to such signage.
(1) Type, Number, Height and Location of Signs. The City Planning Commission may authorize variations in otherwise applicable regulations of this chapter to the extent necessary to provide adequate information to the public.
(2) Electronic Changeable Copy Signs. Information displayed through electronically changeable copy on signs
located on the premises of a qualifying public assembly facility or on property located within 500 feet of the
qualifying public assembly facility and owned or leased by the owners of said public assembly facility shall be
limited to the following:
A. identification of the facility or events held at the facility.

purchase
power
costs may be applied to the rates
prescribed in Sections 523.02 to
523.065 and any other rate schedule
as may be adopted by the City.
(b) The incremental charge shall
be based on the fuel and purchase
power cost per kilowatt hour delivered calculated pursuant to subsections (c)(1) and (2) of this Section,
and shall not be less than the
charge calculated pursuant to such
subsections on October 1, 1997.
(c)(1) The fuel and purchase
power cost per kilowatt hour sold to
residential ratepayers shall be determined by dividing the sum of the
cost of the kilowatt hours purchased
from the Power Authority of the
State of New York and the average
cost of kilowatt hours purchased
from other sources needed to supply
the residential customers. For the
period ending December 31, 2005, the
incremental charge calculated herein shall be adjusted by subtracting
15 mils per kilowatt hour for residential customers who provide the
Division of Cleveland Public Power
with a certificate of reduction of
taxes obtained pursuant to the
Homestead Exemption provisions of
Sections 323.151 through 323.157 of
the Revised Code, and 9.75 mils per
kilowatt hour for all other residential customers. Beginning on January 1, 2006, the incremental charge
for all residential customers shall be
adjusted by subtracting 15 mils per
kilowatt hour.
(2) Except as provided in Section
523.048, the fuel and purchase power
cost per kilowatt hour sold to all
ratepayers, other than residential
ratepayers,
during
the
twelve
months of the year, shall be determined by dividing the sum of the
total cost of coal, oil, gas and purchase power by the total kilowatt
hours distributed, except that the
computation shall exclude the cost
of PASNY power and the amount of
PASNY power allocable to kilowatt
hours distributed, and shall exclude
the costs of all purchase power from
a specific source or sources purchased by the Division for distribution to ratepayers pursuant to Section 523.048. For the period ending
December 31, 2005, the incremental
charge calculated herein shall be
adjusted by subtracting 3.0 mils per
kilowatt hour. Beginning on January 1, 2006, such incremental charge
shall be adjusted by subtracting 15
mils per kilowatt hour.
(d) At the end of each month, the
Division of Cleveland Public Power
shall determine the excess fuel and
power charge during such month as
herein provided.
Be it further resolved that all
other provisions of said Resolution
No. 140-95, adopted February 27,
