FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES READ IN FULL
AND PASSED
Ord. No. 1219-2000.
By Councilmen O’Malley, Polensek
and Patmon.
An emergency ordinance disapproving the request to consent to
transfer the Cable franchise from
Cablevision of Cleveland, L.P. to
Adelphia Cleveland LLC.
Whereas, Cablevision of Cleveland, L.P., an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Cablevision Systems
Corp., (collectively, “Cablevision”)
has the right to own, operate and
maintain a cable system in the City
of Cleveland, Ohio pursuant to a
Franchise Agreement, effective on
or about September 16, 1986 (the
“Franchise Agreement”), as amended by the Amendment to Franchise
Agreement approved by this Council
by Ordinance No. 305-94, effective
March 9, 1994, (the “1994 Amendment,” and together with the Franchise Agreement, the “Franchise”),
which Franchise shall expire on or
about September 15, 2001; and
Whereas,
Adelphia
Communications Corporation and Cablevision
entered into a Purchase Agreement
dated as of December 8, 1999 (the
“Purchase
Agreement”),
whereby
Adelphia Communications Corporation shall acquire Cablevision of
Cleveland, L.P. resulting in the
transfer of
the Franchise from
Cablevision to Adelphia Communications Corporation (the “Transfer”),
which Purchase Agreement provides
that subsequent to the Transfer from
Cablevision,
Adelphia
Cleveland
LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Adelphia Communications Corporation (collectively, “Adelphia”), will
hold the Franchise and operate the
cable system in the City; and
Whereas, in mid-February 2000,
Cablevision and Adelphia submitted
an FCC Form 394 dated February 4,
2000 to the City Council, which
described the Purchase Agreement
and Transfer and requested that the
City consent to the proposed Transfer; and
Whereas, after a review of the
FCC Form 394 and other information
submitted by Cablevision and Adelphia, it was determined that the FCC
Form 394 was incomplete and the
City Council’s consultants requested
additional information from Cablevision and Adelphia, which information was provided, in order for City
Council to perform its due diligence
review of the technical, legal and
financial ability of Adelphia to perform the obligations of the Franchise, to ascertain Cablevision’s compliance with the terms of the Franchise and to consider the effect of
the proposed Transfer on the health,
safety and welfare of the citizens of
the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, after reviewing Cablevision’s compliance with the Franchise
and performing a due diligence review of Adelphia’s technical, legal and
financial ability to perform the obligations of the Franchise, which reviews included public hearings, representatives of City Council, Cablevision and Adelphia have been and
are continuing to negotiate in good
faith relevant terms and conditions
to address issues of past compliance,
the ability of Adelphia to perform
under this Franchise and any new
franchise upon the Franchise’s expiration on September 15, 2001 and
other issues raised by the proposed
Transfer, but have not yet reached
agreement on such terms; and

The City Record
Whereas, City Council, pursuant
to Section 617 of the federal Cable
Act [47 U.S.C. 537], must act on the
request to approve the Transfer of
the Franchise within one hundred
twenty (120) days of receiving a
complete FCC Form 394, which time
period expires on August 8, 2000, or
the Council will lose its rights with
respect to the proposed Transfer
since the Transfer shall be deemed
approved if no action is taken prior
to said date of August 8, 2000, or
unless an extension of time is
agreed to by the parties; and
Whereas, this Council has determined that it is not in its best interest to approve the Transfer until the
City Council, Cablevision and Adelphia have resolved, and reached
agreement on, the appropriate terms
and conditions of the Transfer; and
Whereas, City Council intends to
continue negotiating in good faith
with Cablevision and Adelphia for
resolution
of
such
issues
but,
because an extension of time has
not been agreed to, Council has
determined to deny its consent to
the Transfer at this time in order to
retain its rights under federal law
by acting on Cablevision’s and Adelphia’s request within the time period allowed by the Cable Act so that
the City Council, Cablevision and
Adelphia can reach agreement on
certain appropriate terms and conditions of the Transfer as described
above; and
Whereas, this Council has established a regular meeting schedule in
July and August 2000 to accommodate a reconsideration of this Ordinance, if appropriate, and to assure
that this Ordinance takes effect, if
necessary, in a timely manner; and
Whereas, this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City of
Cleveland; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland that:
Section 1. That the City of Cleveland, in order to retain its full
rights under the federal Cable Act
with respect to the proposed Transfer, hereby denies and disapproves
the Transfer of the Franchise from
Cablevision to Adelphia Cleveland
LLC pending continued negotiation
and resolution of appropriate terms
and conditions of issues raised by
the Transfer.
Section 2. That this Council will
reconsider the request to consent to
Transfer the Franchise from Cablevision to Adelphia Cleveland LLC
and may determine to approve the
Transfer if this Council is able to
negotiate and resolve appropriate
terms and conditions of issues related to the Transfer with Cablevision
and Adelphia.
Section 3. That it is found and
determined that all formal actions
by the Council concerning and relating to the adoption of this Ordinance
were adopted in an open meeting of
this Council and that all deliberations of this Council, and of any of
its committees that resulted in such

to the public in compliance with all

An emergency resolution urging
the Immigration and Naturalization
Service to launch a vigorous investigation into the granting of asylum
to two generals, Jose Guillermo Garcia and Carlos Vides Casanova, high
ranking members of the El
Salvadoran army.
Whereas, in December, 1980, four
American citizens were murdered in
El Salvador while helping the poor
and refugees of that country that
were trying to live a life free of
oppression; and
Whereas, two of the four women

Casanova, high ranking members of

Whereas, the Ohio General Assembly established the Health Care
Assurance Program (HCAP) approximately 10 years ago to assist
in funding the provision of charity
care in Ohio hospitals; and
Whereas, the distribution of the
HCAP funds are currently governed
by a formula determined by the
Ohio Hospital Association, members
of the hospital industry; and
Whereas, the Ohio Hospital Association recently announced a new
formula that would drastically cut
the funding of MetroHealth Medical
Center by $5.9 million, a decrease of
approximately 15% from the prior
year’s funding; and

adversely
impacted

northeast
Ohio
include
Community
Health
Partners (Lorain), Lake Hospital,
Huron Road Hopsital and Robinson
Memorial (Portage); and

reject the Ohio Hospital Association
formula.

develop an equitable formula based
on the original guiding priniciples
that had previously governed the
successful distribution of Health
Care Assurance funds.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
