the adoption of laws prohibiting the
sale of alcohol near schools and
churches.
Whereas, it has been estimated
that the costs attributable to alcohol
problems in America exceed $70 billion per year; and
Whereas, according to the Department of Health and Human Services,
alcohol is implicated in nearly half
of all deaths caused by motor vehicle crashes and fatal intentional
injuries, and victims are intoxicated
in approximately one-third of all
homicides, drownings and boating
deaths; and
Whereas, the use of alcohol has
been shown to jeopardize physical,
mental and social development during the formative years and to
endanger the successful transition
from school to the workplace; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
Governor Robert Taft and the state
legislators to protect the youth of
Ohio by limiting their access and
proximity to the use of alcohol by
passing legislation prohibiting any
sale of alcohol within 500 feet of
any school or church or by passing
legislation allowing municipalities
to legislate such matters.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to transmit
a copy of this Resolution to Governor Robert Taft, Richard Finan,
President of the Ohio Senate, and
JoAnn Davidson, Speaker of the
Ohio House of Representatives, and
the Minority Leader of the Ohio Senate and House of Representatives.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

By Councilmen Cimperman and
Lewis.
An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting
new Section 341.07, thereof, relating
to pedestrian retail area restrictions.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
and safety in that Cleveland’s older
downtown buildings are in immediate demand for conversion and use
as
telecommunications
switching
terminals by intensely competitive
telecommunications equipment company; the impact of the above-referenced intense competition could be
numerous permit applications within the next several weeks for use of
first floor space in Cleveland’s
downtown retail districts for the
placement
of
telecommunications
switching equipment; the placement
of
telecommunications
switching
equipment on first floor spaces in
Cleveland’s downtown retail districts
would
significantly
harm
those retail districts because this
use does not generate pedestrian
traffic, which is essential to a vital
urban retail district; additionally,
the placement of telecommunications switching equipment on first
floor spaces in Cleveland’s downtown retail district could decrease
the safety of that district by lessening pedestrian traffic and surveillance opportunities; now therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That of the Codified
Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
are hereby supplemented by enacting new Section 341.07 thereof, to
read as follows:
Section 341.07 Pedestrian Retail
Area Restrictions
(a) Purpose. The regulations of
this
section
are
established
to
achieve, among others, the following
purposes.
(1) ensuring the continued economic viability of retail corridors
that depend on the patronage of customers who seek a shopping environment that is convenient and comfortable for pedestrians;
(2) enhancing the vitality of
downtown streets, thereby strengthening the district’s attractiveness as
a location for residences, offices and
tourism;
(3) increasing the marketability
of housing located on upper floors
of historic buildings in the district;
(4) providing necessary retail services to downtown residents and
office workers;
(5) reducing traffic congestion by
allowing downtown residents and
employees to patronize retail busi-

804

April 26, 2000
nesses by walking rather than by
traveling in automobiles or other
vehicles;
(6) furthering economic development in the City of Cleveland and
providing additional employment for
City residents.
(b) Applicability. The regulations
of this section shall apply to the
ground floor or “street-level floor
area” of any property located both
in the Public Land Protective District and in a Retail Business District on a “pedestrian-oriented shopping street,” as defined herein. No
use in such location shall be established or changed except in accordance with the provisions of this
section.
(c) Pedestrian-Oriented Shopping
Street. A “pedestrian oriented shopping street” is any side of any block
of a street characterized by a predominance of retail businesses situated at or near the public sidewalk.
The City Planning Commission shall
prepare and adopt a map designating pedestrian-oriented streets within the area to which the regulations
of this section apply. The Planning
Commission shall review and update
that map periodically. The Planning
Commission shall also consider for
designation as a pedestrian-oriented
shopping street any block that is
designated for retail use in the
adopted general plan for the development and improvement of the
City, regardless of the current uses
located on that block.
(d) Referral by Division of Build ing and Housing. The Division of
Building and Housing shall refer to
the City Planning Commission any
application
for
establishment
or
change of a ground floor use in a
building located both in the Public
Land Protective District and in a
Retail Business District.
(e) Planning Commission Deter mination. Upon receipt of an application to establish a new street-level
use in a location subject to the provisions of this section, the City Planning Commission shall determine
whether the space is located on a
pedestrian-oriented
street
and
whether the proposed use is permitted by the regulations of this section. The Commission shall make its
determination within thirty (30)
days of receipt of a complete application,
unless
the
applicant
approves an extension of time.
(f) Prohibited Uses. Street-level
floor area in a building located on
a
pedestrian-oriented
shopping
street, as determined by the City
Planning Commission in accordance
with the provisions of this section,
shall not be occupied principally for
purposes of storage or warehousing
or operation of telecommunications
devices, telephone switching equipment or other automated or remotely controlled machinery or equipment.
(g) Facade and Window Treat ment. If any uses prohibited in
street-level areas are proposed for
upper floors in buildings subject to
the provisions of this section, the
City Planning Commission or, if
applicable, the Landmarks Commission during its review shall ensure
that the entire facade and window
areas are treated in a manner that
does not convey the appearance of
a space used for storage or warehousing purposes, but rather conveys the appearance of a space used
actively by employees, customers or
residents.
(h) Nonconforming Uses. Legallyestablished uses made nonconform-

April 26, 2000
ing by the initial adoption of this
section may continue but may not
be expanded or otherwise changed
so as to create a greater degree of
nonconformity, unless approved by
the Board of Zoning Appeals in
accordance with Chapter 359.
(i) For any use subject to the regulations of this section, no exhaust
vents shall be placed along the designated
pedestrian-oriented
shopping street on the first floor, second
floor or in the sidewalk area. Furthermore, any emergency generator
for such use shall be powered by
natural gas, as opposed to diesel
power, or by other means that minimize fumes and smoke.
(j) Exceptions. Notwithstanding
the variance powers outlined in Section 329.03, the Board of Zoning
Appeals may vary or modify the
application of these provisions in
harmony with the general purpose
and intent of the Zoning Code so
that
the
public
health,
safety,
morals and general welfare may be
safeguarded and substantial justice
done. The decision to vary or modify the application of these provisions shall consider the following
factors: (1) the proximity of the proposed use to the pedestrian-oriented
street frontage, in the case of a use
that will occupy only a portion of
the street-level floor space; (2) the
physical size, shape or other characteristics of the premises; and (3)
whether refusal of the variance
appealed for will deprive the owner
of substantial property rights.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
