RESOLUTION
Res. No. 1333-98.
By Councilman Coats.
An emergency resolution urging
the adoption of laws prohibiting the
sale of alcohol near schools and
churches.
Whereas, it has been estimated
that the costs attributable to alcohol
problems in America exceed $70 billion per year; and
Whereas, according to the Department of Health and Human Services,
alcohol is implicated in nearly half
of all deaths caused by motor vehicle crashes and fatal intentional
injuries, and victims are intoxicated
in approximately one-third of all
homicides, drownings and boating
deaths; and
Whereas, the use of alcohol has
been shown to jeopardize physical,
mental and social development during the formative years and to
endanger the successful transition
from school to the workplace; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
urges Governor Robert Taft and
the state legislators to protect the

675

15
youth of Ohio by limiting their
access and proximity to the use of
alcohol by passing legislation prohibiting any sale of alcohol within 500 feet of any school or church
or by passing legislation allowing
municipalities to legislate such
matters.
Section 2. That the Clerk of
Council
is hereby requested to
transmit a copy of this Resolution
to Governor Robert Taft, Richard
Finan, President of the Ohio Senate,
and JoAnn Davidson, Speaker of
the Ohio House of Representatives,
and the Minority Leader of the Ohio
Senate and House of Representatives.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

An emergency resolution urging
the State of Ohio use funds from the
tobacco settlement to convert Mt.
Sinai-East, Mt. Sinai-Univeristy Circle, St. Michael, and Deaconess Hospital from for profit-to-not-for-profit
facilities.
Whereas, over the past recent
weeks the Greater Cleveland community has seen the results of an
antiquated
regulatory
health
delivery system that has resulted
in the proposed closure of Mt.
Sinai-East,
Mt.
Sinai-University
Circle, and St. Michael as well as
the possible sale of Deaconess
Hospital; and
Whereas, these proposed closings
will have a detrimental impact in
Cleveland inner city neighborhoods
since the residents that reside in
these communities must now travel
outside
their
neighborhood
to
receive health care services at other
suburban hospitals; and
Whereas, these hospital closings
have resulted in the closure of emergency rooms and trauma centers,
which
drastically
decrease
the
accessibility of emergency medical
care to residents in the City of
Cleveland; and

April 12, 2000
Whereas, these hospital closings
have greatly reduced the accessibility of hospital care to the City’s population of indigent, elderly, and
working poor who reside in Cleveland and are in most need for medical services; and
Whereas,
State
Representative
John E. Barnes has proffered a plan
to eradicate an antiquated regulatory health delivery system that has
resulted in hospital closings by
proposing
that
specific
funding
streams be used for these hospitals
in order to keep them open; and
Whereas, a resolution has been
introduced in the State General
Assembly by State Representative
John E. Barnes urging the State of
Ohio to use funds from the tobacco
settlement to prevent to the closings
of these hospitals; and
Whereas, this resolution calls for
the State to use these specific funds
for converting these hospitals from
for-profit to not-for-profit facilities
as well as providing direct capital
assistance and bonds totaling $100
million to implement such conversion; and
Whereas,
this
resolution
also
urges the State to set aside $10
million from the Victims of Violent
Crimes fund to reestablish the
trauma care unit at Mt. Sinai-University Circle and emergency room
care at other hospitals serving victims of violent crime and to establish Health and Economic Solvency Commissions to review long
term implications of acquisitions
that convert not-for-profit hospitals
to for-profit hospitals; now therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland supports the resolution proffered by Representative Barnes urging the State of
Ohio to use funds from the tobacco settlement to convert Mt. SinaiEast, Mt. Sinai-University Circle,

institutions open to serve the residents in their respective communities.
