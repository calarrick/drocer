severely restrict the bind over discretion privilege of juvenile court
judges and give it to the county
prosecutors; and

are already entwined in the prison
system and often lose hope for living a productive and meaningful
life; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

stinging
indictment
against
all
Ohio’s children and strongly urges
Governor Robert Taft to veto this
legislation.

transmit two certified copies of this
resolution to Ohio Governor Robert
Taft.

all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 1605-2000.
By Councilman Rybka (by request).
An emergency resolution declaring the intention to vacate a portion
of East 73rd Place.
Whereas, this Council; is satisfied
that there is good cause to vacate a
portion of East 73rd Place, as hereinafter described; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That it hereby declares
its intention to vacate the following
described real property:
Situated in the City of Cleveland,
County of Cuyahoga and State of
Ohio, and known as being all that
portion of EAST 73RD PLACE (40.00

feet
wide),
extending
Southerly
from the Southerly line of Aetna
Road S.E. (40.00 feet wide) to its
Southerly terminus.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted November 27, 2000.
Effective December 7, 2000.

Res. No. 1690-2000.
By Councilmen Dolan, O’Malley,
Rybka, Melena, Polensek, Patmon,
Lewis and Coats.
An emergency resolution strongly
opposing proposed mergers of major
air carriers including the proposed
merger of US Airways and United
Airlines and urging the U.S. Senate
to disapprove said proposed merger
as not being in the public interest.
Whereas, airport authorities, consumer groups, economists, and many
members of Congress have raised
many problems with the proposed
merger of United Airlines and US
Airways; and
Whereas, most observers agree
that the United Airlines/US Airways
merger would be the beginning of a
final industry consolidation that
could result in only three major carriers
(eg.
American/Northwest;
Delta/Continental/TWA; and United/US Airways) serving 80-90% of
domestic air travelers; and
Whereas, approval of proposed
mergers such as that of United Airlines and US Airways would substantially
reduce
competition
at
most airports, potentially increase
air fares for local travelers and
adversely affect existing relationships between airlines and airports;
and
Whereas, approval of proposed
mergers such as that of United Airlines and US Airways would cause
all airports to have a more difficult
time attracting low fare competitors;
and
Whereas,
such
mergers
could
enable the three remaining air carriers, without violating antitrust
laws, to divide the U.S. market into
three locational monopolies where
they would have absolute control of
pricing and schedules; and
Whereas, on July 25, 2000, Senate
Commerce
Committee
Chairman
McCain and Aviation Subcommittee
Chairman Gorton introduced Resolution 344 stating that the United Airlines/US Airways merger is not in
the public interest and should be
disapproved; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
strongly opposes proposed mergers
of major air carriers, including the
proposed merger of United Airlines
and US Airways and urges the U.S.
Senate to follow Resolution 344 calling for the disapproval of the United
Airlines/US Airways merger as not
being in the public interest.

December 13, 2000

Voinovich; to U.S. Representatives
Dennis Kucinich, Stephanie TubbsJones,
Sherrod
Brown,
Steven
LaTourette and Ralph Regula to
Airports Council International —
North America, and to Association of
American Airport Executives.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted December 4, 2000.
Effective December 13, 2000.

Res. No. 1813-2000.

Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That it hereby declares

described real property:
Situated in the City of Cleveland,

Ohio, and known as being all that

wide) to its intersection with the

N.E. (50.00 feet wide) and the Westerly line of East 55th Street (100.00

Section 665.16 Watch Area Designation
(a) Upon consideration of the factors listed in division (b) of Section
665.17, the Fair Housing Board may
designate, by a simple majority, any
area of the City as a “watch area”.

The City Record
A watch area designation shall signify that the area is sensitive to
change and that real estate brokers,
agents, salespersons or other persons who are licensed or required to
be licensed pursuant to Chapter 4735
of the Revised Code are advised to
solicit the area only with due caution. Whenever an area of the City
is designated as a watch area, the
Fair Housing Board shall monitor
the situation and actively work
towards eliminating or reducing the
factors that caused the area to be
designated as a watch area. In any
area designated as a watch area,
the Fair Housing Board may seek a
voluntary real estate solicitation
moratorium for such length of time
as appropriate, but only if such voluntary moratorium is warranted in
the opinion of the Fair Housing
Board by the circumstances in a
given watch area.
(b) At any time that an area is
not under a non-solicitation area
designation
pursuant
to
Section
665.17, the Fair Housing Board may
cancel a watch area designation if
it finds that the factors that caused
the area to be designated as a
watch area have been eliminated or
reduced and that the designation is
no longer warranted.
(c) Upon each designation or cancellation of a watch area, the Fair
Housing Board shall promptly notify the Mayor and the Council, in
writing, and publish a notice in the
City Record or newspaper of general circulation describing the boundaries of the area by reference to
streets, census tracts or common
landmarks. Each designation or cancellation shall take effect upon publication. The Fair Housing Board
shall maintain a list of designated
watch areas and make it available
to any person upon request.
Section 665.17 Non-solicitation
(a) No real estate broker, agent,
sales representative or other person
who is licensed or required to be
licensed pursuant to Chapter 4735 of
the Revised Code shall solicit the
owner or occupant of any housing
accommodation located within a
non-solicitation area designed by the
Fair Housing Board.
(b) Any area that the Fair Housing Board has designated as a
watch area may be designated as a
non-solicitation area for an initial
period of up to forty-five (45) days
upon making written findings based
on substantial evidence introduced
at a public hearing that real estate
solicitation in the area is or is likely to cause or contribute to blockbusting or panic selling. A vote of
two-thirds (2/3) of the Fair Housing
Board is needed in order to designate an area as a non-solicitation
area. In determining whether a nonsolicitation area should be designated, the Fair Housing Board shall
consider the following factors, and
such other factors it may deem
appropriate, as they pertain to the
area under consideration:
(1) the frequency of real estate
solicitation;
(2) the content of the solicitations;
(3) the racial composition and
rate of racial changes;
(4) the frequency of home sales
and other real estate activity; and
(5) the number, severity and history of racial incidents.
(c) The Fair Housing Board may
extend the designation of a non-

3070

December 13, 2000
solicitation area for one (1) additional consecutive period of fortyfive (45) days upon making written
findings based on substantial evidence that continuation of the solicitation ban is warranted. If an area
is designated as a non-solicitation
area and the designation is extended one more time, the designation
shall cease after the extension
expires.
(d) The Fair Housing Board may,
following a public hearing, cancel
the designation of a non-solicitation
area or extension of any such designation made pursuant to this section.
(e) If the designation of a nonsolicitation area expires without
extension or is canceled, or if an
extension made pursuant to division
(a) of this section expires or is canceled, the Fair Housing Board may,
no earlier than ninety (90) days following such expiration or cancellation, designate the area anew as a
non-solicitation area pursuant to
division (b) of this section.
(f) Upon expiration or cancellation of a designation or extension of
a non-solicitation area, the area
shall remain a watch area until the
watch area designation is canceled
by the Fair Housing Board pursuant
to division (b) of Section 665.16.
(g) Upon each designation, extension or cancellation made pursuant
to this section, the Fair Housing
Board shall promptly notify the
Mayor and Council in writing and
publish a notice in the City Record
or newspaper of general circulation
describing the boundaries of the
area by reference to streets, census,
tracts, or common landmarks. Each
designation or cancellation shall
take effect upon publication. The
Fair Housing Board shall maintain
a list of designated non-solicitation
areas and make it available to any
person upon request.
Section 665.18 Pattern or Practice
of Discrimination
Whenever the Fair Housing Board
has reasonable cause to believe that
any person or persons are engaged
in a pattern or practice of resistance
to a person’s or persons’ full enjoyment of the rights granted by Section 665.03 or 665.19, of this chapter,
or that any group of persons has
been denied any of the rights granted by such section and the denial
raises an issue of public policy, the
Fair Housing Board may refer the
matter to the Director of Law for
commencement of a civil action in a
court of competent jurisdiction on
behalf of the City. The Director of
Law may seek any relief considered
necessary to ensure the full enjoyment of the rights granted by this
chapter.

of housing accommodations by any
influence, suggestion, act or failure
to act, or accord any differential
treatment among such persons, in
connection with the sale or rental of
housing accommodations or in the
furnishing of information, services,
or facilities relative thereto because

disability, ethnic group, Vietnam-era
or disabled veteran status, familial
status, marital status or ancestry of
any person.

Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,

years 1980 through 1989 was taxicab
driver/chauffeur, with a rate 21
times the national average; and
Whereas, among the measures
suggested by the CDC and NIOSH
for reducing occupational homicides
is the use of bullet-proof barriers or
enclosures, or the use of surveillance cameras; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
