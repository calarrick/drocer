By Councilmen Cimperman and
Lewis (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting
new Section 341.07, thereof, relating
to pedestrian retail area restrictions.
Approved by Directors of City
Planning, Law; Relieved of Committee on Legislation; Recommended by
Committee on City Planning; when
amended as follows:
1. Strike the whereas clause in its
entirety and insert in lieu thereof
the following:
“Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
and safety in that Cleveland’s older
downtown buildings are in immediate demand for conversion and use
as
telecommunications
switching
terminals by intensely competitive
telecommunications equipment company; the impact of the above-referenced intense competition could be
numerous permit applications within the next several weeks for use of
first floor space in Cleveland’s
downtown retail districts for the
placement
of
telecommunications
switching equipment; the placement
of
telecommunications
switching
equipment on first floor spaces in
Cleveland’s downtown retail districts
would
significantly
harm
those retail districts because this
use does not generate pedestrian
traffic, which is essential to a vital
urban retail district; additionally,
the placement of telecommunications switching equipment on first
floor spaces in Cleveland’s downtown retail district could decrease
the safety of that district by lessening pedestrian traffic and surveillance opportunities; now therefore,”.
2. In Section 1, at division (c) of
Section 341.07, at the end, add the
following new sentence: “The Planning Commission shall also consider for designation as a pedestrianoriented shopping street any block
that is designated for retail use in
the adopted general plan for the

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 825-97.
By Councilman Lewis.
An emergency resolution urging
Governor Taft, the State Auditor,
the Board of County Commissioners
and the County Auditor to audit the
tax payments of gas and
oil well
operators
and
collect
delinquent
taxes for the benefit of the Cleveland public schools.
Whereas, Ohio law classifies oil
and natural gas as real property
subject to real property taxes;
and
Whereas, state law requires Ohio
counties to compile a list annually
of oil and gas wells throughout the
state; and
Whereas, the only oil and gas
wells in county records are those
reported by the operators of the
wells; and
Whereas, a similar honor system
is used to assess the proper taxes to
be paid since the data used to compile the taxes is supplied by the suppliers and not audited by the county or state; and
Whereas, it is estimated that only
a fraction of the returns are being
filed by the well operators and only
a fraction of the tax due is being
paid; and
Whereas, there is little initiative
for counties to trace delinquent producers since about 80% of the
money collected would go to public
schools, not the county; and
Whereas, strict enforcement of
the tax laws with respect to oil and
gas wells in Cuyahoga County could
be a badly needed source of revenue
for the Cleveland school system;
and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health or safety in that all
potential sources of revenue to
benefit
the
Cleveland
public
schools must be explored; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
Governor Taft, the State Auditor,
the Board of County Commissioners
and the County Auditor to audit the
tax payments of gas and oil well
operators
and
collect
delinquent
taxes for the benefit of public
school systems, including the Cleveland public schools.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Governor
Taft, the State Auditor, the Board of
County
Commissioners
and
the
County Auditor.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted April 10, 2000.
Effective April 17, 2000, without
the signature of the Mayor.

The City Record
Res. No. 424-2000.
By Councilman Lewis.
An emergency resolution requesting that Betty Montgomery, Ohio
Attorney General, investigate the
rash of hospital closures and proposed closures in the City of Cleveland to determine whether any violation of state law has occurred.
Whereas, this Council is greatly
concerned about the level of care
provided to the residents of the City
of Cleveland by the hospitals located within our City; and
Whereas, it has been recently
reported in the Plain Dealer that
several hospitals within our City are
failing to provide accessible health
care to the indigent and working
poor residents of our City; and
Whereas, the charters to operate
hospitals are granted by the State
of Ohio and, as such, are governed
by the leaders of our state; and
Whereas, The Cleveland Clinic
Foundation has demonstrated a lack
of concern and failure to provide
accessible health care for many of
the residents of Cleveland; and
Whereas, this Council requests
that Betty Montgomery, Ohio Attorney General, investigate the rash of
hospital closures and proposed closures in the City of Cleveland to
determine whether any violation of
state law has occurred; and
Whereas,
this
Council
also
requests
that
Attorney
General
Montgomery review the charter of
The Cleveland Clinic Foundation to
determine whether it has fulfilled
its mission and duties thereunder,
and if warranted, to begin procedures to revoke their charter to
operate; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland requests that
Betty Montgomery, Ohio Attorney
General, investigate the rash of hospital closures and proposed closures
in the City of Cleveland to determine whether any violation of state
law has occurred and to review the
charter of The Cleveland Clinic
Foundation to determine whether it
has fulfilled its mission and duties
thereunder, and if warranted, to
begin procedures to revoke their
charter to operate.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby requested to forward a copy of
this
Resolution
to
Betty
Montgomery, Attorney General of the
State of Ohio.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted April 10, 2000.
Effective April 17, 2000, without
the signature of the Mayor.
