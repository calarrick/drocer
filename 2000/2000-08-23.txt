An emergency resolution urging
the federal government to require
labeling of genetically manipulated
foods and further urging a moratorium on the production of such foods
until acceptable testing systems are
in place.
Whereas, genetically engineered
foods have not yet been proven safe

Administration requires only that
companies producing such genetically engineered foods state, on the

safe with no further testing required, and

has been brought against the Food
and Drug Administration to prevent

August 23, 2000
it from continuing to rush such
untested foods on the market; and

and scientists have stated that the
technology
of
genetically
engineered foods is clearly different

lead to a host of undesirable health
and environmental problems; and

has potential negative effects in
genetic cross-pollination of beneficial plants, insects and other fragile
ecosystems;
