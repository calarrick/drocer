FIRST READING
ORDINANCE REFERRED
Ord. No. 1729-2000.
By Councilmen O’Malley, Polensek, Patmon and Cintron.
An ordinance conditionally approving the request to consent to
transfer the cable franchise from
Cablevision of Cleveland, L.P. to
Adelphia Cleveland LLC and approving the extension of the franchise.
Whereas, Cablevision of Cleveland, L.P., an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Cablevision Systems
Corp., (collectively, “Cablevision”)
has the right to own, operate and
maintain a cable system in the City
of Cleveland, Ohio pursuant to a
Franchise Agreement, effective on
or about September 16, 1986 (the
“Franchise Agreement”), as amended by the Amendment to Franchise
Agreement approved by this Council
by Ordinance No. 305-94, effective
March 9, 1994 (the “1994 Amendment,” and together with the Franchise Agreement and this Ordinance,
the “Franchise”), which Franchise
expires by its own terms on or about
September 15, 2001; and
Whereas,
Adelphia
Communications Corporation and Cablevision
entered into a Purchase Agreement
dated as of December 8, 1999 (the
“Purchase
Agreement”),
whereby
Adelphia Communications Corporation shall acquire Cablevision of
Cleveland, L.P. (the “Transaction”)
resulting in the transfer of the
Franchise from Cablevision to Adelphia Communications Corporation
(the “Transfer”), which Purchase
Agreement provides that subsequent
to the Transfer from Cablevision,
Adelphia Cleveland LLC, a whollyowned subsidiary of Adelphia Communications Corporation (collectively, “Adelphia”), will hold the Franchise and operate the cable system
in the City; and
Whereas, in February 2000, Cablevision and Adelphia submitted an
FCC Form 394 dated February 4,
2000 to the City, which described the

October 4, 2000
Purchase Agreement and Transfer
and requested that the City consent
to the proposed Transfer; and
Whereas, after reviewing the FCC
Form 394 and other information submitted by Cablevision and Adelphia,
the City determined that the FCC
Form
394
was
incomplete
and
requested
additional
information
from
Cablevision
and
Adelphia,
which information was provided, in
order for City Council to perform its
due diligence review of the technical, legal and financial ability of
Adelphia to perform the obligations
of the Franchise and consider the
effect of the proposed Transfer on
the health, safety and welfare of the
citizens of the City of Cleveland;
and
Whereas, after extensive review
of Cablevision’s compliance with the
Franchise and Adelphia’s technical,
legal and financial ability to perform the obligations of the Franchise, which review included public
hearings, this Council entered into
negotiations with Cablevision and
Adelphia
to
address
the
issues
raised by the proposed Transfer;
and
Whereas, City Council, pursuant
to Section 617 of the federal Cable
Act [47 U.S.C., 537], was required to
act on the request to approve the
Transfer of the Franchise within
one hundred twenty (120) days of
receiving a complete FCC Form 394,
which time period was to expire on
August 8, 2000, or the Council would
lose its rights with respect to the
proposed
Transfer,
because
the
Transfer would have been deemed
approved if no action was taken
prior to said date of August 8, 2000;
and
Whereas, despite negotiations by
representatives
of
City
Council,
Adelphia and Cablevision, the parties were unable to reach agreement
prior to August 8, 2000 on relevant
issues raised by the proposed Transfer including terms and conditions
to address issues of non-compliance
by Cablevision and the ability of
Adelphia to perform under this
Franchise; and
Whereas, in order to preserve its
rights under federal law by acting
on Cablevision’s and Adelphia's
request
within
the
time
period
allowed by the Cable Act, this Council determined, pursuant to Ordinance No. 1219-2000, passed July 17,
2000, that it was in the best interests of the residents and Subscribers
of Cleveland, to disapprove the
Transfer of the Franchise from
Cablevision to Adelphia; and
Whereas, after continued negotiations with Cablevision and Adelphia
to address the relevant issues raised
by the proposed Transfer, this Council has determined that it is in the
best interests of the residents and
Subscribers of Cleveland to approve
the Transfer of the Franchise from
Cablevision to Adelphia provided
that Cablevision and Adelphia are
willing to accept certain terms and
conditions of the Transfer as set
forth in this Ordinance, and to execute the Franchise Transfer Ordinance
Acceptances
(the
“Acceptances”) attached as File No. 17292000-A; and
Whereas, Cablevision and Adelphia have agreed to accept such
terms and conditions and to execute
the
Acceptances;
Adelphia
has
agreed to execute the Guaranty
attached as File No. 1729-2000-B; and
the parties have agreed to extend
the date of the expiration of the

Res. No. 1650-2000.
By Councilman Brady.
An emergency resolution urging
Vocational Guidance Services to
comply with all legal requirements
to permit workers to seek union
organization and representation.
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland, through passage of
numerous pieces of legislation, has
recognized the rights of all workers
to seek safe, fair working conditions
and to be paid equitably for their
work; and
Whereas,
this
Council
has
acknowledged the existence and
need for federal laws protecting the
rights of workers and ensuring their
ability to seek union representation,
if desired; and
Whereas, with the assistance of
Local 47, SEIU, the workers of Vocational
Guidance
Services
have
joined together for the purposes of
choosing a union to better their
wages, benefits and working conditions when performing janitorial
services at the Anthony J. Celebrezze Federal Building; and
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland supports the rights of
all workers, as provided by the law,
to seek union representation and
urges Vocational Guidance Services
to comply with all laws governing
union organization and representation; now therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland urges Vocational
Guidance Services to comply with
all legal requirements providing
workers with a fair, non-confrontational, and expedient method for
determining
whether
they
want
union representation.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby requested to transmit a copy of
this resolution to Robert Comben,
President and CEO of Vocational
Guidance Services and Michael Murphy, President Local 47.
Section 3. That this resolution is

Effective September 28, 2000, without the signature of the Mayor.

price since the Gulf War crisis 10
years ago, and threatens to go even
higher over the coming weeks and
months; and
Whereas, the high level of oil
prices has already led to massive
social conflict and economic hardship in western Europe and other
parts of the world; and
Whereas, the high level of oil
prices threatens severe economic
hardship against the citizens of
Cleveland this Winter, especially
the elderly and those on fixed
incomes since home heating oil
prices have increased by an average
of 50% over the past 12 months, and
skyrocketing energy prices could
cause a hyper-inflationary explosion
throughout the economy; and
Whereas, oil prices have continued to rise despite increased production by OPEC countries, suggesting that other factors, such as
speculation in oil price futures and
other markets, are to blame for the
oil price crisis; and
Whereas, the skyrocketing of oil
prices began just weeks after the
purchase of AMOCO by British
Petroleum in August 1998, and a
merger of oil giants Exxon and
Mobil in December 1998, leading to
suspicion that oil markets are being
manipulated upwards, to generate
the super-profits needed to pay the
massive cost of mergers and acquisitions among multinational corporations; now therefore:
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges the President of the United States, and the
United States Congress, to take
emergency action to reduce oil prices,
including an investigation of possible market manipulation through
speculation or other unfair practices, and the possibility of bypassing the oil multinational corporations completely, by negotiating
government-to-government purchasing agreements directly with the oilproducing countries.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby is directed to
transmit two certified copies of this
resolution to the President of the
United States, the United States Congress and the Mayor of the City of
Cleveland, urging them to take
emergency action to reduce oil
prices, and to investigate the possibility
of
market
manipulation
through
speculation
and
other
unfair practices.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all members of Council, it shall take
effect and be in force immediately
upon its adoption and approval by
the Mayor; otherwise, it shall be in
force from and after the earliest
period allowed by law.
Adopted September 25, 2000.

Permit No. 4173863, JCK Johns Inc.,
DBA Mrs Lounge, 3876 East 65th
Street, 1st Fl. & Bsmt., Cleveland,
Ohio 44105; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
safety and welfare pursuant to Section 4303.26 of the Ohio Revised
Code. Council’s objection to said
permit must be received by the
Director of Liquor Control within
30 days of notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby record its objection to the transfer of ownership of a D5 Liquor Permit to Permit No. 7503002, Ron Mar
East 65th Street Inc., DBA Mrs.

Ohio 44105 and requests the Director
of Liquor Control to set a hearing
for said application in accordance
with provisions of Section 4303.26 of
the Revised Code of Ohio.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby is directed to
transmit two certified copies of this
resolution, together with two copies
of a letter of objection and two
copies of a letter requesting that the
hearing be held in Cleveland, Cuyahoga County.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

The City Record
Res. No. 1704-2000.
By Councilman White.
An emergency resolution urging
the Governor of Ohio to implement
a food stamp waiver for Ohio’s labor
surplus areas to assist working
adults.
Whereas, across the country, families are facing hardships of moving
from welfare to work as a result of
the welfare reform policy; and
Whereas, in 1999, 40 percent of
Ohio families receiving public assistance were from the 19 counties in
Northeast Ohio, which makes this
region one of the most severely
impacted by welfare reform; and
Whereas, changes implemented as
a result of welfare reform have
caused much confusion about who is
eligible for food stamps; and
Whereas, the state of Ohio’s food
stamp application process is already
an intricate one, which is further
complicated by the requirement that
working individuals must reapply
for eligibility every three months;
and
Whereas, the length and requirements of the application make it a
difficult process for many people,
especially the working poor; and
Whereas, a recent nationwide poll
of low-income individuals eligible
for food stamps showed that 75 percent were not aware of their eligibility; and
Whereas, 80 percent of the food
stamp reductions in Cuyahoga County in 1999 were from City of Cleveland residents; and
Whereas, over 60 percent of those
receiving food stamps nationally are
children or elderly; and
Whereas, four years ago, the food
banks in Ohio were successful in
having a line item placed into the
state budget for $1.5 million to be
distributed annually to Ohio food
banks for the purchase of food; and
Whereas it was the position of the
Ohio food banks that public dollars
formerly being spent on food stamps
be made available to food providers;
and
Whereas, the Greater Cleveland
Committee on Hunger is urging a
permanent line item for the Ohio
Food Purchase Program; and
Whereas, according to federal legislation, states are given the opportunity to seek waivers of food stamp
eligibility for individuals in geographic areas with high unemployment rates or an insufficient number of jobs; and
Whereas, the state of Ohio has
been granted such wavier and the
Governor of Ohio has declined to
implement it; and
Whereas, through the implementation of a food stamp waiver for
Ohio’s labor surplus areas, Cleveland, which currently qualify as a
labor surplus area could provide
food stamp benefits for eligible residents; now, therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland strongly urges
Ohio Governor Robert Taft to implement a food stamp waiver for Ohio’s
labor surplus areas to assist working adults and provide food stamp
benefits to eligible residents.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby is directed to
transmit two certified copies of this
resolution to Ohio Governor Robert
Taft, urging him to implement a
food stamp waiver for Ohio’s labor

adults and provide food stamp benefits to eligible residents.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

An emergency ordinance authorizing the acquisition and disposition
of
real
property
and
the
improvements located thereon comprising
Longwood
Apartments,
accepting a grant from the United
States Department of Housing and
Urban Development in connection
with the redevelopment of that property, authorizing agreements with
the United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and
with new Longwood Associates L.P.
in connection therewith and authorizing and approving related matters.

of 1978, 12 U.S.C. §1701z-11, as
amended by Section 101(b) of the
Multifamily Housing Property Disposition Reform Act of 1994 (as so
amended, the “Act”) and regulations
promulgated pursuant thereto (the
“Regulations”), the United States
Department of Housing and Urban
Development, acting by and through
the Secretary of Housing and Urban

2442

October 4, 2000
Development (“HUD”), has determined to dispose of certain real
property, the improvements thereon
and a Housing Assistance Payments
(“HAP”) contract, tenant leases and
other
personal
property
related
thereto, all located in the City of
Cleveland (the “City”) known as
Longwood Apartments (collectively,
the “Property”); and
Whereas, pursuant to the Act and
the Regulations, HUD has determined that it is necessary and
appropriate to make available an
up-front grant in an amount presently
estimated
not
to
exceed
$25,160,000 in connection with demolition,
rebuilding,
redevelopment
and other related development of
the Property; and
Whereas, in order to provide the
up-front grant in the most economically
efficient
manner
possible,
HUD wishes to convey title to the
Property to the City pursuant to a
Contract for Sale (the “HUD Contract for Sale”) between HUD and
the City, and to make the up-front
grant available pursuant to an
Upfront
Grant
Agreement
(the
“Grant Agreement”) between HUD
and the City, a copy of which is in
File No. 1574-2000-A (the “File”); and
Whereas, New Longwood Associates L.P., or its designated successors or assigns (the “Developer”)
has offered to purchase the Property from the City and to redevelop a
portion of the Property into a multifamily housing complex containing
629 affordable living units, together
with related and supporting facilities, at an estimated total development
cost
of
approximately
$110,000,000; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that the acquisition of the Property
from HUD pursuant to the HUD Contract for Sale and the sale of the
Property to the Developer by private
negotiation and the redevelopment
of the Property by the Developer
pursuant to a Redevelopment Agreement (the “Redevelopment Agreement”) is in the best interest of the
City and is the best means of accomplishing the necessary redevelopment of the Property in order to
carry out the City’s public purpose
of providing safe, decent and sanitary affordable housing in the City;
and
Whereas, in order to complete the
redevelopment of the Property in
accordance with the Act, the Regulations
and
the
Redevelopment
Agreement, the City intends to loan
the proceeds of the up-front grant to
the Developer pursuant to the Redevelopment
Agreement
and
upon
mutually agreeable terms and conditions as provided in the Redevelopment Agreement; and
Whereas, this Council finds that
the proposed acquisition, sale and
redevelopment of the Property will
improve the welfare of the City and
its residents by accomplishing the
aforesaid public purpose; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. This Council determines
that, in order to carry out the City’s
public purpose of providing safe,
decent and sanitary affordable housing in the City, and notwithstanding
and as an exception to any provision of the Codified Ordinances of
the City, the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies and the Direc-

October 4, 2000
tor of Community Development, as

accept the up-front grant on behalf
of the City.
The grant proceeds
are hereby appropriated for the
purposes set forth in the Grant
Agreement and the Redevelopment
Agreement.
Section 3. This Council finds and
determines that, in order to carry
out the City’s public purpose of providing safe, decent and sanitary
affordable housing in the City, it is
necessary and appropriate to sell
the Property to the Developer and
cause its redevelopment through the
demolition,
rebuilding,
equipping
and improvement of the Property to
be made by the Developer.
Section 4. Notwithstanding and as
an exception to any provision of the
Codified Ordinances of the City, this
Council finds and determines that
disposition of the Property by negotiated sale is in the City’s best interests; authorizes the disposition of
the Property by negotiation, subject
to approval by the Board of Control;
and approves the Redevelopment
Agreement and the conveyance of
the Property to the Developer and
the loan of the up-front grant proceeds to the Developer upon the
terms and conditions set forth in the
Redevelopment
Agreement.
This
Council authorizes and directs the
Mayor and the Director of Community Development, or either one of
them, to execute and deliver, on
behalf of the City the Redevelopment Agreement in substantially the
form now on file with the Clerk of
Council in the File, with such
changes or amendments that are not
inconsistent with this Ordinance and
that are approved by the Director of
Community
Development
as
not
being substantially adverse to the
City, with signing and delivery of
the Redevelopment Agreement, or
amendments thereto, being conclusive evidence of such approval. This
Council authorizes and directs the
Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies, the Mayor and the Director of
Community Development, as appropriate to execute and deliver to the
Developer, upon satisfaction of the
applicable conditions precedent set
forth in the Redevelopment Agreement, a quit-claim deed (the “Deed”)
and related assignments, bills of
sale or other agreements conveying
the Property (including the HAP

The City Record
contract, the leases and the other
personal property related to the
operation and maintenance of the
Project) to the Developer; provided
that Deed shall contain such restrictive covenants, reversionary interests or similar provisions as may, in
the judgment of the Director of
Community
Development,
be
required to ensure the elimination of
blight and deterioration and for the
prevention of recurrence of said conditions, and shall specifically contain a provision against the creation
of advertising signs or billboards
other than permitted identification
signs.
The Developer shall be required
by the Redevelopment Agreement,
Deed or other writing to meet the
following terms in addition to all
other requirements imposed upon
the Developer:
(1) To use best efforts to meet the
following Minority Business Enterprise and Female Business Enterprise
subcontractor participation goals:
30% MBE; and
10% FBE.
(2) To use best efforts to meet the
following permanent and temporary
hiring goals:
33-1/3% minorities and females; and
50% City of Cleveland residents.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and
(2) above, if these hiring goals negatively impact the up-front HUD
grant funding, then these goals may
be waived or reduced by the Director of Community Development.
(3) To use best efforts to maximize the energy efficiency of the
housing units built on the Property.
Section 5. The Mayor, the Director
of
Community
Development,
the
Director of Finance, the Director of
Law, the Clerk of Council and other
City officials, as appropriate, are
authorized to provide such information and to execute, certify or furnish such other documents, and do
all other things as are necessary for
or incidental to carrying out the
conveyance of the Property pursuant to the terms of the HUD Contract for Sale and the Redevelopment Agreement. The loan of the
HUD up-front grant may be made as
one loan in multiple installments or
as multiple loans in an aggregate
amount not to exceed $25,160,000 and
the obligation of the Developer to
repay the loan may be subordinate
to the obligations of the Developer
under any other financing arrangements for the Property improvements. Notwithstanding and as an
exception to any provision of any
Codified Ordinance of the City, if
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance to be advantageous to the
financing of the Property improvements, the City may evidence all or
a portion of the loan by accepting
obligations exempt from federal
income tax under Section 103 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, and issued for the purpose
of funding the Property improvements. The Mayor, the Director of
Community Development, the Director of Finance, the Director of Law

determines the sale of the Property
for the consideration provided in the
Redevelopment Agreement is satisfactory and proper, and that the
redevelopment of the Property with
affordable
housing
units
as
described

Redevelopment
Agreement will further the City’s
objective of providing additional
safe, decent and sanitary affordable
