Res. No. 291-2000.
By Councilman Cimperman.
An emergency resolution calling
for a moratorium on executions in
the State of Ohio, and throughout
the United States, until certain enumerated actions are taken.
Whereas, approximately 90% of
people charged with capital crimes
cannot afford their own attorney;
and
Whereas, no state has met standards developed by the American
Bar Association for appointment,
performance and compensation of
counsel for indigent prisoners; and
Whereas, in 1987, in McCleskey v.
Kemp, the United States Supreme
Court refused to act on data demonstrating the continuing reality of
racial bias in capital cases; and
Whereas, in a series of rulings
since 1991, the U.S. Supreme Court
has drastically restricted the rights
of death row prisoners to appeal
their convictions and death sentences in federal courts, even in
cases where prisoners present compelling evidence of innocence; and
Whereas, the American Bar Association has concluded that administration of the death penalty is a
“haphazard maze of unfair practices
with no internal consistency” and
has called for a moratorium on executions; and
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland joins with the American Bar Association in calling for a
moratorium on executions in the
State of Ohio, and throughout the
United States, until certain enumerated actions are taken; now, therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland requests Governor
Taft, President Clinton and our representatives in Congress to enact
legislation imposing a moratorium
on executions in the State of Ohio,

The City Record
until policies and procedures are
implemented
to: 1) ensure that
death penalty cases are administered fairly
and impartially
in
accordance with basic due process;
2) eliminate the risk that innocent
persons may be executed; and 3)
prevent the execution of mentally
disabled persons and people who
were under the age of 18 at the time
of their offenses.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby requested to transmit a copy of
this resolution to President Clinton;
Governor Taft; Senators DeWine
and Voinovich; and Congressmembers Kucinich, Tubbs Jones, LaTourette and Brown.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of

who make less than 60% of the

An emergency resolution requesting the Social Security Administration to change the envelope of

Whereas, many senior citizens
residing in the City of Cleveland
receive Social Security benefits from
the federal government, benefits
that these residents have paid into

this
Council
also
believes strongly in the right to privacy afforded to all American citizens, including the right to keep

the
Social
Security
Administration recently changed the
