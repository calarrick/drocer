VETO
File No. 2128-2000-A.
November 30, 2000
Via Hand Delivery
Honorable Michael D. Polensek
Council President
Cleveland City Hall, Room 216
601 Lakeside Avenue
Cleveland, Ohio 44114
Dear Council President Polensek:
Actions by City Council have
forced me to return Ordinance Number 2128-00 with a veto. The reasons
for this action are outlined below.
Councilman
Dolan’s
Ordinance,
number 2128-00 amends Ordinance
number 552-00, passed by City Council on June 19, 2000. As you are
aware, Ordinance 552-00 authorized
Department
of
Port
Control
to
undertake
the
necessary
public
improvements and actions for a new
runway 5L-23R, at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport and all
other related improvements necessary.
As part of Ordinance 552-00 City
Council, without warning or discussion,
removed
an
allocation
of
$600,000 for the design of a restoration project for a portion of Doan
Brook in (Councilmembers Britt,
Lewis, Patmon and Willis) Wards 6,
7, 8 and 9. This restoration project
is part of the Airport’s Army Corps
and Ohio EPA requirement for mitigation, which is necessary for runway construction. The mitigation
requirements are standard requirements when any entity disturbs wetlands and streams as part of a project. City Council’s elimination of
the authority of Doan Brook has
now jeopardized the Airport’s ability to move forward on the runway
project.
Ordinance number 2128-00 amends
Section 1 of Ordinance 552-00, by
taking funds from Doan Brook
(Councilmembers Britt, Lewis, Patmon and Willis) in Wards 6, 7, 8 and
9 and giving it to Big Creek (Councilmembers Gordon, O’Malley, Brady
and Sweeney) in Wards 15, 16, 19
and 20 and Mill Creek (Councilmembers
Jones,
White
and
Rybka) in Wards 1, 2, and 12. The
legislation stipulates that $600,000
be used to design a restoration of
either one or both streams. The
Department of Port Control’s consultants, Landrum and Brown have
extensively reviewed both projects,
Big Creek and Mill Creek. Their
review indicates that due to environmental, cost, logistical and ownership issues, neither Big Creek nor

The City Record

4
Mill Creek meet the needs of the
City as the least environmentally
damaging practicable alternative, as
set forth by the Army Corps.
The Army Corps District office in
Buffalo, New York has also reviewed Big Creek and Mill Creek in
the context of their suitability as
mitigation projects. According to the
Army Corps neither Big Creek nor
Mill Creek provide adequate mitigation for the habitat losses associated with Abram Creek.
By stipulating that $600,000 be
taken from Doan Brook and given
to either Big Creek or Mill Creek as
mitigation projects, the Council will,
in effect, have eliminated the funding for design of the Doan Brook
restoration project.
Given the support by the Army
Corps and our airport engineers for
the inclusion of Doan Brook as part
of the mitigation package, I am
vetoing Ordinance number 2128-00.
Said ordinance would exchange a
project accepted by the Army Corps
as an appropriate mitigation for
Abram Creek, and would replace it
with two projects that Army Corps
has stated are clearly deficient mitigation projects as related to the
Army Corps requirements for the
mitigation of Abram Creek.
Sincerely,
MICHAEL R. WHITE
Mayor

Section 665.16 Watch Area Designation
(a) Upon consideration of the factors listed in division (b) of Section
665.17, the Fair Housing Board may
designate, by a simple majority, any
area of the City as a “watch area”.
A watch area designation shall signify that the area is sensitive to
change and that real estate brokers,
agents, salespersons or other persons who are licensed or required to
be licensed pursuant to Chapter 4735
of the Revised Code are advised to
solicit the area only with due caution. Whenever an area of the City
is designated as a watch area, the
Fair Housing Board shall monitor
the situation and actively work
towards eliminating or reducing the
factors that caused the area to be
designated as a watch area. In any
area designated as a watch area,
the Fair Housing Board may seek a
voluntary real estate solicitation
moratorium for such length of time
as appropriate, but only if such voluntary moratorium is warranted in
the opinion of the Fair Housing
Board by the circumstances in a
given watch area.
(b) At any time that an area is
not under a non-solicitation area
designation
pursuant
to
Section
665.17, the Fair Housing Board may
cancel a watch area designation if
it finds that the factors that caused
the area to be designated as a
watch area have been eliminated or
reduced and that the designation is
no longer warranted.
(c) Upon each designation or cancellation of a watch area, the Fair
Housing Board shall promptly notify the Mayor and the Council, in
writing, and publish a notice in the
City Record or newspaper of general circulation describing the boundaries of the area by reference to
streets, census tracts or common
landmarks.
Each
designation
or
cancellation shall take effect upon
publication.
The
Fair
Housing
Board shall maintain a list of designated watch areas and make it
available
to
any
person
upon
request.
Section 665.17 Non-solicitation
(a) No real estate broker, agent,
sales representative or other person
who is licensed or required to be
licensed pursuant to Chapter 4735 of
the Revised Code shall solicit the
owner or occupant of any housing
accommodation located within a
non-solicitation area designed by the
Fair Housing Board.

2981

17
(b) Any area that the Fair Housing Board has designated as a
watch area may be designated as a
non-solicitation area for an initial
period of up to forty-five (45) days
upon making written findings based
on substantial evidence introduced
at a public hearing that real estate
solicitation in the area is or is likely to cause or contribute to blockbusting or panic selling. A vote of
two-thirds (2/3) of the Fair Housing
Board is needed in order to designate an area as a non-solicitation
area. In determining whether a nonsolicitation area should be designated, the Fair Housing Board shall
consider the following factors, and
such other factors it may deem
appropriate, as they pertain to the
area under consideration:
(1) the frequency of real estate
solicitation;
(2) the content of the solicitations;
(3) the racial composition and
rate of racial changes;
(4) the frequency of home sales
and other real estate activity; and
(5) the number, severity and history of racial incidents.
(c) The Fair Housing Board may
extend the designation of a nonsolicitation area for one (1) additional consecutive period of fortyfive (45) days upon making written
findings based on substantial evidence that continuation of the solicitation ban is warranted. If an area
is designated as a non-solicitation
area and the designation is extended one more time, the designation
shall cease after the extension
expires.
(d) The Fair Housing Board may,
following a public hearing, cancel
the designation of a non-solicitation
area or extension of any such designation made pursuant to this section.
(e) If the designation of a nonsolicitation area expires without
extension or is canceled, or if an
extension made pursuant to division
(a) of this section expires or is canceled, the Fair Housing Board may,
no earlier than ninety (90) days following such expiration or cancellation, designate the area anew as a
non-solicitation area pursuant to
division (b) of this section.
(f) Upon expiration or cancellation of a designation or extension of
a non-solicitation area, the area
shall remain a watch area until the
watch area designation is canceled
by the Fair Housing Board pursuant
to division (b) of Section 665.16.
(g) Upon each designation, extension or cancellation made pursuant
to this section, the Fair Housing
Board shall promptly notify the
Mayor and Council in writing and
publish a notice in the City Record
or newspaper of general circulation
describing the boundaries of the
area by reference to streets, census,
tracts, or common landmarks. Each
designation or cancellation shall
take effect upon publication. The
Fair Housing Board shall maintain
a list of designated non-solicitation
areas and make it available to any
person upon request.

of Discrimination

has reasonable cause to believe that
any person or persons are engaged
in a pattern or practice of resistance
to a person’s or persons’ full enjoy-

18
ment of the rights granted by Section 665.03 or 665.19, of this chapter,
or that any group of persons has
been denied any of the rights granted by such section and the denial
raises an issue of public policy, the
Fair Housing Board may refer the
matter to the Director of Law for
commencement of a civil action in a
court of competent jurisdiction on
behalf of the City. The Director of
Law may seek any relief considered
necessary to ensure the full enjoyment of the rights granted by this
chapter.

renting housing accommodations by
referring to race, religion, color, sex,
sexual orientation, national origin,
age, disability, ethnic group, Vietnam-era or disabled veteran status,
familial status, marital status or
ancestry, of occupants or prospective occupants of other housing
accommodations in the neighborhood;

of housing accommodations by any
influence, suggestion, act or failure
to act, or accord any differential

housing accommodations or in the
furnishing of information, services,
or facilities relative thereto because

disability, ethnic group, Vietnam-era
or disabled veteran status, familial
status, marital status or ancestry of
any person.

a safe, livable place; and
Whereas, Mayor White and certain members of his Administration
launch
daily
vitriolic
attacks
against members of Council, many

Whereas, reasoned and intelligent
people, particularly those charged
with representing the interests of
the public, should engage in reasoned and intelligent public discourse, absent personal and vicious
name calling; and

White have created an environment
in which evil can flourish; and

being done and to be done in our
City.

however,
NEORSD is contracting to dump
approximately 250,000 cubic yards of
shale from the sewer project into
the Mill Creek Valley; and
Whereas, the dumping of shale
into Mill Creek would ultimately
cause pollution and degradation of
the water stream and riparian areas

into the Mill Creek Valley has been
opposed by the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency; and

immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland strongly opposes
the plan of the Northeast Ohio

entitled to a credit, reimbursement,
payment, or any other type of compensation for termination of the
Lease and recapture of the Premises. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provision, if the City shall recapture

facility
investment
cost;
