ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 1845-96.
By Councilman Coats.
An emergency resolution opposing passage of HR 1020/S. 1271
which could lead to the transport
by railway and highway of high
level radioactive waste from other
states through the Cleveland area,
or failing the above, to amend these
bills to provide additional provisions.
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland has been advised of
legislation pending before the U.S.
Congress,
HR
1020/S.
1271,
the
Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1995,
which could lead to the transport by
railway and highway of shipments
of high level radioactive waste from
other states through the Cleveland
area; and

10
Whereas, the City Council and the
appropriate City departments have
attempted to inform themselves of
the procedures to be used in these
shipments and have taken all available precautions within their power;
and
Whereas, in spite of assurances by
responsible federal and state officials that shipment procedures are
safe, there remain questions still
unanswered regarding these procedures; and
Whereas, it is clear that the shipment of nuclear waste materials
through the City of Cleveland represents an undesirable risk in the
event of a catastrophic and unpredictable railway or highway accident; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that the City of Cleveland is without sufficient emergency
personnel, equipment and financial
resources to safeguard its residents
in the event of a major nuclear
transport accident; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby opposes passage of HR 1020/S.
1271 and urges the members of the
General Assembly to vote against
this threat to public health.
Section 2. That failing Section 1 of
this resolution, to urge the members
of the Senate and the General
Assembly to support an amendment
to these bills include the following:
1) to bar any shipment of irradiated fuel rods through the metropolitan Cleveland area until a deep-geological repository is available for
permanent disposal; 2) to require
the responsible federal agency or
agencies
to
provide
a
written
description with citations of Federal Regulations which justify the
routing of this high level radioactive waste shipments through highly populated areas; and 3) to indemnify the City of Cleveland from
accepting any liability for a risk of
this magnitude for its residents or
their properties.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Governor
Voinovich, the appropriate state and
federal agencies and to the Speaker
of the House of Representatives, the
President of the Senate and the Ohio
members of the United States Senate
and the House of Representatives.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Whereas, adult reading, viewing
and audio materials can be accessed
on the Internet by children using
library computers; and
Whereas,
certain
adult
books,
video and audio material may be
inappropriate to be accessed by
minors; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that restriction of
access to adult materials on the
Internet is essential to the healthy
development and welfare of the children of this country; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of

the Cleveland Public Library to conduct a study on the feasibility of
procedures that restrict the access

Res. No. 402-97.
By Councilman Dolan.
An emergency resolution urging
the Mayor and the Administration to
immediately and actively investigate and prepare the City of Cleveland for the imminent deregulation
of the electric utility industry by
pursuing the right of electrical utility customers, both residential and
commercial/industrial, situated in
the City of Cleveland to be aggregated together for the purpose of
purchasing
electricity
to
derive
greater energy savings as a collective group and other matters set
forth in Case No. 96-406-EL-COI
before The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio.
Whereas,
The
Public
Utilities
Commission of Ohio issued findings
in Case No. 96-406-EL-COI, relating
to the right of electrical utility customers to be aggregated together
for the purpose of purchasing electricity to derive greater energy savings as collective groups then would
otherwise be able to achieve individually; and
Whereas, the members of this
Council understand the importance
of the potentially significant energy
savings such customer aggregation
may have to the residential and
commercial/industrial customers of
electrical power who reside in the
City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, such customer aggregation and the resulting competitive

1478

June 28, 2000
market will have a positive effect
upon the cost of living and the cost
of doing business in the City of
Cleveland;
Now, therefore, be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
strongly urges Mayor Michael R.
White and Directors Konicek and

other resources required to immediately and actively investigate and
prepare the City of Cleveland for
the imminent deregulation of the
electric utility industry and become
fully involved in the matters set
forth in Case No. 96-406-EL-COI
before The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio regarding competition
in the electric utility industry in
Ohio, particularly the advisability of
conjunctive electric service and the
potential cost savings to residential
and
commercial/industrial
customers situated in the City of Cleveland.

to the members of The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio.
Section 3. That this resolution is

it difficult for Ward 2 residents
especially senior citizens to obtain

offense or other incident within the
respective areas of concern for the
safety divisions occurred, knowing
that such offense did not occur;
(4) Knowingly use the 9-1-l system, knowing that no major critical
or
life
threatening
emergency
exists
and
knowing
that
such
report is likely to result in unnecessary consumption of safety services; or
(b) Whoever violates this section
is guilty of improper use of 9-1-1
telephone system, a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives

Ord. No. 2009-A-99 (As a substitute
for Ord. No. 2009-99).
By Councilmen Polensek, ~Brady,
Britt, Cimperman, Cintron, Coats,
Dolan, Gordon, Jackson, Johnson,
Jones, Lewis, Melena, O’Malley, Patmon, Robinson, Rybka, Sweeney,
Westbrook, White and Willis.
An ordinance to supplement the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, by enacting new Chapter
189 relating to the Cleveland Fair
Employment Law.
Whereas, it is beneficial to the
health and welfare of all citizens of
the City of Cleveland that all workers are paid an hourly wage which
enables them to live above the level
of poverty and reduces the amount
of taxpayer funded social service
programs in the City of Cleveland;
and
Whereas, this legislation provides
for a fair employment wage for
employees employed by persons or
entities, which are awarded contracts by, for, or on behalf of the
City of Cleveland and receive economic
assistance
in
conjunction
with such contracts; and
Whereas, same employers who
receive financial assistance from
the City do not provide reasonable
health insurance to their employees,
thereby negatively affecting work
performance
and
absenteeism,
resulting in a decrease in the quantity and quality of services rendered
by such employees to the City and
to the public; and
Whereas, the City is greatly concerned with the general health and
welfare of its citizens and such
interest is furthered when its citizens are provided reasonable health
care insurance coverage; and

The City Record
Whereas, when the City uses contractors or subsidizes businesses
which do not provide health insurance to their employees, this often
imposes the cost of their medical
care on the City, county, state and
federal governments, an impact that
can be avoided only if employers
provide health insurance in a reasonable form; and
Whereas, because employees are
far likelier to be healthy and, therefore, more productive workers if
their employers provide an adequate
level of compensation, including reasonable health insurance for them
and their dependents, this legislation both mandates the payment of
a fair employment wage and provides incentives to encourage contractors with the City to provide
health insurance benefits to their
employees; and
Whereas, the purpose of this legislation is to provide for a fair
employment
wage
and
promote
health insurance benefits for workers employed by employers receiving assistance from the City and, as
a result, enhance the welfare of
workers in the City of Cleveland;
and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes a measure providing for the
preservation of the public health,
safety, and welfare of the citizens
of the City of Cleveland; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are

as a factor in determining the lowest and best or lowest responsible
bid for any Service Contract. If a

that it has offered reasonable health
care insurance to its employees but
as a group the employees have
refused the health care insurance
coverage, the Service Contractor is

and
treatment
in
the
bidding
process as a Service Contractor who
provides or agrees to provide reasonable health care insurance. The

health care insurance in determining the lowest and best or lowest
responsible bid. Such regulations

incentives include: more favorable
terms for a loan, such as a lower
interest rate; a higher percentage of
taxes to be credited or abated; a
higher amount for a grant, etc.
Whether or not such incentives have
been offered; the reasons for offering or not offering such incentives;
the terms of such incentives, if
offered; and any evidence of the
intent of the proposed Recipient of
Assistance to provide reasonable
health care insurance shall be a part
of the information provided by the
Applicable Department to Cleveland
City Council for consideration in connection with any ordinance authorizing a contract for Assistance.
(2) In order to qualify a Covered
Employer for an incentive as provided in the previous section, the
reasonable health care insurance
provided to employees must be comparable to a family health care

has
occurred,
initiate
a
complaint
against the Covered Employer and

Covered Employer(s), the affected
Covered Employee(s) and to the
FEWB with a time and date set for

days of completion of the investigation, though for good cause shown
it can be rescheduled. If the investigation resulted from a filed charge
of noncompliance, a conciliation
agreement may be not be entered
without the consent of both the Covered Employer and the charging
party. If the investigation was initiated by the Applicable Department
on its own, the Director has authority to enter into a conciliation agreement.
(f) Hearing. If conciliation does
not result in a settlement of the
complaint,
the
Director
of
the
Applicable Department shall appoint
a Hearing Officer to conduct a hearing on the complaint. Any Hearing
Officer shall be either a member of
Ohio’s Judiciary or an attorney
licensed to practice in Ohio. The

empowered to subpoena witnesses,
compel their attendance, administer
oaths, take sworn testimony and
require the production for examination of any documents relating to
the complaint.
(g) After the conclusion of the
hearing, the Hearing Officer shall
report his or her findings to the
Director within fifteen (15) days.
The Director may adopt, reject or
modify the findings of the Hearing
Officer. Within seven days after
receipt of the findings of the Hearing Officer, the Director shall render a decision in the form of a written order which shall include findings of fact, a statement as to
whether the Covered Employer has
violated this
Chapter and such
remedial actions as the Director
may order. The order shall be
served upon the parties by certified
mail within fifteen (15) days of the
date of the decision. A copy of the
decision shall be provided to the
FEWB and the Clerk of City Council.

Any Covered Employer or Employee who objects to any decision
of the Director of the Applicable
Department relative to enforcement
of this Chapter may appeal such
decision to the Common Pleas Court
or as otherwise provided by law.

Any covered employer found not
to be in compliance with the provisions of this Chapter or who has
submitted false or fraudulent information may be subject to one or
more of the following sanctions
imposed by the City of Cleveland:
(1)
Withholding

its proceedings or using any remedies to enforce his or her rights
under this Chapter. A person who
believes he or she has been retaliated against in violation of this section may file a charge of noncompliance with the Clerk of City Council, as provided in subsection (b) of

1496

June 28, 2000
processed, investigated and, if necessary, conciliated and heard according to the procedure set forth in

rates or covered by prevailing wage
agreements or collective bargaining
agreements.

(1) Cleveland City Council may,
through
passage
of
legislation,
grant a partial or whole exemption
from the requirements of this Chapter on the following grounds:
(A) A hardship exemption for otherwise Covered Employers that can
demonstrate a specific, particular
harm that would be felt uniquely by
the Covered Employer if this chapter were to be applied. Economic
harm alone will not suffice to
demonstrate hardship unless it is of
a type that would not affect any
other actual competitor for the contract, subcontract or lease. The following types of specific particular
harm may provide grounds for a
hardship exemption:
(i) a loss of profitability that will
result in the elimination of jobs; (ii)
a loss in profits that will substantially impact the Covered Employer’s long-term stability;
(iii) as to not-for-profit community or social service agencies or organizations, a substantial hindrance in
the ability to deliver service.
(2) Procedures. Application for an
exemption shall be made to the
Applicable Department. If the need
for the exemption is known to the
applicant at the time it applies or
during the term of the contract for
a Service Contract or Assistance, the
application for the exemption should
be submitted with the application
for the Service or Assistance Contract.
(A) The Director of the Applicable Department shall review and
make a determination on the application within ten (10) days and
respond to the applicant in writing,
setting forth the reasons for the
determination.
(i) Notice of the request for an
exemption shall be forwarded to
the Fair Employment Wage Board
and the Clerk of Cleveland City
Council.
(ii) A copy of the Director's determination regarding the application
for the hardship exemption shall be
forwarded to the Fair Employment

June 28, 2000
Wage Board and the Clerk of Cleveland City Council.
(B) Should the exemption be recommended by the Director, the
Director shall cause legislation to
be drafted and acted upon by Cleveland City Council granting the
exemption. At such time, the Director shall forward to Council along
with the recommendation all supporting documents and other materials, including those supplied by
the applicant for the exemption, as
provided in the next section. If the
exemption
is
recommended
and
Council adopts the recommendation
before the Service or Assistance contract is entered into, the legislation
authorizing
such
contract
shall
include a provision granting the
exemption.
(3) Contents of Exemption Request
(A) Hardship Exemption requests
shall include:
(i) the lower wage to be paid by
the Covered Employer;
(ii) a detailed explanation of how
the payment of the Fair Employment Wage will cause particular
harm; and
(iii) supporting financial statements and/or other documents.
Section 189.07 Evaluation
After a three (3) year period
from the effective date of this ordinance, an evaluation on the impact
of this ordinance shall be done.
The Mayor, City Council, and the
FEWB shall decide on who shall
perform the evaluation and the
scope of the evaluation. After one
(1) year following the effective
date of this ordinance, Cleveland
City Council shall hold a hearing
for the purpose of reviewing this
legislation.
Section 189.08 Severability
In the event any provision of this
Chapter is held unconstitutional or
invalid or unenforceable by any
court of competent jurisdiction, such
holding shall not invalidate or render unenforceable any other provision hereof.

The City Record
Section 619.25 Action to Abate Nuisances
(a) Nature of action. The Director
of Law may file an action in rem to
abate any nuisance as defined by Section 619.24. The standard of proof
shall be by a preponderance of the
evidence. This action may be brought
as a separate action or concurrently
with any other action available at
law or in equity to enjoin and/or
abate the nuisance including, without
limitation, an action authorized by
Chapter 3767 of the Revised Code or
other actions authorized by these
Codified Ordinances.
(b) Notice and opportunity to be
heard. Prior to the issuance of an
order under this section, a reasonably diligent search shall be conducted of the public records that
relate to the property that is the
subject of an abatement action to
identify the owner, lienholder, and
any other person with an ownership
interest in the property. Such persons shall be sent notice by certified
mail, return receipt requested, or
shall be personally served, and shall
be granted an opportunity to be
heard by the court.
(c) Innocent owners or lienhold ers. No abatement order shall be
issued pursuant to this section if an
owner or lienholder or other person
with an ownership interest in the
property that is the subject of an
abatement action establishes to the
court, by a preponderance of evidence after filing a motion with the
court, that the owner, lienholder or
other
person
neither
knew
nor
should have known after a reasonable inquiry that the property would
be used, or likely would be used or
involved in the commission of a
criminal offense, and further that
the owner, lienholder or other person with an ownership interest in
the property did not expressly or
impliedly consent to the use or
involvement of the property in the
violation, and that the lien or ownership interest was perfected pursuant to law prior to the existence
of the nuisance.
(d) Family hardship. A family or
household member of the person
who is the owner of property used
to maintain a nuisance may file a
motion with the court having jurisdiction over the action to abate a
nuisance claiming that the order of
abatement and sale of the property
will create an undue hardship on
the family or household member. If
the court determines by a preponderance of the evidence that an
undue hardship would be caused to
a family or household member filing
the motion, and if the court further
finds that the moving party has not
in any previous case benefited from
a finding of family hardship relative to the property at issue, no
order of abatement shall issue. As
used in this section, “family or
household
member”
means
the
spouse, brother, sister or child of the
person who is the owner of property used to maintain a nuisance.
(e) Order of Abatement. If the
existence of a nuisance is established, an order of abatement as
described in this division shall be
entered as a part of the judgment
in the case.
If the property involved in the
abatement action is a building or
other place, it shall be ordered
closed and kept closed for a period
of one (1) year, unless sooner
released by the court. The contents
and fixtures of such a building or

1501

33
other place shall be given to an
agency identified by the Director of
Law, which may be a battered
women’s shelter or similar agency,
if the agency desires to have it, or
if it does not, the same shall be sold
at public auction or as otherwise
directed by the court, and the proceeds shall be distributed as provided in division (g) of this section.
If the property involved in the
abatement action is a vehicle, boat
or aircraft, the same shall be given
to a battered women’s shelter or similar agency identified by the Director of Law, if the agency desires to
have it, or if it does not, the same
sold at public auction or as otherwise directed by the court, and the
proceeds shall be distributed as provided in division (g) of this section.
The court may order any person
in charge of personalty that is subject to sale under this division to
present the same at a time and
place directed by the court for the
purpose of conducting its sale. In
addition, the court may authorize
any law enforcement agency to
seize such personalty.
In identifying an agency to receive
the property or the proceeds from the
sale of the property as provided in
this section, the Director of Law
shall confer with the council member
representing the community in which
the criminal activity that gave rise
to the nuisance occurred, and where
possible, the agency selected will be
one that serves that community.
(f) Use of closed building. Any
person who uses a building or place
ordered closed in accordance with
division (e) of this section, with
knowledge that such building or
place has been ordered closed, shall
be guilty of a misdemeanor of the
fourth degree.
(g) Sale of property, costs and
liens. Upon the sale of any furniture, fixtures, contents, vehicle, boat
or aircraft as provided in this section, the person executing the order
of the court shall, after deducting
the expenses of keeping such property and costs of such sale, pay all
liens according to their priorities
which may be established by intervention or otherwise at the hearing
or in other proceedings brought for
the purpose as being bona fide and
as having been created without the
lienholder having any notice that
such property was being used or
was to be used for the maintenance
of a nuisance as herein defined, and
shall pay the balance to a battered
women’s shelter or similar agency
identified by the Director of Law.
Section 2. That it is hereby declared that giving property that is
forfeited pursuant to Codified Ordinance Sections 619.23, 619.24 and
619.25 as enacted by this ordinance,
or the proceeds from a sale of such
property after payment of liens and
expenses, to a battered women’s
shelter or similar agency, constitutes a public purpose.
Section 3. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor, otherwise is

and to the extent required by the
Fourth Supplemental Indenture, and
any determination of the Fiscal Officer under Section 4 of this Series
2000 Bond Legislation as to whether
there shall be an alternative special
reserve fund for the Series 2000
Bonds of any series, separate from
the Bond Service Reserve Fund, or
a municipal bond insurance policy,

The Series 2000 Certificate of
Award may also specify that the
Series 2000 Bonds may be issued in
one or more separate series, each
bearing a distinctive designation,
provided that the Series 2000 Bonds
of all such series satisfy the requirements of the Indenture and of this

advice of the Issuer’s Financial
Advisor, that the Issuer’s best interests will be served by causing all or
a portion of the Series 2000 Bonds
to be Series 2000 Variable Rate
Bonds, then the Fiscal Officer is
authorized to cause such Series 2000
Bonds to be Series 2000 Variable
Rate Bonds by so specifying in the
Series 2000 Certificate of Award. If
the Fiscal Officer so determines,
then, in accordance with Section
3.02(c) of the First Supplemental
Indenture, the Fourth Supplemental
Indenture shall specify the method
and procedure by which the rate of
interest to be borne by the Series

June 28, 2000
2000 Variable Rate Bonds shall be
determined, provided that the Series
2000 Variable Rate Bonds shall not
bear interest at a rate in excess of
fourteen percent (14%). The preceding sentence shall not be deemed to
prohibit the inclusion in the Reimbursement Agreement with the Credit Provider of any liquidity facility
for the Series 2000 Variable Rate
Bonds of any provision that would
entitle the Credit Provider to additional interest during any period
when Series 2000 Variable Rate
Bonds
are
held
by
the
Credit
Provider as pledged bonds under
that
Reimbursement
Agreement.
The Fourth Supplemental Indenture
may also provide for the right of the
holders of Series 2000 Variable Rate
Bonds to tender their Series 2000
Variable Rate Bonds for purchase
by the Issuer at the times, on the
terms, and subject to the conditions
set forth therein, provided that such
tender rights shall be exercisable
only at such times as a credit or liquidity facility is in place that provides for the payment of the purchase price payable to the tendering
holder of a Series 2000 Variable
Rate Bond. If the Fiscal Officer designates any Series 2000 Bonds as
Series 2000 Variable Rate Bonds,
then the Fiscal Officer shall also
designate in the Series 2000 Certificate of Award the Credit Provider
or Credit Providers for any credit or
liquidity facility or facilities to
apply to the Series 2000 Variable
Rate Bonds, and the remarketing
agent or agents for tendered Series
2000 Variable Rate Bonds (if the
holders of the Series 2000 Variable
Rate Bonds are to be entitled or
required to tender the Series 2000
Variable Rate Bonds for purchase),
which designations shall be based
on the written advice of the Issuer’s
Financial Advisor that the parties
so designated possess the requisite
resources and experience to provide
the services required of them and
that the terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide
such services are fair and commercially reasonable.
It is hereby determined that the
Purchase Price, the Specified Interest Rates, and the other terms and
details of the Series 2000 Bonds as
so specified and determined in the
Series 2000 Certificate of Award
within the limitations set forth in
the Series 2000 Bond Legislation

balance of such proceeds.
Pursuant to Section 3.02(h) of the
First Supplemental Indenture, the
Fourth Supplemental Indenture may
provide that no deposit to the Bond
Service Reserve Fund shall be made
for or with respect to the Series 2000
Bonds, in which case: (i) the holders of Series 2000 Bonds shall have
no right or entitlement to have any
portion of the Bond service charges
on Series 2000 Bonds be paid from
amounts
in
the
Bond
Service
Reserve Fund, (ii) the lien of and
pledge on the Bond Service Reserve
Fund shall not extend to or be for
the benefit of the holders of Series
2000 Bonds, and (iii) the Bond service charges on Series 2000 Bonds
shall not be taken into account in
determining the Required Bond Service Reserve. In the event that the
Fourth Supplemental Indenture provides as described in the preceding
sentence, then such Supplemental
Indenture may also provide for the
creation of a special reserve fund
solely for Series 2000 Bonds, separate from the Bond Service Reserve
Fund, and may provide for the
deposit therein, at the time of
issuance or in one or more subsequent deposits thereto, of an amount
specified in the Fourth Supplemental
Indenture
as
the
required
reserve for Series 2000 Bonds (which
amount shall in no event exceed the
Required Bond Service Reserve computed for the Series 2000 Bonds
alone, if it had applied), or may
require the Issuer to provide a
municipal bond insurance policy, a
bank letter or line of credit, or any
other form of credit or liquidity
facility to enhance the security for
Series 2000 Bonds in lieu of a funded reserve fund. If the Fourth Supplemental Indenture so provides for
such a special reserve fund and further requires that deposits be made
thereto from Airport Revenues at
any time, then such deposits may be
made only from moneys remaining
in the Operating and Maintenance
Fund on the last day of a month
before any deposit is made to the
General Obligation Debt Service
Fund (or the Subordinated Debt Service Fund, if it shall have been
established) or into any other Special Fund into which such moneys
may be deposited after any required
deposits to the General Obligation
Debt Service Fund. If the Fourth
Supplemental Indenture provides for
no reserve fund, or for a special
reserve fund as permitted by the
preceding
paragraph,
then
the
Fourth
Supplemental
Indenture
shall also provide that the amount
of any defaulted principal of or
interest on the Series 2000 Bonds
that would have been timely paid
had the Required Bond Service
Reserve for such Revenue Bonds
been fully funded in the Bond Service Reserve Fund shall be paid
only from moneys remaining in the
Operating and Maintenance Fund on
the last day of a month before any
deposit is made to the General
Obligation Debt Service Fund (or

1535

67
the
Subordinated
Debt
Service
Reserve Fund, if it shall have been
established) or to any other Special
Funds into which such moneys may
be deposited after any required
deposits to the General Obligation
Debt Service Fund. The Fiscal Officer is authorized to determine, based
on the written advice of the Issuer’s
Financial Advisor, which of the
options permitted under this Section
4 for funding the Bond Service
Reserve Fund or for alternatives to
doing so best serves the Issuer’s
interests, shall specify that option in
the Series 2000 Certificate of Award,
and shall cause the provisions for
that option to be incorporated into
the Fourth Supplemental Indenture.
Section 5. Terms and Provisions
Applicable to the Series 2000 Bonds.
(a) Form; exchange and transfer.
Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the Original Indenture,
(i) all Series 2000 Bonds shall initially be issued in fully registered
form, and (ii) no Series 2000 Bond
shall be exchanged for or transferable into a coupon Revenue Bond or
Bonds unless and until the Indenture shall have been amended in
accordance with the terms thereof to
permit such exchanges or transfers.
To the extent that the Original
Indenture (particularly, but without
limitation, Section 2.05 thereof) permits fully registered Revenue Bonds
to be exchanged for or transferred
into coupon Revenue Bonds or Revenue Bonds payable to bearer, then
the Original Indenture is hereby
amended to prohibit such exchanges
or transfers for the Series 2000
Bonds unless and until the Indenture shall have been amended in
accordance with the terms thereof to
permit such exchanges or transfers.
The Series 2000 Bonds shall be
issued to a Depository for use in a
book entry system and, if and as
long as a book entry system is utilized: (i) the Series 2000 Bonds shall
be issued in the form of a single
registered Series 2000 Bond representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the beneficial
owners in book entry form shall
have no right to receive Series 2000
Bonds in the form of physical securities or certificates; (iii) ownership
of beneficial interests in book entry
form shall be shown by book entry
on the system maintained and operated by the Depository and its participants, and transfers of the ownership of beneficial interests shall
be made only by book entry by the
Depository and its participants; and
(iv) the Bonds as such shall not be
transferable
or
exchangeable,
except
for
transfer
to
another
Depository or to another nominee of
a Depository, without further action
by the Issuer.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Series 2000 Bonds for use in
a book entry system, the Fiscal Officer and Trustee may attempt to
establish
a
securities
depository/book entry relationship with
another qualified Depository. If the
Fiscal Officer and Trustee do not or
are unable to do so, the Fiscal Officer and Trustee, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Series 2000 Bonds from the

68
Depository, and authenticate and
deliver registered Series 2000 Bond
certificates to the assigns of the
Depository or its nominee, all at the
cost and expense (including any
costs of printing), if the event is not
the result of Issuer action or inaction, of those persons requesting
such issuance.
The Executive Officer, the Fiscal
Officer, the Director of Port Control
or any one of them are authorized
and directed to the extent necessary
or required to enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with the book entry system
for the Series 2000 Bonds, after
determining (as evidenced by their
signing) that the signing thereof
will not endanger the funds or securities of the Issuer under the Indenture.
(b) Denominations and Dates.
The Series 2000 Bonds shall each
be in the denomination of $5,000 or
any integral multiple thereof and
shall be dated as of the date or
dates specified in or pursuant to the
Series 2000 Certificate of Award;
provided, however, that if, pursuant
to the Series 2000 Certificate of
Award, a book entry system is to be
used for the Series 2000 Bonds, then
the Series 2000 Bonds shall be issued
in the form of a single Series 2000
Bond for each maturity or mandatory redemption date of each series of
Series 2000 Bonds. Each Series 2000
Bond shall have only one principal
maturity date, except for interim
certificates or receipts issued pending preparation of definitive Series
2000 Bonds.
(c) Interest and Place of Payment.
The Series 2000 Bonds shall bear
interest at their respective Specified
Interest Rates from the most recent
date to which interest has been paid
or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid or duly provided
for, from their dated date. The principal and Redemption Price, if any,
of and the interest payable on each
Series 2000 Bond shall be payable at
the times, to the persons and in the
manner set forth in the Indenture,
including, without limitation, provisions
thereof
permitting
special
arrangements for payment to the
Depository.
(d) Maturities.
The Series 2000 Serial Bonds shall
mature on the Principal Retirement
Dates, and the Series 2000 Term
Bonds shall mature on the Term
Maturity Dates, as specified in the
Series 2000 Certificate of Award.
(e) Optional and Mandatory Redemption.

by their stated terms after the Earliest
Optional
Redemption
Date
shall be subject to redemption at the
option of the Issuer on or after the
earliest Optional Redemption Date
in whole on any date or in part on
any Interest Payment Date at the
Redemption Price specified in the
Series 2000 Certificate of Award and
in accordance with the Indenture;
provided, however, that the Series
2000 Certificate of Award may specify that all or a portion of the Series
2000 Bonds will not be subject to
redemption at the option of the
Issuer. The Series 2000 Term Bonds
shall also be subject to mandatory
redemption prior to maturity at the
Redemption Price on each Mandato-

The City Record
ry Redemption Date in the aggregate amount of the mandatory sinking fund requirement to be paid on
such Mandatory Redemption date,
all as specified in the Series 2000
Certificate of Award and in accordance with the Indenture.
(f) Execution.
The Series 2000 Bonds shall be
executed by the Executive Officer
and the Fiscal Officer, and approved
as to form by the Legal Officer, provided that any or all of such signatures may be facsimiles, and shall
bear the corporate seal of the Issuer
or a facsimile thereof.
(g) Numbering.
The Series 2000 Bonds to be
authenticated by the Trustee shall
be numbered and otherwise identified as specified by the Fiscal Officer in accordance with the Indenture.
Section 6. Refunding of Outstanding Revenue Bonds.
If Series 2000 Bonds are issued for
the purpose of refunding any outstanding Revenue Bonds, then the
Executive Officer, the Fiscal Officer
and the Director of Port Control or
any two of them are authorized and
directed to sign and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of the Issuer,
an escrow agreement between the
Issuer and the Trustee, as escrow
trustee, providing for the investment
and holding in escrow of the proceeds of the Series 2000 Refunding
Bonds to be applied to the refunding of such Revenue Bonds and for
the
application
of
the
moneys
derived from those investments to
the payment of the Bond service
charges on such Revenue Bonds.
The Fiscal Officer shall provide for
the payment of the services rendered and for reimbursement of
expenses incurred pursuant to the
escrow agreement from proceeds of
the Series 2000 Refunding Bonds to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose. Provision shall be
made in the escrow agreement to
give the Trustee any written notice
of redemption required under Section 3.02 of the Original Indenture.
The Executive Officer, the Fiscal
Officer, the Director of Port Control
and other appropriate Issuer officials shall execute all documents
and take all other actions necessary
or appropriate on the part of the
Issuer to effect such refunding in
accordance with the Original Indenture and to cause the refunded Revenue Bonds to be deemed paid and
discharged.
Section 7. Arbitrage Provisions.
Some or all of the Series 2000
Bonds are to be issued and sold as
obligations bearing interest to be
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes (the “TaxExempt
Bonds”).
The
Issuer
covenants that it will use and will
restrict the use and investment of,
the proceeds of the Tax-Exempt
Bonds in such manner and to such
extent as may be necessary so that
(a) the interest on the Tax-Exempt
Bonds will be excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes and (b) in the case of any
Tax-Exempt Bonds intended to qualify as bonds, the interest on which
is not treated as an item of tax pref-

1536

June 28, 2000
erence under Section 57 of the Code
(“Non-AMT
Bonds”),
such
TaxExempt Bonds will be treated as
Non-AMT Bonds.
The Issuer covenants that (a) it
will take or cause to be taken such
actions that may be required of it
for the interest on the Tax-Exempt
Bonds to be and to remain excluded
from
gross
income
for
federal
income tax purposes, (b) it will not
take or authorize to be taken any
action that would adversely affect
that exclusion, and c) it, or persons
acting for it, will, among other acts
of compliance, (i) apply the proceeds of the Tax-Exempt Bonds to
the governmental purposes of the
borrowing, (ii) restrict the yield on
investment
property,
(iii)
make
timely and adequate payments to
the federal government, (iv) maintain books and records and make
calculations and reports, and (v)
refrain from certain uses of those
proceeds and, as applicable, of property financed with such proceeds,
all in such manner and to the extent
necessary to assure such exclusion
of that interest under the Code.
The Fiscal Officer, or any other
officer of the Issuer having responsibility for issuance of the TaxExempt Bonds, is hereby authorized
(a) to make or effect any election,
selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or waiver on behalf
of the Issuer with respect to the
Tax-Exempt Bonds as the Issuer is
permitted or required to make or
give under the federal income tax
laws, including, without limitation
thereto, any of the elections provided for in Section 148(f)(4)(C) of the
Code or available under Section 148
of the Code, for the purpose of
assuring, enhancing or protecting
favorable tax treatment or status of
the Tax-Exempt Bonds or interest
thereon
or
assisting
compliance
with requirements for that purpose,
reducing the burden or expense of
such
compliance,
reducing
the
rebate amount or payments of penalties, or making payments of special
amounts in lieu of making computations to determine, or paying,
excess earnings as rebate, or obviating those amounts or payments, as
determined by that officer, which
action shall be in writing and
signed by the officer (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf
of the Issuer, as may be appropriate
to assure the exclusion of interest
from gross income and the intended
tax status of the Tax-Exempt Bonds,
and (c) to give one or more appropriate certificates of the Issuer, for
inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Tax-Exempt Bonds,
setting forth the reasonable expectations of the Issuer regarding the
amount and use of all the proceeds
of the Tax-Exempt Bonds, the facts,
circumstances
and
estimates
on
which they are based, and other
facts and circumstances relevant to
the tax treatment of the interest on
and the tax status of the TaxExempt Bonds.
Each covenant made in this Section with respect to the Tax-Exempt
Bonds is also made with respect to
all issues any portion of the debt
service on which is paid from proceeds of the Tax-Exempt Bonds
(and, if different, the original issue
and any refunding issues in a series
of refundings), to the extent such

June 28, 2000
compliance is necessary to assure
exclusion of interest on the TaxExempt Bonds from gross income
for federal income tax purposes, and
the officers identified above are
authorized to take actions with
respect to those issues as they are
authorized in this Section to take
with respect to the Tax-Exempt
Bonds.
Section 8. Fourth Supplemental
Indenture;
Amendments
to
Use
Agreements; Transcript of Proceedings.
The Executive Officer, the Fiscal
Officer and the Director of Port Control, or any two of them, are hereby authorized and directed, in the
name and on behalf of the Issuer, to
make, execute, acknowledge, and
deliver to the Trustee, a good and
sufficient
Fourth
Supplemental
Indenture, approved as to form and
correctness by the Legal Officer, for
the purposes hereinafter described
and substantially in the form put on
file with the Clerk in connection
with the Series 2000 Bond Legislation in File No. 833-2000-A. The form
of the Fourth Supplemental Indenture is approved with such changes
therein as are not inconsistent with
this Series 2000 Bond Legislation
and not adverse to the Issuer and
which are permitted by the Constitution and the laws of Ohio and as
shall be approved by the officers
signing the Fourth Supplemental
Indenture. The approval of those
changes, and the determination that
such changes are not adverse to the
Issuer, shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of the Fourth
Supplemental Indenture by those
officials. The Fourth Supplemental
Indenture shall expressly extend the
security of the Original Indenture as
thereby amended to the Series 2000
Bonds and shall cause the Indenture
to include, among other things: (i)
appropriate provisions for the use of
a book entry system for the Series
2000 Bonds, (ii) such covenants as
are necessary and appropriate for
the interest on the Series 2000 Bonds
to be exempt from gross income for
purposes of federal income taxation
under the Code, and (iii) such
covenants as are deemed necessary
and appropriate to obtain favorable
ratings on or credit enhancement for
the Series 2000 Bonds or to enhance
their marketability.
The Fourth Supplemental Indenture may also include such additional covenants of the Issuer as the
Fiscal Officer and the Director of
Port Control of the Issuer deem necessary and appropriate to obtain
favorable ratings on the Series 2000
Bonds and to enhance their marketability, including, without limitation, covenants pertaining to the
conditions under which the City may
acquire or construct additional airport facilities that may have an
adverse impact on the ability of the
Airport to generate sufficient Airport Revenues for purposes of the
Indenture, and covenants pertaining
to the Issuer’s obligations, if any,
regarding the lease and use agreements that may replace the existing
Use Agreements upon their termination.
To the extent permitted by the
Indenture, the Issuer is authorized,
from time to time, to enter into one
or more agreements in connection
with, prior to, or subsequent to the
issuance of the Series 2000 Bonds,
for an interest rate swap, an interest rate cap, or any other such

The City Record
arrangement to lower the effective
interest rate on the Series 2000
Bonds or to hedge the exposure of
the Issuer against fluctuations in
prevailing interest rates, and to
secure its obligations to the counterparties in such agreements on a
parity with its obligations to holders of Revenue Bonds under the
Indenture, subject to such conditions
and restrictions as may be specified
therein. The Fiscal Officer is authorized, on behalf of the Issuer, to execute and deliver any such agreement that meets the requirements of
the Indenture and that he determines,
based
upon
the
written
advice of the Issuer’s Financial
Advisor, will reduce the net Bond
service charges payable on the
Series 2000 Bonds or otherwise
enhance the timing and amount of
the
payments
thereof
for
the
Issuer’s purposes to an extent that
justifies the cost of the Issuer’s
entering into such agreement. In the
event that the Issuer’s entering into
any such agreement requires an
amendment to the Original Indenture as amended and supplemented
by the First Supplemental Indenture, Second Supplemental Indenture
and the Third Supplemental Indenture, then, provided that the consent
of holders of the requisite percentage of holders of outstanding Revenue Bonds is obtained in order for
such an amendment to become effective in accordance with Section 13.02
of
the
Original
Indenture,
the
Fourth Supplemental Indenture may
include an amendment to the Original Indenture as theretofore amended for the purpose of causing the
Indenture to permit the Issuer, from
time to time, to enter into one or
more agreements in connection with
or subsequent to the issuance of any
series of Revenue Bonds, for an
interest rate swap, an interest rate
cap, or any other such arrangement
to lower the effective interest rate
on Revenue Bonds or to hedge the
exposure of the Issuer against fluctuations in prevailing interest rates,
and to permit the Issuer to secure
its obligations to the counterparties
in such agreements on a parity with
its obligations to holders of Revenue
Bonds under the Indenture, subject
to such conditions and restrictions
as may be specified in such amendment. If such an amendment is
required, the Fiscal Officer is authorized to seek such consent from the
holders of the Revenue Bonds to be
outstanding upon the issuance of
the Series 2000 Bonds, including the
Original Purchasers.
This Series 2000 Bond Legislation
shall constitute a part of the Fourth
Supplemental Indenture as therein
provided and for all purposes thereof, including, without limitation, the
application to this Series 2000 Bond
Legislation of the provisions of the
Indenture relating to amendment,
modification, supplementation and
severability.
The Director of Port Control of
the Issuer is hereby authorized and
directed to execute and deliver to
the Airlines such amendments to the
Use Agreements as are necessary
and appropriate to cause the Use
Agreements to reflect the issuance
of the Series 2000 Bonds and the
execution and delivery of the Fourth
Supplemental Indenture and to be
consistent with the Fourth Supplemental Indenture.
The Clerk shall furnish to the
Original Purchasers of the Series
2000 Bonds a true transcript, certi-

1537

69
fied by the Clerk, of all proceedings
had with reference to the issuance
of the Series 2000 Bonds, along with
such information from the records of
the Issuer as is necessary to determine the regularity and validity of
the issuance of the Series 2000
Bonds.

execution of the Bond Purchase
Agreement by the Fiscal Officer.

further authorized and directed to
take all steps necessary to effect

that the Original Purchasers fail to
offer to purchase the Series 2000
Bonds on terms which are consistent
with the requirements of this Bond
Legislation or in the event that the

terms offered by the Original Purchasers are otherwise unacceptable
to the Issuer, but the execution of
the Bond Purchase Agreement by
the Fiscal Officer shall conclusively
evidence the absence of any such
determination.

Ord. No. 897-2000.
By Councilman Patmon (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance providing for the issuance and sale of
Bonds in the maximum principal
amount of $9,975,000 for the purpose
of providing funds for improving
buildings and structures housing
and providing for the discharge of
governmental functions and services
otherwise
benefiting
the
public
safety, health and welfare and to
pay capitalized interest and all
expenses
incurred
in
connection
with the issuance of the Bonds; to
authorize agreements with respect
to the Bonds; and to authorize the

such Bonds.
Whereas, this Council desires to
issue bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed Nine Million Nine Hundred Seventy Five
Thousand Dollars ($9,975,000) (the
“Bonds”) to finance the cost of certain
permanent
improvements
described in Section 1; and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of the City, has certified to this Council that the estimated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be financed with
the proceeds of the Bonds is at least
five (5) years and the maximum
maturity of the Bonds is twenty (20)
years; and
Whereas, this Council passed Ordinance No. 1749-80 on October 8, 1980,
and thereafter amended that ordinance by Ordinance No. 1112-83,
passed on May 6, 1983, and Ordinance No. 944-96, passed on June 10,
1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so

in accordance with its provisions, is
referred to as the “General Bond
Ordinance”), providing the general
terms
and
provisions
for
the
issuance thereunder of unvoted general obligations of the City and the
General Bond Ordinance was passed
in contemplation of this Ordinance
and other ordinances authorizing
the issuance of bonds in accordance
with the provisions thereof (the

Whereas, the issuance of the

for the benefit of the City, and as a
result, this Ordinance constitutes an
emergency measure providing for
the immediate preservation of the
public peace, property, health and
safety, and for the usual daily operation of a municipal department;
now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary to issue the Bonds in an

exceed Nine Million Nine Hundred
Seventy
Five
Thousand
Dollars

including
any

within
the
meaning
of
Revised Code Section 133.01(K), and

Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Sections
133.01 to 133.70, inclusive, and other
applicable provisions of the Revised
Code, the Charter of the City, the
General Bond Ordinance and this
Ordinance in the principal amount
and for the purpose stated in Section 1. The Bonds shall be designated “Public Facilities Improvement Bonds, Series 2000”. The Bonds
shall be issued in one lot as fully
registered Bonds in denominations
of $5,000 or any integral multiple
thereof. The Bonds shall be numbered as determined by the Director
of Finance.
The Bonds shall be dated as of
August 1, 2000, or such other date,
but in no event later than December
31, 2000, specified in the certificate
of award providing for the final
terms of the Bonds and the sale of
the bonds and signed by the Director of Finance in accordance with
this Ordinance (the “Certificate of
Award”). The Bonds shall bear
interest at the rate or rates per year
specified
in
the
Certificate
of
Award; provided that if all the
Bonds bear interest at the same rate
per year, then such rate shall not
exceed eight percent (8%) per year,
and if the Bonds bear interest at
more than one rate per year, then
the weighted average of such rates
(taking into account the principal
amount and maturity of each Bond
to which a rate applies) shall not
exceed eight percent (8%) per year.
Interest on the Bonds shall be
payable, until the principal amount
is paid, semi-annually on May 15
and November 15 of each year or on
the days specified in the Certificate
of Award as the dates on which
interest on the Bonds shall be
payable
(the
“Interest
Payment
Dates”), beginning November 15,
2000 or on such other Interest Payment Date specified in the Certificate of Award as the first Interest
Payment Date.
The
Bonds
shall
mature
on
November 15 in twenty (20) substantially equal annual installments,
beginning November 15, 2001, or
according to the schedule set forth
in the Certificate of Award, provided that (i) each principal payment
shall occur on an Interest Payment
Date, (ii) the first principal payment on the Bonds shall be no earlier than November 15, 2000 and no
later than August 1, 2002, (iii) the
final maturity date of the Bonds
shall be no later than twenty (20)
years from that date which is
twelve months prior to the first date
on which provision for payment of
principal is made, and (iv) the principal
amount
thereof
shall
be
payable in annual installments such
that the total principal and interest
payments on the Bonds in any fis-

The City Record
cal year in which principal is
payable is not more than three times
the amount of those payments in
any other fiscal year.
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the
“Mandatory
Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption prior to stated maturity
as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys, to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent,
currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of
and interest on any Term Bonds
shall include amounts sufficient to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City
for any Term Bonds. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate is
not timely furnished to the Escrow
Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding
mandatory
redemption
obligation) shall not be reduced. A
credit against
the
then
current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding
mandatory redemption obligation)
also shall be received by the City for
any Term Bonds which prior thereto
have been redeemed (other than
through the operation of the Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and canceled by the Registrar, to
the extent not applied
theretofore as a credit against any
mandatory redemption obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by

1547

79
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of
the principal amount thereof against
the then current Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement (and
corresponding mandatory redemption obligation). Any excess of that
amount
over
the
then
current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement shall be credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligations) in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(b)
Optional
Redemption.
The
Bonds may be subject to redemption
prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole on any
date, or in part on any Interest Payment Date, on the dates and for the
prices specified in the Certificate of
Award, or the Director of Finance
may determine that it is in the best
interests of the City for the Bonds
not to be callable prior to their stated maturity. In the event that the
Bonds are callable, the earliest date
for optional redemption shall be no
later than the tenth anniversary of
the first principal payment date and
the maximum redemption price shall
be no greater than 102% of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued
interest to the redemption date.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar, given upon the direction
of the Council of the City by passage of an ordinance. That notice
shall specify the redemption date
and the principal amount of each
maturity of Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar. In
the event that notice of redemption
shall have been given by the Registrar to the registered owners as
hereinafter provided, there shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, funds
which, in addition to any other moneys available therefor and held by
the Registrar, will be sufficient to
redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus interest accrued to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice
of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Bonds by lot when Bonds of
denominations greater than $5,000
are then outstanding, each $5,000
unit of principal thereof shall be
treated as though it were a separate
Bond of the denomination of $5,000.
If it is determined that one or more,

80
but not all of the $5,000 units of
principal amount represented by a
Bond are to be called for redemption. then upon notice of redemption
of a $5,000 unit or units, the registered owner of that Bond shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i)
for payment of the redemption price
of the $5,000 unit or units called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption and any
premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or
portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity
of
the
proceedings
for
the
redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph hereof, the Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due, and payable
on the redemption date, and, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the
redemption
price,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date. If
money for the redemption of all of
the Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with interest
accrued thereon to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, so as to be available therefor on that date and, if
notice
of
redemption
has
been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
that money shall not be so available
on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held
by
the
Registrar
for
the
redemption of particular Bonds shall
be held in trust for the account of
the registered owners thereof and
shall be paid to them, respectively,
upon presentation and surrender of
those Bonds.

The City Record
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying agent. Principal shall be payable
when due upon presentation and surrender of the Bonds at the principal
corporate trust office of the Registrar. Interest on a Bond shall be paid
on each Interest Payment Date by
check or draft mailed to the person
in whose name the Bond was registered, and to that person’s address
appearing, on the Bond Register (as
defined in Section 3) at the close of
business on the date provided in the
Agreement authorized in Section 3
(the “Record Date”). Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the
General Bond Ordinance, so long as
the Bonds are held by a Depository
in a book entry system (as described
in Section 3), debt charges on the
Bonds will be payable in lawful
money of the United States by wire
transfer to the Depository made by
the Escrow Agent on each Interest
Payment Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance is hereby adopted by reference, and, except for the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 of the General Bond Ordinance
(pertaining generally to the periods
during
which
the
City
is
not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under
the General Bond Ordinance), which
are not included in this Ordinance
and will not apply to the Bonds, the
General Bond Ordinance is included
as a part of this Ordinance as fully
as if restated herein. Words and
terms not otherwise defined herein
shall have the same meaning as set
forth in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their faces
the purpose for which they are
issued and that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to
Section 4 of the General Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be authenticated by the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee.
The Bonds shall be signed by the
City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor and
by the City’s Director of Finance or
Acting Director of Finance; provided, however, that in accordance with
Section 9.96 of the Code and the foregoing requirement that each Bond
bear the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee,
either or both of the signatures of
the City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor or
of its Director of Finance or Acting
Director of Finance may be a facsimile. The Bonds shall bear the
seal of the City, which seal may be
a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section
83 of the City’s Charter, the Director of Law or Acting Director of
Law shall prepare the Bonds and
shall endorse thereon his or her
approval of the form and correctness
thereof by his or her manual or facsimile signature.
Firstar Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent,
bond registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Bonds (the

1548

June 28, 2000
“Registrar”);
provided
that
the
Escrow Agent shall also act as paying agent for the Bonds so long as
the Bonds are held in a book entry
system. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, the Registrar Agreement among the City,
the Registrar and the Escrow Agent
(the “Agreement”) in substantially
the form as is now on file with the
Clerk of Council in File No. 897-2000-A.
The Agreement is approved, together with any changes or amendments that are not inconsistent
with this ordinance and not substantially adverse to the City and
that are approved by the Director
of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Agreement or amendments to the
Agreement. The Director of Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and
for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Agreement
from the proceeds of the Bonds to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided
in this Section (the “Bond Register’). Subject to the provisions of
Section 5, the person in whose name
a Bond is registered on the Bond
Register shall be regarded as the
absolute owner of that Bond for all
purposes of this ordinance. Payment
of or on account of the debt charges
on any Bond shall be made only to
or upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Bond at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner
or
by
a
person
legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the

June 28, 2000
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of
this ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Bonds
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Bonds surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized: (i) the
Bonds may be issued in the form of
a single, fully registered Bond representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the beneficial
owners in book entry form shall
have no right to receive Bonds in
the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for
transfer to another Depository or to
another nominee of a Depository,
without further action by the City.

The City Record
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Bonds from the Depository,
and the Trustee and Registrar shall
authenticate and deliver bond certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking
Fund and, if not purchased by such
Trustees, shall be offered to the
Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased by
such Account, shall be sold to NatCity Investments, Inc., SBK-Brooks
Investment Corp., as co-senior managers, and Lehman Brothers, as comanager, (collectively, the “Original
Purchaser”); provided, however, that
if, in the reasonable opinion of the
Director of Finance, an underwriter
is incapable of fully performing its
duties or meeting its obligations in
its capacity as Original Purchaser
with respect to the Bonds, the Director of Finance is hereby authorized
and directed, in the name of and on
behalf of the City, to take whatever actions may be necessary to terminate that underwriter’s standing
as Original Purchaser.
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Bonds as set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement, including: the
principal amount of the Bonds, final
purchase price (which shall be not
less than 97% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate
or rates, the amounts and years in
which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements),
the
Interest Payment Dates and the
date of the Bonds (if different from
those set forth in Section 2) and any
other matters required in this Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. If it is determined advisable by the Director of Finance for
the sale of the Bonds, the Director
of Finance is authorized to sign
agreements with a municipal bond
insurer issuing a policy of municipal bond insurance for the Bonds
that are not materially inconsistent

1549

81
with this Ordinance. The Mayor,
Director of Finance, Director of
Law and other appropriate officers
of the City are, and each of them
is, authorized and directed to take
such actions
as
are
necessary,
appropriate and in the best interest
of the City to establish the terms
and requirements for delivery of the
Bonds and to make such arrangements as are necessary with the
Original
Purchaser
in
order
to
establish the date, location, and procedure, and conditions for the delivery of the Bonds to the Original
Purchaser, to give all appropriate
notices and certificates, to cause a
true transcript of proceedings with
reference to the issuance of the
Bonds to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Mayor and the Director
of Finance are, and each of them is,
hereby
further
authorized
and
directed to execute and deliver on
behalf of the City a bond purchase
agreement
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, between the City and the Original Purchaser setting forth the
terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell and the Original
Purchaser agrees to buy the Bonds,
provided that such agreement shall
not provide for or require the terms
of the Bonds to be inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Bond Purchase
Agreement is approved substantially in the form now on file with the
Clerk of Council in the File referenced in Section 3, together with
any changes or amendments that
are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and not substantially adverse
to the City and that are approved
by the Director of Finance on
behalf of the City, all of which shall
be conclusively evidenced by the
signing
of
the
Bond
Purchase
Agreement or amendments to the
Bond Purchase Agreement. It is
hereby determined that the terms of
the Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance and as may be provided in or
pursuant
to
the
Certificate
of
Award, are in the best interest of
the City and in compliance with all
legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an
Official Statement is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
original issuance of the Bonds, those
officers in their official capacities
are authorized to prepare or cause
to be prepared on behalf of the City
an Official Statement and any necessary supplements thereto, and on
behalf of the City to use and distribute, or authorize the use and distribution of, that Official Statement
and any supplements thereto in connection with the original issuance of
the Bonds, and each of those officers is authorized to sign on behalf
of the City and in his or her official
capacity, that Official Statement and
any supplements thereto approved
by such officer. Those officers are
and each of them is authorized to
sign and deliver, on behalf of the
City and in their official capacities,

82
such certificates in connection with
the accuracy of the Official Statement and any supplements thereto
as may, in their judgment, be necessary or appropriate. Such officers
are also hereby authorized to determine and certify on behalf of the
City that such disclosure document
is “deemed final” by the City within the meaning of Securities and
Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12
(the “SEC Rule”).
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under, the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
and directed to prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Bonds in accordance
with the SEC Rule. The performance
of that Agreement shall be subject
to the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of the
occurrence of any other events, the
Director of Finance shall consult
with, as appropriate, the legal counsel and bond or other qualified independent special counsel to the City.
The Director of Finance, acting in
the name and on behalf of the City,
shall be entitled to rely upon any
legal advice provided by any such
counsel in determining whether a
filing should be made.
Pursuant
to
Section
133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds
with other bonds into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of their sale as a single issue to
be designated “Various Purpose General Obligation Bonds, Series 2000”.
Such bonds shall contain a summary statement of purposes encompassing the purpose for which the
Bonds are issued and shall state
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds
promptly when and as the same
falls due, and also to provide for the
discharge of the Bonds at maturity,
there shall be and is hereby levied
on all the taxable property in the
City, in addition to all other taxes,
a direct tax annually during the
period the Bonds are outstanding, in

The City Record
an amount sufficient to provide for
the payment of that interest, when
and as the same shall fall due, and
also to discharge the principal of
the Bonds at maturity, which tax
shall not be less than the interest
and sinking fund tax required by
Section 11 of Article XII of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of those years are certified, extended and collected. The
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from the tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund as provided pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on
the Bonds when and as the same
fall due; provided, however, that,
subject to the provisions of Section
8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in
each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the
Bonds and are appropriated for such
purpose, the amount of such tax
shall be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25 and 5705.51 of the
Revised Code, and in accordance
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the
General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt
charges for the Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended
and
applied
for
the
objects and purposes for which the
Bonds are issued upon City Council
authorization. Accrued interest and
any premium received from the sale
of the Bonds shall be deposited in
the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the Sinking Fund
to be applied to the payment of the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Bonds are secured by a pledge and
lien on a parity with the pledges
and liens authorized by the General Bond Ordinance and, in addition
to the taxes and revenues specifically pledged pursuant to this Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance and the other covenants,
terms
and
agreements
provided
hereunder and in the General Bond
Ordinance to secure payment of the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds, the City hereby determines,
declares, warrants and covenants
that the Bonds are general obligations of the City and that the full
faith and credit of the City are hereby pledged for the payment of the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds in accordance with the laws

1550

June 28, 2000
and Constitution of the State of
Ohio, this Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid
and discharged all the outstanding
Bonds, or there shall otherwise be
paid to the holders of the outstanding Bonds all debt charges due or
to become due thereon, and provision shall also be made for paying
all other sums payable hereunder,
then and in that event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of further
effect, and the covenants, agreements and other obligations of the
City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the
request of the City execute and
deliver to the City such instruments
in writing as shall discharge the
lien hereof and enter on the record
such discharge of the lien and such
other instruments as may be reasonably required by the City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or sub-accounts, in trust for and
irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold
in special accounts or sub-accounts,
in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations
of the United States certified by, an
independent public accounting firm
of national reputation or such other
qualified organization, to be of such
maturities and interest payment
dates and to bear such interest,
without further investment or reinvestment of either the principal
amount thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held
in trust and committed, except as
hereinafter provided), as will be sufficient,
together
with
moneys
referred to in (i) above, for the
payment, at their maturities or
redemption
dates,
of
all
debt
charges on the Bonds to their date
of maturity or redemption, as the
case may be, or if default in such
payment shall have occurred on
such date then to the date of the
tender of such payment; provided,
that
if
any
Bonds
are
to
be
redeemed prior to the maturity
thereof, notice of such redemption
shall have been duly given or irrevocable provision satisfactory to the
Trustee shall have been duly made
for the giving of such notice. Any
moneys held by the Escrow Agent
in accordance with the provisions of
this Section shall be invested by the
Escrow Agent in direct obligations
of the United States of America
maturing, or redeemable at the
option of the holder, at times and in
amounts sufficient to meet payment
of debt charges on the Bonds, as
directed by the Director of Finance.
Any income or interest earned by, or
increment to, the investments held
under this Section shall, to the
extent determined from time to time
by the Escrow Agent to be in excess
of the amount required to be held
by it for the purposes of this Section, be transferred at the time of
such determination as provided in
Section 17(a) of the General Bond
Ordinance for unclaimed funds held

June 28, 2000
by a Paying Agent. In the event of
nonpresentment of any Bond as
described in Section 17(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance, the moneys
held pursuant to this Section shall
be held and paid as provided in said
Section 17(a) for unclaimed funds
held by a Paying Agent.
Section 9. Bond Anticipation Notes.
For the purpose of raising money in
anticipation of the issuance of the
Bonds for the purposes set forth in
Section 1 hereof, notes of the City
may be issued in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed Nine Million Nine Hundred Seventy Five
Thousand Dollars ($9,975,000) (the
“Notes”) upon the direction of the
Director of Finance to be set forth
in a certificate providing for the
final terms of the Notes and the sale
of the Notes and signed by the
Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate of Award”).
Section 10. Term of the Notes. The
Notes shall bear interest at such

(7%) per year, as may be fixed by
the Director of Finance of the City
in the Note Certificate of Award;

of
issuance; shall mature on the date
set forth in the Note Certificate of
Award, which shall be no later than
five (5) years from such date of
issuance; shall be subject to redemption by the City at any time prior
to maturity without penalty, provided that, if the Director of Finance,
based on the advice of the financial
advisor of the City, determines that
it is in the best interest of the City
in order to enhance the marketability of the Notes, the Director of
Finance may cause the Notes to not
be redeemable for a period which
ends no later than the date which is
two (2) years following the date of
issuance of the Notes; shall be designated “Public Facilities Improvement
Bonds
Anticipation
Notes,
Series 2000”; shall be issued in such
numbers and denominations as may
be requested by the Note Purchaser
(hereinafter defined); and shall be
issued in fully registered form
(which may be in a book entry only
system) in denominations of $5,000
or integral multiples thereof. In connection with the issuance of the
Notes and the Bonds, Carmona Motley Hoffmann, Inc. shall serve as
the financial advisor of the City.
Interest shall be payable semi-annually on the dates set forth in the
Note Certificate of Award; provided
that if the Notes mature on or before
the end of the twelfth (12th) month
following their date of issuance,
interest on the Notes shall be
payable at maturity.
Firstar Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent, registrar, transfer agent and paying
agent for the Notes (the “Note Registrar”); provided that the Escrow
Agent also shall act as paying
agent for the Notes so long as the
Notes are held in a book entry system. The Director of Finance shall
sign and deliver, in the name and
on behalf of the City, an agreement
among the City, the Note Registrar
and the Escrow Agent (the “Note
Registrar Agreement”) providing for
services relating to the registration,
transfer, exchange and payment of
Notes. The Director of Finance shall
provide for the payment of the services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant
to the Note Registrar Agreement

The City Record
from the proceeds of the Notes to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose.
So long as any of the Notes
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Note Registrar to maintain and keep at its principal corporate trust office all books and
records necessary for the registration, exchange and transfer of Notes
as provided in this Section (the
“Note Register”). Subject to the provisions of Section 5, the person in
whose name a Note is registered on
the Note Register shall be regarded
as the absolute owner of that Note
for all purposes of this ordinance.
Payment of or on account of the
debt charges on any Note shall be
made only to or upon the order of
that person; neither the City nor the
Note Registrar shall be affected by
any notice to the contrary, but the
registration may be changed as provided in this Section. All such payments shall be valid and effectual
to satisfy and discharge the City’s
liability upon the Note, including
interest, to the extent of the amount
or amounts so paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for
Notes of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Note Registrar, together with a request for exchange
signed by the registered owner or
by a person legally empowered to
do so in a form satisfactory to the
Note Registrar. A Note may be
transferred only on the Note Register upon presentation and surrender of the Note at the principal corporate trust officer of the Note Registrar together with an assignment
signed by the registered owner or
by a person legally empowered to
do so in a form satisfactory to the
Note Registrar. Upon exchange or
transfer the Note Registrar shall
complete, authenticate and deliver
a new Note or Notes of any authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner equal
in the aggregate to the unmatured
principal amount of the Note surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Note Registrar shall undertake the exchange
or transfer of Notes only after the
new Notes are signed by the authorized officers of the City. In all
cases of Notes exchanged or transferred, the City shall sign and the
Note Registrar shall authenticate
and deliver Notes in accordance
with the provisions of this Ordinance. The exchange or transfer
shall be without charge to the
owner, except that the City and Note
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Note Registrar may require
that those charges, if any, be paid
before the procedure is begun for
the exchange or transfer. All Notes
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security ,and benefit under
this ordinance, as the Notes surrendered upon that exchange or transfer.

States of America if requested by
the Note Purchaser.
Section 12. Sale of the Notes. The
Notes shall be sold at private sale
to the Note Purchaser by the Director of Finance in the principal
amount set forth in a certificate of
award to be executed by the Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate

Bonds and any excess funds resulting from the issuance of the Notes
shall, to the extent necessary, be
used for the retirement of the Notes
at maturity, together with the interest thereon, and are hereby pledged,
for such purpose.
Section 14. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. During the year
or years while the Notes are outstanding there shall be levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes but within tax limitations, a direct tax annually not less than that which would
have been levied if bonds had been
issued therefor without the prior
issue of the Notes.
Said tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of said year are certified, extended and collected. Said
tax shall be placed before and in

the fill amount thereof. The funds
derived from said tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the

be irrevocably pledged for the payment of the principal and interest of
the Notes or the Bonds in anticipation of which they are issued, when

84
and as the same falls due; provided,
however, that in each year to the
extent that revenues are available
from other sources for the payment
of the Notes and Bonds and are
appropriated for such purpose, the
amount of such direct tax upon all
of the taxable property in the City
may be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
Section 15. Preparation of Disclosure Document for the Notes. The
Director of Finance is hereby authorized to prepare, execute and deliver to the Note Purchaser, to the

of this Ordinance.
Section 18. Federal Tax Covenants. The City covenants that it
will use, and will restrict the use
and investment of, the proceeds of
the Notes and the Bonds in such

and the Bonds will not (i) constitute
private activity bonds, arbitrage
bonds or hedge bonds under Sections
141, 148 or 149 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (the
“Code”) or (ii) be treated other than
as bonds to which Section 103(a) of
the Code applies, and (b) the interest thereon will not be treated as an
item of tax preference under Section
57 of the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the Notes
and the Bonds to be and to remain

the Bonds is also made with respect
to all issues any portion of the debt
service on which is paid from proceeds of the Notes or the Bonds
(and, if different, the original issue
and any refunding issues in a series
of refundings), to the extent such
compliance is necessary to assure
exclusion of interest on the Notes
and the Bonds from gross income
for federal income tax purposes, and
the officers identified above are
authorized to take actions with
respect to those issues as they are
authorized in this section to take
with respect to the Notes and the
Bonds.
The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer
of the City having responsibility

such
compliance,

to take any and all other actions,
make or obtain calculations, make
payments,
and
make

give
reports, covenants and certifications of and on behalf of the City,
as may be appropriate to assure the
exclusion of interest from gross

to give one or more appropriate certificates of the City, for inclusion
in the transcript of proceedings for
the Notes and the Bonds, setting
forth the reasonable expectations of
the City regarding the amount and
use of all the proceeds of the Notes
and the Bonds, the facts, circumstances and estimates on which
they are based, and other facts and
circumstances relevant to the tax
treatment of the interest on and the
tax status of the Notes and the
Bonds.

Awaiting the approval or disapproval of the Mayor.

Ord. No. 898-2000.
By
Councilman
Patmon
(by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance providing for the issuance and sale of
bonds in the maximum principal
amount of $5,590,000 for the purpose
of
providing
funds
to
improve
municipal
parks
and
recreation
facilities and to pay capitalized
interest and all expenses incurred in
connection with the issuance of the
Bonds; to authorize agreements with
respect to the Bonds; and to authorize the issuance of notes in anticipation of such Bonds.
Whereas, this Council desires to
issue bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed Five Million Five Hundred Ninety Thousand
Dollars ($5,590,000) (the “Bonds”) to
finance the cost of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1; and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of the City, has certified to this Council that the esti-

The City Record
mated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be financed with
the proceeds of the Bonds is at least
five (5) years and the maximum
maturity of the Bonds is twenty (20)
years; and
Whereas, this Council passed Ordinance No. 1749-80 on October 8, 1980,
and thereafter amended that ordinance by Ordinance No. 1112-83,
passed on May 6, 1983, and Ordinance No. 944-96, passed on June 10,
1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so
amended and as the same may further be amended from time to time
in accordance with its provisions, is
referred to as the “General Bond
Ordinance”), providing the general
terms
and
provisions
for
the
issuance thereunder of unvoted general obligations of the City and the
General Bond Ordinance was passed
in contemplation of this Ordinance
and other ordinances authorizing
the issuance of bonds in accordance
with the provisions thereof (the
“Series Bond Ordinances”); and
Whereas, the issuance of the
Bonds is necessary to provide funds
to pay the costs of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1, which are urgently needed
for the benefit of the City, and as a
result, this Ordinance constitutes an
emergency measure providing for
the immediate preservation of the
public peace, property, health and
safety, and for the usual daily operation of a municipal department;
now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary to issue the Bonds in
an aggregate principal amount
not to exceed Five Million Five
Hundred Ninety Thousand Dollars
($5,590,000) for the purpose of providing funds to improve municipal
parks and recreation facilities by
constructing, reconstructing, rehabilitating,
installing,
renovating,
enlarging and otherwise improving
parks and recreation centers and
areas, pools, skating rinks, greenhouses, bicycle paths, playgrounds,
playfields, golf courses and related
buildings,
structures,
walkways,
pavement and facilities, and providing
necessary
water
systems,
drainage, lighting, signage, fixtures,
furnishings, equipment, safety modifications and site improvements,
together with all preliminary associated research, planning and development and all necessary and incidental appurtenances in all cases,
including the acquisition of any
required real estate and interests in
real estate and to pay capitalized
interest and all expenses incurred in
connection with the issuance of the
Bonds.
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Sections
133.01 to 133.70, inclusive, and other
applicable provisions of the Revised
Code, the Charter of the City, the
General Bond Ordinance and this
Ordinance in the principal amount
and for the purpose stated in Section 1. The Bonds shall be designated “Parks and Recreation Facilities
Improvement
Bonds,
Series
2000”. The Bonds shall be issued in
one lot as fully registered Bonds in
denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. The Bonds
shall be numbered as determined by
the Director of Finance.

1553

85
The Bonds shall be dated as of
August 1, 2000, or such other date,
but in no event later than December
31, 2000, specified in the certificate
of award providing for the final
terms of the Bonds and the sale of
the bonds and signed by the Director of Finance in accordance with
this Ordinance (the “Certificate of
Award”). The Bonds shall bear
interest at the rate or rates per year
specified
in
the
Certificate
of
Award; provided that if all the
Bonds bear interest at the same rate
per year, then such rate shall not
exceed eight percent (8%) per year,
and if the Bonds bear interest at
more than one rate per year, then
the weighted average of such rates
(taking into account the principal
amount and maturity of each Bond
to which a rate applies) shall not
exceed eight percent (8%) per year.
Interest on the Bonds shall be
payable, until the principal amount
is paid, semi-annually on May 15
and November 15 of each year or on
the days specified in the Certificate
of Award as the dates on which
interest on the Bonds shall be
payable
(the
“Interest
Payment
Dates”), beginning November 15,
2000 or on such other Interest Payment Date specified in the Certificate of Award as the first Interest
Payment Date.
The
Bonds
shall
mature
on
November 15 in twenty (20) substantially equal annual installments,
beginning November 15, 2001, or
according to the schedule set forth
in the Certificate of Award, provided that (i) each principal payment
shall occur on an Interest Payment
Date, (ii) the first principal payment on the Bonds shall be no earlier than November 15, 2000 and no
later than August 1, 2002, (iii) the
final maturity date of the Bonds
shall be no later than twenty (20)
years from that date which is
twelve months prior to the first date
on which provision for payment of
principal is made, and (iv) the principal
amount
thereof
shall
be
payable in annual installments such
that the total principal and interest
payments on the Bonds in any fiscal year in which principal is
payable is not more than three times
the amount of those payments in
any other fiscal year.
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the
“Mandatory
Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption prior to stated maturity
as follows:
(a) Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount

86
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys, to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent,
currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of
and interest on any Term Bonds
shall include amounts sufficient to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City
for any Term Bonds. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds which
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and canceled
by the Registrar, to the extent not
applied
theretofore
as
a
credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of
the principal amount thereof against
the then current Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement (and
corresponding mandatory redemption obligation). Any excess of that
amount
over
the
then
current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement shall be credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligations) in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(b)
Optional
Redemption.
The
Bonds may be subject to redemption
prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole on any
date, or in part on any Interest Payment Date, on the dates and for the
prices specified in the Certificate of
Award, or the Director of Finance
may determine that it is in the best
interests of the City for the Bonds
not to be callable prior to their stated maturity. In the event that the
Bonds are callable, the earliest date
for optional redemption shall be no
later than the tenth anniversary of
the first principal payment date and
the maximum redemption price shall
be no greater than 102% of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued
interest to the redemption date.
If optional redemption at a price

The City Record
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar, given upon the direction
of the Council of the City by passage of an ordinance. That notice
shall specify the redemption date
and the principal amount of each
maturity of Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar. In
the event that notice of redemption
shall have been given by the Registrar to the registered owners as
hereinafter provided, there shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, funds
which, in addition to any other moneys available therefor and held by
the Registrar, will be sufficient to
redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus interest accrued to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice
of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Bonds by lot when Bonds of
denominations greater than $5,000
are then outstanding, each $5,000
unit of principal thereof shall be
treated as though it were a separate
Bond of the denomination of $5,000.
If it is determined that one or more,
but not all of the $5,000 units of
principal amount represented by a
Bond are to be called for redemption. then upon notice of redemption
of a $5,000 unit or units, the registered owner of that Bond shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i)
for payment of the redemption price
of the $5,000 unit or units called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption and any
premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the

1554

June 28, 2000
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity
of
the
proceedings
for
the
redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph hereof, the Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due, and payable
on the redemption date, and, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the
redemption
price,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date. If
money for the redemption of all of
the Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with interest
accrued thereon to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, so as to be available therefor on that date and, if
notice
of
redemption
has
been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
that money shall not be so available
on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held
by
the
Registrar
for
the
redemption of particular Bonds shall
be held in trust for the account of
the registered owners thereof and
shall be paid to them, respectively,
upon presentation and surrender of
those Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section
3) at the close of business on the
date provided in the Agreement
authorized in Section 3 (the “Record
Date”). Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond
Ordinance, so long as the Bonds are
held by a Depository in a book entry
system (as described in Section 3),
debt charges on the Bonds will be
payable in lawful money of the United States by wire transfer to the
Depository made by the Escrow
Agent on each Interest Payment
Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance is hereby adopted by reference, and, except for the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) of the

June 28, 2000
General Bond Ordinance (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 of the General Bond Ordinance
(pertaining generally to the periods
during
which
the
City
is
not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under the
General Bond Ordinance), which are
not included in this Ordinance and
will not apply to the Bonds, the General Bond Ordinance is included as
a part of this Ordinance as fully as
if restated herein. Words and terms
not otherwise defined herein shall
have the same meaning as set forth
in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their faces
the purpose for which they are
issued and that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to
Section 4 of the General Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be authenticated by the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee.
The Bonds shall be signed by the
City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor and
by the City’s Director of Finance or
Acting Director of Finance; provided, however, that in accordance with
Section 9.96 of the Code and the foregoing requirement that each Bond
bear the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee,
either or both of the signatures of
the City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor or
of its Director of Finance or Acting
Director of Finance may be a facsimile. The Bonds shall bear the
seal of the City, which seal may be
a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section
83 of the City’s Charter, the Director of Law or Acting Director of
Law shall prepare the Bonds and
shall endorse thereon his or her
approval of the form and correctness
thereof by his or her manual or facsimile signature.
Firstar Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent,
bond registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Bonds (the
“Registrar”);
provided
that
the
Escrow Agent shall also act as paying agent for the Bonds so long as
the Bonds are held in a book entry
system. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, the Registrar Agreement among the City,
the Registrar and the Escrow Agent
(the “Agreement”) in substantially the
form as is now on file with the Clerk
of Council in File No. 898-2000-A.
The Agreement is approved, together with any changes or amendments that are not inconsistent
with this ordinance and not substantially adverse to the City and
that are approved by the Director
of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Agreement or amendments to the
Agreement.
The
Director
of
Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and
for
reimbursement
of
expenses
incurred pursuant to the Agreement
from the proceeds of the Bonds to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust

The City Record
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided
in this Section (the “Bond Register’). Subject to the provisions of
Section 5, the person in whose name
a Bond is registered on the Bond
Register shall be regarded as the
absolute owner of that Bond for all
purposes of this ordinance. Payment
of or on account of the debt charges
on any Bond shall be made only to
or upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Bond at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner
or
by
a
person
legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of
this ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Bonds
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Bonds surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only

1555

87
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized: (i) the
Bonds may be issued in the form of
a single, fully registered Bond representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the beneficial
owners in book entry form shall
have no right to receive Bonds in
the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for
transfer to another Depository or to
another nominee of a Depository,
without further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Bonds from the Depository,
and the Trustee and Registrar shall
authenticate and deliver bond certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.

88
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking
Fund and, if not purchased by such
Trustees, shall be offered to the
Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased by
such Account, shall be sold to NatCity Investments, Inc., SBK-Brooks
Investment Corp., as co-senior managers, and Lehman Brothers, as comanager, (collectively, the “Original
Purchaser”); provided, however, that
if, in the reasonable opinion of the
Director of Finance, an underwriter
is incapable of fully performing its
duties or meeting its obligations in
its capacity as Original Purchaser
with respect to the Bonds, the Director of Finance is hereby authorized
and directed, in the name of and on
behalf of the City, to take whatever actions may be necessary to terminate that underwriter’s standing
as Original Purchaser.
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Bonds as set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement, including: the
principal amount of the Bonds, final
purchase price (which shall be not
less than 97% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate
or rates, the amounts and years in
which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements),
the
Interest Payment Dates and the
date of the Bonds (if different from
those set forth in Section 2) and any
other matters required in this Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. If it is determined advisable
by the Director of Finance for the
sale of the Bonds, the Director of
Finance is authorized to sign agreements with a municipal bond insurer issuing a policy of municipal
bond insurance for the Bonds that
are not materially inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Mayor, Director
of Finance, Director of Law and
other appropriate officers of the
City are, and each of them is, authorized and directed to take such
actions as are necessary, appropriate and in the best interest of the
City to establish the terms and
requirements for delivery of the
Bonds and to make such arrangements as are necessary with the
Original Purchaser in order to establish the date, location, and procedure, and conditions for the delivery
of the Bonds to the Original Purchaser,
to
give
all
appropriate
notices and certificates, to cause a
true transcript of proceedings with
reference to the issuance of the
Bonds to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Mayor and the Director
of Finance are, and each of them is,
hereby
further
authorized
and
directed to execute and deliver on
behalf of the City a bond purchase
agreement
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form

The City Record
and correctness by the Director of
Law, between the City and the Original Purchaser setting forth the
terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell and the Original
Purchaser agrees to buy the Bonds,
provided that such agreement shall
not provide for or require the terms
of the Bonds to be inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Bond Purchase
Agreement is approved substantially in the form now on file with the
Clerk of Council in the File referenced in Section 3, together with
any changes or amendments that
are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and not substantially adverse
to the City and that are approved by
the Director of Finance on behalf of
the City, all of which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing
of the Bond Purchase Agreement or
amendments to the Bond Purchase
Agreement. It is hereby determined
that the terms of the Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance and as may
be provided in or pursuant to the
Certificate of Award, are in the best
interest of the City and in compliance with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an
Official Statement is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
original issuance of the Bonds, those
officers in their official capacities
are authorized to prepare or cause
to be prepared on behalf of the City
an Official Statement and any necessary supplements thereto, and on
behalf of the City to use and distribute, or authorize the use and distribution of, that Official Statement
and any supplements thereto in connection with the original issuance of
the Bonds, and each of those officers is authorized to sign on behalf
of the City and in his or her official
capacity, that Official Statement and
any supplements thereto approved
by such officer. Those officers are
and each of them is authorized to
sign and deliver, on behalf of the
City and in their official capacities,
such certificates in connection with
the accuracy of the Official Statement and any supplements thereto
as may, in their judgment, be necessary or appropriate. Such officers
are also hereby authorized to determine and certify on behalf of the
City that such disclosure document
is “deemed final” by the City within the meaning of Securities and
Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12
(the “SEC Rule”).
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under, the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
and directed to prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Bonds in accordance

1556

June 28, 2000
with the SEC Rule. The performance
of that Agreement shall be subject
to the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of the
occurrence of any other events, the
Director of Finance shall consult
with, as appropriate, the legal counsel and bond or other qualified independent special counsel to the City.
The Director of Finance, acting in
the name and on behalf of the City,
shall be entitled to rely upon any
legal advice provided by any such
counsel in determining whether a
filing should be made.
Pursuant
to
Section
133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds
with other bonds into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of their sale as a single issue to
be designated “Various Purpose General Obligation Bonds, Series 2000”.
Such bonds shall contain a summary statement of purposes encompassing the purpose for which the
Bonds are issued and shall state
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds
promptly when and as the same
falls due, and also to provide for the
discharge of the Bonds at maturity,
there shall be and is hereby levied
on all the taxable property in the
City, in addition to all other taxes,
a direct tax annually during the
period the Bonds are outstanding, in
an amount sufficient to provide for
the payment of that interest, when
and as the same shall fall due, and
also to discharge the principal of
the Bonds at maturity, which tax
shall not be less than the interest
and sinking fund tax required by
Section 11 of Article XII of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of those years are certified, extended and collected. The
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from the tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund as provided pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on
the Bonds when and as the same
fall due; provided, however, that,
subject to the provisions of Section
8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in
each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the
Bonds and are appropriated for such
purpose, the amount of such tax
shall be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.

June 28, 2000
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25 and 5705.51 of the
Revised Code, and in accordance
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the
General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt
charges for the Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended and applied for the objects
and purposes for which the Bonds
are issued upon City Council authorization. Accrued interest and any
premium received from the sale of
the Bonds shall be deposited in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund to be
applied to the payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Bonds are secured by a pledge and
lien on a parity with the pledges
and liens authorized by the General
Bond Ordinance and, in addition to
the taxes and revenues specifically
pledged pursuant to this Ordinance
and the General Bond Ordinance and
the other covenants, terms and
agreements provided hereunder and
in the General Bond Ordinance to
secure payment of the principal of
and interest on the Bonds, the City
hereby determines, declares, warrants and covenants that the Bonds
are general obligations of the City
and that the full faith and credit of
the City are hereby pledged for the
payment of the principal of and
interest on the Bonds in accordance
with the laws and Constitution of
the State of Ohio, this Ordinance and
the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid
and discharged all the outstanding
Bonds, or there shall otherwise be
paid to the holders of the outstanding Bonds all debt charges due or
to become due thereon, and provision shall also be made for paying
all other sums payable hereunder,
then and in that event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of further
effect, and the covenants, agreements and other obligations of the
City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the
request of the City execute and
deliver to the City such instruments
in writing as shall discharge the
lien hereof and enter on the record
such discharge of the lien and such
other instruments as may be reasonably required by the City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or sub-accounts, in trust for and
irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold
in special accounts or- sub-accounts,
in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations
of the United States certified by, an

The City Record
independent public accounting firm
of national reputation or such other
qualified organization, to be of such
maturities and interest payment
dates and to bear such interest,
without further investment or reinvestment of either the principal
amount thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held
in trust and committed, except as
hereinafter provided), as will be sufficient,
together
with
moneys
referred to in (i) above, for the payment, at their maturities or redemption dates, of all debt charges on the
Bonds to their date of maturity or
redemption, as the case may be, or
if default in such payment shall
have occurred on such date then to
the date of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds
are to be redeemed prior to the
maturity thereof, notice of such
redemption shall have been duly
given or irrevocable provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall have
been duly made for the giving of
such notice. Any moneys held by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with
the provisions of this Section shall
be invested by the Escrow Agent in
direct obligations of the United
States of America maturing, or
redeemable at the option of the holder, at times and in amounts sufficient to meet payment of debt
charges on the Bonds, as directed by
the Director of Finance. Any income
or interest earned by, or increment
to, the investments held under this
Section shall, to the extent determined from time to time by the
Escrow Agent to be in excess of the
amount required to be held by it for
the purposes of this Section, be
transferred at the time of such
determination as provided in Section

for unclaimed funds held by a Paying Agent. In the event of nonpresentment of any Bond as described
in Section 17(a) of the General Bond
Ordinance, the moneys held pursuant to this Section shall be held

17(a) for unclaimed funds held by a
Paying Agent.
Section 9. Bond Anticipation Notes.
For the purpose of raising money in
anticipation of the issuance of the
Bonds for the purposes set forth in
Section 1 hereof, notes of the City
may be issued in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed Five Million Five Hundred Ninety Thousand
Dollars ($5,590,000) (the “Notes”)
upon the direction of the Director of
Finance to be set forth in a certificate providing for the final terms of
the Notes and the sale of the Notes
and signed by the Director of
Finance (the “Note Certificate of
Award”).
Section 10. Term of the Notes. The
Notes shall bear interest at such
rate, not exceeding seven percent
(7%) per year, as may be fixed by
the Director of Finance of the City
in the Note Certificate of Award;

Award, which shall be no later than
five (5) years from such date of
issuance; shall be subject to redemption by the City at any time prior
to maturity without penalty, provided that, if the Director of Finance,
based on the advice of the financial
advisor of the City, determines that
it is in the best interest of the City
in order to enhance the marketabil-

1557

89
ity of the Notes, the Director of
Finance may cause the Notes to not
be redeemable for a period which
ends no later than the date which is
two (2) years following the date of
issuance of the Notes; shall be designated
“Parks
and
Recreation
Facilities Improvement Bond Anticipation Notes, Series 2000”; shall be
issued in such numbers and denominations as may be requested by the
Note
Purchaser
(hereinafter
defined); and shall be issued in
fully registered form (which may be
in a book entry only system) in
denominations of $5,000 or integral
multiples
thereof.
In
connection
with the issuance of the Notes and
the Bonds, Carmona Motley Hoffmann, Inc. shall serve as the financial advisor of the City. Interest
shall be payable semi-annually on
the dates set forth in the Note Certificate of Award; provided that if
the Notes mature on or before the
end of the twelfth (12th) month following their date of issuance, interest on the Notes shall be payable at
maturity.
Firstar Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent, registrar, transfer agent and paying
agent for the Notes (the “Note Registrar”); provided that the Escrow
Agent also shall act as paying
agent for the Notes so long as the
Notes are held in a book entry system. The Director of Finance shall
sign and deliver, in the name and
on behalf of the City, an agreement
among the City, the Note Registrar
and the Escrow Agent (the “Note
Registrar Agreement”) providing for
services relating to the registration,
transfer, exchange and payment of
Notes. The Director of Finance shall
provide for the payment of the services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant
to the Note Registrar Agreement
from the proceeds of the Notes to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose.
So long as any of the Notes
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Note Registrar to maintain and keep at its principal corporate trust office all books and
records necessary for the registration, exchange and transfer of Notes
as provided in this Section (the
“Note Register”). Subject to the provisions of Section 5, the person in
whose name a Note is registered on
the Note Register shall be regarded
as the absolute owner of that Note
for all purposes of this ordinance.
Payment of or on account of the
debt charges on any Note shall be
made only to or upon the order of
that person; neither the City nor the
Note Registrar shall be affected by
any notice to the contrary, but the
registration may be changed as provided in this Section. All such payments shall be valid and effectual
to satisfy and discharge the City’s
liability upon the Note, including
interest, to the extent of the amount
or amounts so paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for
Notes of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Note Registrar, together with a request for exchange
signed by the registered owner or
by a person legally empowered to do
so in a form satisfactory to the Note
Registrar. A Note may be transferred only on the Note Register

90
upon presentation and surrender of
the Note at the principal corporate
trust officer of the Note Registrar
together with an assignment signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Note Registrar. Upon exchange or transfer
the Note Registrar shall complete,
authenticate and deliver a new Note
or Notes of any authorized denomination or denominations requested
by the owner equal in the aggregate
to the unmatured principal amount
of the Note surrendered and bearing
interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Note Registrar shall undertake the exchange
or transfer of Notes only after the
new Notes are signed by the authorized officers of the City. In all
cases of Notes exchanged or transferred, the City shall sign and the
Note Registrar shall authenticate
and deliver Notes in accordance with
the provisions of this Ordinance. The
exchange or transfer shall be without charge to the owner, except that
the City and Note Registrar may
make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any tax or other governmental charge required to be
paid with respect to the exchange or
transfer. The City or the Note Registrar
may
require
that
those
charges, if any, be paid before the
procedure is begun for the exchange
or transfer. All Notes issued and
authenticated upon any exchange or
transfer shall be valid obligations of
the City, evidencing the same debt,
and entitled to the same security
,and benefit under this ordinance, as
the Notes surrendered upon that
exchange or transfer.
Pursuant
to
Section
133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Notes
with other bond anticipation notes
of the City into a single consolidated ‘issue of bonds for purposes of
their sale as a single issue to be
designated “Various Purpose General

purposes encompassing the purpose
for which the Notes are issued and
shall state that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 11. Execution and Payment of the Notes. The Notes shall
be executed by the Director of
Finance and the Mayor, provided
that one of such signatures may be
a facsimile. Such Notes shall express
upon their face the purpose for
which they are issued and that they
are issued pursuant to this ordinance, and may be payable in Federal Reserve funds of the United
States of America if requested by
the Note Purchaser.
Section 12. Sale of the Notes. The
Notes shall be sold at private sale
to the Note Purchaser by the Director of Finance in the principal
amount set forth in a certificate of
award to be executed by the Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate
of Award”) at not less than par and
accrued interest and at a rate not

Notes are being issued under the
provisions of this Ordinance.
Section 13. Security for the Notes.
The Notes shall be the full general
obligations of the City, and the full
faith, credit and revenue of the City
are hereby pledged for the prompt
payment of the same. The par value
to be received from the sale of the
Bonds and any excess funds resulting from the issuance of the Notes
shall, to the extent necessary, be
used for the retirement of the Notes
at maturity, together with the interest thereon, and are hereby pledged,
for such purpose.
Section 14. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. During the year
or years while the Notes are outstanding there shall be levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes but within tax limitations, a direct tax annually not less than that which would
have been levied if bonds had been
issued therefor without the prior
issue of the Notes.
Said tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of said year are certified, extended and collected. Said
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the fill amount thereof. The funds
derived from said tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account, which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of the principal and interest of
the Notes or the Bonds in anticipation of which they are issued, when
and as the same falls due; provided,
however, that in each year to the
extent that revenues are available
from other sources for the payment
of the Notes and Bonds and are
appropriated for such purpose, the
amount of such direct tax upon all
of the taxable property in the City
may be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
Section 15. Preparation of Disclosure Document for the Notes. The
Director of Finance is hereby authorized to prepare, execute and deliver to the Note Purchaser, to the
extent required by law, a preliminary and final Official Statement or

will use, and will restrict the use
and investment of, the proceeds of
the Notes and the Bonds in such

and the Bonds will not (i) constitute
private activity bonds, arbitrage
bonds or hedge bonds under Sections
141, 148 or 149 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (the
“Code”) or (ii) be treated other than
as bonds to which Section 103(a) of
the Code applies, and (b) the interest thereon will not be treated as an
item of tax preference under Section
57 of the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the Notes
and the Bonds to be and to remain

Bonds to the governmental purpose
of the borrowing, (ii) restrict the
yield

investment
property
acquired with those proceeds, (iii)

the Bonds is also made with respect
to all issues any portion of the debt
service on which is paid from proceeds of the Notes or the Bonds
(and, if different, the original issue
and any refunding issues in a series
of refundings), to the extent such
compliance is necessary to assure
exclusion of interest on the Notes
and the Bonds from gross income
for federal income tax purposes, and
the officers identified above are
authorized to take actions with
respect to those issues as they are
authorized in this section to take
with respect to the Notes and the
Bonds.
The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer of
the City having responsibility for
issuance of the Notes and the Bonds
is hereby authorized (a) to make or

actions, make or obtain calculations,

costs of certain permanent improvements which are urgently needed
for the benefit of the City and for
the usual daily operation of a

Passed June 19, 2000.
Awaiting the approval or disapproval of the Mayor.

Ord. No. 899-2000.
By
Councilman
Patmon
(by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance providing for the issuance and sale of
Bonds in the maximum principal
amount of $11,090,000 for the purpose of providing funds to improve
the municipal street system and
related facilities and to pay capitalized
interest
and
all
expenses
incurred in connection with the
issuance of the Bonds; to authorize
agreements with respect to the
Bonds; and to authorize the issuance
of notes in anticipation of such
Bonds.
Whereas, this Council desires to
issue bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed Eleven
Million Ninety Thousand Dollars
($11,090,000) (the “Bonds”) to finance
the cost of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1;
and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of the City, has certified to this Council that the estimated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be financed with
the proceeds of the Bonds is at least
five (5) years and the maximum
maturity of the Bonds is seventeen
(17) years; and
Whereas, this Council passed Ordinance No. 1749-80 on October 8, 1980,
and thereafter amended that ordinance by Ordinance No. 1112-83,
passed on May 6, 1983, and Ordinance No. 944-96, passed on June 10,
1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so
amended and as the same may further be amended from time to time
in accordance with its provisions, is
referred to as the “General Bond
Ordinance”), providing the general
terms
and
provisions
for
the
issuance thereunder of unvoted general obligations of the City and the
General Bond Ordinance was passed
in contemplation of this Ordinance
and other ordinances authorizing
the issuance of bonds in accordance
with the provisions thereof (the
“Series Bond Ordinances”); and
Whereas, the issuance of the
Bonds is necessary to provide funds
to pay the costs of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1, which are urgently needed
for the benefit of the City, and as a
result, this Ordinance constitutes an
emergency measure providing for
the immediate preservation of the
public peace, property, health and
safety, and for the usual daily operation of a municipal department;
now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

92
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary to issue the Bonds in an
aggregate principal amount not to
exceed Eleven Million Ninety Thousand Dollars ($11,090,000) for the
purpose
of
providing
funds
to
improve the municipal street system
and
related
facilities,
including
streets, expressways, roadways, driveway approaches and pedestrian
walkways as designated, by acquiring,
constructing,
reconstructing,

and improving retaining walls, relocating certain utilities, resetting
and constructing catch basins and
other storm drainage facilities, constructing, reconstructing, replacing,
renovating
and
rehabilitating
bridges, acquiring any real estate

purpose, and installing signs, signals, markings and other devices for
traffic control purposes, together
with the payment of all associated
preliminary costs and costs of site
clearance and all appurtenances
necessary and incidental thereto,
and to pay capitalized interest and
all expenses incurred in connection
with the issuance of the Bonds,
including any financing costs within the meaning of Revised Code Section 133.01(K); and such other costs
of the foregoing permanent improvements that may be financed with
the proceeds of securities as permitted by Revised Code Section
133.15(B) and as otherwise permitted by law; and to authorize the
issuance of notes in anticipation of
such Bonds.
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Sections
133.01 to 133.70, inclusive, and other
applicable provisions of the Revised
Code, the Charter of the City, the
General Bond Ordinance and this
Ordinance in the principal amount
and for the purpose stated in Section 1. The Bonds shall be designated
“Bridges
and
Roadways
Improvement Bonds, Series 2000”.
The Bonds shall be issued in one lot
as fully registered Bonds in denominations of $5,000 or any integral
multiple thereof. The Bonds shall be
numbered as determined by the
Director of Finance.
The Bonds shall be dated as of
August 1, 2000, or such other date,
but in no event later than December
31, 2000, specified in the certificate
of award providing for the final
terms of the Bonds and the sale of
the bonds and signed by the Director of Finance in accordance with
this Ordinance (the “Certificate of
Award”). The Bonds shall bear
interest at the rate or rates per year
specified
in
the
Certificate
of
Award; provided that if all the
Bonds bear interest at the same rate
per year, then such rate shall not
exceed eight percent (8%) per year,
and if the Bonds bear interest at
more than one rate per year, then
the weighted average of such rates
(taking into account the principal
amount and maturity of each Bond
to which a rate applies) shall not
exceed eight percent (8%) per year.
Interest on the Bonds shall be
payable, until the principal amount
is paid, semi-annually on May 15
and November 15 of each year or on

The City Record
the days specified in the Certificate
of Award as the dates on which
interest on the Bonds shall be
payable
(the
“Interest
Payment
Dates”), beginning November 15,
2000 or on such other Interest Payment Date specified in the Certificate of Award as the first Interest
Payment Date.
The
Bonds
shall
mature
on
November 15 in seventeen (17) substantially equal annual installments,
beginning November 15, 2001, or
according to the schedule set forth
in the Certificate of Award, provided that (i) each principal payment
shall occur on an Interest Payment
Date, (ii) the first principal payment on the Bonds shall be no earlier than November 15, 2000 and no
later than August 1, 2002, (iii) the
final maturity date of the Bonds
shall be no later than seventeen
(17) years from that date which is
twelve months prior to the first date
on which provision for payment of
principal is made, and (iv) the principal
amount
thereof
shall
be
payable in annual installments such
that the total principal and interest
payments on the Bonds in any fiscal year in which principal is
payable is not more than three times
the amount of those payments in
any other fiscal year.
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the
“Mandatory
Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption prior to stated maturity
as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys, to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent,
currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of
and interest on any Term Bonds
shall include amounts sufficient to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City
for any Term Bonds. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or

1560

June 28, 2000
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds which
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and canceled
by the Registrar, to the extent not
applied
theretofore
as
a
credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of
the principal amount thereof against
the then current Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement (and
corresponding mandatory redemption obligation). Any excess of that
amount
over
the
then
current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement shall be credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligations) in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(b)
Optional
Redemption.
The
Bonds may be subject to redemption
prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole on any
date, or in part on any Interest Payment Date, on the dates and for the
prices specified in the Certificate of
Award, or the Director of Finance
may determine that it is in the best
interests of the City for the Bonds
not to be callable prior to their stated maturity. In the event that the
Bonds are callable, the earliest date
for optional redemption shall be no
later than the tenth anniversary of
the first principal payment date and
the maximum redemption price shall
be no greater than 102% of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued
interest to the redemption date.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar, given upon the direction
of the Council of the City by passage of an ordinance. That notice
shall specify the redemption date
and the principal amount of each
maturity of Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar. In
the event that notice of redemption
shall have been given by the Registrar to the registered owners as

June 28, 2000
hereinafter provided, there shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, funds
which, in addition to any other moneys available therefor and held by
the Registrar, will be sufficient to
redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus interest accrued to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice
of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial
redemption of Bonds by lot when
Bonds
of
denominations
greater
than $5,000 are then outstanding,
each $5,000 unit of principal thereof shall be treated as though it
were a separate Bond of the denomination of $5,000. If it is determined
that one or more, but not all of the
$5,000 units of principal amount represented by a Bond are to be called
for redemption. then upon notice of
redemption of a $5,000 unit or units,
the registered owner of that Bond
shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar
(i)
for
payment
of
the
redemption price of the $5,000 unit
or
units
called
for
redemption
(including, without limitation, the
interest accrued to the date fixed
for redemption and any premium),
and
(ii)
for
issuance,
without
charge to the registered owner
thereof, of a new Bond or Bonds of
any
authorized
denomination or
denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unmatured and unredeemed portion of,
and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity
of
the
proceedings
for
the
redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph hereof, the Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due, and payable
on the redemption date, and, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the

The City Record
redemption
price,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date. If
money for the redemption of all of
the Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with interest
accrued thereon to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, so as to be available therefor on that date and, if
notice
of
redemption
has
been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
that money shall not be so available
on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held
by
the
Registrar
for
the
redemption of particular Bonds shall
be held in trust for the account of
the registered owners thereof and
shall be paid to them, respectively,
upon presentation and surrender of
those Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section
3) at the close of business on the
date provided in the Agreement
authorized in Section 3 (the “Record
Date”). Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond
Ordinance, so long as the Bonds are
held by a Depository in a book entry
system (as described in Section 3),
debt charges on the Bonds will be
payable in lawful money of the United States by wire transfer to the
Depository made by the Escrow
Agent on each Interest Payment
Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance is hereby adopted by reference, and, except for the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 of the General Bond Ordinance
(pertaining generally to the periods
during
which
the
City
is
not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under
the General Bond Ordinance), which
are not included in this Ordinance
and will not apply to the Bonds, the
General Bond Ordinance is included
as a part of this Ordinance as fully
as if restated herein. Words and
terms not otherwise defined herein
shall have the same meaning as set
forth in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their faces

1561

93
the purpose for which they are
issued and that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to
Section 4 of the General Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be authenticated by the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee.
The Bonds shall be signed by the
City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor and
by the City’s Director of Finance or
Acting Director of Finance; provided, however, that in accordance with
Section 9.96 of the Code and the foregoing requirement that each Bond
bear the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee,
either or both of the signatures of
the City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor or
of its Director of Finance or Acting
Director of Finance may be a facsimile. The Bonds shall bear the
seal of the City, which seal may be
a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section
83 of the City’s Charter, the Director of Law or Acting Director of
Law shall prepare the Bonds and
shall endorse thereon his or her
approval of the form and correctness
thereof by his or her manual or facsimile signature.
Firstar Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent,
bond registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Bonds (the
“Registrar”); provided that the Escrow Agent shall also act as paying
agent for the Bonds so long as the
Bonds are held in a book entry system. The Director of Finance shall
sign and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of the City, the Registrar
Agreement among the City, the Registrar and the Escrow Agent (the
“Agreement”) in substantially the
form as is now on file with the Clerk
of Council in File No. 899-2000-A.
The Agreement is approved, together with any changes or amendments that are not inconsistent
with this ordinance and not substantially adverse to the City and
that are approved by the Director
of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Agreement or amendments to the
Agreement. The Director of Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and
for
reimbursement
of
expenses
incurred pursuant to the Agreement
from the proceeds of the Bonds to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided in
this Section (the “Bond Register’).
Subject to the provisions of Section
5, the person in whose name a Bond
is registered on the Bond Register
shall be regarded as the absolute
owner of that Bond for all purposes
of this ordinance. Payment of or on
account of the debt charges on any
Bond shall be made only to or upon
the order of that person; neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be
affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid and
effectual to satisfy and discharge
the City’s liability upon the Bond,
including interest, to the extent of
the amount or amounts so paid.

94
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Bond at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner
or
by
a
person
legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of
this ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Bonds
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Bonds surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The

The City Record
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized: (i) the
Bonds may be issued in the form of
a single, fully registered Bond representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the beneficial
owners in book entry form shall
have no right to receive Bonds in
the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for
transfer to another Depository or to
another nominee of a Depository,
without further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Bonds from the Depository,
and the Trustee and Registrar shall
authenticate and deliver bond certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking
Fund and, if not purchased by such
Trustees, shall be offered to the
Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased by
such Account, shall be sold to NatCity Investments, Inc., SBK-Brooks
Investment Corp., as co-senior managers, and Lehman Brothers, as comanager, (collectively, the “Original
Purchaser”); provided, however, that
if, in the reasonable opinion of the
Director of Finance, an underwriter
is incapable of fully performing its
duties or meeting its obligations in
its capacity as Original Purchaser
with respect to the Bonds, the Direc-

1562

June 28, 2000
tor of Finance is hereby authorized
and directed, in the name of and on
behalf of the City, to take whatever actions may be necessary to terminate that underwriter’s standing
as Original Purchaser.
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Bonds as set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement, including: the
principal amount of the Bonds, final
purchase price (which shall be not
less than 97% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate
or rates, the amounts and years in
which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements),
the
Interest Payment Dates and the
date of the Bonds (if different from
those set forth in Section 2) and any
other matters required in this Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. If it is determined advisable by the Director of Finance for
the sale of the Bonds, the Director
of Finance is authorized to sign
agreements with a municipal bond
insurer issuing a policy of municipal bond insurance for the Bonds
that are not materially inconsistent
with this Ordinance. The Mayor,
Director of Finance, Director of
Law and other appropriate officers
of the City are, and each of them
is, authorized and directed to take
such actions
as
are
necessary,
appropriate and in the best interest
of the City to establish the terms
and requirements for delivery of the
Bonds and to make such arrangements as are necessary with the
Original
Purchaser
in
order to
establish the date, location, and
procedure, and conditions for the
delivery of the Bonds to the Original Purchaser, to give all appropriate notices and certificates, to cause
a true transcript of proceedings
with reference to the issuance of
the Bonds to be delivered to the
Original Purchaser, to sign any
transcript
certificates,
financial
statements and other documents
and instruments and to take such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Mayor and the Director
of Finance are, and each of them is,
hereby
further
authorized
and
directed to execute and deliver on
behalf of the City a bond purchase
agreement
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, between the City and the Original Purchaser setting forth the
terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell and the Original
Purchaser agrees to buy the Bonds,
provided that such agreement shall
not provide for or require the terms
of the Bonds to be inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Bond Purchase
Agreement is approved substantially in the form now on file with the
Clerk of Council in the File referenced in Section 3, together with
any changes or amendments that
are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and not substantially adverse

June 28, 2000
to the City and that are approved
by the Director of Finance on
behalf of the City, all of which shall
be conclusively evidenced by the
signing
of
the
Bond
Purchase
Agreement or amendments to the
Bond Purchase Agreement. It is
hereby determined that the terms of
the Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance and as may be provided in or
pursuant
to
the
Certificate
of
Award, are in the best interest of
the City and in compliance with all
legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an
Official Statement is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
original issuance of the Bonds, those
officers in their official capacities
are authorized to prepare or cause
to be prepared on behalf of the City
an Official Statement and any necessary supplements thereto, and on
behalf of the City to use and distribute, or authorize the use and distribution of, that Official Statement
and any supplements thereto in connection with the original issuance of
the Bonds, and each of those officers is authorized to sign on behalf
of the City and in his or her official
capacity, that Official Statement and
any supplements thereto approved
by such officer. Those officers are
and each of them is authorized to
sign and deliver, on behalf of the
City and in their official capacities,
such certificates in connection with
the accuracy of the Official Statement and any supplements thereto
as may, in their judgment, be necessary or appropriate. Such officers
are also hereby authorized to determine and certify on behalf of the
City that such disclosure document
is “deemed final” by the City within the meaning of Securities and
Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12
(the “SEC Rule”).
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under, the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
and directed to prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Bonds in accordance
with the SEC Rule. The performance
of that Agreement shall be subject
to the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making

agreement or providing notice of the
occurrence of any other events, the
Director of Finance shall consult
with, as appropriate, the legal counsel and bond or other qualified independent special counsel to the City.
The Director of Finance, acting in
the name and on behalf of the City,
shall be entitled to rely upon any
legal advice provided by any such
counsel in determining whether a
filing should be made.
Pursuant
to
Section

Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds
with other bonds into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of their sale as a single issue to
be designated “Various Purpose General Obligation Bonds, Series 2000”.

Bonds are issued and shall state
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying

of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds

discharge of the Bonds at maturity,
there shall be and is hereby levied
on all the taxable property in the
City, in addition to all other taxes,
a direct tax annually during the
period the Bonds are outstanding, in
an amount sufficient to provide for
the payment of that interest, when
and as the same shall fall due, and
also to discharge the principal of
the Bonds at maturity, which tax
shall not be less than the interest
and sinking fund tax required by
Section 11 of Article XII of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of those years are certified, extended and collected. The
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from the tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund as provided pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on
the Bonds when and as the same
fall due; provided, however, that,
subject to the provisions of Section

each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the
Bonds and are appropriated for such
purpose, the amount of such tax
shall be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25 and 5705.51 of the
Revised Code, and in accordance
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the
General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal

1563

income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt
charges for the Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended and applied for the objects
and purposes for which the Bonds
are issued upon City Council authorization. Accrued interest and any
premium received from the sale of
the Bonds shall be deposited in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund to be
applied to the payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Bonds are secured by a pledge and

and the General Bond Ordinance and
the other covenants, terms and
agreements provided hereunder and
in the General Bond Ordinance to
secure payment of the principal of
and interest on the Bonds, the City
hereby determines, declares, warrants and covenants that the Bonds

the State of Ohio, this Ordinance and
the General Bond Ordinance.

all other sums payable hereunder,
then and in that event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of further
effect, and the covenants, agreements and other obligations of the
City under this Ordinance shall be

request of the City execute and

in special accounts or sub-accounts,
in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations
of the United States certified by, an

Escrow Agent in accordance with
the provisions of this Section shall
be invested by the Escrow Agent in
direct obligations of the United

charges on the Bonds, as directed by
the Director of Finance. Any income
or interest earned by, or increment
to, the investments held under this

following
their
date
of
issuance, interest on the Notes shall

Firstar Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent, registrar, transfer agent and paying
agent for the Notes (the “Note Registrar”); provided that the Escrow
Agent also shall act as paying
agent for the Notes so long as the
Notes are held in a book entry system. The Director of Finance shall
sign and deliver, in the name and
on behalf of the City, an agreement
among the City, the Note Registrar
and the Escrow Agent (the “Note
Registrar Agreement”) providing for
services relating to the registration,
transfer, exchange and payment of
Notes. The Director of Finance shall
provide for the payment of the services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant
to the Note Registrar Agreement
from the proceeds of the Notes to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose.
So long as any of the Notes
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Note Registrar to maintain and keep at its principal corporate trust office all books and
records necessary for the registration, exchange and transfer of Notes
as provided in this Section (the
“Note Register”). Subject to the provisions of Section 5, the person in
whose name a Note is registered on
the Note Register shall be regarded
as the absolute owner of that Note
for all purposes of this ordinance.
Payment of or on account of the
debt charges on any Note shall be
made only to or upon the order of
that person; neither the City nor the
Note Registrar shall be affected by
any notice to the contrary, but the
registration may be changed as provided in this Section. All such payments shall be valid and effectual
to satisfy and discharge the City’s
liability upon the Note, including
interest, to the extent of the amount
or amounts so paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for
Notes of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Note Registrar, together with a request for exchange
signed by the registered owner or
by a person legally empowered to do
so in a form satisfactory to the Note
Registrar. A Note may be transferred only on the Note Register
upon presentation and surrender of
the Note at the principal corporate
trust officer of the Note Registrar
together with an assignment signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Note Registrar. Upon exchange or transfer
the Note Registrar shall complete,
authenticate and deliver a new Note

1564

by the owner equal in the aggregate
to the unmatured principal amount
of the Note surrendered and bearing
interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Note Registrar shall undertake the exchange
or transfer of Notes only after the
new Notes are signed by the authorized officers of the City. In all
cases of Notes exchanged or transferred, the City shall sign and the
Note Registrar shall authenticate
and deliver Notes in accordance
with the provisions of this Ordinance. The exchange or transfer
shall be without charge to the
owner, except that the City and Note
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Note Registrar may require
that those charges, if any, be paid
before the procedure is begun for
the exchange or transfer. All Notes
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security ,and benefit under
this ordinance, as the Notes surrendered upon that exchange or transfer.

issuance thereunder of unvoted general obligations of the City and the
General Bond Ordinance was passed
in contemplation of this Ordinance
and other ordinances authorizing
the issuance of bonds in accordance
with the provisions thereof (the
“Series Bond Ordinances”); and
Whereas, the issuance of the
Bonds is necessary to provide funds
to pay the costs of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1, which are urgently needed
for the benefit of the City, and as a
result, this Ordinance constitutes an
emergency measure providing for
the immediate preservation of the
public peace, property, health and
safety, and for the usual daily operation of a municipal department;
now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary to issue the Bonds in an
aggregate principal amount not to
exceed Two Million Three Hundred
Ten Thousand Dollars ($2,310,000)

1566

June 28, 2000
for the purpose of providing funds
for public improvements of streets
and municipal properties and easements in residential neighborhoods
by
opening,
widening,
grading,
draining, curbing and paving designated
streets,
constructing
sidewalks, curbs and gutters and driveway approaches, installing storm
and sanitary sewers, water lines
and storm drainage facilities as necessary and installing street lighting
and signs, signals, markings and
other devices for traffic control
together with the provision of all
necessary and incidental appurtenances in all cases, acquiring real
estate and interests in real estate,
including easements necessary for
such purpose, together with the payment of all associated preliminary
costs and costs of site clearance,
and to pay capitalized interest and
all expenses incurred in connection
with the issuance of the Bonds.
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Sections
133.01 to 133.70, inclusive, and other
applicable provisions of the Revised
Code, the Charter of the City, the
General Bond Ordinance and this
Ordinance in the principal amount
and for the purpose stated in Section 1. The Bonds shall be designated
“Residential
Neighborhood
Improvement Bonds, Series 2000”.
The Bonds shall be issued in one lot
as fully registered Bonds in denominations of $5,000 or any integral
multiple thereof. The Bonds shall be
numbered as determined by the
Director of Finance.
The Bonds shall be dated as of
August 1, 2000, or such other date,
but in no event later than December
31, 2000, specified in the certificate
of award providing for the final
terms of the Bonds and the sale of
the bonds and signed by the Director of Finance in accordance with
this Ordinance (the “Certificate of
Award”). The Bonds shall bear
interest at the rate or rates per year
specified
in
the
Certificate
of
Award; provided that if all the
Bonds bear interest at the same rate
per year, then such rate shall not
exceed eight percent (8%) per year,
and if the Bonds bear interest at
more than one rate per year, then
the weighted average of such rates
(taking into account the principal
amount and maturity of each Bond
to which a rate applies) shall not
exceed eight percent (8%) per year.
Interest on the Bonds shall be
payable, until the principal amount
is paid, semi-annually on May 15
and November 15 of each year or on
the days specified in the Certificate
of Award as the dates on which
interest on the Bonds shall be
payable
(the
“Interest
Payment
Dates”), beginning November 15,
2000 or on such other Interest Payment Date specified in the Certificate of Award as the first Interest
Payment Date.
The
Bonds
shall
mature
on
November 15 in twenty (20) substantially equal annual installments,
beginning November 15, 2001, or
according to the schedule set forth
in the Certificate of Award, provided that (i) each principal payment
shall occur on an Interest Payment
Date, (ii) the first principal payment on the Bonds shall be no earlier than November 15, 2000 and no

June 28, 2000
later than August 1, 2002, (iii) the
final maturity date of the Bonds
shall be no later than twenty (20)
years from that date which is
twelve months prior to the first date
on which provision for payment of
principal is made, and (iv) the principal
amount
thereof
shall
be
payable in annual installments such
that the total principal and interest
payments on the Bonds in any fiscal year in which principal is
payable is not more than three times
the amount of those payments in
any other fiscal year.
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the
“Mandatory
Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption prior to stated maturity
as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys, to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent,
currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of
and interest on any Term Bonds
shall include amounts sufficient to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City
for any Term Bonds. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by

The City Record
the City for any Term Bonds which
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and canceled
by the Registrar, to the extent not
applied
theretofore
as
a
credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of
the principal amount thereof against
the then current Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement (and
corresponding mandatory redemption obligation). Any excess of that
amount
over
the
then
current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement shall be credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligations) in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(b)
Optional
Redemption.
The
Bonds may be subject to redemption
prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole on any
date, or in part on any Interest Payment Date, on the dates and for the
prices specified in the Certificate of
Award, or the Director of Finance
may determine that it is in the best
interests of the City for the Bonds
not to be callable prior to their stated maturity. In the event that the
Bonds are callable, the earliest date
for optional redemption shall be no
later than the tenth anniversary of
the first principal payment date and
the maximum redemption price shall
be no greater than 102% of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued
interest to the redemption date.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar, given upon the direction
of the Council of the City by passage of an ordinance. That notice
shall specify the redemption date
and the principal amount of each
maturity of Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar. In
the event that notice of redemption
shall have been given by the Registrar to the registered owners as
hereinafter provided, there shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, funds
which, in addition to any other moneys available therefor and held by
the Registrar, will be sufficient to
redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus interest accrued to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice
of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of

1567

99
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial
redemption of Bonds by lot when
Bonds
of
denominations
greater
than $5,000 are then outstanding,
each $5,000 unit of principal thereof shall be treated as though it
were a separate Bond of the denomination of $5,000. If it is determined
that one or more, but not all of the
$5,000 units of principal amount represented by a Bond are to be called
for redemption. then upon notice of
redemption of a $5,000 unit or units,
the registered owner of that Bond
shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar
(i)
for
payment
of
the
redemption price of the $5,000 unit
or
units
called
for
redemption
(including, without limitation, the
interest accrued to the date fixed
for redemption and any premium),
and
(ii)
for
issuance,
without
charge to the registered owner
thereof, of a new Bond or Bonds of
any
authorized denomination or
denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unmatured and unredeemed portion of,
and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or
portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity
of
the
proceedings
for
the
redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph hereof, the Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due, and payable
on the redemption date, and, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the
redemption
price,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date. If
money for the redemption of all of
the Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with interest
accrued thereon to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, so as to be available therefor on that date and, if
notice
of
redemption
has
been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
that money shall not be so available
on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposit-

100
ed in the mail as aforesaid, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held
by
the
Registrar
for
the
redemption of particular Bonds shall
be held in trust for the account of
the registered owners thereof and
shall be paid to them, respectively,
upon presentation and surrender of
those Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section
3) at the close of business on the
date provided in the Agreement
authorized in Section 3 (the “Record
Date”). Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond
Ordinance, so long as the Bonds are
held by a Depository in a book entry
system (as described in Section 3),
debt charges on the Bonds will be
payable in lawful money of the United States by wire transfer to the
Depository made by the Escrow
Agent on each Interest Payment
Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance is hereby adopted by reference, and, except for the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 of the General Bond Ordinance
(pertaining generally to the periods
during
which
the
City is
not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under
the General Bond Ordinance), which
are not included in this Ordinance
and will not apply to the Bonds, the
General Bond Ordinance is included
as a part of this Ordinance as fully
as if restated herein. Words and
terms not otherwise defined herein
shall have the same meaning as set
forth in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their faces
the purpose for which they are
issued and that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to
Section 4 of the General Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be authenticated by the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee.
The Bonds shall be signed by the
City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor and
by the City’s Director of Finance or
Acting Director of Finance; provided, however, that in accordance with
Section 9.96 of the Code and the foregoing requirement that each Bond
bear the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee,
either or both of the signatures of
the City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor or
of its Director of Finance or Acting
Director of Finance may be a fac-

The City Record
simile. The Bonds shall bear the
seal of the City, which seal may be
a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section
83 of the City’s Charter, the Director of Law or Acting Director of
Law shall prepare the Bonds and
shall endorse thereon his or her
approval of the form and correctness
thereof by his or her manual or facsimile signature.
Firstar Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent,
bond registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Bonds (the
“Registrar”);
provided
that
the
Escrow Agent shall also act as paying agent for the Bonds so long as
the Bonds are held in a book entry
system. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, the Registrar Agreement among the City,
the Registrar and the Escrow Agent
(the “Agreement”) in substantially
the form as is now on file with the
Clerk of Council in File No. 900-2000-A.
The Agreement is approved, together with any changes or amendments
that are not inconsistent with this
ordinance
and
not
substantially
adverse to the City and that are
approved by the Director of Finance
on behalf of the City, all of which
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Agreement or
amendments to the Agreement. The
Director of Finance shall provide for
the payment of the services rendered
and for reimbursement of expenses
incurred pursuant to the Agreement
from the proceeds of the Bonds to the
extent available and then from other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for that
purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided
in this Section (the “Bond Register’). Subject to the provisions of
Section 5, the person in whose name
a Bond is registered on the Bond
Register shall be regarded as the
absolute owner of that Bond for all
purposes of this ordinance. Payment
of or on account of the debt charges
on any Bond shall be made only to
or upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender
at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together with
a request for exchange signed by
the registered owner or by a person
legally empowered to do so in a
form satisfactory to the Registrar. A
Bond may be transferred only on the
Bond Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Bond at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an assignment signed by the registered
owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in a form satisfactory
to the Registrar. Upon exchange or
transfer the Registrar shall complete, authenticate and deliver a new
Bond or Bonds of any authorized
denomination or denominations re-

1568

June 28, 2000
quested by the owner equal in the
aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond surrendered
and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the
new Bonds are signed by the authorized officers of the City. In all
cases of Bonds exchanged or transferred, the City shall sign and the
Registrar shall authenticate and
deliver Bonds in accordance with
the provisions of this ordinance.
The exchange or transfer shall be
without charge to the owner, except
that the City and Registrar may
make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any tax or other governmental charge required to be
paid with respect to the exchange
or transfer. The City or the Registrar may require that those charges,
if any, be paid before the procedure
is begun for the exchange or transfer. All Bonds issued and authenticated upon any exchange or transfer shall be valid obligations of the
City, evidencing the same debt, and
entitled to the same security and
benefit under this ordinance, as the
Bonds surrendered upon that exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and
the principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii)
physical Bond certificates in fully
registered form are issued by the
City only to a Depository or its
nominee as registered owner, with
the Bonds “immobilized” in the custody of the Depository. The book
entry maintained by others than
the City is the record that identifies the owners of beneficial interests in those Bonds and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a
book entry system is utilized: (i)
the Bonds may be issued in the
form of a single, fully registered
Bond representing each maturity
and registered in the name of the
Depository or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the
custody of the Depository; (ii) the
beneficial owners in book entry
form shall have no right to receive
Bonds in the form of physical secu-

June 28, 2000
rities or certificates; (iii) ownership
of beneficial interests in book entry
form shall be shown by book entry
on the system maintained and operated by the Depository and its Participants, and transfers of the ownership of beneficial interests shall
be made only by book entry by the
Depository and its Participants; and
(iv) the Bonds as such shall not be
transferable or exchangeable, except for transfer to another Depository or to another nominee of a
Depository, without further action
by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Bonds from the Depository,
and the Trustee and Registrar shall
authenticate and deliver bond certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking
Fund and, if not purchased by such
Trustees, shall be offered to the
Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased by
such Account, shall be sold to NatCity Investments, Inc., SBK-Brooks
Investment Corp., as co-senior managers, and Lehman Brothers, as comanager, (collectively, the “Original
Purchaser”); provided, however, that
if, in the reasonable opinion of the
Director of Finance, an underwriter
is incapable of fully performing its
duties or meeting its obligations in
its capacity as Original Purchaser
with respect to the Bonds, the Director of Finance is hereby authorized
and directed, in the name of and on
behalf of the City, to take whatever actions may be necessary to terminate that underwriter’s standing
as Original Purchaser.
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Bonds as set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement, including: the
principal amount of the Bonds, final
purchase price (which shall be not
less than 97% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate
or rates, the amounts and years in

The City Record
which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements),
the
Interest Payment Dates and the
date of the Bonds (if different from
those set forth in Section 2) and any
other matters required in this Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. If it is determined advisable by the Director of Finance for
the sale of the Bonds, the Director
of Finance is authorized to sign
agreements with a municipal bond
insurer issuing a policy of municipal bond insurance for the Bonds
that are not materially inconsistent
with this Ordinance. The Mayor,
Director of Finance, Director of
Law and other appropriate officers
of the City are, and each of them
is, authorized and directed to take
such actions
as
are
necessary,
appropriate and in the best interest
of the City to establish the terms
and requirements for delivery of the
Bonds and to make such arrangements as are necessary with the
Original
Purchaser
in
order
to
establish the date, location, and procedure, and conditions for the delivery of the Bonds to the Original
Purchaser, to give all appropriate
notices and certificates, to cause a
true transcript of proceedings with
reference to the issuance of the
Bonds to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Mayor and the Director
of Finance are, and each of them is,
hereby
further
authorized
and
directed to execute and deliver on
behalf of the City a bond purchase
agreement
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, between the City and the Original Purchaser setting forth the
terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell and the Original
Purchaser agrees to buy the Bonds,
provided that such agreement shall
not provide for or require the terms
of the Bonds to be inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Bond Purchase
Agreement is approved substantially in the form now on file with the
Clerk of Council in the File referenced in Section 3, together with
any changes or amendments that
are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and not substantially adverse
to the City and that are approved
by the Director of Finance on
behalf of the City, all of which shall
be conclusively evidenced by the
signing
of
the
Bond
Purchase
Agreement or amendments to the
Bond Purchase Agreement. It is
hereby determined that the terms of
the Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance and as may be provided in or
pursuant
to
the
Certificate
of
Award, are in the best interest of
the City and in compliance with all
legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an
Official Statement is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
original issuance of the Bonds,
those
officers
in
their
official

1569

101
capacities are authorized to prepare
or cause to be prepared on behalf
of the City an Official Statement
and
any
necessary
supplements
thereto, and on behalf of the City
to use and distribute, or authorize
the use and distribution of, that
Official Statement and any supplements thereto in connection with
the original issuance of the Bonds,
and each of those officers is authorized to sign on behalf of the City
and in his or her official capacity,
that Official Statement and any
supplements thereto approved by
such officer. Those officers are and
each of them is authorized to sign
and deliver, on behalf of the City
and in their official capacities, such
certificates in connection with the
accuracy of the Official Statement
and any supplements thereto as
may, in their judgment, be necessary or appropriate. Such officers
are also hereby authorized to determine and certify on behalf of the
City that such disclosure document
is “deemed final” by the City within the meaning of Securities and
Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12
(the “SEC Rule”).
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under, the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
and directed to prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Bonds in accordance
with the SEC Rule. The performance
of that Agreement shall be subject
to the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further authorized and directed to
establish procedures in order to
ensure compliance by the City with
its
continuing
disclosure
agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices.
Prior to making any filing in accordance with that agreement or providing notice of the occurrence of
any other events, the Director of
Finance
shall
consult
with,
as
appropriate, the legal counsel and
bond or other qualified independent
special counsel to the City. The
Director of Finance, acting in the
name and on behalf of the City,
shall be entitled to rely upon any
legal advice provided by any such
counsel in determining whether a
filing should be made.
Pursuant
to
Section
133.30(B),

(hereinafter defined); and shall be

the financial advisor of the City.
Interest shall be payable semi-annually on the dates set forth in the

June 28, 2000
month

their
date
of

be payable at maturity.
Firstar Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent, registrar, transfer agent and paying
agent for the Notes (the “Note Registrar”); provided that the Escrow
Agent also shall act as paying
agent for the Notes so long as the
Notes are held in a book entry system. The Director of Finance shall
sign and deliver, in the name and
on behalf of the City, an agreement
among the City, the Note Registrar
and the Escrow Agent (the “Note
Registrar Agreement”) providing for
services relating to the registration,
transfer, exchange and payment of
Notes. The Director of Finance shall
provide for the payment of the services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant
to the Note Registrar Agreement
from the proceeds of the Notes to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose.
So long as any of the Notes
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Note Registrar to maintain and keep at its principal corporate trust office all books and
records necessary for the registration, exchange and transfer of Notes
as provided in this Section (the
“Note Register”). Subject to the provisions of Section 5, the person in
whose name a Note is registered on
the Note Register shall be regarded
as the absolute owner of that Note
for all purposes of this ordinance.
Payment of or on account of the
debt charges on any Note shall be
made only to or upon the order of
that person; neither the City nor the
Note Registrar shall be affected by
any notice to the contrary, but the
registration may be changed as provided in this Section. All such payments shall be valid and effectual
to satisfy and discharge the City’s
liability upon the Note, including
interest, to the extent of the amount
or amounts so paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for
Notes of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Note Registrar, together with a request for exchange
signed by the registered owner or
by a person legally empowered to do
so in a form satisfactory to the Note
Registrar. A Note may be transferred only on the Note Register
upon presentation and surrender of
the Note at the principal corporate
trust officer of the Note Registrar
together with an assignment signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Note Registrar. Upon exchange or transfer
the Note Registrar shall complete,
authenticate and deliver a new Note
or Notes of any authorized denomination or denominations requested
by the owner equal in the aggregate
to the unmatured principal amount
of the Note surrendered and bearing
interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Note Registrar shall undertake the exchange
or transfer of Notes only after the
new Notes are signed by the authorized officers of the City. In all
cases of Notes exchanged or transferred, the City shall sign and the

The City Record
Note Registrar shall authenticate
and deliver Notes in accordance
with the provisions of this Ordinance. The exchange or transfer
shall be without charge to the
owner, except that the City and Note
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Note Registrar may require
that those charges, if any, be paid
before the procedure is begun for
the exchange or transfer. All Notes
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security ,and benefit under
this ordinance, as the Notes surrendered upon that exchange or transfer.
