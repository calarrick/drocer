Opportunity
Center
and urging the Director and Board
of the Council for Economic Opportunities
of
Greater

planning process to formulate a

Whereas, the Tremont Neighborhood Opportunity Center serves hundreds of people a month in its capacity as a social services center; and

Whereas, the Tremont Neighborhood Opportunity Center is a strong

schools to encourage neighborhood

and
Whereas, while Tremont is a
neighborhood
that
has
recently
experienced tremendous growth and
revitalization, residents and community leaders must be mindful that
advances may be stifled with the
onset of welfare reform; as such, the
role
of
organizations
like
the

Center become more vital to stability of the neighborhood; and

such as the Tremont Neighborhood

they serve; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland supports the initiatives of the Tremont Neighborhood Opportunity Center and urges

Neighborhood Development Association has requested that all records,

the permits be made available permanently and locally for review by
the community within a reasonable
time frame and that the documents

Res. No. 339-2000.
By Councilmen Cimperman, Rybka,
Brady, Britt, Cintron, Coats, Dolan,
Gordon, Jackson, Johnson, Jones,
Lewis, Melena, O’Malley, Patmon,
Polensek, Robinson, Sweeney, Westbrook, White and Willis.
An emergency resolution opposing
the decision to close St. Michael Hospital and urging the federal government to conduct an investigation
into the recent rash of hospital closures in Cleveland; and urging that
the City join a lawsuit compelling
that St. Michael remain open.
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland is deeply concerned
about the recent announcement concerning the closing of St. Michael
Hospital, located in the heart of the
City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, this announced closure
comes on the heels of the closure of
Mt. Sinai Hospital and the announcement by MetroHealth Medical
Center that it intends to terminate
its agreements with Medicaid HMO
providers, negatively impacting over
30,000 residents of the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, the impact of the closure
of St. Michael’s is devasting to the
north and south Broadway communities, to the southeast region of our
City, as well as to the entire City of
Cleveland and Cuyahoga County;
and
Whereas, this Council is especially disturbed that, at a time in which
our national and local economies are
booming, and at a time when there
is over $493 million dollars in new
hospital construction underway in
the Greater Cleveland area, and at
a time when institutions such as the
Cleveland Clinic are opening new
facilities in Florida, that our own
health community deems it appropriate to discontinue health care to
Cleveland residents; and
Whereas, with the closure of St.
Michael’s, over 400 jobs will be lost,
over 200 beds will become unavailable to serve the needs of our city,
and another emergency room will
shut its doors to the residents of the
inner city; and
Whereas, this Council finds it
especially troubling that our own
Cleveland Clinic, which at any time
provides care to foreign royalty and
various heads of state and other
high paying patients from abroad,
has deemed community health care
in Cleveland to be of little or no
value; and
Whereas, this Council is greatly
concerned about the quality and
accessibility of health care available to serve the needs of the residents of the City of Cleveland; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland strongly opposes
the decision to close St. Michael Hospital and urges that such decision
be reconsidered for the benefit of
the residents of the City and Greater
Cleveland community.
Section 2. That this Council urges
President Clinton, Attorney General
Janet Reno and Secretary of Health
and Human Services Donna Shalala
to conduct an investigation in to the
closures of hospitals in Cleveland.
Section 3. That this Council wishes to acknowlege the efforts of Congressman Dennis Kucinich for his
assistance and attention to this matter and to thank him for working

The City Record
for the benefit of the citizens of
Cleveland.
Section 4. That this Council will
hold a public hearing on the issue
of hospital closures and the detrimental impact on the health care of
the residents of the City at 9:30 a.m.
on Friday, March 10, 2000.
Section 5. That this Council urges
that the City join in the proposed
lawsuit and/or injunction to keep
St. Michael Hospital open.
Section 6. That the Cleveland Clinic and PHS work together with our
residents,
Cleveland’s
community
development organizations, the St.
Michael Community Board, and the
Council of the City of Cleveland to
provide a proper standard of health
care that is accessible to all residents in the City of Cleveland.
Section 7. That the Clerk is hereby requested to transmit a copy of
this resolution to President Clinton,
Attorney General Janet Reno and
Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala, Congressman
Dennis Kucinich and the President
of the Cleveland Clinic and PHS.
Section 8. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 291-2000.
By Councilman Cimperman.
An emergency resolution calling
for a moratorium on executions in
the State of Ohio, and throughout
the United States, until certain enumerated actions are taken.
Whereas, approximately 90% of
people charged with capital crimes
cannot afford their own attorney;
and
Whereas, no state has met standards developed by the American
Bar Association for appointment,
performance and compensation of
counsel for indigent prisoners; and
Whereas, in 1987, in McCleskey v.
Kemp, the United States Supreme
Court refused to act on data demonstrating the continuing reality of
racial bias in capital cases; and
Whereas, in a series of rulings
since 1991, the U.S. Supreme Court
has drastically restricted the rights
of death row prisoners to appeal
their convictions and death sentences in federal courts, even in
cases where prisoners present compelling evidence of innocence; and
Whereas, the American Bar Association has concluded that administration of the death penalty is a
“haphazard maze of unfair practices
with no internal consistency” and
has called for a moratorium on executions; and
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland joins with the American Bar Association in calling for a
moratorium on executions in the
State of Ohio, and throughout the
United States, until certain enumerated actions are taken; now, therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland requests Governor
Taft, President Clinton and our representatives in Congress to enact
legislation imposing a moratorium
on executions in the State of Ohio,
and throughout the United States,
until policies and procedures are
implemented
to: 1) ensure that
death penalty cases are administered
fairly
and
impartially in
accordance with basic due process;
2) eliminate the risk that innocent
persons may be executed; and 3)
prevent the execution of mentally
disabled persons and people who
were under the age of 18 at the time
of their offenses.

20
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby requested to transmit a copy of
this resolution to President Clinton;
Governor Taft; Senators DeWine
and Voinovich; and Congressmembers Kucinich, Tubbs Jones, LaTourette and Brown.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted February 28, 2000.
Effective March 6, 2000.

Res. No. 292-2000.
By Councilman Cimperman.
An emergency resolution expressing the support of the Cleveland
City Council for the Artspace Projects, Inc. proposal for housing tax
credits for the Tower Press housing
development project.
Whereas, each year the Ohio
Housing Finance Agency allocates
housing credits to affordable housing developments throughout Ohio,
using a competitive proposal process; and
Whereas, the Artspace Project,
Inc. is preparing to develop 47 units
of
affordable
artist
housing,
live/work space for individuals and
families; and
Whereas, the project, to be located
on 1900 Superior Avenue, will be
comprised of a maximum of fortyseven (47) units located in the City
of Cleveland, including location in a
Qualified Census Tract (QCT); and
Whereas, 100% of the project’s
total units will be set aside for lowincome qualifying households who
make less than 60% of the Area
Median Gross Income (AMGI); and
Whereas, the project will utilize
Housing Tax Credits; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Cleveland City
Council extends its full support to
the
Artspace
Projects,
Inc.
to
develop and construct the Tower
Press project, an affordable housing
development in the City of Cleveland at 1900 Superior Avenue; and
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she is hereby authorized
and directed to forward two certified copies of this Resolution to Artspace Project, Inc. in the care of the
President, at 2351 East 22nd Street,
Cleveland, Ohio 44115 and that a
copy of this Resolution be spread
upon the minutes of this meeting;
and
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Res. No. 293-2000.
By Councilman Cimperman.
An emergency resolution requesting the Social Security Administration to change the envelope of
Social Security recipients to ensure
the security and privacy of those
recipients.
Whereas, many senior citizens
residing in the City of Cleveland
receive
Social
Security
benefits
from the federal government, benefits that these residents have paid
into for years from their income;
and
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland believes that senior citizens and others who have contributed to the Social Security system are entitled to their fair return;
and
Whereas,
this
Council
also
believes strongly in the right to privacy afforded to all American citizens, including the right to keep
confidential one’s own Social Security number; and
Whereas,
the
Social
Security
Administration recently changed the
envelope in which they mail checks
to Social Security recipients, expanding the address window, thus revealing the Social Security number of
the recipient; and
Whereas, the expanded window
presents security concerns for our
seniors
and
other
recipients
of
Social Security benefits; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland requests the Social
Security Administration to change
the envelope of Social Security recipients to ensure the security and privacy of those recipients.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby requested to transmit a copy of
this resolution to Senators DeWine
and Voinovich; and Congressmembers Kucinich, Tubbs Jones, LaTourette and Brown.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives

all members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force

An emergency resolution opposing
the decision of MetroHealth Medical
Center to terminate its agreement
with the Medicaid HMO providers
and urging the Commissioners of
Cuyahoga
County

Governor
Taft to review the matter.
Whereas,
MetroHealth

to
accept

by
patients
served by three Medicaid managedcare

namely
Emerald

and University Hospitals Health
System’s QualChoice Prime; and
Whereas, this decision by MetroHealth adversely impacts approximately 30,000 residents of Cuyahoga
County; and
Whereas, MetroHealth’s intended
pullout from the Medicaid HMO program has a detrimental effect on
many of the City’s most needy citizens, particularly in light of the
recent closing of Mt. Sinai Medical
Center; and
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland is deeply concerned
about the welfare and health of the
residents of Cleveland and opposes
the decision of MetroHealth to terminate its agreement with the Medicaid HMO providers; and

the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of
the City of Cleveland opposes the
decision of MetroHealth Medical
Center to terminate its agreement
with the Medicaid HMO providers

shall be governed by the following regulations:
(a) Permitted Repair and Alterations. A nonconforming sign may be painted, cleaned or repaired as required
in Section 350.18 but shall not be otherwise altered, moved or replaced unless made to conform to current regulations. Such sign, however, may be altered to permit a change of message or change of face if such change does
not structurally alter the sign casing or support.

work is begun within six (6) months of the incident and is completed within twelve (12) months of the
incident.

this Code if the use to which the sign refers has been discontinued for a continuous and immediately preceding period of at least six (6) months, except as provided in division (f) of this section. In the case of a
nonconforming billboard, as defined in this chapter, such sign shall be removed or made to conform to regulations of this Code if, for a continuous and immediately preceding period of at least twelve (12) months, the

entrance providing access to the uses in question. In addition, for each such use, window signs not exceeding
twenty (20) square feet in total area shall be permitted for display on the inside surface of windows within the
subject space.

(1) Secondary Frontages. A building or building unit with frontage on a second street or with a customer building entrance from a rear or side parking lot shall be permitted total additional wall, window, projecting and
canopy sign area not to exceed 50% of the sign area otherwise permitted. Such signs shall be displayed so that
the total sign area placed on any facade does not exceed the maximum sign area permitted for the building’s
primary frontage. This provision shall also apply to buildings or building units with secondary frontage along
the Cuyahoga River or Lake Erie and to buildings adjoining a freeway right-of-way.
(2) Secondary Entrances. For lots served by more than one (1) vehicular entrance, one (1) additional freestanding identification sign shall be permitted at each additional vehicular entrance if the minimum distance
between any two (2) such signs is five hundred (500) feet as measured along street lines. Where such distance
is less than five hundred (500) feet but more than three hundred (300) feet, a second free-standing identification
sign shall be permitted if the height of each such sign is no greater than twelve (12) feet and the combined
sign area of the two signs is no greater than one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the maximum sign area permitted for a single free-standing identification sign on the subject property.
(c) New Businesses. Upon its initial opening, a new business establishment may display a temporary identification sign for a maximum period of sixty-two (62) days prior to installation of a permanent identification sign.
Such temporary sign may be a wall, window or portable sign which shall conform with all regulations applicable to permanent signs (except clearly inapplicable structural requirements) and shall be counted as part of the
maximum permitted permanent sign area. In addition, temporary window signs for such new businesses may
cover up to 75% of window area. Strings of pennants, streamers, pinwheels, balloons and similar small lightweight objects shall be permitted for “grand openings” for a single period not exceeding seven (7) days within
the first six (6) months after issuance of the initial Occupancy Certificate for a new business.
(d) Open Lots. For uses without buildings, and for uses on lots where building frontage is less than 20% of
lot frontage, maximum sign face area for the use, including free-standing signs, shall be the greater of fifty (50)
square feet or the figure resulting from the following formula where “LW” equals the width of the lot frontage,
as defined in division (a)(2) of Section 350.05: LW x 1.0 = SQUARE FEET OF SIGNAGE. The area of a freestanding sign shall in no instance exceed one hundred (100) square feet.
(e) Major Public Assembly Facilities. For public assembly facilities located within the Central Business District and providing a minimum seating or attendance capacity of 5,000 persons, signage shall be permitted in
accordance with the following standards contained in this division (e) which recognize the unique nature of these
large-scale public assembly facilities. Except as provided in these standards, all other regulations of this Zoning
Code shall apply to such signage.
(1) Type, Number, Height and Location of Signs. The City Planning Commission may authorize variations in
otherwise applicable regulations of this chapter to the extent necessary to provide adequate information to the public.
