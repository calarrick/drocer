By Councilmen Cimperman and

An emergency resolution endorsing the Corridor Management Plan
for the Ohio & Erie National Heritage Corridor, and recognizing the
significance of preserving, enhancing and promoting the resources

Whereas, in 1996, Congress enacted the Ohio & Erie National Heritage Corridor Act establishing a

Canal,
running
from
Cleveland,
Ohio to Dover/New Philadelphia,
Ohio; and
Whereas, that legislation recognizes the Ohio & Erie Canal Association as the management entity for
the Heritage Corridor and further

Whereas, the Ohio & Erie Canal
Association has prepared a Corridor
Management Plan, with the assistance of widespread public improvement; and
Whereas, the Ohio & Erie Canal
National Heritage Corridor Committee and the regional and federal offices of the National Park Service have reviewed and approved
the Corridor Management Plan;
and
Whereas, the Corridor Management Plan has been submitted to the
U.S. Secretary of the Interior for
approval; and
Whereas, the Corridor Management Plan provides the framework
for development of the Ohio & Erie
Canal Heritage Corridor and does
the following:
1. establishes the boundary for the

course of the historic Ohio & Erie
Canal and Cuyahoga Valley Line

2. supports regional environmental
and water quality goals by promoting resource stewardship practices,
including the protection, preservation, enhancement and management
of natural, cultural, and historic
resources within the corridor for
future generations; and
3. promotes a network of alternative means of transportation, including a series of trails that connect to
the Towpath Trail, the Cuyahoga
Valley Scenic Railroad, and the
Canal Way Ohio National Scenic
Byway; and
4. facilitates public-private partnerships for fulfilling the goals outlined in the Corridor Management
Plan; and
5. provides no additional regulations for land use and/or zoning;
and
6. adds to the quality of life of
Northeast Ohio through support of
educational,
cultural,
community
and
economic
development
programs; and
Whereas, the National Heritage
Corridor Act specifies that, “No privately owned property shall be
included in the corridor unless the
municipality in which the property
is located agrees to be so included
and submits notification to the Secretary of the Interior;” and
Whereas, the Ohio & Erie Canal
Association is authorized to request
and receive up to $10 million on projects and programs within the Corridor boundary that meet the purposes of the Heritage Corridor Act
and the Corridor Management Plan;
and
Whereas, the Management Plan
has received recommendations from
NOACA, the Cleveland Metroparks,
Greater Cleveland Growth Association and numerous other organizations and political subdivisions;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health and safety
since preservation of the waterway
is in the best interest of our citizens; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland endorses the Corridor Management Plan for the Ohio
& Erie National Heritage Corridor,
and recognizes the significance of
preserving, enhancing and promoting the resources along the Corridor.
