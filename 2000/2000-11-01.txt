FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES REFERRED
Ord. No. 1957-2000.
By Councilmen Polensek and Patmon.
An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting
new Chapter 154 relating to creation
of the City Audit Commission.
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland concurs with the following statement of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board
(GASB) concerning the objective of
financial reporting: “Accountability
requires government to answer to
the citizenry, to justify the raising
of public resources and the purposes for which they are used. Governmental accountability is based on
the belief that the citizenry has a
‘right to know’, a right to receive
openly disclosed facts that may lead
to public debate by the citizens and
their elected representatives. Financial reporting plays a major role in
fulfilling government’s duty to be
publicly accountable in a democratic society;” and
Whereas, the Government Finance
Officers Association encourages the
government’s use of audit committees to ensure the integrity of the
audit process and to increase the

2690

November 1, 2000
level of confidence in the financial
reporting process; and
Whereas, the Auditor of the State
of Ohio recommends audit committees for all government subdivisions
in the State; and
Whereas, by letter dated September 27, 2000 to Mayor Michael R.
White
and
Council
President
Michael D. Polensek, the State Auditor recommended the formation of
an audit committee in the City of
Cleveland comprised of members of
Cleveland City Council and the
Administration with the purpose of
such committee to become the focal
point between the City and its auditors; and
Whereas, in adhering to the recommendation of the State Auditor
and in order to monitor the effectiveness and efficiency of operations; to monitor the reliability of
financial reporting; and to ensure
compliance with applicable laws
and regulations, the Council of the
City of Cleveland seeks to form the
City Audit Commission; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department to ensure
the fiscal responsibility of the City
of Cleveland; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
hereby supplemented by enacting
new Chapter 154, to read as follows:
Chapter 154
CITY AUDIT COMMISSION
Section 154.01 Establishment and
Members
Section 154.02 Declaration of Purpose
Section 154.03 Duties of Commission
Section 154.04 Meetings and Attendance
Section 154.01 Establishment and
Members
There is hereby established a City
Audit
Commission
composed
of
seven members consisting of the
Mayor, or the Director of Finance as
his designee; the President of Council, or the Chairman of the Finance
Committee as his designee; the
Director
of
Law;
one
member
appointed by the Mayor; and two
members appointed by the President
of Council. The final member, who
shall serve as Chair of the City
Audit Commission, shall be chosen
jointly by the Mayor and Council
President, shall have at least ten
years experience in auditing or
financial accounting, and shall have
no financial or contractual interest
with the City of Cleveland. The
appointed members’ terms shall be
two years and the term of the Chair
shall be three years. The Director of
Law shall designate one of his assistants to serve as Secretary of the
City Audit Commission. Members of
the City Audit Commission shall
serve without compensation.
Section 154.02 Declaration of Purpose
The City Audit Commission is to
serve as the focal point for communication between the legislative and
executive branches of the City of
Cleveland, the independent auditor
retained by the City, the Department

November 1, 2000
of Finance, and the Division of
Internal Auditing as their duties
relate
to
financial
accounting,
reporting,
internal
controls,
and
compliance with applicable laws
and regulations. The City Audit
Commission is to assist the staff
and employees of the City in fulfilling its responsibilities as to
accounting policies and reporting
practices of the City of Cleveland
and sufficiency of auditing relative
thereto. The City Audit Commission
shall be the principal agent in
ensuring the independence of independent auditors, the integrity of
management and the adequacy of
disclosures to the public. The City
Audit Commission shall make recommendations to the Director of
Finance relative to his selection of
an independent auditor for the City
pursuant to Section 127.41 of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976.
Section 154.03 Duties of Commission
(a) The City Audit Commission
shall:

regulations and financial reporting.
(2) Have familiarity, through the
individual efforts of its members,
with the accounting and reporting
principles and practices applied by
the City in preparing its financial

Commission is to make, or cause to

the City and the independent auditor concerning established standards
of conduct and performance and
deviations therefrom.
(3) Review, prior to the start of
the annual audit, the scope and general extent of the independent auditor’s planned examination, including
its engagement letter. The auditor’s
fees shall be summarized by the
Director of Finance for review by
the City Audit Commission. The
Commission’s review should entail
an understanding from the independent auditor of the factors considered by the auditor in determining
the audit scope, including:
(a) risk characteristics of the City
of Cleveland; and
(b) external reporting requirements; and
(c) quality of internal accounting,
administrative and compliance controls; and
(d) extent of internal auditor’s involvement with the audit examination; and
(e) other areas to be covered during the audit engagement.
(4) Review the extent of non-audit
services planned to be provided by
the independent auditor in relation
to the objectivity and independence
needed in the audit.
(5) Review with the City staff
and the independent auditor, upon
completion of its audit, financial
results and findings prior to their
finalization and dissemination to
the public.
(b) The City Audit Commission is
to review the City’s comprehensive
annual financial report, including
the financial statements and footnote disclosures and supplemental

The City Record

accepted accounting principles, with
respect to the following:
(1) Significant transactions not a
normal part of the City’s operations;
and
(2) Selection of and changes, if
any, during the year in the City’s
accounting principles or their application; and
(3) Significant adjustments proposed by the independent auditor;
and
