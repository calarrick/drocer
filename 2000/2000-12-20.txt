VETO
File No. 2221-2000-A.
December 13, 2000
The Honorable Michael Polensek
Council President
Cleveland City Council
601 Lakeside Avenue
Cleveland, Ohio 44114
Dear Council President Polensek:
I am returning enclosed Ordinance No. 2221-2000 with my objections. This ordinance is entitled “An
emergency ordinance to change the
name of a portion of Superior Avenue to ‘Plain Dealer Plaza.’ ” The
reasons for my veto are set forth
below.
• Section 76-3 of the Cleveland
City Charter establishes a mandatory referral to the Cleveland City
Planning Commission for ordinances
that concern, among other things,
the “use of any public improvement.”
My staff has advised me, and I concur that Ordinance No. 2221-2000 concerns the use of the public improvement of Superior Avenue. Consequently, the failure to achieve Planning Commission review prior to the
passage of Ordinance No. 2221-2000
constitutes a violation of the Cleveland City Charter.
• Ordinance No. 2221-2000 violates
Chapter 305 of the Codified Ordinances in at least two respects: (a)
thoroughfares cannot be classified
as “plazas;” and (b) the street numbering would conflict with the numbering for the rest of Superior Avenue.
• The renaming of a one-block
stretch of a major City arterial creates significant emergency response
risks. Ambulances and other emergency
response
vehicles
depend
upon immediate identification of the
site of an incident. The confusion
implicit in the renaming of a oneblock segment is a safety risk the
City and its residents should not
assume.
• The passage of Ordinance No.
2221-2000 would set a precedent that
would invite other significant community stakeholders to seek similar
treatment. The end result could be
a patchwork system of City streets
that is confusing to both residents
and visitors.
While I share with the City Council recognition and appreciation of
the
Plain
Dealer’s
significant
investment in the City, my public
responsibilities cannot allow me to
support passage of Ordinance No.
2221-2000.
However, if City Council chooses
to re-introduce Ordinance No. 22212000 in its present form as an introduction piece rather than a passage
piece, we stand ready to engage the

Council in a full discussion of all
relevant points. As you know, the
legally required, time-honored path
for an ordinance such as this
includes not only Council Committees but also a mandatory review
and vote by the City Planning Commission. At that Charter-required
Commission hearing, all impacted
property owners would have the
opportunity to express their views
prior to the Commission’s final
vote.
Finally, I regard this Plain Dealer affair as the latest example of a
disturbing trend at City Council
meetings.
Increasingly,
the
City
Council has chosen to insulate controversial items from public discussion and debate through the means
of passing ordinances on first reading as an emergency when clearly
no emergency exists. This closeddoor, back room dealing approach to
public issues is an affront to our
residents. I believe that the Plain
Dealer ordinance should have been
subjected to the same Council Committee scrutiny that is routinely
given to legislation submitted by my
Administration
instead
of
being
passed in the above described manner.
Thank you for your expected
attention to these matters.
Sincerely,
Michael P. White
Mayor
Received.

Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the title and Section 1 of Ordinance No. 213-2000,
passed June 12, 2000, are hereby
amended to read, respectively, as
follows:
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Port Control to

any provision of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, to
the contrary, the Director of Port
Control is hereby authorized to
enter into a Lease By Way of Concession with BTS/Aerzone Joint
Venture for the use and occupancy
of
approximately
one
thousand
(1,000) square feet of space in the
Airport Terminal Building and the
installation of Internet and DVD
kiosks
in
various
locations
throughout the terminal in connection with its operation of a business service center. The annual
rent shall be determined as follows: Lessee shall pay to the City
a minimum annual guaranteed concession fee of Twenty-Four Thousand One Dollars ($24,001); one
and one-half percent (1 1/2%) of
gross revenues realized by Lessee
on U.S. currency traded; ten percent (10%) of the gross premium
on the sale of travel related insurance and fifteen percent (15%) of
gross revenues realized by Lessee
from all other operations. The minimum annual guaranteed concession fee shall be subject to an
annual increase of four percent
(4%). The term shall commence on
the date of execution of the Agreement, and unless sooner terminated, shall expire five years thereafter.
Section 2. That the existing title
and Section 1 of Ordinance No. 2132000, passed June 12, 2000, are hereby repealed.
Section 3. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

(c) Any pay telephone located in
the right-of-way that is not permitted may be removed by the City
without prior notice at the owner’s
expense. The owner shall reimburse
the City for the cost of removing

this ordinance shall take precedence
over any applications made pursuant to any agreement with the
City for pay telephones in the right
of way submitted after the date of

of this ordinance, applications for
permits shall be given preference
for purposes of determining compliance with the distance requirements
in the order that they are received.

(2) The size of the telephone and
any booth stand, or pole accompanying the telephone;

or omission which is solely attributable to the City, and shall furnish,
at said owner’s expense, such general commercial liability insurance

Section 670B.07 Public Nuisance;
Removal of Outdoor Pay Telephones
(a) Upon request in writing by
the member of Council in whose
ward an outdoor pay telephone is
located in the right-of-way, or on private property, or upon receipt of verbal or written citizen complaints
concerning such an outdoor pay telephone, the Director of Public Safety
shall conduct an investigation into
whether the installation and maintenance of the outdoor pay telephone constitutes a public nuisance.
Upon determination by the Director
of Public Safety that a particular
outdoor pay telephone constitutes a
public nuisance, the Director shall
order that special telephone service
features as are acceptable to the
Director shall be provided by the
outdoor pay telephone or, if the
Director determines it is necessary,
that the telephone be removed. Nothing in this Section shall preclude the
Director from ordering the removal
of a telephone without first requiring the implementation of special
features. A particular outdoor pay
telephone shall constitute a public
nuisance when the Director of Public Safety determines that one or
more of the following conditions
exist:
(1) The outdoor pay telephone has
been used in the commission of illegal drug transactions or other criminal activity, or substantially contributes by its presence to the commission of illegal drug transactions
or other criminal activity as evidenced by significant numbers of
such crimes occurring in the vicinity of the telephone;
(2) The existence of the outdoor
pay telephone has substantially contributed by its presence to the congregation of persons who have made
loud noises and other disturbances
that have disrupted persons residing
near the telephone or disrupted business enterprises located near the
telephone;
(3) The existence of the outdoor
pay telephone has substantially contributed by its presence to the congregation
of
persons
consuming
alcoholic beverages, except where
such
consumption
is
expressly
authorized by a state license, or consuming illegal or controlled substances;

December 20, 2000
(4) The existence of the outdoor
pay telephone has substantially contributed by its presence to the congregation of persons who have interfered with pedestrian or vehicular
traffic in the public right-of-way
near the telephone;
(5) Usage of the outdoor pay telephone between the hours of 1:00 a.m.
and 5:00 a.m. is significantly and
repeatedly above normal usage for
similarly situated outdoor pay telephones during the same hours so as
to indicate that the telephone is
being used in the commission of illegal drug activity or other criminal
activity;
(6) The pay telephone has been
used to abuse the 911 system.
(b) The special features shall be
instituted,
or
the
owner
shall
remove the telephone, and restore
the right-of-way to its original condition, if applicable, within five (5)
business days of an order to institute special features or remove the
telephone. Any outdoor pay telephone which does not provide special features or is not removed, as
applicable, within five (5) business
days of such an order shall be subject to immediate removal by the
City at the owner’s expense and
shall constitute a default of the
owner’s contract or a violation of
the owner’s license and permit, as
applicable. The owner shall reimburse the City for the cost of removing and storing the telephone before
the telephone may be reclaimed by
the owner. Such costs shall also
include the cost of removing any
installation ancillary to the outdoor
pay telephone and the cost of restoring the public right-of-way to its
original condition.
(c) If the Director determines that
the nuisance may be abated by the
reduction in the total number of pay
telephones in an area, the removal
of pay telephones shall be ordered
based upon the total period of time
that a telephone has been permitted
by the City, with the telephones permitted for the least amount of time
being ordered removed first.
(d) The Director of Public Safety
will inform in writing the member
of Council who made the complaint
regarding the pay telephone the
result of such investigation and the
Director shall notify the member in
writing of any order issued by the
Director.
(e) If an outdoor pay telephone
has been removed from a location
because it is a nuisance, no other
pay telephone may be installed at
the same location or within 500 feet
of that location for a minimum of
one year.
(f) The owner of an outdoor pay
telephone may appeal from the
determination of a nuisance and the
order of special features or removal
issued pursuant to this section to
the Board of Zoning Appeals within five (5) business days after
receipt of the order. The order shall
be stayed during the pendency of
the appeal before the Board. The
Board shall commence to hear the
merits of an appeal within thirty
(30) days of the filing of an appeal.
The Board shall render a decision
within ten (10) days of the date of
the hearing, which decision may
affirm, disaffirm, or grant exception
from the order, requirement, decision or determination from which
the appeal has been taken. If the
Board affirms an order of the Direc-

The City Record
tor that a telephone constitutes a
nuisance, the owner shall have
three (3) business days to remove
the outdoor pay telephone in question; if the owner fails to correct
the violation within that time, the
outdoor
pay
telephone
may
be
removed by the Director at the
owner’s expense.
Section 670B.08 PUCO Regulations

By Councilman Jones.
An emergency resolution urging
Ohio Governor Robert Taft to oppose
and veto SB 179 as it pertains to
juvenile offenders.
Whereas, Senate Bill 179 if passed
will change the entire juvenile justice system, where the focus will no
longer be on rehabilitation, but
punitive measures for young offenders; and
Whereas, Senate Bill 179 will
cause permanent psychological and
emotional damage to young children
caught
in
a
deficient
and
ill
equipped penal system, thus impeding their rehabilitation; and
Whereas, Senate Bill 179 will
make children as young as ten
years old go to juvenile prison if
they
have
committed
a
serious
offense; and
Whereas, more African American
and Latino males will be affected by
Senate Bill 179 than any other group
if this legislation is passed; and
Whereas, Senate Bill 179 will
allow a child to be convicted on evidence that is “clear and convincing”

3146

December 20, 2000
rather than by the adult constitutional standard “beyond a reasonable doubt”; and
Whereas, Senate Bill 179 will
severely restrict the bind over discretion privilege of juvenile court
judges and give it to the county
prosecutors; and
Whereas, Senate Bill 179 is placing emphasis on punishing children by placing them in a penal
system that is already overcrowded and under funded, which will
not guarantee the safety and security of young offenders, exposing
them to rape, torture and even
murder; and
Whereas far too many children
are already entwined in the prison
system and often lose hope for living a productive and meaningful
life; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby reject Senate Bill 179, which is a
stinging
indictment
against
all
Ohio’s children and strongly urges
Governor Robert Taft to veto this
legislation.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby is directed to
transmit two certified copies of this
resolution to Ohio Governor Robert
Taft.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

reasonable
grounds to believe that a violation
of Section 665.03 has occurred, in

or reverse the dismissal. If the Fair

Housing Administrator for conciliation and other actions consistent
with this chapter.

why the investigation cannot be
completed within the time prescribed.

and the respondent agree otherwise
and the Fair Housing Board determines that disclosure is not required
to further the purposes of this chapter.

provide for binding arbitration of
the dispute arising from the complaint. Any such arbitration that
results from a conciliation agreement may award appropriate relief,
including monetary relief.

Section 665.16 Watch Area Designation
(a) Upon consideration of the factors listed in division (b) of Section
665.17, the Fair Housing Board may
designate, by a simple majority, any
area of the City as a “watch area”. A
watch area designation shall signify
that the area is sensitive to change
and that real estate brokers, agents,
salespersons or other persons who
are
licensed
or
required to be
licensed pursuant to Chapter 4735 of
the Revised Code are advised to solicit the area only with due caution.
Whenever an area of the City is designated as a watch area, the Fair
Housing Board shall monitor the situation and actively work towards
eliminating or reducing the factors
that caused the area to be designated as a watch area. In any area designated as a watch area, the Fair
Housing Board may seek a voluntary
real estate solicitation moratorium
for such length of time as appropriate, but only if such voluntary moratorium is warranted in the opinion of
the Fair Housing Board by the circumstances in a given watch area.
(b) At any time that an area is
not under a non-solicitation area
designation
pursuant
to
Section
665.17, the Fair Housing Board may
cancel a watch area designation if
it finds that the factors that caused
the area to be designated as a
watch area have been eliminated or
reduced and that the designation is
no longer warranted.
(c) Upon each designation or cancellation of a watch area, the Fair
Housing Board shall promptly notify the Mayor and the Council, in
writing, and publish a notice in the
City Record or newspaper of general circulation describing the boundaries of the area by reference to
streets, census tracts or common
landmarks. Each designation or cancellation shall take effect upon publication. The Fair Housing Board
shall maintain a list of designated
watch areas and make it available
to any person upon request.
Section 665.17 Non-solicitation
(a) No real estate broker, agent,
sales representative or other person
who is licensed or required to be
licensed pursuant to Chapter 4735 of
the Revised Code shall solicit the
owner or occupant of any housing
accommodation located within a

The City Record
non-solicitation area designed by the
Fair Housing Board.
(b) Any area that the Fair Housing Board has designated as a
watch area may be designated as a
non-solicitation area for an initial
period of up to forty-five (45) days
upon making written findings based
on substantial evidence introduced
at a public hearing that real estate
solicitation in the area is or is likely to cause or contribute to blockbusting or panic selling. A vote of
two-thirds (2/3) of the Fair Housing
Board is needed in order to designate an area as a non-solicitation
area. In determining whether a nonsolicitation area should be designated, the Fair Housing Board shall
consider the following factors, and
such other factors it may deem
appropriate, as they pertain to the
area under consideration:
(1) the frequency of real estate
solicitation;
(2) the content of the solicitations;
(3) the racial composition and
rate of racial changes;
(4) the frequency of home sales
and other real estate activity; and
(5) the number, severity and history of racial incidents.
(c) The Fair Housing Board may
extend the designation of a non-solicitation area for one (1) additional
consecutive period of forty-five (45)
days upon making written findings
based on substantial evidence that
continuation of the solicitation ban
is warranted. If an area is designated as a non-solicitation area and the
designation is extended one more
time, the designation shall cease
after the extension expires.
(d) The Fair Housing Board may,
following a public hearing, cancel
the designation of a non-solicitation
area or extension of any such designation made pursuant to this section.
(e) If the designation of a nonsolicitation area expires without
extension or is canceled, or if an
extension made pursuant to division
(a) of this section expires or is canceled, the Fair Housing Board may,
no earlier than ninety (90) days following such expiration or cancellation, designate the area anew as a
non-solicitation area pursuant to
division (b) of this section.
(f) Upon expiration or cancellation of a designation or extension of
a non-solicitation area, the area
shall remain a watch area until the
watch area designation is canceled
by the Fair Housing Board pursuant
to division (b) of Section 665.16.
(g) Upon each designation, extension or cancellation made pursuant
to this section, the Fair Housing
Board shall promptly notify the
Mayor and Council in writing and
publish a notice in the City Record
or newspaper of general circulation
describing the boundaries of the
area by reference to streets, census,
tracts, or common landmarks. Each
designation or cancellation shall
take effect upon publication. The
Fair Housing Board shall maintain
a list of designated non-solicitation
areas and make it available to any
person upon request.
Section 665.18 Pattern or Practice
of Discrimination

has reasonable cause to believe that
any person or persons are engaged
in a pattern or practice of resistance
to a person’s or persons’ full enjoy-

3153

41
ment of the rights granted by Section 665.03 or 665.19, of this chapter,
or that any group of persons has
been denied any of the rights granted by such section and the denial
raises an issue of public policy, the
Fair Housing Board may refer the
matter to the Director of Law for
commencement of a civil action in a
court of competent jurisdiction on
behalf of the City. The Director of
Law may seek any relief considered
necessary to ensure the full enjoyment of the rights granted by this
chapter.

or represents himself or herself to be
a prospective purchaser, occupant or
tenant of housing accommodations
to refrain from purchasing or renting
housing
accommodations
by
referring to race, religion, color, sex,
sexual orientation, national origin,
age, disability, ethnic group, Vietnam-era or disabled veteran status,
familial status, marital status or
ancestry, of occupants or prospective
occupants of other housing accommodations in the neighborhood;
(b) influence or attempt to influence, by any words, acts, or failure
to act, any person who purports or
represents himself to be a prospective

or rental of housing accommodations, so as to promote or tend to
promote the continuance or maintenance of segregated housing or so

street, block or neighborhood;
(c) discriminate against any person who purports or represents himself to be a prospective seller, purchaser, occupant, landlord or tenant
of housing accommodations by any
influence, suggestion, act or failure
to act, or accord any differential
treatment among such persons, in

housing accommodations or in the
furnishing of information, services,
or facilities relative thereto because
of the race, religion, color, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, age,
disability, ethnic group, Vietnam-era
or disabled veteran status, familial
status, marital status or ancestry of
any person.
