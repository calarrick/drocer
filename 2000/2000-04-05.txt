CITY COUNCIL
______________

Cleveland, Ohio
Thursday, March 30, 2000.
The meeting of the Council was

to
order,
The
President,
Michael D. Polensek, in the Chair.
Councilmen present: Brady, Britt,
Cimperman, Cintron, Coats, Dolan,
Gordon, Jackson, Jones, Lewis, Melena,
O’Malley,
Patmon,
Polensek,
Robinson, Rybka, Sweeney, Westbrook, White and Willis.
MOTION

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTION READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 495-2000.
By Councilmen Polensek, Rybka,
Cimperman, Patmon, White, Brady,
Britt, Cintron, Coats, Dolan, Gordon,
Jackson,
Jones,
Lewis,
Melena
O’Malley, Robinson, Sweeney, Westbrook and Willis.
An emergency resolution expressing that Section 686.99 of Chapter
686 of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, is inapplicable
to Primary Health Systems with
respect
to
its
operation
of
St.
Michael Hospital.
Whereas, on March 13, 2000, Cleveland City Council passed Ordinance
385-2000 which enacted new Chapter
686 of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976; and
Whereas, Chapter 686 requires
Hospitals in the City of Cleveland
to comply with notice and other
requirements as defined therein; and
Whereas, Chapter 686 establishes,
at Section 686.99, a criminal penalty
for noncompliance with the provisions of that Chapter; and
Whereas, on the date of passage
of Ordinance 385-2000, and subse-

559

quently on the effective date of
enactment of Chapter 686, Primary
Health Systems, Inc. and PHS St.
Alexis, Inc., which entities own and
operate PHS-St. Michael Hospital,
located at 5163 Broadway Avenue,
Cleveland, were Debtors in the matter of In re Primary Health Systems, Inc., United States Bankruptcy
Court
for
the
District
of
Delaware, Case No. 99-615; and
Whereas,
certain
orders
were
issued by the Bankruptcy Court in
the above-referenced PHS Bankruptcy Case whereby Debtor Primary Health Systems, Inc. was
ordered, by injunction, to keep open
for normal operations, and to forego
closure of a certain hospital asset
of the Debtor, namely PHS-Mt. Sinai
East Medical Center located in
Richmond Heights, Ohio; and
Whereas,
various
petitioners
before the aforesaid Bankruptcy
Court in the PHS Bankruptcy Case,
including certain Members of the
Cleveland City Council, requested
injunctive relief to require that the
Debtor keep St. Michael Hospital
open for a specified period of time,
and that the Debtor forego closure
of St. Michael Hospital until further
order of the Bankruptcy Court; and
Whereas, Debtor Primary Health
Systems, Inc. has stated arguments
before the United States Bankruptcy Court in the aforesaid PHS
Bankruptcy Case whereby it has
represented
that
its
compliance
with an order of the Bankruptcy
Court requiring it to forego immediate closure of St. Michael Hospital may cause the Debtor and its
agents and principals to be subject
to potential criminal prosecution as
a result of Chapter 686; and
Whereas, The Honorable Mary
Walrath, Bankruptcy Judge in the
PHS Bankruptcy, on March 29, 2000,
issued a directive from the Bench
that the Cleveland City Council provide her, by no later than March 31,
2000, a clear-statement of Council’s
intent with respect to the application of Section 686.99 to Debtor Primary Health Systems, Inc. in connection with its ownership and
operation of St. Michael Hospital;
and
Whereas, by letter dated March
28, 2000, Primary Health Systems
provided to the Clerk of Council,
the Mayor, and the Director of Public Safety, information pursuant to
Section 686.02, while reserving the
question of whether Primary Health
Systems is required to comply with
Chapter 686; and
Whereas, the City Council of
Cleveland fully supports legal measures that result in keeping St.
Michael Hospital open, and which
prevent closure of said Hospital,
but does not intend, expressly or
impliedly, for concerns about the
interpretation and application of
Ordinance 385-2000 or Chapter 686,

The City Record

Chapter 686, that Section 686.99 does

Res. No. 498-2000.
By Councilmen Polensek, Rybka,
Cimperman, Patmon, White, Brady,
Britt, Cintron, Coats, Dolan, Gordon,
Jackson,
Jones,
Lewis,
Melena
O’Malley, Robinson, Sweeney, Westbrook and Willis.
An emergency resolution expressing that Section 686.99 of Chapter
686 of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, is inapplicable
to Primary Health Systems with
respect
to
its
operation
of
St.
Michael Hospital.
Whereas, on March 13, 2000, Cleveland City Council passed Ordinance

385-2000 which enacted new Chapter
686 of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976; and
Whereas, Chapter 686 requires
Hospitals in the City of Cleveland
to comply with notice and other
requirements as defined therein; and
Whereas, Chapter 686 establishes,
at Section 686.99, a criminal penalty
for noncompliance with the provisions of that Chapter; and
Whereas, on the date of passage
of Ordinance No. 385-2000, and subsequently on the effective date of
enactment of Chapter 686, Primary
Health Systems, Inc. and PHS St.
Alexis, Inc., which entities own and
operate PHS-St. Michael Hospital,
located at 5163 Broadway Avenue,
Cleveland, were Debtors in the matter of In re Primary Health Systems,
Inc., United States Bankruptcy Court
for the District of Delaware, Case
No. 99-615; and
Whereas,
certain
orders
were
issued by the Bankruptcy Court in
the above-referenced PHS Bankruptcy Case whereby Debtor Primary
Health Systems, Inc. was ordered,
by injunction, to keep open for normal operations, and to forego closure of a certain hospital asset of
the Debtor, namely PHS-Mt. Sinai
East Medical Center located in Richmond Heights, Ohio; and
Whereas,
various
petitioners
before the aforesaid Bankruptcy
Court in the PHS Bankruptcy Case,
including certain Members of the
Cleveland City Council, requested
injunctive relief to require that the
Debtor keep St. Michael Hospital
open for a specified period of time,
and that the Debtor forego closure
of St. Michael Hospital until further
order of the Bankruptcy Court; and
Whereas, Debtor Primary Health
Systems, Inc. has stated arguments
before the United States Bankruptcy
Court in the aforesaid PHS Bankruptcy Case whereby it has represented that its compliance with an
order
of
the
Bankruptcy
Court
requiring it to forego immediate
closure of St. Michael Hospital may
cause the Debtor and its agents and
principals to be subject to potential
criminal prosecution as a result of
Chapter 686; and
Whereas, The Honorable Mary
Walrath, Bankruptcy Judge in the
PHS Bankruptcy, on March 29, 2000,
issued a directive from the Bench
that the Cleveland City Council provide her, by no later than March 31,
2000, a clear-statement of Council’s
intent with respect to the application of Section 686.99 to Debtor Primary Health Systems, Inc. in connection with its ownership and operation of St. Michael Hospital; and
Whereas, by letter dated March 28,
2000, Primary Health Systems provided to the Clerk of Council, the
Mayor, and the Director of Public
Safety, information pursuant to Section 686.02, while reserving the question of whether Primary Health Systems is required to comply with
Chapter 686; and
Whereas, the City Council of
Cleveland fully supports legal measures that result in keeping St.
Michael Hospital open, and which
prevent closure of said Hospital, but
does
not
intend,
expressly
or
impliedly, for concerns about the
interpretation and application of
Ordinance No. 385-2000 or Chapter
686, to stand as a legal barrier to
keeping St. Michael Hospital open
pursuant to order of Bankruptcy
Court; now, therefore,

568

April 5, 2000
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That it is the intention
and understanding of the City Council of Cleveland that, given the facts
and circumstances of the bankruptcy of Primary Health Systems, and
the above-referenced proceedings in
the United States Bankruptcy Court
in relation to the passage of Ordinance No. 385-2000 and the enactment of Chapter 686, that Chapter
686 does not apply to Primary
Health Systems, its agents and principals, with respect to its operations
of St. Michael Hospital.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
are hereby supplemented by enacting new Section 341.07 thereof, to
read as follows:
Section 341.07 Pedestrian Retail
Area Restrictions
(a) Purpose. The regulations of
this
section
are
established
to
achieve, among others, the following
purposes.
(1) ensuring the continued economic viability of retail corridors
that depend on the patronage of customers who seek a shopping environment that is convenient and comfortable for pedestrians;
(2) enhancing the vitality of
downtown streets, thereby strengthening the district’s attractiveness as
a location for residences, offices and
tourism;
(3) increasing the marketability
of housing located on upper floors
of historic buildings in the district;
(4) providing necessary retail services to downtown residents and
office workers;
(5) reducing traffic congestion by
allowing downtown residents and
employees to patronize retail businesses by walking rather than by
traveling in automobiles or other
vehicles;
(6) furthering economic development in the City of Cleveland and
providing additional employment for
City residents.

18
(b) Applicability. The regulations
of this section shall apply to the
ground floor or “street-level floor
area” of any property located both
in the Public Land Protective District and in a Retail Business District on a “pedestrian-oriented shopping street,” as defined herein. No
use in such location shall be established or changed except in accordance with the provisions of this
section.
(c) Pedestrian-Oriented Shopping
Street. A “pedestrian oriented shopping street” is any side of any block
of a street characterized by a predominance of retail businesses situated at or near the public sidewalk.
The City Planning Commission shall
prepare and adopt a map designating pedestrian-oriented streets within the area to which the regulations
of this section apply. The Planning
Commission shall review and update
that map periodically.
(d) Referral by Division of Build ing and Housing. The Division of
Building and Housing shall refer to
the City Planning Commission any
application
for
establishment
or
change of a ground floor use in a
building located both in the Public
Land Protective District and in a
Retail Business District.
(e) Planning Commission Deter mination. Upon receipt of an application to establish a new street-level
use in a location subject to the provisions of this section, the City Planning Commission shall determine
whether the space is located on a
pedestrian-oriented
street
and
whether the proposed use is permitted by the regulations of this section. The Commission shall make its
determination within thirty (30)
days of receipt of a complete application,
unless
the
applicant
approves an extension of time.
(f) Prohibited Uses. Street-level
floor area in a building located on
a
pedestrian-oriented
shopping
street, as determined by the City
Planning Commission in accordance
with the provisions of this section,
shall not be occupied principally for
purposes of storage or warehousing
or operation of telecommunications
devices, telephone switching equipment or other automated or remotely controlled machinery or equipment.
(g) Upper Floor Uses. If any uses
prohibited in street-level areas are
proposed for upper floors in buildings subject to the provisions of this
section, the City Planning Commission or, if applicable, the Landmarks Commission during its review
shall ensure that facade and window areas are treated in a manner
that does not convey the appearance
of a space used for storage or warehousing purposes, but rather conveys the appearance of a space used
actively by employees, customers or
residents.
(h) Nonconforming Uses. Legallyestablished uses made nonconforming by the initial adoption of this
section may continue but may not
be expanded or otherwise changed
so as to create a greater degree of
nonconformity, unless approved by
the Board of Zoning Appeals in
accordance with Chapter 359.
(i) Exceptions. Notwithstanding
the variance powers outlined in Section 329.03, the Board of Zoning
Appeals may vary or modify the
application of these provisions in
harmony with the general purpose

The City Record
and intent of the Zoning Code so
that
the
public
health,
safety,
morals and general welfare may be
safeguarded and substantial justice
done. The decision to vary or modify the application of these provisions shall consider the following
factors: (1) the proximity of the proposed use to the pedestrian-oriented
street frontage, in the case of a use
that will occupy only a portion of
the street-level floor space; (2) the
physical size, shape or other characteristics of the premises; and (3)
whether refusal of the variance
appealed for will deprive the owner
of substantial property rights.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

RESOLUTIONS
Res. No. 825-97.
By Councilman Lewis.
An emergency resolution urging
Governor Taft, the State Auditor,
the Board of County Commissioners
and the County Auditor to audit the
tax payments of gas and
oil well
operators
and
collect
delinquent
taxes for the benefit of the Cleveland public schools.
Whereas, Ohio law classifies oil
and natural gas as real property
subject to real property taxes; and
Whereas, state law requires Ohio
counties to compile a list annually
of oil and gas wells throughout the
state; and
Whereas, the only oil and gas
wells in county records are those
reported by the operators of the
wells; and
Whereas, a similar honor system
is used to assess the proper taxes to
be paid since the data used to compile the taxes is supplied by the suppliers and not audited by the county or state; and
Whereas, it is estimated that only
a fraction of the returns are being
filed by the well operators and only
a fraction of the tax due is being
paid; and
Whereas, there is little initiative
for counties to trace delinquent producers since about 80% of the
money collected would go to public
schools, not the county; and
Whereas, strict enforcement of the
tax laws with respect to oil and gas
wells in Cuyahoga County could be
a badly needed source of revenue
for the Cleveland school system; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that all potential
sources of revenue to benefit the
Cleveland public schools must be
explored; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
Governor Taft, the State Auditor,
the Board of County Commissioners
and the County Auditor to audit the
tax payments of gas and oil well
operators
and
collect
delinquent
taxes for the benefit of public
school systems, including the Cleveland public schools.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Governor

The City Record
Taft, the State Auditor, the Board of
County
Commissioners
and
the
County Auditor.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Res. No. 424-2000.

Attorney General, investigate the

An emergency resolution urging
the State of Ohio use funds from the
tobacco settlement to convert Mt.
Sinai-East, Mt. Sinai-Univeristy Circle, St. Michael, and Deaconess Hospital from for profit-to-not-for-profit
facilities.
Whereas, over the past recent
weeks the Greater Cleveland community has seen the results of an
antiquated regulatory health delivery system that has resulted in the
proposed closure of Mt. Sinai-East,
Mt. Sinai-University Circle, and St.
Michael as well as the possible sale
of Deaconess Hospital; and
Whereas, these proposed closings
will have a detrimental impact in
Cleveland inner city neighborhoods
since the residents that reside in
these communities must now travel
outside
their
neighborhood
to
receive health care services at other
suburban hospitals; and
Whereas, these hospital closings
have resulted in the closure of emergency rooms and trauma centers,
which
drastically
decrease
the

The City Record
accessibility of emergency medical
care to residents in the City of
Cleveland; and
Whereas, these hospital closings
have greatly reduced the accessibility of hospital care to the City’s population of indigent, elderly, and
working poor who reside in Cleveland and are in most need for medical services; and
Whereas,
State
Representative
John E. Barnes has proffered a plan
to eradicate an antiquated regulatory health delivery system that has
resulted in hospital closings by
proposing
that
specific
funding
streams be used for these hospitals
in order to keep them open; and
Whereas, a resolution has been
introduced in the State General
Assembly by State Representative
John E. Barnes urging the State of
Ohio to use funds from the tobacco
settlement to prevent to the closings
of these hospitals; and
Whereas, this resolution calls for
the State to use these specific funds
for converting these hospitals from
for-profit to not-for-profit facilities
as well as providing direct capital
assistance and bonds totaling $100
million to implement such conversion; and
Whereas,
this
resolution
also
urges the State to set aside $10 million from the Victims of Violent
Crimes fund to reestablish the trauma care unit at Mt. Sinai-University
Circle and emergency room care at
other hospitals serving victims of
violent
crime
and
to
establish
Health and Economic Solvency Commissions to review long term implications of acquisitions that convert
not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit
hospitals; now therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland supports the resolution proffered by Representative
Barnes urging the State of Ohio to
use funds from the tobacco settlement to convert Mt. Sinai-East, Mt.
Sinai-University Circle, St. Michael,
and Deaconess Hospitals from forprofit to not-for-profit facilities in
order to keep these institutions open
to serve the residents in their
respective communities.

An emergency resolution expressing that Section 686.99 of Chapter
686 of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, is inapplicable
to Primary Health Systems with
respect
to
its
operation
of
St.
Michael Hospital.
Whereas, on March 13, 2000, Cleveland City Council passed Ordinance
385-2000 which enacted new Chapter
686 of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976; and
Whereas, Chapter 686 requires
Hospitals in the City of Cleveland
to comply with notice and other
requirements as defined therein; and
Whereas, Chapter 686 establishes,
at Section 686.99, a criminal penalty
for noncompliance with the provisions of that Chapter; and
Whereas, on the date of passage
of Ordinance No. 385-2000, and subsequently on the effective date of
enactment of Chapter 686, Primary
Health Systems, Inc. and PHS St.
Alexis, Inc., which entities own and
operate PHS-St. Michael Hospital,
located at 5163 Broadway Avenue,
Cleveland, were Debtors in the matter of In re Primary Health Systems,
Inc., United States Bankruptcy Court
for the District of Delaware, Case
No. 99-615; and
Whereas,
certain
orders
were
issued by the Bankruptcy Court in
the above-referenced PHS Bankruptcy Case whereby Debtor Primary
Health Systems, Inc. was ordered,
by injunction, to keep open for normal operations, and to forego closure of a certain hospital asset of
the Debtor, namely PHS-Mt. Sinai
East Medical Center located in Richmond Heights, Ohio; and
Whereas,
various
petitioners
before the aforesaid Bankruptcy
Court in the PHS Bankruptcy Case,
including certain Members of the
Cleveland City Council, requested
injunctive relief to require that the
Debtor keep St. Michael Hospital
open for a specified period of time,
and that the Debtor forego closure
of St. Michael Hospital until further
order of the Bankruptcy Court; and
Whereas, Debtor Primary Health
Systems, Inc. has stated arguments
before the United States Bankruptcy
Court in the aforesaid PHS Bankruptcy Case whereby it has represented that its compliance with an
order
of
the
Bankruptcy
Court
requiring it to forego immediate closure of St. Michael Hospital may
cause the Debtor and its agents and
principals to be subject to potential
criminal prosecution as a result of
Chapter 686; and
Whereas, The Honorable Mary
Walrath, Bankruptcy Judge in the
PHS Bankruptcy, on March 29, 2000,
issued a directive from the Bench
that the Cleveland City Council provide her, by no later than March 31,
2000, a clear-statement of Council’s
intent with respect to the application of Section 686.99 to Debtor Primary Health Systems, Inc. in connection with its ownership and operation of St. Michael Hospital; and
Whereas, by letter dated March 28,
2000, Primary Health Systems provided to the Clerk of Council, the
Mayor, and the Director of Public

38
Safety, information pursuant to Section 686.02, while reserving the question of whether Primary Health Systems is required to comply with
Chapter 686; and
Whereas, the City Council of
Cleveland fully supports legal measures that result in keeping St.
Michael Hospital open, and which
prevent closure of said Hospital, but
does
not
intend,
expressly
or
impliedly, for concerns about the
interpretation and application of
Ordinance No. 385-2000 or Chapter
686, to stand as a legal barrier to
keeping St. Michael Hospital open
pursuant to order of Bankruptcy
Court; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That it is the intention
and understanding of the City Council of Cleveland that, given the facts
and circumstances of the bankruptcy of Primary Health Systems, and
the above-referenced proceedings in
the United States Bankruptcy Court
in relation to the passage of Ordinance No. 385-2000 and the enactment of Chapter 686, that Chapter
686 does not apply to Primary
Health Systems, its agents and principals, with respect to its operations
of St. Michael Hospital.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
