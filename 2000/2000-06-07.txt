FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES REFERRED
Ord. No. 164-A-2000 (As substitute
for Ordinance No. 164-2000).
By Mayor White and Councilmen
Polensek, Patmon, Melena and Britt.
An emergency ordinance to enact
Sections 619.23, 619.24 and 619.25 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, relating to declaring vehicles used in the commission
of drug or prostitution offenses to
be nuisances, and declaring other
property to be nuisances, and providing for the abatement of the
same.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
hereby supplemented by enacting
new Sections 619.23, 619.24 and 619.25
thereof to read, respectively, as follows:
Section 619.23 Use of a Vehicle to
Solicit a Person to Engage in Prostitution or a Drug Offense Prohibited
(a) No person, while operating a
vehicle, or while a passenger in or
on a vehicle, shall solicit another to
engage such other person in sexual
activity for hire.
(b) No person, while operating a
vehicle or while a passenger in or
on a vehicle, shall stop, attempt to
stop, beckon to, attempt to beckon
to, or entice any person to approach
or enter the vehicle with intent to
entice the other person to engage in
sexual activity for hire contrary to
Section 619.09 of the Codified Ordinances.
(c) No person, while operating a
vehicle, or while a passenger in or
on
a

knowingly
obtain, possess, or use a controlled
substance contrary to Section 607.03.
(d) No person, while operating a
vehicle or while a passenger in or
on a vehicle, shall stop, attempt to
stop, beckon to, attempt to beckon
to, or entice any person to approach
or enter the vehicle with intent to
entice the other person to engage in
any drug abuse offense contrary to
Chapter 607 of the Codified Ordinances.
(e) Any vehicle that has been
used on two (2) occasions in the
commission of one or any combination of the offenses defined in divisions (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section, for which convictions have
been entered in the court’s journal,
without regard to the ownership of
the property and without regard to
whether the same person(s) were
convicted of both offenses, is hereby declared to be a nuisance, and its
contents, if any, are also hereby
declared to be a nuisance. Any vehicle
that
constitutes
a
nuisance
under this division and its contents
may be abated as provided in Section 619.25.

(f) Whoever violates divisions
(a), (b), (c ) or (d) of this Section
is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The sentencing court
shall sentence the offender to a
mandatory term of imprisonment of
not less than three (3) days on the
first offense, not less than ten (10)
days on the second offense, and not
less than thirty (30) days on the
third or any subsequent offense, and
may sentence the offender to a
longer term of imprisonment. In
addition, the sentencing court may
impose a fine not exceeding one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
Section 619.24 Nuisance Property
Declared
(a) Any vehicle, boat, aircraft,
building or place that has been used
on two (2) occasions in the commission of one or any combination
of the following offenses, for which
convictions have been entered in the
court’s journal, without regard to
the ownership of the property and
without regard to whether the same
person(s) were convicted of both
offenses, is hereby declared to be a
nuisance:
Pertaining to prostitution
(1) Procuring, Section 619.08
(2) Soliciting, Section 619.09
(3) Prostitution, Section 619.10
(4) Use of a Vehicle to Solicit a
Person to engage in Prostitution or
a Drug Offense Prohibited, Section
619.23
Pertaining to drugs
(5) Drug Abuse: Controlled Substance Possession or Use, Section
607.03
(6) Possessing Drug Abuse Instruments, Section 607.04
(7) Permitting Drug Abuse, Section 607.05
(8) Possession, Manufacture and

Pertaining to gambling
(10) Gambling, Section 611.02
(11) Operating a Gambling House,
Section 611.03
(12) Public Gaming, Section 611.04
(b) Any building, vehicle, boat,
aircraft, or place that constitutes a
nuisance as defined in division (a)
and all of the contents of the same,
if any, may be abated as provided
in Section 619.25.
Section 619.25 Action to Abate Nuisances
(a) Nature of action. The Director
of Law may file an action in rem to
abate any nuisance as defined by
Section 619.24. The standard of proof
shall be by a preponderance of the
evidence.
This
action
may
be
brought as a separate action or concurrently with any other action
available at law or in equity to
enjoin and/or abate the nuisance
including, without limitation, an
action authorized by Chapter 3767 of
the Revised Code or other actions
authorized by these Codified Ordinances.
(b) Notice and opportunity to be
heard. Prior to the issuance of an
order under this section, a reasonably diligent search shall be conducted of the public records that
relate to the property that is the
subject of an abatement action to

1200

June 7, 2000
identify the owner, lienholder, and
any other person with an ownership
interest in the property. Such persons shall be sent notice by certified
mail, return receipt requested, or
shall be personally served, and shall
be granted an opportunity to be
heard by the court.
(c) Innocent owners or lienhold ers. No abatement order shall be
issued pursuant to this section if an
owner or lienholder or other person
with an ownership interest in the
property that is the subject of an
abatement action establishes to the
court, by a preponderance of evidence after filing a motion with the
court, that the owner, lienholder or
other
person
neither
knew
nor
should have known after a reasonable inquiry that the property would
be used, or likely would be used or
involved in the commission of a
criminal offense, and further that
the owner, lienholder or other person with an ownership interest in
the property did not expressly or
impliedly consent to the use or
involvement of the property in the
violation, and that the lien or ownership interest was perfected pursuant to law prior to the existence
of the nuisance.
(d) Family hardship. A family or
household member of the person
who is the owner of property used
to maintain a nuisance may file a
motion with the court having jurisdiction over the action to abate a
nuisance claiming that the order of
abatement and sale of the property
will create an undue hardship on
the family or household member. If
the court determines by a preponderance of the evidence that an
undue hardship would be caused to
a family or household member filing
the motion, and if the court further
finds that the moving party has not
in any previous case benefited from
a finding of family hardship relative to the property at issue, no
order of abatement shall issue. As
used in this section, “family or
household
member”
means
the
spouse, brother, sister or child of the
person who is the owner of property used to maintain a nuisance.
(e) Order of Abatement. If the
existence of a nuisance is established, an order of abatement as
described in this division shall be
entered as a part of the judgment
in the case.
If the property involved in the
abatement action is a building or
other place, it shall be ordered
closed and kept closed for a period
of one (1) year, unless sooner
released by the court. The contents
and fixtures of such a building or
other place shall be given to an
agency identified by the Director
of Law, which may be a battered
women’s shelter or similar agency,
if the agency desires to have it, or
if it does not, the same shall be
sold at public auction or as otherwise directed by the court, and the
proceeds shall be distributed as
provided in division (g) of this section.
If the property involved in the
abatement action is a vehicle, boat
or aircraft, the same shall be given
to a battered women’s shelter or
similar agency identified by the
Director of Law, if the agency
desires to have it, or if it does not,
the same sold at public auction or
as otherwise directed by the court,
and the proceeds shall be distrib-

June 7, 2000
uted as provided in division (g) of
this section.
The court may order any person
in charge of personalty that is subject to sale under this division to
present the same at a time and
place directed by the court for the
purpose of conducting its sale. In
addition, the court may authorize
any law enforcement agency to
seize such personalty.
In identifying an agency to receive the property or the proceeds
from the sale of the property as
provided in this section, the Director of Law shall confer with the
council member representing the
community in which the criminal
