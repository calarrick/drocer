FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES REFERRED
Ord. No. 1053-2000.
By Councilman Jackson.
An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting
new Chapter 659 relating to predatory lending.
Whereas, many senior citizens
and minority homeowners in the
City of Cleveland are targeted by
unethical home improvement contractors, mortgage companies, mortgage lenders, and finance companies; and
Whereas, many of these companies engage in predatory lending
practices resulting in foreclosure
and/or stripping the home of equity; and
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland is deeply concerned
about these unscrupulous practices
and believes that entities or their
affiliates that engage in predatory
lending should be barred from doing
business with the City of Cleveland;
and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of
the City of Cleveland; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
hereby supplemented by enacting
new Chapter 659, to read as follows:

under common control with another
entity.
(b) “Flipping” means the refinancing and charging of additional
points, charges or other costs on a

ceases to occupy the dwelling.
(e) “Threshold loan” means a loan
secured by residential real property
located within the City of Cleveland
on
which

entered into after the effective date
of this chapter, and:
(1) at the time of the loan's origination, the annual percentage rate
of the loan exceeds by more than
five (5) percentage points the yield
on Treasury securities having comparable periods of maturity to the

(2) the total points and fees
exceed four percent (4%) of the

(f) “Points and fees” means:

1280

June 14, 2000
nection with the charge or the

(iii) any bona fide, competitive
and reasonable fees paid to the
lender or an affiliate of the lender
for
the

the service or product from the
unaffiliated entity.
(g) “Predatory lender” means a
financial institution that has made,
within the previous twelve (12)
month period, predatory loans that
comprise either (1) one percent
(1%) of the total annual number of
loans made, or (2) one (1) individual loan; whichever is less. Each
financial institution and affiliate
shall be considered separately for
the purposes of these calculations,
and only loans secured by residential real estate that is located within the City of Cleveland shall be
considered.
The
term
“predatory
lender” shall not include a financial
institution, or its affiliates, that has
submitted to the Director of Finance
a plan to discontinue the practice of
making predatory loans, if the plan
ensures: (i) the prompt disengagement from the practice of making
predatory loans by the financial
institution and its affiliates, and (ii)
the complete cessation of the making of predatory loans by the financial institution and its affiliates
immediately after the plan is submitted.;
(h) “Predatory loan” means a

points and fees in excess of four
percent (4%), as well as the financing of fees for unreasonably high
priced or unnecessary products into
threshold loans;
(iii) payment penalties: (1) that
apply to payments made after the
expiration of the 24 month period
following the date the loan was
made, or (2) that are more than
two percent (2%) of the threshold
loan;
(iv) balloon payments: a threshold
loan that has a payment schedule
with regular periodic payments that
when aggregated do not fully amortize the outstanding principal balance, except for bridge loans connected with the acquisition or construction of a dwelling intended to
become
the
borrower’s
principal
dwelling;
(v) loan flipping;
(vi)
negative
amortization:
a
threshold loan, other than a loan
secured only by a reverse mortgage,
with terms under which the outstanding balance will increase at
any time over the course of the loan
because the regular periodic payments do not cover the full amount
of the interest due, unless the negative amortization is the consequence of a temporary forbearance
sought by the borrower;
(vii) the financing of a single
premium credit life, credit disability, credit unemployment, or any
other life or health insurance, directly or indirectly, into one or more
threshold loans;
(viii) lending without due regard
to repayment ability: the lender
makes a loan if the lender does not
reasonably believe at the time the
loan is consummated that the borrower or the borrowers (when considered collectively in the case of
multiple borrowers) will be able to
make the scheduled payments to
repay the obligation based upon a
consideration of their current an
expected income, current obligations, employment status, and other
financial resources (other that the
borrower’s equity in the dwelling
which secures repayment of the
loan). A borrower shall be presumed
to be able to make the scheduled
payments to repay the obligation, if,
at the time the loan is consummated, or at the time of first rate
adjustment in the case of a lower
introductory rate, the borrower’s
scheduled
monthly
payments
(including principal, interest, taxes,
insurance and assessment) do not
exceed 30% of the borrower’s monthly gross income as verified by the
credit application, the borrower’s
financial statement, a credit report,
financial information provided to

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTION REFERRED
Res. No. 1073-2000.
By Councilman Cintron.
An emergency resolution opposing
the hiring of armed security guards
for Cleveland Public Schools.
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland is greatly concerned
about the health, safety and welfare
of children attending the Cleveland
Public Schools; and
Whereas, it was recently announced that the Cleveland school
district intends to spend an additional $8 million next year to place
armed police, security guards and
metal detectors in the schools; and
Whereas, the Cleveland school district announced it will hire 22 armed
police for selected schools within
the district; and
Whereas, while Council acknowledges that security must be of paramount concern, this Council believes
that the hiring of armed guards to
patrol the halls is a dangerous and
ill-advised plan;
Whereas, Council urges Mayor
White and Barbara Byrd-Bennett to
reconsider the placement of armed
guards in such close proximity to
school students; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,

Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

City of Cleveland opposes the placement of armed security guards in

1294

Whereas, as part of the annual
budget process for this year, Council
and the Administration agreed that
$350,000 would be earmarked to fully
staff the Department of Public Safety fireboat serving the neighborhoods along the Cuyahoga River; and
Whereas, Council reached this consensus with the Administration after
much discussion, and eventual agreement by the Administration, that the
fireboat is needed to ensure the
safety of residents and businesses in
Tremont, Ohio City and the Clark
Metro areas of the City, and along
the riverfront; and
Whereas, there is over $1 billion
of business development along the
riverfront; and
Whereas,
Council
has
become
aware that the Administration has
not fulfilled its promise to fully staff
the fireboat, citing an opinion of an
arbitrator that failed to give due consideration to the needs and safety of
the impacted neighborhoods; and
Whereas, this Council condemns
this decision of the arbitrator and
the Administration which places
neighborhoods last, as opposed to
first; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

An emergency resolution urging
Rite Aid Pharmacies to keep the
Rite Aid Pharmacy branch located
on East 131st Street and Miles at
this location in order to continue providing pharmaceutical prescriptions
services to the residents in Ward 2.
Whereas, the Rite Aid Pharmacy
has been providing pharmaceutical
services to residents in Ward 2 for
the last ten years; and
Whereas, Rite Aid Pharmacy is the
only pharmacy in Ward 2 that residents can go to in order to fill their
pharmaceutical prescriptions; and
Whereas, Rite Aid Pharmacies has
announced that the Rite Aid branch
located at the East 131st Street and
Miles Avenue location will be relocating to another part of the City;
and
Whereas, this Rite Aid Pharmacy
branch has recently closed its prescription services, which now makes
it difficult for Ward 2 residents
especially senior citizens to obtain
their medical prescriptions, since
there are no other pharmacies in the
neighborhood providing pharmaceutical services; and
Whereas, the absence of a pharmacy in Ward 2 will require many
residents especially senior citizens
to seek other pharmacies outside
their own neighborhood in order
obtain medical prescriptions; and
Whereas, the absence of a neighborhood pharmacy could be a detriment to the health and quality of
life for residents in Ward 2, now,
therefore;
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council strongly
opposes the decision by Rite Aid
Pharmacies to relocate the Rite Aid
Pharmacy branch that is presently
located on East 131st Street and
Miles Avenue to another location
within the City of Cleveland, that
would leave Ward 2 residents without a pharmacy service.
Section 2. That Council strongly
urges Rite Aid Pharmacies to maintain a pharmacy branch in the Ward
2 area at the East 131st Street and
Miles Avenue location, in order for
residents to have their medical prescriptions filled at a pharmacy in
their own neighborhood.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby is directed to
transmit two certified copies of this
resolution to the Rite Aid Pharmacies
Chief Executive Officer Robert Miller.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of

it shall take effect and be in force
