By Councilmen Dolan, O’Malley,
Rybka, Melena, Polensek, Patmon
and Lewis.
An emergency resolution strongly
opposing proposed mergers of major
air carriers including the proposed
merger of US Airways and United
Airlines and urging the U.S. Senate
to disapprove said proposed merger
as not being in the public interest.
Whereas, airport authorities, consumer groups, economists, and many
members of Congress have raised
many problems with the proposed
merger of United Airlines and US
Airways; and
Whereas, most observers agree
that the United Airlines/US Airways
merger would be the beginning of a
final industry consolidation that
could result in only three major carriers
(eg.
American/Northwest;
Delta/Continental/TWA; and United/US Airways) serving 80-90% of
domestic air travelers; and
Whereas, approval of proposed
mergers such as that of United Airlines and US Airways would substantially
reduce
competition
at
most airports, potentially increase
air fares for local travelers and
adversely affect existing relationships between airlines and airports;
and
Whereas, approval of proposed
mergers such as that of United Airlines and US Airways would cause
all airports to have a more difficult
time attracting low fare competitors;
and
Whereas,
such
mergers
could
enable the three remaining air carriers, without violating antitrust
laws, to divide the U.S. market into
three locational monopolies where
they would have absolute control of
pricing and schedules; and
Whereas, on July 25, 2000, Senate
Commerce
Committee
Chairman
McCain and Aviation Subcommittee
Chairman Gorton introduced Resolution 344 stating that the United Airlines/US Airways merger is not in
the public interest and should be
disapproved; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,

September 27, 2000
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
strongly opposes proposed mergers
of major air carriers, including the
proposed merger of United Airlines
and US Airways and urges the U.S.
Senate to follow Resolution 344 calling for the disapproval of the United
Airlines/US Airways merger as not
being in the public interest.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
Senate Commerce Committee Chairman McCain and Aviation Subcommittee Chairman Gorton; to U.S. Senators Mike DeWine and George
Voinovich; to U.S. Representatives
Dennis Kucinich, Stephanie TubbsJones, Sherrod Brown and Steven
LaTourette
to
Airports
Council
International — North America, and
to Association of American Airport
Executives.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Referred to Directors of Port Control, Law; Committees on Aviation
and Transportation, Legislation.

RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 1702-2000.
By Councilman Jones.
An emergency resolution urging
the President of the United States,
and the United States Congress, to
take emergency action to reduce oil
prices.
Whereas, the price of oil has more
than tripled since January 1999 to
over $35.00 per barrel, the highest
price since the Gulf War crisis 10
years ago, and threatens to go even
higher over the coming weeks and
months; and
Whereas, the high level of oil
prices has already led to massive
social conflict and economic hardship in western Europe and other
parts of the world; and
Whereas, the high level of oil
prices threatens severe economic
hardship against the citizens of
Cleveland this Winter, especially
the elderly and those on fixed
incomes since home heating oil
prices have increased by an average
of 50% over the past 12 months, and
skyrocketing energy prices could
cause a hyper-inflationary explosion
throughout the economy; and
Whereas, oil prices have continued to rise despite increased production by OPEC countries, suggesting that other factors, such as
speculation in oil price futures and

The City Record
other markets, are to blame for the
oil price crisis; and
Whereas, the skyrocketing of oil
prices began just weeks after the
purchase of AMOCO by British
Petroleum in August 1998, and a
merger of oil giants Exxon and
Mobil in December 1998, leading to
suspicion that oil markets are being
manipulated upwards, to generate
the super-profits needed to pay the
massive cost of mergers and acquisitions among multinational corporations; now therefore:
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges the President of the United States, and the
United States Congress, to take
emergency action to reduce oil prices,
including an investigation of possible market manipulation through
speculation or other unfair practices, and the possibility of bypassing the oil multinational corporations completely, by negotiating
government-to-government purchasing agreements directly with the oilproducing countries.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby is directed to
transmit two certified copies of this
resolution to the President of the
United States, the United States Congress and the Mayor of the City of
Cleveland, urging them to take
emergency action to reduce oil
prices, and to investigate the possibility
of
market
manipulation
through
speculation
and
other
unfair practices.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all members of Council, it shall take
effect and be in force immediately
upon its adoption and approval by
the Mayor; otherwise, it shall be in
force from and after the earliest
period allowed by law.

Res. No. 1703-2000.
By Councilman Rybka.
An emergency resolution objecting to the transfer of ownership of
a D5 Liquor Permit to 3876 East 65th
Street, 1st Fl. & Bsmt.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Director of Liquor Control of an application for the transfer of ownership of a D5 Liquor Permit from Permit No. 7503002, Ron
Mar East 65th Street Inc., DBA Mrs.
Lounge, 3876 East 65th Street, 1st Fl.
& Bsmt., Cleveland, Ohio 44105, to
Permit No. 4173863, JCK Johns Inc.,
DBA Mrs Lounge, 3876 East 65th
Street, 1st Fl. & Bsmt., Cleveland,
Ohio 44105; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and

2374

September 27, 2000
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, safety
and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of
notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby record its objection to the transfer of ownership of a D5 Liquor Permit to Permit No. 7503002, Ron Mar
East 65th Street Inc., DBA Mrs.
Lounge, 3876 East 65th Street, 1st Fl.
& Bsmt., Cleveland, Ohio 44105, to
Permit No. 4173863, JCK Johns Inc.,
DBA Mrs Lounge, 3876 East 65t

Ohio 44105 and requests the Director
of Liquor Control to set a hearing
for said application in accordance
with provisions of Section 4303.26 of
the Revised Code of Ohio.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby is directed to
transmit two certified copies of this
resolution, together with two copies
of a letter of objection and two
copies of a letter requesting that the
hearing be held in Cleveland, Cuyahoga County.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

Res. No. 1704-2000.
By Councilman White.
An emergency resolution urging
the Governor of Ohio to implement
a food stamp waiver for Ohio’s labor
surplus areas to assist working
adults.
Whereas, across the country, families are facing hardships of moving
from welfare to work as a result of
the welfare reform policy; and
Whereas, in 1999, 40 percent of
Ohio families receiving public assistance were from the 19 counties in
Northeast Ohio, which makes this
region one of the most severely
impacted by welfare reform; and
Whereas, changes implemented as

September 27, 2000
a result of welfare reform have
caused much confusion about who is
eligible for food stamps; and
Whereas, the state of Ohio’s food
stamp application process is already
an intricate one, which is further
complicated by the requirement that
working individuals must reapply
for eligibility every three months;
and
Whereas, the length and requirements of the application make it a
difficult process for many people,
especially the working poor; and
Whereas, a recent nationwide poll
of low-income individuals eligible
for food stamps showed that 75 percent were not aware of their eligibility; and
Whereas, 80 percent of the food
stamp reductions in Cuyahoga County in 1999 were from City of Cleveland residents; and
Whereas, over 60 percent of those
receiving food stamps nationally are
children or elderly; and
Whereas, four years ago, the food
banks in Ohio were successful in
having a line item placed into the
state budget for $1.5 million to be
distributed annually to Ohio food
banks for the purchase of food; and
Whereas it was the position of the
Ohio food banks that public dollars
formerly being spent on food stamps
be made available to food providers;
and
Whereas, the Greater Cleveland
Committee on Hunger is urging a
permanent line item for the Ohio
Food Purchase Program; and
Whereas, according to federal legislation, states are given the opportunity to seek waivers of food stamp
eligibility for individuals in geographic areas with high unemployment rates or an insufficient number of jobs; and
Whereas, the state of Ohio has
been granted such wavier and the
Governor of Ohio has declined to
implement it; and
Whereas, through the implementation of a food stamp waiver for
Ohio’s labor surplus areas, Cleveland, which currently qualify as a
labor surplus area could provide
food stamp benefits for eligible residents; now, therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland strongly urges
Ohio
Governor
Robert
Taft
to
implement a food stamp waiver for
Ohio’s labor surplus areas to assist
working adults and provide food
stamp benefits to eligible residents.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby is directed to
transmit two certified copies of this
resolution to Ohio Governor Robert
Taft, urging him to implement a
food stamp waiver for Ohio’s labor
surplus areas to assist working
adults and provide food stamp benefits to eligible residents.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
