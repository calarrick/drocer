By Councilman Rybka.
An emergency ordinance to enact
Section 337.081 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, and
to amend Section 335.01 of said Codified Ordinances, as amended by
Ordinance No. 552-96, passed June 10,
1996, and Section 335.02, as enacted
by Ordinance No. 2204-A-48, passed
December 19, 1949, relating to downtown residential districts.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
hereby supplemented by enacting
new Section 337.081 to read as follows:
Section 337.081 Downtown Residential (DR) District
(a) Purpose. A Downtown Residential (DR) District is established
to reserve suitably-located sites for
development or retention of multifamily housing, supplemented by
compatible retail or office uses,
within the downtown area of the
City of Cleveland. Reservation of
such sites for residential use is
intended to strengthen the economy
of the City’s central business district by supplementing the demand
for retail and entertainment uses,
particularly during evening and
weekend hours. Establishment of a
downtown residential zoning district
is also intended to protect residential uses in the downtown area from
detrimental effects of incompatible
uses.
(b) Definition of Residential Use.
For purposes of this section, the
term “residential use” shall refer to
dwelling
units
for
non-transient
occupancy, dormitory rooms, and all
hallways and other common areas
serving such units or rooms.
(c) Permitted Uses. In a Downtown Residential (DR) District, permitted uses shall be limited to the
following, provided that at least
fifty-one percent (51%) of all floor
area devoted to main uses in each
main building or complex of main
and accessory buildings shall be in
residential use, as defined in division (b) of this section:
(1) residential uses: including
“Class A” multiple dwellings, townhouse buildings and dormitories,
(2) professional, business, governmental, institutional and medical
offices,
(3) restaurants, taverns and other
eating establishments,
(4) retail stores and retail services, except as prohibited in division (d) of this section,
(5) theaters, nightclubs, dance
halls, bowling alleys, skating rinks
and other places of entertainment
and recreation, except as prohibited
in division (d) of this section,
(6) banks and other financial service establishments, copying and
printing services, employment agencies, and other business service
establishments, except as prohibited
in division (d) of this section,
(7) museums, libraries, galleries,
schools, places of worship, daycare
centers, and other cultural and institutional uses, not for correctional
purposes,
(8) accessory uses permitted in
Multi-Family and General Retail
Districts, and roof-top antennae and

16
associated equipment for transmission or reception,
(9) uses similar to those permitted with respect to the type of goods
sold, the type of services offered,
hours of operation, and effects on
nearby residential uses.
(d) Prohibited Uses. All uses not
listed as permitted nor determined
to be a similar use are prohibited.
In addition, the following uses are
specifically prohibited in Downtown
Residential (DR) Districts:
(1) uses permitted only in an
Industrial District,
(2)
service
stations,
service
garages, and car washes (“automobile laundries”), except as an accessory use to a multiple dwelling,
where such services are available
exclusively to residents to the multiple dwelling and for which no
exterior signs are displayed,
(3) adult entertainment uses, as
defined in Section 347.07 of this
Code,
(4) animal kennels and establishments in which animal slaughtering
is conducted.
(e) Limitation on Parking. In
Downtown Residential (DR) Districts, parking shall be permitted as
an accessory use but shall be limited to a maximum of two (2) parking spaces per dwelling unit and
one (1) parking space per 500 feet
of commercial area for each main
building or complex of main and
accessory buildings. No additional
parking shall be permitted.
(f) Limitation on Location of NonResidential Main Uses. In Downtown Residential (DR) Districts, no
building shall be devoted exclusively to retail, office, or other permitted non-residential main uses. Such
uses shall be located only in buildings which are devoted principally
to residential use or to garages providing parking for the residential
uses.
(g) Exceptions to Yard Regulations. Requirements for interior side
yards and rear yards may be waived
by the Board of Zoning Appeals in
Downtown Residential (DR) Districts if the Board determines that
one of the following factors applies:
(1) the subject property owner
has obtained a legal interest from
an adjoining property owner to provide yard areas which are equivalent to those required — such legal
interest to be properly recorded, to
be of appropriate duration and to be
filed with the Division of Building
and Housing prior to issuance of a
Building Permit;
(2) no windows for residential
uses are located in any side of the
building where the required yard
area is not provided; or
(3) development of a structure on
an adjoining property, so as to block
adequate light and air to windows
for residential uses, is made infeasible by topography, natural features or other factors identified by
the Board.
(h) Area Regulations. Regulations
of Section 355.04 regarding “minimum lot area per dwelling unit” and
the ratio of “maximum gross floor
area to lot area” shall not apply in
Downtown Residential (DR) Districts.
(i) Nonconforming Uses and Buildings. Legally established nonconforming uses located in a Downtown
Residential (DR) District may be
continued in accordance with the
regulations of Chapter 359 of the
Zoning Code. In addition, within a
DR District, any building which
does not meet the minimum require-

The City Record
ment for proportion of floor area in
residential use shall be governed by
the
following
regulations
with
regard to changes in use:
(1) Any existing non-residential
use may be replaced by any use permitted in the DR District, without
action by the Board of Zoning
Appeals.
(2) Any vacant space in which the
immediate prior use was non-residential may be occupied by any use
permitted in the DR District, without action by the Board of Zoning
Appeals.

335.02 of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended

An emergency resolution urging
Rini-Rego Stop-N-Shop Corporation
to terminate their lease option at
Puritas Plaza or to sublease the
building to another supermarket
chain willing to place its operations
at Puritas Plaza.
Whereas, the Rini-Rego Stop-NShop Corporation (“Rini-Rego”) has
operated a supermarket in Puritas
Plaza over the last several years
selling perishable and non-perishable goods to neighborhood residents; and
Whereas,
Rini-Rego
recently
announced that it would relocate
their
supermarket
from
Puritas
Plaza to West 138th Street and
Lorain; and
Whereas, on March 1, 1997, the
building that housed the supermarket at Puritas Plaza became vacant;
and
Whereas, Rini-Rego has renewed
its lease on this vacant building for
another five years, even though it
has relocated its supermarket; and
Whereas, since Rini-Rego still
holds the lease to the building, no
other supermarket chain can place
its operations inside of the building
without authorization from RiniRego; and
Whereas, the existence of RiniRego’s vacant building in Puritas
Plaza could decrease the property
values of neighboring properties
and increase the risk of arson and
vandalism, as well as blight, to this
commercial retail district; and
Whereas, since no other supermarket exists in the vicinity of the
Bellaire-Puritas neighborhood, the
loss of the Puritas Plaza store will
create tremendous inconvenience to
the many elderly citizens in the
community who do not have access
to transportation to shop at a supermarket outside their neighborhood
boundary, as well as to a significant
number of neighborhood WIC recipients, who will have to travel to
another supermarket outside their
community to receive perishable
goods in exchange for food stamp
coupons; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health

20
or safety in that the loss of the Puritas Plaza supermarket will cause
immediate hardship to the BellairePuritas neighborhood; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
strongly urges Rini-Rego Stop-NShop Corporation to allow another
supermarket chain to sublease the
building at the Puritas Plaza location or terminate its existing lease
in order to allow another supermarket chain to place one of its stores
at the Puritas Plaza location.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to the corporate officers of Rini-Rego Stop-NShop Corporation.
Section 3. That this resolution is
