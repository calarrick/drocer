VETO
File No. 877-96-A.
April 3, 1997
Council President Jay Westbrook
Cleveland City Council
601 Lakeside Avenue - Room 216
Cleveland, Ohio 44114
Dear Council President Westbrook:
I am returning Ordinance No. 87796, passed by City Council on March

4
24, 1997, pertaining to the rezoning
of the Davenport Bluffs with my
veto endorsed thereon.
I regret that I am forced to veto
this ordinance. In almost eight
years, I have vetoed more than
seven pieces of legislation and as
all Mayors have before me, I reserve
exercise of the veto power for only
the
most
extraordinary
circumstances. This is one of those situations. I am hopeful that City Council will use my veto as a constructive opportunity to pause and revisit the consequences of the Council’s
passage
of
the
above-referenced
ordinance.
There is no defensible public policy rationale to support the passage
of this ordinance. As my staff
repeatedly stated to Council’s Planning Committee on March 24, 1997,
we expect to plan for the area
bounded by East 13th Street, East
18th Street, the Conrail tracks and
St. Clair Avenue.
This Administration continues to
believe that it would be unwise and
not in the public interest for Council to even consider passing an ordinance to rezone a segment of this
area when a complete analysis of
the entire area will be available
within 1-2 months. Although the
Planning Committee dwelled upon
the property owner’s desire for an
answer on his development proposal, I do not think the citizens of
Cleveland expect to see their elected
officials
accommodate
that
owner’s scheme to the detriment of
the public’s interest in the comprehensive redevelopment of this key
lakefront planning area.
The piecemeal approach embodied
in Ordinance No. 877-96 is not cured
and, in fact, is only exacerbated by
Council’s introduction of Ordinance
No. 453-97 which would extend the
Public Land Protective District to a
part (but not all) of the Davenport
Bluffs.
The
additional
Planning
Commission review for the property
located in that District would be
frustrated by reason of Council’s
erosion of the very planning principles upon which such review is normally based.
The Davenport Bluffs site is one
of two key areas (the other being
the area surrounding the Greyhound
Bus Terminal on Chester Avenue)
that form the eastern boundary of
our downtown. Each area requires
careful planning coupled with a
serious examination of redevelopment opportunities. If we shun those
opportunities and instead pass expedient, landowner-driven, piecemeal
rezoning ordinances, we are foreclosing important public options.
In the case of the approval of
Ordinance No. 877-96:
• Did the Council ask whether
options to extend the Waterfront
Line are now foreclosed?
• Did the Council ask how the
Convention Center (existing or renovated or new) would be impacted
by new hotels at Davenport Bluffs?
• Did the Council ask how the
landowner's proposal would impact
the possibility of redeveloping the
entire plan area (as opposed to the
landowner’s specific property)?
• Did the Council ask how this
rezoning would promote (or, more
likely preclude) the general public’s
access to Cleveland’s lakefront?
These questions were not asked.
They should be asked. The property should not be rezoned until these
questions are answered to the satisfaction of the electorate to which we
are all held accountable.

The City Record
I understand that some members
of the planning Committee were critical of the eminent domain process
and the “threat” of eminent domain.
Some perspective on this issue is
required. Like any governmental
power, eminent domain can be harmful when misused. Yet, Cleveland’s
history over the last ten years is
filled with examples of judicious
use of this power for the public
good. The Gateway project and the
significant housing and retail development in the adjacent Prospect and
Huron area, could not have been
achieved without the adoption of a
community development plan and
the City’s commitment to use eminent domain if necessary.
At the neighborhood level, community development plans (coupled
with the City’s commitment to use
eminent domain if necessary to remedy blighted conditions) were essential elements in impact projects
such as Church Square, Beacon
Place, Brooklyn Town Centre and
the George V. Voinovich Safety Center at East 152nd and St. Clair. All
of these actions were taken by my
predecessor and unopposed by the
City Council at the time.
At a smaller level, our use of eminent domain on a used-car lot in
your ward, Mr. President, enabled us
to construct sorely needed parking
for businesses on Lorain Avenue.
I
believe
that
our
planning
process for the Davenport Bluffs is
consistent with the approach we
took on these exemplary downtown
and neighborhood projects.
For all of these reasons, I hope
City Council will utilize the exercise
of my veto correctly as an opportunity to reconsider the approval of
Ordinance No. 877-96.
Thank you for your attention to
this important land use issue.
Sincerely,
Michael R. White
Mayor

Coats.
An emergency resolution requesting United States Senators Glenn
and
DeWine
and
Congressman
Stokes to investigate the Nuclear
Regulatory
Commission’s
actions
with respect to Advanced Medical
Systems license request in connection with its London Road facility.
Whereas, it has come to the attention
of
the
City
of
Cleveland
(“Cleveland”) that Advanced Medical
Systems
Inc.
(“AMS”)
has
applied to the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (“NRC”) to amend its
license to allow the “free” release of
ground/surface water that collects
in the foundation drainage system
of AMS’s London Road facility in
the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, based on information
Cleveland has received and over
Cleveland’s strong objections, Cleveland believes that the NRC is most
likely to grant AMS’s request to
amend its license, which will permit
the “free” release of ground/surface
water into the combined storm/sanitary sewer without requiring testing be performed prior to any discharge; and
Whereas, Cleveland desires that
testing be required to be performed
prior to discharge into the combined
storm/sanitary sewer to confirm
that levels of Cobalt 60 do not
exceed the levels set forth in the
Settlement Order issued in the federal court case recently settled by
the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer
District and AMS; and
Whereas, it is the desire of this
Council to request United States Senators Glenn and DeWine and Congressman Stokes require a federal
investigation into the NRC’s conduct
with
respect
to
AMS’s
license
request (USNRC License No. 3419089-01) to insure to the citizens of
Cleveland that all steps are being
taken to prevent a health or safety
risk to the community or to the environment;
Now, therefore, be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
request United States Senators John
Glenn and Mike DeWine and Con-

April 9, 1997
gressman Stokes take all necessary
steps to require the appropriate federal agency or agencies undertake a
federal
investigation
into
the
Nuclear
Regulatory
Commission’s
conduct
and
proceedings
with
respect to Advanced Medical System’s request to amend its license to
permit
the
“free”
release
of
ground/surface water that collects
in the foundation drainage system
of AMS’s London Road facility located in the City of Cleveland.

correspondence to Roy J. Caniano,
Deputy Director U. S. Regulatory
Commission Region III, dated April
4, 1997, to United States Senators
John Glenn and Mike DeWine, Congressman Louis Stokes and Deputy
Director Caniano.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
