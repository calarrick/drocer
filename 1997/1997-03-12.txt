Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to

substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and

Liquor Control within 30 days of

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 351-97.
By Councilman Lewis.
An emergency resolution withdrawing objection to the transfer of
ownership of a C1 and C2 Liquor
Permit to 8802-06 Superior Avenue,
and
repealing
Res.
No.
2056-96,
objecting to said transfer of ownership, pursuant to a Cooperation
Agreement signed February 18, 1997.
Whereas, this Council objected to
the renewal of a C1 and C2 Liquor
Permit to 8802-06 Superior Avenue
by Res. No. 2056-96, adopted November 18, 1996; and
Whereas, this Council wishes to
withdraw its objection to the above
transfer of ownership and consents
to said transfer of ownership based
upon and pursuant to a Cooperation
Agreement signed February 18, 1997,
a copy of which is in the file for
this address in the City Law Department; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That objection to the
transfer of ownership of a C1 and
C2X Liquor Permit to 8802-06 Superior Avenue be and the same is
hereby withdrawn and Res. No. 205696, containing said objection, be and
the same is hereby repealed and
that this Council consents to the
immediate transfer of ownership
thereof.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted March 3, 1997.
Effective March 11, 1997 without
the signature of the Mayor.
Res. No. 352-97.
By Councilman Sweeney.
An emergency resolution urging
Rini-Rego Stop-N-Shop Corporation
to terminate their lease option at
Puritas Plaza or to sublease the
building to another supermarket
chain willing to place its operations
at Puritas Plaza.
Whereas, the Rini-Rego Stop-NShop Corporation (“Rini-Rego”) has
operated a supermarket in Puritas
Plaza over the last several years
selling perishable and non-perishable goods to neighborhood residents; and
Whereas,
Rini-Rego
recently
announced that it would relocate
their
supermarket
from
Puritas
Plaza to West 138th Street and
Lorain; and
Whereas, on March 1, 1997, the
building that housed the supermarket at Puritas Plaza became vacant;
and
Whereas, Rini-Rego has renewed
its lease on this vacant building for

March 12, 1997
another five years, even though it
has relocated its supermarket; and
Whereas, since Rini-Rego still
holds the lease to the building, no
other supermarket chain can place
its operations inside of the building
without authorization from RiniRego; and
Whereas, the existence of RiniRego’s vacant building in Puritas
Plaza could decrease the property
values of neighboring properties
and increase the risk of arson and
vandalism, as well as blight, to this
commercial retail district; and
Whereas, since no other supermarket exists in the vicinity of the
Bellaire-Puritas neighborhood, the
loss of the Puritas Plaza store will
create tremendous inconvenience to
the many elderly citizens in the
community who do not have access
to transportation to shop at a supermarket outside their neighborhood
boundary, as well as to a significant
number of neighborhood WIC recipients, who will have to travel to
another supermarket outside their
community to receive perishable
goods in exchange for food stamp
coupons; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that the loss of the Puritas Plaza supermarket will cause
immediate hardship to the BellairePuritas neighborhood; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
strongly urges Rini-Rego Stop-NShop Corporation to allow another
supermarket chain to sublease the
building at the Puritas Plaza location or terminate its existing lease
in order to allow another supermarket chain to place one of its stores
at the Puritas Plaza location.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to the corporate officers of Rini-Rego Stop-NShop Corporation.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted March 3, 1997.
Effective March 11, 1997.
Ord. No. 160-97.

Rybka and Westbrook (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the sale of real property as part

Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has elected to adopt and implement
the procedures under Chapter 5722
of the Ohio Revised Code to facilitate reutilization of nonproductive
lands situated within the City of
Cleveland; and
Whereas, real property acquired
under the City’s Land Reutilization
Program is acquired, held, administered and disposed of by the City of
Cleveland through its Department of
Community Development under the
terms of Chapter 5722 of the Ohio

The City Record
Revised Code and Section 183.021 of
Codified Ordinances of the City of
