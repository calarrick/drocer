ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
REPRINT
Ord. No. 2215-96.
By Councilman Rybka (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance to enact
Sections 325.121 and 347.15 of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, and to amend Sections
337.10, 343.01, 343.11, 345.01, 345.02
and 345.03, as enacted by various
ordinances, all relating to correctional halfway houses.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
hereby supplemented by enacting
new Sections 325.121 and 347.15 thereof to read, respectively, as follows:
Section 325.121 Correctional Halfway House
“Correctional
halfway
house”
means a premises which provides
room and board and correctional
oversight, pursuant to a contract to
provide those services for the Federal Bureau of Prisons or the Ohio
Department of Rehabilitation and
Corrections or the Cuyahoga County
Court of Common Pleas Department
of Probation or any other governmental entity with jurisdiction to
provide
correctional
services,
to
adults who have been assigned to
such facility by either a governmental authority or a court of law.
Such premises may be one building
or a grouping of buildings located
on contiguous properties.
Section 347.15 Correctional Halfway Houses
Correctional halfway houses, as
defined in Section 325.121, shall be
permitted only in accordance with
the following regulations and other
applicable regulations of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland.
(a) Purpose. The regulations of
this section are intended to provide
suitable locations for residential
institutions which assist in enabling
individuals to live independently,
productively and lawfully as members of the larger community, following a period of incarceration or
following a conviction for criminal
activity. These regulations are also
intended to ensure that such institutions are operated in a manner
which serves the best interests of
their residents, while protecting the
safety of residents living in nearly
neighborhoods.
(b) Certificate of Occupancy. No
correctional halfway house shall be
established
or
expanded
before
issuance by the Commissioner of
Building and Housing of a Certificate of Occupancy. The Commissioner shall issue such Certificate
only after approval by the Board of
Zoning Appeals, as required in division (c) of this section.

12
(c) Board of Zoning Appeals
Approval. No Certificate of Occupancy for establishment or expansion of a correctional halfway house
shall be issued without approval of
such application by the Board of
Zoning Appeals, after public notice
and a public hearing. In order to
ensure compatibility between a proposed correctional halfway house, or
expansion thereof, and surrounding
properties, the Board may require
modifications to a proposal as a condition of its approval. The Board
shall determine the suitability of a
proposed
correctional
halfway
house, or expansion thereof, at a
particular location, through consideration of, among others, the following factors.
(1) conformance of the proposal to
the requirements of this section and
to other applicable regulations of
the City’s Codified Ordinances;
(2) the record of the proposed
operator in managing similar facilities; and
(3) the size of the proposed facility as it affects potential over-concentration of a correctional system
population in the immediate vicinity.
(d) Permitted Locations. Correctional halfway houses shall be
allowed in General Retail Business,
Residence-Industry and Semi-Industry zoning districts, in accordance
with all applicable regulations.
(1) Separation Standards. No correctional halfway house shall be
established on a lot or lots within
five hundred (500) feet of a Residential zoning district nor within
five hundred (500) feet of the lot or
lots occupied by a playground, public park, public recreation center,
church or similar place of worship,
public library, pre-school, day-care
center, kindergarten, special education center, or primary or secondary
school, measured in accordance with
the standards of division (d)(3) of
this section. Specifically, however,
along the rear lot line of a property to be occupied by a correctional
halfway house, this separation standard may be waived by the Board
of Zoning Appeals, if, in the determination of the Board, adequate
fencing, buffer areas and/or other
barriers are in place or will be put
in place to screen and separate the
adjoining properties, and to prevent
access between the properties.
(2) Spacing Standard. No correctional halfway house shall be established on a lot or lots within two
thousand (2,000) feet of a lot or lots
occupied by another such facility
measured in accordance with the
standards of division (d)(3) of this
section. Furthermore, not more than
two (2) correctional halfway houses
shall be located in any Police District.
(3) Measurement Standard. In all
instances where this section requires
separation or spacing by a specified
distance, such distance shall be measured in a geometrically straight line
which represents the shortest distance between the lot or lots accommodating the proposed correctional
halfway house and the lot or lots or
zoning district from which the correctional halfway house is to be separated. Such measurement shall be
made using a scaled map, or a survey if deemed necessary, and shall
be made without regard to intervening structures, objects, uses, the
street grid, landforms, waterways, or
any other topographic feature.
(e) Licensing and Supervision. All
correctional halfway houses operating in the City of Cleveland shall
have all required licenses, including
any required for operation of a correctional
halfway
house.
On-site
supervision by qualified staff shall

The City Record
be provided for all hours during
which residents are on the premises. Security measures shall be sufficient to protect the safety of residents and other citizens in the vicinity of the facility.
(f) Floor Area and Occupancy
Standards. A minimum of two hundred (200) square feet of habitable
floor area shall be provided, on average, for each resident of a correctional halfway house, including staff
members normally on the premises
after 11:00 p.m. A maximum of one
hundred (100) residents subject to
correctional
oversight
shall
be
accommodated at any correctional
halfway
house.
No
correctional
halfway house may operate with a
total resident population of less than
twenty (20) persons, which twenty
persons may include individuals not
subject to correctional oversight.
(g) Parking. A minimum of one
off-street parking space shall be provided for every three residents of a
correctional halfway house, plus one
space for each staff person on duty
during the largest shift. Such spaces
shall be provided either on or directly adjacent to the property occupied
by the facility.
(h) Excluded Residents. Correctional halfway houses shall not
admit or
accommodate residents
who, at the time of their admission
or at any time during their stay,
exhibit a pattern of violent behavior,
nor shall correctional halfway houses admit or accommodate residents
who have been convicted of any of
the following crimes: murder, rape
or felony crimes against children.
(i) Revocation of Certificate. The
Commissioner of Building and Housing shall revoke the Certificate of
Occupancy issued to a correctional
halfway house if it is determined
that the facility is no longer licensed
as required in this section or if compliance with City regulations or with
requirements of the Board of Zoning
Appeals is not maintained.
(j) Application. An application for
a Certificate of Occupancy for a correctional
halfway
house
shall
include the following information,
in addition to such information and
drawings otherwise required under
these Codified Ordinances.
(1) The name, address and telephone number of the operator, the
agency holding the required State
