A majority affirmative vote is necessary for passage.
Shall Section 33-1 be enacted to
prohibit Council from enacting an
ordinance or resolution or section
thereof granting or consenting to an
exemption from taxation for real or
tangible personal property (including
without

any

abatement, tax increment financing,
or other financing arrangement),
the effect of which is to diminish
revenue that the Cleveland City
School District General Fund would
otherwise receive from an increase
in the fair market value of property because of new construction, renovations, or additions, unless the
same ordinance, resolution, or sec-

tion thereof requires the owner of
the improvement or the City of
Cleveland or the owner and the City
together, to reimburse in a timely
manner the Cleveland City School
District General Fund for the full
amount of property taxes that would
have been payable to the Cleveland
City School District had the improvement not been exempted from taxation, dollar for dollar, with payments to be due and legally enforceable at the same time and in the
same manner as the taxes that they
purport to replace. This limitation
shall not apply to ordinances or resolutions or sections thereof solely
for the benefit of owner occupied
property improved by new construction, renovations, or additions of single and/or double houses for a period not to exceed seven (7) years.
Section 7. That for the reasons
stated in the preamble hereto which
is made a part hereof this ordinance
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage by the
affirmative
vote
of
two-thirds
(2/3rds) of the members elected to
Council.
Referred to Director of Law; Committee on Finance.
Ord. No. 851-97.
By Councilmen Britt, Jackson,
Rybka and Westbrook (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Economic Development to enter into an Enterprise

5709 of the Ohio Revised Code; and
Whereas, in August, 1995, the
Director of Development of the State

Whereas,
Uptown

Corp.
(the
“Enterprise”) has proposed to rehabilitate
a professional building located at
11211-11955 Shaker Boulevard in the
City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, the Enterprise has certified to the City that, but for abatement of real estate taxes the Enterprise would be at a competitive disadvantage by operating at this location; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure in that
the same provides for the immediate
preservation of the public peace,
safety, property, and welfare and
for the further reason that its enactment is a necessary prerequisite to
providing immediate assistance to
create and preserve job opportunities and advance and promote commercial and economic development
in the City of Cleveland, such assistance being immediately necessary
or such jobs will be lost; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

located at 11211-11955 Shaker Boulevard in Cleveland, Ohio; said abatement shall be subject to annual

Section 3. That the terms of said

are hereby appropriated for the purposes set forth in Chapter 5709 of
the Revised Code. Such fees shall be
deposited to and expended from
Fund No. 17 SF 305, Loan Fees Fund.
Section 5. That the Director of
Law shall prepare and approve said
agreement and that said agreement
shall contain such terms and provisions as he deems necessary to protect the City’s interest.
Section 6. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period

1976, as amended, respectively, by
Ordinance Nos. 1463-91, passed June
17, 1991, and 1205-94, passed June 13,
1994, relating to adult entertainment
and to amusement and recreation
uses; and to supplement said codified ordinances by enacting new
Section 331.04 thereof relating to
measurement.
Whereas, numerous cities have
studied the effects of adult entertainment uses on the neighborhoods
and areas in which those uses are
located; and
Whereas, File No. _____ contains
copies of the “Adult Entertainment
Study” dated November 1994 conducted by the New York City
Department
of
Planning;
“Adult
Entertainment Businesses in Indianapolis, An Analysis” dated 1984
conducted by the Department of Metropolitan Development of the City of
Indianapolis; and the “Report of the
Attorney General’s Working Group
on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses’’ dated June 6, 1989
conducted by the Attorney General
for the State of Minnesota; and
Whereas, the “Adult Entertainment Study” of the City of New York
contains summaries of impact studies from the cities of Islip, New
York; Los Angeles, California; Indianapolis, Indiana; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; and Phoenix,
Arizona; along with Manatee County, Florida; New Hanover County,
North Carolina; and the State of Minnesota; and
Whereas, these numerous studies
conclude, based on documented evidence, that adult entertainment uses
have negative secondary effects
such
as
increased
crime
rates,
decreased property values, curtailed
retail trade and the deterioration of

667

15
the quality of urban life; and
Whereas, this Council finds that
the evidence presented and conclusions found in these studies are relevant to the City of Cleveland’s
experience with adult entertainment
uses; and
Whereas, this Council finds that
in Cleveland adult entertainment
uses
have
negative
secondary
effects on the areas surrounding
their locations; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
desires to restrict the impact of
these negative secondary effects by
regulating the location of adult
entertainment uses by preventing
their
concentration
and
location
near certain sensitive uses; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

(a) Purpose. Based upon evidence
and findings of negative secondary
effects of adult entertainment uses
presented in hearings before the
Council and in studies from other
communities, including the cities of
Indianapolis and New York, the
Council finds that adult entertainment uses in Cleveland cause negative secondary effects and has created this section to regulate adult
entertainment uses to promote the
health, safety, morals and general
welfare of the citizens of Cleveland
by establishing, reasonable and, uniform regulations to prevent concentration of adult entertainment uses
and location near specified other
uses. The provisions of this section
have neither the purpose nor effect
