from
the
immediately
preceding
Interest Accretion Date to the date
of determination to (D) the total
number of days from that immediately preceding Interest Accretion
Date to the immediately succeeding
Interest Accretion Date; provided,
however, that in determining the
Compound Accreted Amount of a
Capital Appreciation Bond as of a
date prior to the first Interest Accretion Date, the Closing Date shall be
deemed to be the immediately preceding Interest Accretion Date and
the original principal amount of
that Bond shall be deemed to be the
Compound Accreted Amount on the
Closing Date.
“Continuing Disclosure Certificate”
means the certificate authorized by
Section 14 which, together with the
agreements of the City set forth in

continuing
disclosure

(b) General. The Bonds shall be
issued in one lot and only as fully
registered Bonds. The Bonds shall
be dated as of the date established
by the Director of Finance in the
Final Terms Certificate, which date
shall not be later than October 1,
2000. In accordance with his determination of the best interest of and

The City Record
financial advantages to the City, the
Director of Finance may designate
in the Final Terms Certificate certain maturities of the Bonds as
“Capital Appreciation Bonds” with
the remaining maturities designated
as the “Current Interest Bonds,” as
further described in this Ordinance.
(c) Interest and Denominations.
The Current Interest Bonds, if any,
shall be issued in an aggregate principal amount as established by the
Director of Finance in the Final
Terms Certificate, and shall be
issued in denominations of $5,000 or
any integral multiple thereof, but in
no case as to a particular maturity
date exceeding the principal amount
of Current Interest Bonds maturing
on that date. The Current Interest
Bonds shall bear the rate or rates
of interest per year (computed on a
360-day per year basis) as shall be
specified by the Director of Finance
(subject to the parameters set forth
hereafter in this Section) in the
Final Terms Certificate; provided,
that the Current Interest Bonds of
any one stated maturity all shall
bear the same rate of interest. Interest on the Current Interest Bonds
shall be payable at such rate or
rates semiannually (the CIB Interest Payment Dates), commencing no
later than December 1, 2001, until
the principal amount has been paid
or provided for. The Current Interest Bonds shall bear interest from
the most recent date to which interest has been paid or provided for or,
if no interest has been paid or provided for, from their date.
The Capital Appreciation Bonds, if
any, shall be issued in an aggregate
principal amount set forth in the
Final Terms Certificate, shall bear
interest from the Closing Date at
the compounding rate or rates of
interest (computed on a 360-day per
year basis), accrued and compounded on each Interest Accretion Date
and payable at maturity, which will
result in the aggregate Maturity
Amounts payable at maturity, as
shall be determined by the Director
of Finance (subject to the parameters set forth hereafter in this Section) in the Final Terms Certificate;
provided, that the Capital Appreciation Bonds of any one stated maturity all shall bear the same compounding rate of interest. The total
interest accrued on any Capital
Appreciation Bond as of any particular date shall be an amount equal
to the amount by which the Compound Accreted Amount of that Capital Appreciation Bond exceeds the
original principal amount of that
Capital Appreciation Bond as of that
date. Capital Appreciation Bonds
shall
be
issued
in
Authorized
Denominations, but in no case as to
a particular maturity date exceeding the principal amount maturing
on that date.
The rate or rates of interest per
year to be borne by the Bonds, as
specified by the Director of Finance
in the Final Terms Certificate, shall
be such that the Bonds (taking into
account the Current Interest Bonds
and the Capital Appreciation Bonds,
if any) shall have a True Interest
Rate (as hereinafter defined) not
exceeding 10% per year, provided
that if the interest rate is not to be
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, the True
Interest Rate shall not exceed 12%.
As used in this paragraph, “True
Interest Rate” means the rate determined by doubling the semi-annual
interest rate, computed semi-annually, necessary to discount all pay-

908

June 11, 1997
ments of principal and interest on
the Bonds to the purchase price of
the Bonds, exclusive of any accrued
interest.
(d) Principal Maturities. Notwithstanding and as an exception to any
prior ordinance passed by this Council, the Bonds shall mature or be
payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements (as hereinafter defined and
described) as specified in the Final
Terms Certificate on the Principal
Payment Dates in the principal
amounts such that the total principal and interest payments on the
Bonds in any fiscal year in which
principal is payable (beginning with
the second such fiscal year) will not
be more than three times the total
of the principal and interest payments in the immediately preceding
year.
Consistent with the foregoing and
in accordance with his determination of the best interest of and
financial advantages to the City, the
Director of Finance shall specify in
the Final Terms Certificate (i) the
principal amount of Bonds, if any,
maturing or payable pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements on each Principal
Payment Date, (ii) the Principal
Payment Date or Dates, if any, on
which Bonds not subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption (Serial Bonds) shall mature; (iii) the
Principal Payment Date or Dates, if
any, on which Bonds subject to
mandatory sinking fund redemption
(Term Bonds) shall be stated to
mature; (iv) the Principal Payment
Date or Dates on which any Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption (Mandatory Redemption Dates) and (v) the
number of annual Principal Payment Dates (not to exceed 30).
(e) Redemption. The Bonds shall
be subject to redemption prior to
stated maturity as follows:
(i)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption of Term Bonds. Term
Bonds, if any, shall be subject to
mandatory redemption in part by lot
and be redeemed pursuant to mandatory sinking fund requirements, at a
redemption price of 100% of the
principal amount of any Current
Interest Bonds or the Compounded
Accreted
Value
of
any
Capital
Appreciation Bonds redeemed, plus
accrued interest to the redemption
date, on the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Dates and in the principal amounts payable on those
Dates for which provision is made
above (such Dates and amounts, the
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements).
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Registrar (as
defined in Section 4 of this Ordinance) for payment of principal of
and interest on Term Bonds on each
Mandatory Redemption Date shall
include an amount sufficient to
redeem on that Date the principal
amount of Term Bonds payable on
that Date pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements (less the amount of any credit as provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar for cancellation Term Bonds in any aggregate
principal amount and to receive a
credit against the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption obligation) of the City for Term Bonds
stated to mature on the same Principal Payment Date as the Term

June 11, 1997
Bonds so delivered. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth day preceding
the applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, by furnishing the Registrar a certificate, signed by the
Director of Finance, setting forth
the extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement for Term Bonds
stated to mature on the same Principal Payment Date. If the certificate is not timely furnished to the
Registrar, the applicable Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds which
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the applicable Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements) or
purchased for cancellation and canceled by the Registrar, to the extent
not applied theretofore as a credit
against
any
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement for
Term Bonds stated to mature on the
same Principal Payment Date as the
Term Bonds so redeemed or purchased and canceled.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Registrar at 100% of the principal amount thereof against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) for Term Bonds stated
to mature on the same Principal
Payment Date as the Term Bonds so
delivered, redeemed or purchased
and canceled. Any excess of that
amount
over
the
then
current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement shall be credited
against any subsequent Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements (and corresponding mandatory redemption obligations) for Term
Bonds stated to mature on that Principal Payment Date, in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(ii) Optional Redemption. If provided by the Director of Finance in
the Final Terms Certificate, the Current Interest Bonds shall be subject
to redemption by and at the sole
option of the City, in whole or in
part in integral multiples of $5,000,
on the dates, in the years and at the
redemption prices (expressed as a
percentage of the principal amount
to be redeemed), plus accrued interest to the redemption date, as determined by the Director of Finance in
the Final Terms Certificate; provided that the earliest optional redemption date shall not be earlier than
December 1, 2007 and shall not be
later than December 1, 2011, and the
redemption price for the earliest
optional redemption date shall not
be greater than 103%.
If optional redemption of Term
Bonds at a redemption price exceeding 100% of the principal amount to
be redeemed is to take place as of
any Mandatory Redemption Date
applicable to those Term Bonds, the
Term Bonds, or portions thereof, to
be redeemed optionally shall be
selected by lot prior to the selection
by lot of the Term Bonds of the
same maturity to be redeemed on
the same date by operation of the
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements. Bonds to be

The City Record
redeemed pursuant to this paragraph shall be redeemed only upon
written notice from the Director of
Finance to the Registrar, given
upon the direction of this Council by
adoption of a resolution or passage
of an Ordinance. That notice shall
specify the redemption date and the
principal amount of each maturity
of Bonds to be redeemed, and shall
be given at least 45 days prior to
the redemption date or such shorter
period as shall be acceptable to the
Registrar.
(iii) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for optional redemption at
one time and Bonds of more than
one maturity are then outstanding,
the Bonds that are called shall be
called as selected by, and selected
in a manner determined by, the City.
If fewer than all of the Bonds of a
single maturity are to be redeemed,
the selection of Bonds of that maturity to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by lot in a manner determined
by the Registrar. In the case of a
partial redemption of Bonds by lot
when
Bonds
of
denominations
greater than $5,000 are then outstanding, each $5,000 unit of principal thereof shall be treated as if it
were a separate Bond of the denomination of $5,000. If it is determined
that one or more, but not all, of the
$5,000 units of principal amount represented by a Bond are to be called
for redemption, then, upon notice of
redemption of a $5,000 unit or units,
the registered owner of that Bond
shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i) for payment of the redemption price of the $5,000 unit or units
of
principal
amount
called
for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption and any
premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner, of a new Bond or Bonds of
any
authorized
denomination
or
denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unmatured and unredeemed portion of,
and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(iv) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least 30
days prior to the date fixed for
redemption, to the registered owner
of each Bond subject to redemption
in whole or in part at the registered
owner’s address shown on the Bond
Register (as defined in Section 6 of
this Ordinance) maintained by the
Registrar at the close of business on
the fifteenth day preceding that
mailing. Failure to receive notice by
mail or any defect in that notice
regarding any Bond, however, shall
not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any
Bond.
(v) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
In the event that notice of redemption shall have been given by the
Registrar to the registered owners
as provided above, there shall be

909

13
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, moneys that, in addition to any other
moneys available therefor and held
by the Registrar, will be sufficient
to redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus accrued interest to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice
of
redemption
has
been
given.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph hereof, the Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due and payable
on the redemption date, and, subject
to Section 5 of this Ordinance, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the
redemption price, plus accrued interest to the redemption date. If moneys for the redemption of all of the
Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with accrued
interest thereon to the redemption
date, are held by the Registrar on
the redemption date, so as to be
available therefor on that date and,
if notice of redemption has been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
those moneys shall not be so available on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All moneys
held
by
the
Registrar
for
the
redemption of particular Bonds shall
be held in trust for the account of
the registered owners thereof and
shall be paid to them, respectively,
upon presentation and surrender of
those Bonds.
Section 3. Execution of Bonds. The
Bonds shall be signed by the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, in the
name of the City and in their official capacities, provided that either
or both of those signatures may be
a facsimile, and shall bear the seal
of the City or a facsimile thereof.
Pursuant to Section 83 of the City’s
Charter, the Director of Law shall
prepare the Bonds and shall endorse
thereon her approval of the form
and correctness by her manual or
facsimile signature. The Bonds shall
be issued in the denominations and
numbers as requested by the original purchaser and approved by the
Director of Finance, shall be numbered as determined by the Director
of Finance, and shall express upon
their faces the purpose, in summary
terms, for which they are issued and
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance. No Bond shall be valid
or obligatory for any purpose or
shall be entitled to any security or
benefit under the Bond Proceedings
unless and until the certificate of
authentication printed on the Bond
is signed by the Registrar (as
defined in Section 4) as authenticating agent. Authentication by the
Registrar shall be conclusive evidence that the Bond so authenticated has been duly issued, signed and
delivered under, and is entitled to
the security and benefit of, the Bond
Proceedings.
The
certificate
of
authentication may be signed by
any authorized officer or employee
of the Registrar or by any other person acting as an agent of the Registrar and approved by the Director

14
of Finance on behalf of the City.
The same person need not sign the
certificate of authentication on all
of the Bonds.
Section 4. Registrar. The Director
of Finance shall designate a bank
or trust company to act as the
authenticating
agent,
registrar,
transfer agent and paying agent for
the Bonds and, if Notes are issued
that
mature
more
than
twelve
months from their date of issuance,
for such Notes (the Registrar) after
determining that the payment at
that bank or trust company will not
endanger the funds or securities of
the City and that proper procedures
and safeguards are available for
that
purpose.
The
Director
of
Finance shall sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
a Registrar Agreement between the
City and the Registrar (the Registrar Agreement) in substantially the
form as is now on the file with the
Clerk of Council in File No. 1090-97A. The Registrar Agreement is
approved,
together
with
any
changes or amendments that are not
inconsistent with this ordinance and
not substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the Registrar Agreement or amendments to
the Registrar Agreement. The Director of Finance shall provide for the
payment of the services rendered
and for reimbursement of expenses
incurred pursuant to the Registrar
Agreement from the proceeds of the
Bonds or Notes, as applicable, and
to the extent available, and then
from other money lawfully available
and appropriated or to be appropriated for that purpose.
Section
5.
Payment
of
Debt
Charges. The debt charges on the
Bonds shall be payable in lawful
money of the United States of America without deduction for the services of the Registrar as paying
agent. Principal and any premium
on the Current Interest Bonds shall
be payable when due upon presentation and surrender of the Bonds at
the principal corporate trust office
of the Registrar. Interest on a Current Interest Bond shall be paid on
each CIB Interest Payment Date by
check or draft mailed to the person
in whose name the Bond was registered, and to that person’s address
appearing, on the Bond Register (as
defined in Section 6) at the close of
business on the 15th day of the calendar month next preceding that
Interest Payment Date (the Record
Date). The debt charges on the Capital Appreciation Bonds shall be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Capital Appreciation Bonds at the principal corporate trust office of the Registrar.
Section 6. Transfer and Exchange
of Bonds. So long as any of the
Bonds remain outstanding, the City
will cause the Registrar to maintain
and keep at its principal corporate
trust office all books and records
necessary
for
the
registration,
exchange and transfer of Bonds as
provided in this Section (the Bond
Register). Subject to the provisions
of Section 5, the person in whose
name a Bond is registered on the
Bond Register shall be regarded as
the absolute owner of that Bond for
all purposes of the Bond Proceedings. Payment of or on account of
the debt charges on any Bond shall
be made only to or upon the order
of that person; neither the City nor
the Registrar shall be affected by

The City Record
any notice to the contrary, but the
registration may be changed as provided in this Section. All such payments shall be valid and effectual
to satisfy and discharge the City’s
liability upon the Bond, including
interest, to the extent of the amount
or amounts so paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any Authorized Denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Bond at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner
or
by
a
person
legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
Authorized Denomination or Denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of
the
Bond
Proceedings.
The
exchange or transfer shall be without charge to the owner, except that
the City and Registrar may make a
charge sufficient to reimburse them
for any tax or other governmental
charge required to be paid with
respect to the exchange or transfer.
The City or the Registrar may
require that those charges, if any,
be paid before the procedure is
begun for the exchange or transfer.
All Bonds issued and authenticated
upon any exchange or transfer shall
be valid special obligations of the
City, evidencing the same debt, and
entitled to the same security and
benefit under the Bond Proceedings,
as the Bonds surrendered upon that
exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be in the best interests of and financially advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
book entry interests in Bonds and
the principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
book entry interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and

910

June 11, 1997
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record
ownership
of
beneficial
interests in Bonds or the principal
and interest, and to effect transfers
of Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized, (i) the
Bonds may be issued in the form of
a single, fully registered Bond representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the book entry
interest owners in book entry form
shall have no right to receive Bonds
in the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of book
entry interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
book entry interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for
transfer to another Depository or to
another nominee of a Depository,
without further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Director of Finance, after
making provision for notification of
the book entry interest owners by
the then Depository and any other
arrangements
deemed
necessary,
shall permit withdrawal of the
Bonds from the Depository, and
authenticate and deliver note certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 7. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking
Fund and, if not purchased by such
Trustees, shall be offered to the
Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased by
such Account, shall be sold to A.G.
Edwards & Sons, Inc., SBK-Brooks
Investment Corp., Pryor, McClendon,
Counts & Co., Inc., Smith Barney
Inc., Lehman Brothers and Key Capital Markets, Inc. (collectively, the
Original Purchaser); provided, however that if, in the reasonable opin-

June 11, 1997
ion of the Director of Finance, an
underwriter is incapable of fully
performing its duties or meeting its
obligations in its capacity as Original Purchaser with respect to the
Bonds, the Director of Finance is
hereby authorized and directed, in
the name of and on behalf of the
City, to take whatever actions may
be
necessary
to
terminate
that
underwriter’s standing as Original
Purchaser.
The
Bonds
shall
be
awarded to the Original Purchaser
at a purchase price of not less than
97% of par plus any accrued interest from the date of the Bonds to
the date of their delivery to the
Original Purchaser, with the principal amount of the Bonds (including
respective principal amounts of Current Interest Bonds and Capital
Appreciation Bonds), final purchase
price, interest rate or rates, annual
principal installments, Serial Bonds,
Term Bonds, Mandatory Redemption
Dates and Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements,
any
optional redemption provisions, and
such other terms and conditions, all
as set forth in the Final Terms Certificate in accordance with law and
the provisions of this Ordinance and
the
Bond
Purchase
Agreement
described below. The Director of
Finance shall sign and deliver, in
the name of and on behalf of the
City, the Bond Purchase Agreement
between the City and the Original
Purchaser in substantially the form
as the Note Purchase Agreement
now on file with the Clerk of Council and referred to below. The Bond
Purchase Agreement is approved,
together
with
any
changes
or
amendments that are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and not
substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Bond
Purchase
Agreement
or
amendments thereto. The Director of
Finance shall cause the Bonds to be
prepared and signed and delivered,
together with a true transcript of
proceedings with reference to the
issuance of the Bonds, to the Original Purchaser upon payment of the
purchase price. The Mayor, the
Clerk of Council, the Director of
Finance, the Director of Law and
other City officials, as appropriate,
are each authorized and directed to
sign
any
transcript
certificates,
financial statements and other documents and instruments, including
but not limited to interest rate
hedges, swap agreements and forward purchase agreements and to
take such actions as are necessary
or appropriate to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this
Ordinance.
Section 8. Issuance of Notes. It is
necessary for the reasons set forth

Section
9.
Payment
of
Debt
Charges; Transfer and Exchange of
Notes. The debt charges on the Notes
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America, or in
Federal Reserve funds of the United
States of America if so requested by
the Original Purchaser, and shall be
payable, without deduction for services of any paying agent, at the
office of the Paying Agent (defined
below), for Notes maturing no later
than twelve months from their date
of issuance. The Notes of each series
shall be dated the date of issuance
of the respective series and shall
mature on a date to be determined
in the Certificate of Award for the
respective series, provided that such
date shall not be later than thirtysix months from the date of issuance
of the respective series of Notes. In
the event that the Notes mature not
later than twelve months from their
date of issuance, the Director of
Finance may serve as the City’s paying agent for the Notes or the Director of Finance shall designate a
bank or trust company to serve as
the City’s paying agent (the Paying
Agent) after determining that payment at that bank or trust company
will not endanger the funds or securities of the City and that proper procedures and safeguards are available for that purpose. In the event
that the Notes mature later than
twelve months following their date
of issuance, the Notes shall be issued
only as fully registered Notes and
the Registrar designated pursuant to
Section 4 shall serve as authenticating agent, registrar, transfer agent
and paying agent for the Notes.
If agreed to by the Original Purchaser, the Notes shall be prepayable without penalty or premium
at the option of the City in whole
or in part at any time prior to maturity as provided in this Ordinance.
Prepayment prior to maturity shall
be made by deposit with the Paying Agent or Registrar of the principal amount of the Notes together
with interest accrued thereon to the
date of prepayment. The City’s
right of prepayment shall be exercised by mailing a notice of prepayment, stating the date of prepayment and the name and address
of the Paying Agent or Registrar,
by certified or registered mail to
the Original Purchaser of the Notes
not less than seven days prior to
the date of that deposit, unless that
notice is waived by the Original
Purchaser of the Notes. If money for
prepayment is on deposit with the
Paying Agent or Registrar on the
specified prepayment date following
the giving of that notice (unless the
requirement of that notice is waived
as stated above), interest on the
principal
amount
prepaid
shall
cease to accrue on the prepayment
date, and upon the request of the
Director of Finance, the Original
Purchaser
of
the
Notes
shall
arrange for the delivery of the
Notes at the designated office of the
Paying Agent or Registrar for prepayment and surrender and cancellation.

Principal on the Notes maturing
later than twelve months following
their date of issuance shall be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Notes at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar. Interest on the Notes
maturing later than twelve months
shall be paid on each interest payment date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Note was registered, and to that person’s address appearing on the Note
Register (defined in the following
paragraph), at the close of business
on the 15th day of the calendar
month next preceding that interest
payment date. So long as any of the
Notes maturing later than twelve
months following their date of
issuance remain outstanding, the
City will cause the Registrar to
maintain and keep at its principal
corporate trust office all books and
records necessary for the registration, exchange and transfer of Notes
as provided in this Section (the Note
Register). Subject to the provisions
of this Section, the person in whose
name a Note is registered on the
Note Register shall be regarded as
the absolute owner of that Note for
all purposes of the Bond Proceedings. Payment of or on account of
the debt charges on any Note shall
be made only to or upon the order
of that person; neither the City nor
the Registrar shall be affected by
any notice to the contrary, but the
registration may be changed as provided in this Section. All such payments shall be valid and effectual
to satisfy and discharge the City’s
liability upon the Note, including
interest, to the extent of the amount
or amounts so paid.
Any Note maturing later than
twelve months following their date
of issuance may be exchanged for
Notes of any Authorized Denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Note may be transferred only on
the Note Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Note at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner
or
by
a
person
legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Note or Notes of any
Authorized Denomination or Denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Note
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Notes only after the new
Notes are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Notes exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Notes
in accordance with the provisions of
the
Bond
Proceedings.
The
exchange or transfer shall be without charge to the owner, except that
the City and Registrar may make a
charge sufficient to reimburse them
for any tax or other governmental
charge required to be paid with
respect to the exchange or transfer.
The City or the Registrar may

16
require that those charges, if any,
be paid before the procedure is
begun for the exchange or transfer.
All Notes issued and authenticated
upon any exchange or transfer shall
be valid special obligations of the
City, evidencing the same debt, and
entitled to the same security and
benefit under the Bond Proceedings,
as the Notes surrendered upon that
exchange or transfer. Neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be
required to make any exchange or
transfer of a Note during the period
beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the
mailing of a notice of redemption of
Notes and ending at the close of
business on the day of such mailing
or to transfer or exchange any Note
selected for redemption, in whole or
in part.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be in the best interests of and financially advantageous to the City, the
Notes may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
book entry interests in Notes and
the principal of and interest on the
Notes
may
be
transferred
only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Note certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Notes
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
book entry interests in those Notes
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in Notes or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
Notes, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Notes may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized, (i) the
Notes may be issued in the form of
a single, fully registered Note representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the book entry
interest owners in book entry form
shall have no right to receive Notes
in the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of book
entry interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
book entry interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Notes as such shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for
transfer to another Depository or to
another nominee of a Depository,
without further action by the City.

The City Record
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Notes for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Director of Finance, after
making provision for notification of
the book entry interest owners by
the then Depository and any other
arrangements
deemed
necessary,
shall permit withdrawal of the
Notes from the Depository, and
authenticate and deliver note certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its
nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the Notes,
after determining that the signing
thereof will not endanger the funds
or securities of the City and after
the approval of the form of any
such agreement by the Director of
Law.
Section 10. Execution of Notes.
The Notes shall be signed by the
Mayor and Director of Finance, in
the name of the City and in their
official capacities, provided that
one of those signatures may be a

Charter, the Director of Law shall
prepare the Notes and shall endorse
thereon her approval of the form
and correctness thereof by her manual or facsimile signature. The
Notes shall be issued in the denominations and numbers as requested

single note, and may be issued as
fully registered securities in accordance with Section 133.40 of the
Revised Code and in book-entry or
other certificated form in accordance with Section 9.96 of the
Revised Code if it is determined by
the Director of Finance that the
issuance of fully registered securities in that form will facilitate the
sale and delivery of the Notes. The
Notes may be issued in the denominations of $5,000 each or in any
denomination that is any whole
multiple thereof. The Notes shall
not have coupons attached, shall be
numbered as determined by the
Director
of
Finance
and
shall
express upon their faces the purpose, in summary terms, for which
they are issued and that they are
issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 11. Sale of Notes. The
Notes shall first be offered at par
and accrued interest to the Trustees
of the Sinking Fund and, if the
Trustees refuse to take any or all
of them, the Director of Finance
shall offer them to the Mayor and
the Director of Law for purchase for
credit of the Treasury Investment
Account and, if not purchased for
the Treasury Investment Account,
the Notes shall be sold at not less
than 97% of par plus any accrued
interest by the Director of Finance
to the Original Purchaser; provided,
however that if, in the reasonable
opinion of the Director of Finance,

912

June 11, 1997
an underwriter is incapable of fully
performing its duties or meeting its
obligations in its capacity as Original Purchaser with respect to the
Bonds, the Director of Finance is
hereby authorized and directed, in
the name of and on behalf of the
City, to take whatever actions may
be necessary to terminate that
underwriter’s standing as Original
Purchaser. The Director of Finance
shall sign the Certificate or Certificates of Award referred to in Sections 8 and 9 evidencing that sale,
cause the Notes to be prepared, and
have the Notes signed and delivered, together with a true transcript
of proceedings with reference to the
issuance of the Notes if requested
by the Original Purchaser, to the
Original Purchaser upon payment of
the purchase price. The Director of
Finance shall sign and deliver, in
the name of and on behalf of the
City, the Note Purchase Agreement
between the City and the Original
Purchaser in substantially the form
as now on file with the Clerk of
Council in the File No. referenced
in Section 4 hereof. The Note Purchase
Agreement
is
approved,
together
with
any
changes
or
amendments that are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and not
substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Note Purchase Agreement or amendments
thereto.
The
Mayor,
the
Director of Finance, the Clerk of
Council, the Director of Law and
other City officials, as appropriate,
are each authorized and directed to
sign
any
transcript
certificates,
financial statements and other documents and instruments and to take
such actions as are necessary or
appropriate
to
consummate
the
transactions contemplated by this
Ordinance for the issuance of the
Notes. The Director of Finance is
authorized, if it is determined to be
in the best interest of the City, to
combine the issue of Notes with one
or more other note issues of the
City into a consolidated note issue
pursuant to Section 133.30(B) of the
Revised Code.
Section 12. Security. The Bonds
and the Notes are special obligations of the City, and the principal
and interest on the Bonds and Notes
are payable solely from Nontax Revenues and such payment is secured
by a pledge of those Nontax Revenues established by and as provided in this Ordinance which are on
deposit in the Stadium Bond Fund,
as described below.
There is hereby created by the
City a separate fund named the “Stadium Bond Fund” (the “Bond Fund”)
into which Nontax Revenues shall
be deposited in accordance with the
following provisions. “Nontax Revenues”, as used herein, means, all
moneys of the City which are not
moneys raised by taxation, to the
extent available for such purposes,
including, but not limited to the following: (a) grants from the United
States of America and the State of
Ohio; (b) payments in lieu of taxes
now or hereafter authorized by State
statute; (c) fines and forfeitures
which are deposited in the City’s
General Fund; (d) fees deposited in
the City’s General Fund from properly imposed licenses and permits;
(e) investment earnings on the
City’s General Fund and which are
credited to the City’s General Fund;
(f) investment earnings of other

June 11, 1997
funds of the City that are credited
to the City’s General Fund; (g) proceeds from the sale of assets which
are deposited in the City’s General
Fund; (h) rental income which is
deposited in the City’s General
Fund; (i) gifts and donations and
(j) charges for services and payments received in reimbursement for
services.
With respect to the Notes, the City
hereby covenants and agrees that on
or before each date on which principal or interest is due and payable
with respect to the Notes, it shall
deposit into the Bond Fund from
Nontax Revenues selected by the
City an amount equal to the debt
service due and payable on the
Notes on such date. With respect to
the
Bonds,
the
City
hereby
covenants and agrees that on the
first day of each month Bonds are
outstanding, the City shall deposit
into the Bond Fund from Nontax
Revenues selected by the City (i)
commencing the later of the first
day of the month following issuance
of the Bonds or the first day of the
sixth month preceding the first CIB
Interest
Payment
Date
on
the
Bonds, an amount equal to one-sixth
of the interest payment due on the
next following CIB Interest Payment Date, and (ii) commencing the
first day of the twelfth month preceding the first Principal Payment
Date, an amount equal to onetwelfth of the principal payment due
on the next following Principal Payment Date; in each case, less any
interest earnings accumulated in the
Bond Fund which have not theretofore been used as a credit against a
prior payment obligation. Moneys in
the Bond Fund shall be used solely
and exclusively to pay principal and
interest on the Notes and Bonds
when due.
The City hereby covenants and
agrees that so long as the Notes and
the Bonds are outstanding, it will
appropriate and maintain sufficient
Nontax Revenues each year to make
each payment due under this Section and to pay principal and interest on the Notes and Bonds when
due; provided, however, the payments due hereunder and under the
Notes and Bonds are payable solely
from Nontax Revenues, which Nontax Revenues are hereby selected
by the City as moneys that are not
raised by taxation. The Notes and
Bonds do not and shall not represent or constitute a general obligation debt or pledge of the faith or
credit or taxing power of the City,
and the owners of the Notes or
Bonds have no right to have taxes
levied by the City for the payment
of principal and interest on the
Notes or Bonds.
Nothing herein shall be construed
as requiring the City to use or
apply to the payment of principal
and interest on the Notes or the
Bonds any funds or revenues from
any source other than Nontax Revenues.
Nothing
herein,
however,
shall be deemed to prohibit the City,
of its own volition, from using, to
the extent that it is authorized by
law to do so, any other resources
for the fulfillment of any of the
terms, conditions or obligations of
this Ordinance or of the Notes or the
Bonds.
Section 13. Proceeds of Notes and
Bonds. The proceeds from the sale
of the Notes or Bonds, except any
premium and accrued interest, shall
be paid into the proper fund or
funds and those proceeds are appropriated and shall be used for the

The City Record
purpose for which the Notes or
Bonds are being issued. Any portion
of those proceeds representing premium and accrued interest shall be
paid into the Bond Fund. If Notes
are issued, the par value to be
received from the sale of the Bonds
or any renewal notes and any
excess funds resulting from the
issuance of the Notes shall, to the
extent necessary, be used to pay the
debt charges on the Notes at maturity and are pledged for that purpose.
Section 14. Disclosure; Rating;
Insurance. If, in the judgment of the
Director of Finance after consultation with the Original Purchaser, an
official statement or other disclosure document is appropriate relating to the initial offering of the
Notes or Bonds, the Director of
Finance, on behalf of the City and
in that officer’s official capacity, is
authorized to (i) cooperate with the
Original Purchaser in the preparation of, and the making of modifications, completions or changes of
or supplements to, such a disclosure
document, (ii) determine, and to certify or otherwise represent, when
the disclosure document is to be
deemed final or is final, (iii) authorize the use and distribution of that
disclosure document and any supplements thereto in connection with
the initial offering of the Notes or
Bonds, and (iv) sign certificates,
statements or other documents in
connection with the finality, accuracy and completeness of that disclosure document.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Notes or Bonds, the City
agrees, as the only obligated person with respect to the Notes or
Bonds under the Rule, to provide or
cause to be provided such financial
information and operating data,
audited financial statements and
notices, in such manner, as may be
required for purposes of paragraph
(b)(5)(i) of the Rule. In order to
describe and specify certain terms
of the City’s continuing disclosure
agreement for that purpose, and
thereby to implement that agreement,
including
provisions
for
enforcement, amendment and termination, the Director of Finance is
authorized and directed to sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, the Continuing Disclosure Certificate with respect to the
Bonds and the Notes. The agreement formed, collectively, by this
paragraph
and
that
Certificate,
shall be the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for purposes of
the Rule, and its performance shall
be subject to the annual appropriation of any funds that may be necessary to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further authorized and directed to
establish procedures in order to
ensure compliance by the City with
its
continuing
disclosure
agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices.
Prior to making any filing in accordance with that agreement or providing notice of the occurrence of
any other events, the Director of
Finance
shall
consult
with,
as
appropriate, the legal counsel and
bond or other qualified independent
special counsel to the City. The
Director of Finance, acting in the
name and on behalf of the City,
shall be entitled to rely upon any
legal advice provided by any such
counsel in determining whether a
filing should be made.

17
If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, after consultation
with the City’s financial advisor,
the filing of an application for (i)
a rating on the Notes or Bonds by
one or more nationally-recognized
rating agencies, (ii) a policy of
insurance or other credit enhancement facility from a company or
companies to better assure the payment of principal of and interest on
the Notes or Bonds, or (iii) a surety bond or other credit enhancement facility from a company or
other companies to satisfy any
reserve requirement for the Notes
or Bonds is in the best interest of
and financially advantageous to
this City, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare and submit
those applications, to provide to
each such agency, company or
other credit enhancement facility
provider such information as may
be required for the purpose. The
cost of obtaining each such rating,
policy, bond or credit enhancement
facility, except to the extent paid
by the Original Purchaser in accordance with the Bond Purchase
Agreement, shall be paid from the
proceeds of the Notes or Bonds. If,
in the judgment of the Director of
Finance, after consultation with the
City’s financial advisor, a bond
reserve fund or similar fund to
secure the Notes or Bonds, or a
pledge of all or a portion of the
Nontax Revenues to secure the
Notes or Bonds is in the best interest of and financially advantageous
to this City, such fund and pledge
are
hereby
authorized and the
Director of Finance and other City
officials, as appropriate, are authorized to take such actions as are
necessary or appropriate to consummate such additional security
for the Notes or Bonds.
Section 15. Tax Covenants. The
City covenants that it will use, and
will restrict the use and investment of, the proceeds of the Notes
and Bonds in such manner and to
such extent as may be necessary
so that (a) neither the Notes nor
the Bonds will (i) constitute private
activity
bonds,
arbitrage
bonds or hedge bonds under Sections 141, 148 or 149 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the Code) or (ii) be
treated other than as bonds to
which Section 103(a) of the Code
applies, and (b) the interest on the
Notes and Bonds will not be treated as an item of tax preference
under Section 57 of the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the Notes
and Bonds to be and remain excluded from gross income for federal
income tax purposes, (b) it will not
take or authorize to be taken any
actions that would adversely affect
that exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting for it, will, among other
acts of compliance, (i) apply the
proceeds of the Notes and Bonds to
the governmental purpose of the
borrowing, (ii) restrict the yield on
investment
property,
(iii)
make
timely and adequate payments to
the federal government, (iv) maintain books and records and make
calculations and reports and (v)
refrain from certain uses of those
proceeds, and, as applicable, of
property financed with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the
extent necessary to assure such
exclusion of that interest under the
Code.

18
The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer
of the City having responsibility
for issuance of the Notes and Bonds
is hereby authorized (a) to make or
effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent, approval,
or waiver on behalf of the City
with respect to the Notes and Bonds
as the City is permitted to or
required to make or give under the
federal income tax laws, including,
without limitation thereto, any of
the elections provided for in Section
148(f)(4)(C) of the Code or available under Section 148 of the Code,
for the purpose of assuring, enhancing or protecting favorable tax
treatment or status of the Notes
and Bonds or interest thereon or
assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose, reducing
the burden or expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount
or payments or penalties, or making payments of special amounts in
lieu of making computations to
determine, or paying, excess earnings as rebate, or obviating those
amounts or payments, as determined by that officer, which action
shall be in writing and signed by
the officer, (b) to take any and all
other actions, make or obtain calculations,
make
payments,
and
make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf
of the City, as may be appropriate
to assure the exclusion of interest
from gross income and the intended tax status of the Notes and
Bonds, and (c) to give one or more
appropriate certificates of the City,
for inclusion in the transcript of
proceedings
for
the
Notes
and
Bonds, setting forth the reasonable
expectations of the City regarding
the amount and use of all the proceeds of the Notes and Bonds, the
facts, circumstances and estimates
on which they are based, and other
facts and circumstances relevant to
the tax treatment of the interest on
and the tax status of the Notes and
Bonds.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or
any other provisions of this Ordinance to the contrary, if the Director of Finance determines prior to
the execution and delivery of the
Bond Purchase Agreement or Note
Purchase Agreement that it is necessary and appropriate and in the
best interests of the City for the
interest on the Notes or the Bonds
to be included in gross income for
federal income tax purposes, the

covenants of this Section 15 with
respect to the Notes or Bonds, as the
case may be.

or Notes authorized herein.

shall be applied in any manner as
would, impair the obligation of contract of the City with respect to any
outstanding bonds, notes, certificates of indebtedness, other obligations, trust indentures, trust agreements, or other agreements or contracts made or entered into by the
City.

Moran,
Patmon,
Polensek, Robinson, Skrha, Smith,
Sweeney, Zone, Patton, Rybka, Melena and White.
An
emergency
resolution
to
demand a moratorium on the new
HUD policy because it is government sponsored gentrification, and
it is disruptive and unjust to lowincome people, neighborhoods and
the City of Cleveland, and that the
City needs time to develop a coordinated process to handle the displacement and relocation issues.
Whereas, there are 22,327 public
housing and Section 8 units in Cuyahoga County, the vast majority of
which are in the City of Cleveland;
and

36
Whereas, there are 11,605 “projectbased” subsidies in the City of
Cleveland; and
Whereas, the federal government
through the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) has changed its policy on
housing the poor; and
Whereas, as a part of the new
HUD policy there will be a reduction of the availability of public
housing units for poor people; and
Whereas, as a part of the new
HUD policy HUD is not renewing
“project-based”
housing
contracts;
and
Whereas,
those
“project-based”
housing contracts that are being
renewed will be only for one year,
and
Whereas, many of the properties
have been in disrepair and substandard condition for many years
with the full knowledge of HUD;
and
Whereas, HUD continued to fund
these properties until now; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
held
two
public
hearings
and
received testimony from local HUD,
Cuyahoga
Metropolitan
Housing
Authority (CMHA), housing advocacy groups, and low-income people
affected by the new HUD policy;
and
Whereas, the testimony from the
low-income people demonstrated a
high level of fear, confusion, mistrust, along with a keen sense of
unjust treatment; and
Whereas, the general public and
city government is not fully aware
of the implication of the new HUD
policy; and
Whereas, the immediate result of
the new HUD policy in Cleveland is
the displacement of hundreds of
families through Section 8 vouchers
that will be renewed only for one
year; and
Whereas, under the new HUD policy there will be thousands more
Cleveland families displaced and
given Section 8 vouchers; and
Whereas, HUD has criticized the
inability of CMHA to process its current volume of Section 8 vouchers;
and
Whereas, there is a need to develop the capacity and coordinated
efforts to address the displacement
and relocation of thousands of lowincome people; and
Whereas, the new HUDpolicy will
result in economic gentrification of
inner city neighborhoods,
Therefore be it resolved that this
council demands;
Section 1. A moratorium on the
new HUD policy because it is government sponsored gentrification of
low-income people, and the new
HUD policy is disruptive and unjust
to
low-income
people,
neighborhoods, and the City of Cleveland;
and
Section 2. The City of Cleveland
be given time to develop a coordinated process for handling the displacement and relocation issues.
Section 3. That a copy of this resolution be forwarded to the President of the United States, the President of the Senate, the Senate
Majority Leader, the Speaker of the
House, the Chair of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, the Chair
of the House Appropriations Committee, Senator John Glenn, Senator

all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

allowed by law.

June 11, 1997
Res. No. 977-97.
By Councilmen Westbrook and
Patton.
An emergency resolution regarding principles for the restructuring
of the electric utility industry in
Ohio.
Whereas, the federal government
and the State of Ohio are considering proposals to restructure the electric utility industry which could
affect the cost of electricity and the
manner in which utilities provide
service; and
Whereas, the purported purpose of
competition is to reduce the cost
electricity and ensure choice of electricity providers; and
Whereas, affordably priced electricity, offered under reasonable
terms, is essential to the health,
safety and economic well being of
all Ohioans; and
Whereas, electric utility deregulation could lead to higher electric
bills,
increased
pollution
and
reduced, degraded or unreliable electric service from coal-fired and
nuclear power plants; and
Whereas, electric utility deregulation could eliminate the guarantee
that all customers receive service
(universal service); and
Whereas, public service objectives
like shut-off protection, bill assistance and payment options, and
energy
efficiency
programs
for
fixed and low income customers
could be eliminated; and
Whereas, electric utility deregulation could result in the elimination
of utility company jobs that would
negatively impact the economy in
Northeast Ohio; and
Whereas, electric utility deregulation could be a disincentive to
increased utilization of energy efficiency practices and the use of
renewable energy resources; and
Whereas,
Northeast
Ohio
customers have already borne the burden of uneconomic electric utility
investments; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That restructuring must
not go forward unless electric utility
bills decrease for all Northeast Ohio
customers, and all Northeast Ohio customers, especially schools, local governments, and fixed and low income,
residential and small business customers, share in the benefits of a
restructured electric utility industry.
Section 2. That consumer and environmental protection must be the
top priorities in any legislation or
policy that introduces competition to
electric utilities in Ohio.
Section 3. That electric utility
restructuring in Ohio must result in
a real, open and competitive market
that brings lower bills to all Northeast Ohio customers and provides
retraining, placement and support
programs for displaced utility workers.
Section 4. That electric utility
restructuring in Ohio must bring
cleaner power to all customers and
provide specific mechanisms to protect and improve the environment,
including incentives for increased
development and use of energy efficiency practices, and gas-fired and
renewable energy technologies.
Section 5. That electric utility
restructuring in Ohio must not
penalize consumers by bailing out
utilities for uneconomical investment (stranded costs).
Section 6. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby is directed to
transmit certified copies of this resolution to Governor George Voinovich,
