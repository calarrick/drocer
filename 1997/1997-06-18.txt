By Mayor White.
An emergency ordinance to amend

amended by Ordinance No. 1612-88,
passed September 12, 1988, and to
supplement

by
enacting new Section 443.261 thereof, relating to rates of fare for taxicabs.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

980

June 18, 1997
Section 1. That Section 443.26 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended by
Ordinance No. 1612-88, passed September 12, 1988, is hereby amended
to read as follows:
Section 443.26 Rates of Fare for

(1) For the first one-sixth mile or
fraction thereof, one dollar and
eighty cents ($1.80).

(3)
For

(b) The maximum rate of fare for

(1) For each person transported

the north by Lake Erie, on the west
by the Cuyahoga River, on the south
by Central Avenue and on the east
by East 14th Street, two dollars
($2.00).
(3) For each coach employed upon
an hourly rate, four dollars ($4.00)
per hour.
(4) For each person transported
between designated points or in connection with special events a special

(c)
Waiting

or
Traffic
Delay Charge. The rate for waiting
or traffic delay shall be fifteen dollars ($15.00) per hour except for

(d) The rate for each trunk carried outside shall be twenty cent

(e) Hourly Rate. Public hacks
may, upon request of passengers,
accept employment whereby the fare

of the owner to the time of returning to the nearest station from the
point of dismissal.
(f) Receipt to be Given. Upon
request of a passenger, the owner,
driver, chauffeur or other person in
charge or control of a public hack

Section 2. That existing Section
443.26 of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended
by Ordinance No. 1612-88, passed
September
12,
1988,
is
hereby
repealed.

June 18, 1997
Section 3. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
hereby supplemented by enacting
new Section 443.261 thereof, to read
as follows:
Section 443.261 Drivers’ Expenses
Capped; Reporting.
(a) Finding. This Council finds
that the wages earned by drivers of
public hacks are inadequate to
insure a sufficient number of taxicabs and capable drivers, and that
the public convenience and necessity require the imposition of a cap
on the expenses paid by drivers of
public hacks.
(b) Definitions. As used in this
section: “Drivers’ expenses” means
all costs, expenses and fees paid by
drivers to a company, association or
independent
operator
currently
charged or hereafter established for
the lease of a public hack, and
includes, by way of example and not
by way of limitation, the costs of
the lease itself, insurance and fuel.
“Base rates” means the drivers’
expenses charged by a company,
association or independent operator

By Councilman Westbrook (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance providing for the issuance and sale of
bonds in the maximum principal
amount of $11,500,000 to advance
refund certain of the City’s outstanding General Obligation Bonds
issued in 1991 to pay expenses
incurred in the issuance of those
bonds
and
that
refunding,
and
authorizing the execution and delivery of an escrow agreement and
other agreements with repsect to the
bonds and the advance refunding.
Whereas, pursuant to Ordinance
No. 2611-91, passed on November 11,
1991,
General
Obligation
Bonds,
Series 1991C, in the aggregate principal amount of $12,500,000, dated as
of December 1, 1991 (the “1991C General Obligation Bonds”), were issued
for the purpose of providing funds
with which to pay or reimburse the
City for the payment of final judgments rendered against the City,
including
settlements
of
claims
approved by a court, and including
interest thereon to the approximate
date of issuance of the bonds, costs
and expenses assessed or taxed
against and defense costs of the
City, and other costs, including
financing costs, permitted by Chapter 133, Ohio Revised Code, to be
paid from the proceeds of such
bonds (the “1991C Purpose”); and
Whereas, this Council finds and
determines that: (i) it is necessary
and in the best interest of the City
to advance refund the 1991C General Obligation Bonds that are stated
to mature on October 1 in the year
2011 (term bonds in the aggregate
principal amount of $4,100,000) and
in the years 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005,
2006 and 2007 (serial bonds in the
aggregate
principal
amounts
of
$610,000, $660,000, $700,000, $755,000,
$810,000 and $860,000, respectively)
(those outstanding bonds, together
with any other outstanding unvoted
general obligation bonds of the City
designated to be refunded pursuant
to Section 1 are collectively referred
to as the “Refunded Bonds”); and
(ii) to issue the Bonds described in
Section 1 to provide funds for that
purpose, including the payment of
any
expenses
relating
to
the
advance refunding of the Refunded
Bonds or the issuance of the Bonds;
and
Whereas,
pursuant
to
Revised
Code
Sections
133.14(C)
and
133.34(A)(3), the maximum maturity
of the Bonds is December 31, 2016;
and
Whereas, this Council passed Ordinance No. 1749-80 on October 8, 1980,
and thereafter amended that ordinance by Ordinance No. 1112-83,
passed on May 6, 1983, and Ordinance No. 944-96, passed on June 10,
1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so
amended and as the same may further be amended from time to time
in accordance with its provisions, is
referred to as the “General Bond
Ordinance”), providing the general
terms
and
provisions
for
the
issuance thereunder of unvoted gen-

995

19
eral obligations of the City and the
General Bond Ordinance was passed
in contemplation of this Ordinance
and other ordinances authorizing
the issuance of bonds in accordance
with the provisions thereof (the
“Series Bond Ordinances”); and
Whereas, the issuance of the
Bonds is necessary to provide funds
to advance refund the Refunded
Bonds which will enable the City to
obtain debt service savings which
are urgently needed for the benefit
of the City, and as a result, this
Ordinance constitutes an emergency
measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public, peace,
property, health and safety, and for
the usual daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary that Bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed
Eleven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($11,500,000) be issued
for the purpose of advance refunding the Refunded Bonds that the
Director
of
Finance
determines,
based on the advice of the City’s
financial advisor, would be advantageous to the City to advance
refund due to savings in bond service charges or the restructuring of
the currently scheduled bond service
charges or otherwise to better serve
the interests of the City, and for the
purpose of paying any expenses
relating to the advance refunding of
the
Refunded
Bonds
and
the
issuance of the Bonds, including all
financing costs within the meaning
of Revised Code Section 133.15(B).
The aggregate principal amount
of Bonds to be issued shall not
exceed $11,500,000 and shall be in an
amount determined by the Director
of Finance to be the aggregate principal amount of Bonds that are
required to be issued, taking into
account
any
discount
from
the
aggregate principal amount of the
Bonds at which they are sold to the
Original Purchaser, in order to
effect the purpose for which the
Bonds are to be issued, including
the payment of any expenses relating to the advance refunding of the
Refunded Bonds and the issuance of
the Bonds, which amount shall be
set forth in the certificate providing
for the final terms of the Bonds and
the sale of the Bonds and signed by
the Director of Finance in accordance with this Ordinance (the “Certificate of Award”). The Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that additional
maturities or different maturities of
the series of unvoted general obligation bonds of the City identified in
the preambles of this Ordinance and
issued for the 1991C Purpose may be
refunded
and
thereby
constitute
Refunded Bonds; provided that in
adding or changing such maturities
the Director of Finance determines,
based on advice from the City’s
financial
advisor,
that
advance
refunding such maturities generates
present value debt service savings
to the City or otherwise is in the
best interests of the City, taking
into account all the factors that the
Director of Finance and the City’s
financial advisor deem relevant to
such determination.
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Revised

20
Code Chapter 133, and other applicable provisions of the Revised Code,
the Charter of the City, the General
Bond Ordinance, and this Ordinance
in the principal amount and for the
purpose stated in Section 1. The
Bonds shall be designated as determined by the Director of Finance.
The Bonds shall be issued in one lot
as fully registered Bonds in denominations of $5,000 or any integral
multiple thereof but in no case as
to a particular maturity date exceeding the principal amount maturing
on that date. The Bonds shall be
numbered as determined by the
Director of Finance.
The Bonds shall be dated as of
August 1, 1997 or such other date
specified
in
the
Certificate
of
Award, but in no event later than
December 31, 1997. The Bonds shall
bear interest at the rate of nine percent (9%) per year or at the rate or
rates per year specified in the Certificate of Award; provided that if
all the Bonds bear interest at the
same rate per year, then such rate
shall not exceed nine percent (9%)
per year, and if the Bonds bear
interest at more than one rate per
year, then the weighted average of
such rates (taking into account the
principal amount and maturity of
each Bond to which a rate applies)
shall not exceed nine percent (9%)
per year. Interest on the Bonds shall
be
payable,
until
the
principal
amount is paid, semi-annually on
February 1 and August 1 of each
year or on the first day of each of
two months specified in the Certificate of Award as the dates on which
interest on the Bonds shall be
payable
(the
“Interest
Payment
Dates”), beginning February 1, 1998,
or on such other Interest Payment
Date specified in the Certificate of
Award as the first Interest Payment
Date. The Bonds shall bear interest
from the most recent date to which
interest has been paid or provided
for or, if no interest has been paid
or provided for, from their date.
The Bonds shall mature in the
years and principal amounts as
shall be determined by the Director
of Finance and specified in the Certificate of Award, provided that (i)
each principal payment shall occur
on an Interest Payment Date, (ii)
the first principal payment on the
Bonds shall be no earlier than January 1, 1998 and no later than
August 1, 1999, (iii) the final maturity date of the Bonds shall be no
later than the last maturity permitted by law for the Refunded Bonds,
and (iv) the principal amount thereof shall be payable in annual
installments such that the total principal and interest payments on the
Bonds in any fiscal year in which
principal is payable, is not more
than three times the amount of
those payments for the Refunded
Bonds in any fiscal year in which
principal
was
payable
on
the
Refunded Bonds.
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The
Director
of
Finance
shall
determine
in
the
Certificate
of
Award whether any of the Bonds
shall be issued as Term Bonds, any
dates (the “Mandatory Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather

The City Record
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption prior to stated maturity
as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent
for payment of principal of and
interest on any Term Bonds shall
include
amounts
sufficient
to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City
for any Term Bonds. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds which
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and canceled
by the Registrar, to the extent not
applied
theretofore
as
a
credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of
the principal amount thereof against
the then current Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement (and
corresponding mandatory redemption obligation). Any excess of that
amount
over
the
then
current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement shall be credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligations) in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(b)
Optional
Redemption.
The
Bonds may be subject to redemption
prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole on any
date, or in part on any Interest Payment Date, on the dates and for the

996

June 18, 1997
prices specified in the Certificate of
Award, or the Director of Finance
may determine that it is in the best
interests of the City for the Bonds
not to be callable prior to their stated maturity. In the event that the
Bonds are callable, the earliest date
for optional redemption shall be no
later than the tenth anniversary of
the first principal payment date and
the maximum redemption price shall
be no greater than 102% of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued
interest to the redemption date.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar, given upon the direction
of the Council of the City by passage of an ordinance. That notice
shall specify the redemption date
and the principal amount of each
maturity of Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar. In
the event that notice of redemption
shall have been given by the Registrar to the registered owners as
hereinafter provided, there shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, funds
which, in addition to any other moneys available therefor and held by
the Registrar, will be sufficient to
redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus interest accrued to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice
of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Bonds by lot when Bonds of
denominations greater than $5,000
are then outstanding, each $5,000
unit of principal thereof shall be
treated as though it were a separate
Bond of the denomination of $5,000.
If it is determined that one or more,
but not all of the $5,000 units of
principal amount represented by a
Bond are to be called for redemption, then upon notice of redemption
of a $5,000 unit or units, the registered owner of that Bond shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i)
for payment of the redemption price
of the $5,000 unit or units called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption and any
premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.

June 18, 1997
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity
of
the
proceedings
for
the
redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph hereof, the Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due and payable
on the redemption date, and, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the
redemption
price,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date. If
money for the redemption of all of
the Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with interest
accrued thereon to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, so as to be available therefor on that date and, if
notice
of
redemption
has
been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
that money shall not be so available
on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held
by
the
Registrar
for
the
redemption of particular Bonds shall
be held in trust for the account of
the registered owners thereof and
shall be paid to them, respectively,
upon presentation and surrender of
those Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section
3) at the close of business on the
fifteenth day of the calendar month
next preceding that Interest Payment
Date
(the
Record
Date).
Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond Ordinance,
so long as the Bonds are held by a
Depository in a book entry system

The City Record
(as described in Section 3), debt
charges on the Bonds will be
payable in lawful money of the United States by wire transfer to the
Depository made by the Escrow
Agent on each Interest Payment
Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance is hereby adopted by reference, and, except for the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 of the General Bond Ordinance
(pertaining generally to the periods
during
which
the
City
is
not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under the
General Bond Ordinance), which are
not included in this Ordinance and
will not apply to the Bonds, the General Bond Ordinance is included as
a part of this Ordinance as fully as
if restated herein. Words and terms
not otherwise defined herein shall
have the same meaning as set forth
in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their faces
the purpose for which they are
issued and that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to
Section 4 of the General Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be authenticated by the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee.
The Bonds shall be signed by the
City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor and
by the City’s Director of Finance or
Acting Director of Finance; provided, however, that in accordance with
Section 9.96 of the Code and the foregoing requirement that each Bond
bear the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee,
either or both of the signatures of
the City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor or
of its Director of Finance or Acting
Director of Finance may be a facsimile. The Bonds shall bear the
seal of the City, which seal may be
a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section
83 of the City’s Charter, the Director of Law or Acting Director of
Law shall prepare the Bonds and
shall endorse thereon his or her
approval of the form and correctness
thereof by his or her manual or facsimile signature.
Star Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent,
bond registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Bonds (the
Registrar);
provided
that
the
Escrow Agent also shall act as paying agent for the Bonds so long as
the Bonds are held in a book entry
system. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, the Registrar Agreement among the City,
the Registrar and the Escrow Agent
(the Agreement) in substantially
the form as is now on file with the
Clerk of Council in File No. 1173-97A. The Agreement is approved,
together
with
any
changes
or
amendments that are not inconsistent with this ordinance and not
substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Agreement or amendments to the
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reim-

997

21
bursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Agreement from the
proceeds of the Bonds to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided
in this Section (the Bond Register).
Subject to the provisions of Section
5, the person in whose name a Bond
is registered on the Bond Register
shall be regarded as the absolute
owner of that Bond for all purposes
of this ordinance. Payment of or on
account of the debt charges on any
Bond shall be made only to or upon
the order of that person; neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be
affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Bond at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner
or
by
a
person
legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of
this ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Bonds
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Bonds surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the

22
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized: (i) the
Bonds may be issued in the form of
a single, fully registered Bond representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the beneficial
owners in book entry form shall
have no right to receive Bonds in
the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for
transfer to another Depository or to
another nominee of a Depository,
without further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Bonds from the Depository,
and the Trustee and Registrar shall
authenticate and deliver bond certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to

The City Record
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking
Fund and, if not purchased by such
Trustees, shall be offered to the
Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased by
such Account, shall be sold to
Lehman Brothers, Merrill, Lynch &
Co., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.,
Pryor, McClendon, Counts & Co.,
Inc., and SBK-Brooks Investment
Corp. (collectively, the “Original
Purchaser”); provided, however, that
if, in the reasonable opinion of the
Director of Finance, an underwriter
is incapable of fully performing its
duties or meeting its obligations in
its capacity as Original Purchaser
with respect to the Bonds, the Director of Finance is hereby authorized
and directed, in the name of and on
behalf of the City, to take whatever actions may be necessary to terminate that underwriter’s standing
as Original Purchaser.
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Bonds as set forth in the Bond Purchase
Agreement
including:
the
principal amount of the Bonds, the
final purchase price (which shall be
not less than 97% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest to
their date of delivery), the interest
rate or rates, the amounts and years
in which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements), and the
Interest Payment Dates and the
date of the Bonds (if different from
those set forth in Section 2). If it is
determined advisable by the Director of Finance for the sale of the
Bonds, the Director of Finance is
authorized to sign agreements with
a municipal bond insurer issuing a
policy of municipal bond insurance
for the Bonds that are not materially inconsistent with this Ordinance.
The
Mayor,
Director
of
Finance, Director of Law and other
appropriate officers of the City are,
and each of them is, authorized and
directed to take such actions as are
necessary, appropriate and in the
best interest of the City to establish
the terms and requirements for
delivery of the Bonds and to make
such arrangements as are necessary
with the Original Purchaser in order
to establish the date, location, and
procedure, and conditions for the
delivery of the Bonds to the Original Purchaser, to give all appropriate notices and certificates, to cause
a true transcript or proceedings
with reference to the issuance of the
Bonds to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Mayor and the Director

998

June 18, 1997
of Finance are, and each of them is,
hereby
further
authorized
and
directed to execute and deliver on
behalf of the City a bond purchase
agreement
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, between the City and the Original Purchaser setting forth the
terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell and the Original
Purchaser agrees to buy the Bonds,
provided that such agreement shall
not provide for or require the terms
of the Bonds to be inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Bond Purchase
Agreement is approved substantially in the form now on the file with
the Clerk of Council in the File No.
referenced in Section 3 of this Ordinance, together with any changes or
amendments that are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and not
substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Bond
Purchase
Agreement
or
amendments to the Bond Purchase
Agreement. It is hereby determined
that the terms of the Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance and as may
be provided in or pursuant to the
Certificate of Award, are in the best
interest of the City and in compliance with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an
Official Statement is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
original issuance of the Bonds, those
officers in their official capacities
are authorized to prepare or cause
to be prepared on behalf of the City
an Official Statement and any necessary supplements thereto, and on
behalf of the City to use and distribute, or authorize the use and distribution of, that Official Statement
and any supplements thereto in connection with the original issuance of
the Bonds, and each of those officers is authorized to sign on behalf
of the City and in his or her official
capacity, that Official Statement and
any supplements thereto approved
by such officer. Those officers are
and each of them is authorized to
sign and deliver, on behalf of the
City and in their official capacities,
such certificates in connection with
the accuracy of the Official Statement and any supplements thereto
as may, in their judgment, be necessary or appropriate. Such officers
are also hereby authorized to determine and certify on behalf of the
City that such disclosure document
is “deemed final” by the City within the meaning of Securities and
Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12
(the “SEC Rule”).
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under, the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
and directed to prepare or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the

June 18, 1997
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute an agreement made by the
City for the benefit of the holders
and beneficial owners of the Bonds
in accordance with the Rule. The
City’s performance of that agreement shall be subject to the availability of funds and their annual
appropriation to meet costs the City
would be required to incur to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of the
occurrence of any other events, the
Director of Finance shall consult
with, as appropriate, the legal counsel and bond or other qualified independent special counsel to the City.
The Director of Finance, acting in
the name and on behalf of the City,
shall be entitled to rely upon any
legal advice provided by any such
counsel in determining whether a
filing should be made.
Pursuant
to
Section
133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds
with other bonds into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of their sale as a single issue to
be designated “Various Purpose General Obligation Bonds, Series 1997”.
Such bonds shall contain a summary statement of purposes encompassing the purpose for which the
Bonds are issued and shall state
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds
promptly when and as the same
falls due, and also to provide for the
discharge of the Bonds at maturity,
there shall be and is hereby levied
on all the taxable property in the
City, in addition to all other taxes,
a direct tax annually during the
period the Bonds are outstanding, in
an amount sufficient to provide for
the payment of that interest, when
and as the same shall fall due, and
also to discharge the principal of
the Bonds at maturity, which tax
shall not be less than the interest
and sinking fund tax required by
Section 11 of Article XII of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of those years are certified, extended and collected. The
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from the tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund as provided pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on
the Bonds when and as the same
fall due; provided, however, that,
subject to the provisions of Section
8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in
each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the
Bonds and are appropriated for such

The City Record
purpose, the amount of such tax
shall be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25 and 5705.51 of the
Revised Code, and in accordance
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the
General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt
charges for the Bonds.

specifically authorized to file, on
behalf of the City, subscriptions for
the purchase and issuance of those

and liens authorized by the General
Bond Ordinance and, in addition to
the taxes and revenues specifically
pledged pursuant to this Ordinance
and the General Bond Ordinance and
the other covenants, terms and
agreements provided hereunder and
in the General Bond Ordinance to

and interest on the Bonds, the City
hereby determines, declares, warrants and covenants that the Bonds
are general obligations of the City

Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid
and discharged all the outstanding
Bonds, or there shall otherwise be
paid to the holders of the outstanding Bonds all debt charges due or
to become due thereon, and provision shall also be made for paying
all other sums payable hereunder,
then and in that event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of further
effect, and the covenants, agreements and other obligations of the
City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the
request of the City execute and
deliver to the City such instruments
in writing as shall discharge the
lien hereof and enter on the record

other instruments as may be reasonably required by the City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if:
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or sub-accounts, in trust for and
irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold
in special accounts or sub-accounts,
in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations
of the United States certified by an
independent public accounting firm
of national reputation to be of such

without further investment or reinvestment of either the principal

24
amount thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held
in trust and committed, except as
hereinafter provided), as will be sufficient,
together
with
moneys
referred to in (i) above, for the payment, at their maturities or redemption dates, of all debt charges on the
Bonds to their date of maturity or
redemption, as the case may be, or

charges on the Bonds, as directed by
the Director of Finance. Any income
or interest earned by, or increment
to, the investments held under this
Section shall, to the extent determined from time to time by the
Escrow Agent to be in excess of the
amount required to be held by it for
the purposes of this Section, be

the third paragraph of Section 4 of
the General Bond Ordinance pursuant to Section 2 of this Ordinance.

Whereas,
pursuant
to
Section
670B.04 of the Codified Ordinances
of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, outdoor
telephones must be registered prior
to installation or placement; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure for the

prior to the effective date of the
City’s comprehensive regulation of
such telephones; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That, in order to protect

Ord. No. 933-A-97.
(As substitute for Ordinance No.
933-97).
By Mayor White and Councilmen
Westbrook and Willis.
An ordinance to repeal Sections
670B.01 to 670B.07 and 670B.99 of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, as amended and enacted
by various ordinances; to supplement said codified ordinances by
enacting new Sections 670B.01 to
670B.08 and 670B.99 thereof, relating
to outdoor pay telephones.
Whereas, this Council enacted regulations concerning the registration
and placement of outdoor pay telephones on private property and the
right-of-way, as Chapter 670B of the
Codified Ordinances, on June 14,
1993, in order to protect the health,
safety and welfare of the public; and
Whereas, this Council has determined that additional regulations
concerning the placement and permitting of outdoor pay telephones
on private property and the right-ofway are needed to further protection
of the public health, safety and welfare; and
Whereas, such additional regulations are needed due to the proliferation of outdoor pay telephones in
the City and the resultant increase
in the
congregation
of persons
around and about such phones, both
of which have created noise, have
created congestion for the public
using the right-of-way, parking lots,
service stations and other businesses, as well as seeking to enter and
leave their own or other residences
in the City, and have created aesthetic pollution and physical obstacles, blocking sightlines and causing
confusion for the police, pedestrians
and drivers; and such proliferation
of outdoor pay telephones has also
magnified the existing atmosphere
conducive to the attraction of drug
related crimes and criminals, prostitution,
gang activity, vandalism,
youth crimes and other public nuisances; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the following Sections of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
Section 670B.01, as enacted by
Ordinance No. 2159-92, passed June
14, 1993, as renumbered by Ordinance No. 1545-93, passed July 14,

areas named in this division.
(i) An owner may apply in writing to the Commissioner for an
exemption
from
the
1,000

restriction to place multiple outdoor
pay telephones at one location, due
to a demonstrated appropriate use
or need for additional outdoor pay
telephones as a result of a high
level of pedestrian and automobile
traffic, and a concentration of heavy
usage of pay telephones at that location. Any such application shall be
referred to the Director of Planning
for review and approval, and if so
approved, shall be submitted to
Council for action. If Council passes the ordinance approving the
exemption, such ordinance shall be
forwarded to the Commissioner who
shall attach the approved exemption
to the license of the owner, and the
owner may then apply for permits
for additional phones, as approved.
Any such approved exemption shall
be effective for the duration of any
permits granted pursuant to the
approved exemption.
(j) For the purposes of this section, the submission of a completed
application for a permit for a telephone on private property, or the
submission of written notification to
the Director, pursuant to an executed contract with the City of the
intent of the owner to install a telephone in the right-of-way, shall be
considered a placement of a pay
telephone.
(k) Any outdoor pay telephone
placed, installed or maintained after

(3) On private property or the
right-of-way, no outdoor pay telephone shall be located within 5 feet
of the entrance or exit to any structure, a crosswalk, a bus shelter, a
fire exit or escape, a mail box, parking meter, police or fire call box,
traffic control box, fire hydrant or
sidewalk elevator, or that blocks or
restricts free passage of pedestrians
or vehicles. Any outdoor pay telephone located on private property
and registered with the City as of
the date of introduction of this ordinance must comply with this division within one year after the effective date of this ordinance.

or omission which is solely attributable to the City, and shall furnish,
at said owner’s expense, such general commercial liability insurance
as shall protect said owner and the
City from all claims for damage to
property or bodily injury, including
death, which may arise from installation, maintenance and operation of
the telephone or in connection therewith. Such policy shall name the
City as an additional insured, shall
be in an amount to be determined
by the Director but not less than one
hundred thousand dollars ($100,000)
combined single limit for any injury
to persons and/or damage to property, and shall provide that the

certificate of such insurance shall
be provided to the Director at the

installed or maintained in violation
of the contract and the requirements

the
outdoor
pay
telephone

34
restore the public right-of-way to its
original condition. Any outdoor pay
telephone which is not removed

private property within the City that
do not have a permit, or for which
the owner does not have a license,
when required, the owners of such
telephones, and the owners of the
properties where such telephones
are located.
(b) Any owner of a pay telephone
who is not in compliance with this
Chapter shall be notified in writing
by the Commissioner of the violation, a copy of which shall be sent
to the property owner or owners
where such violations exist, and
that the owner must correct the violations within five (5) business

violations
within
the
time

The City Record
required, the Commissioner may
order any telephone in violation
removed within five (5) days, and
the Commissioner may order the
license or permit of the owner suspended until all violations are corrected, or revoked. An owner may

or of a suspension or revocation,
shall stay such removal order, or the
requirement that one or all telephones be removed by the owner,
pending the decision of the Board.
(d) If an owner’s license or permit is revoked, the owner must
apply for a new license or permit
and pay all fees required for a
license or permit prior to the installation of any telephone. After the

expenses.
Section 670B.07 Public Nuisance;
Removal of Outdoor Pay Telephones
(a) Upon request in writing by
the member of Council in whose
ward an outdoor pay telephone is
located in the right-of-way, or on private property, or upon receipt of verbal or written citizen complaints
concerning such an outdoor pay telephone, the Director of Public Safety
shall conduct an investigation into
whether the installation and maintenance of the outdoor pay telephone constitutes a public nuisance.
Upon determination by the Director
of Public Safety that a particular
outdoor pay telephone constitutes a
public nuisance, the Director shall
order that special telephone service
features as are acceptable to the
Director shall be provided by the
outdoor pay telephone, or if the
Director determines it is necessary,
that the telephone be removed. Nothing in this Section shall preclude the
Director from ordering the removal
of a telephone without first requiring the implementation of special

1011

35
features. A particular outdoor pay
telephone shall constitute a public
nuisance when the Director of Public Safety determines that one or
more of the following conditions
exist:
(1) The outdoor pay telephone has
been used in the commission of illegal drug transactions or other criminal activity, or substantially contributes by its presence to the commission of illegal drug transactions
or other criminal activity as evidenced by significant numbers of
such crimes occurring in the vicinity of the telephone;
(2) The existence of the outdoor
pay telephone has substantially contributed by its presence to the congregation of persons who have made
loud noises and other disturbances
that have disrupted persons residing
near the telephone or disrupted business enterprises located near the
telephone;
(3) The existence of the outdoor
pay telephone has substantially contributed by its presence to the congregation
of
persons
consuming
alcoholic beverages, except where
such
consumption
is
expressly
authorized by a state license, or consuming illegal or controlled substances;
(4) The existence of the outdoor
pay telephone has substantially contributed by its presence to the congregation of persons who have interfered with pedestrian or vehicular
traffic in the public right-of-way
near the telephone;
(5) Usage of the outdoor pay telephone between the hours of 1:00 a.m.
and 5:00 a.m. is significantly and
repeatedly above normal usage for
similarly situated outdoor pay telephones during the same hours so as
to indicate that the telephone is
being used in the commission of illegal drug activity or other criminal
activity;
(6) The pay telephone has been
used to abuse the 911 system.
(b) The special features shall be
instituted,
or
the
owner
shall
remove the telephone, and restore
the right-of-way to its original condition, if applicable, within five (5)
business days of an order to institute special features or remove the
telephone. Any outdoor pay telephone which does not provide special features or is not removed, as
applicable, within five (5) business
days of such an order shall be subject to immediate removal by the
City at the owner’s expense and
shall constitute a default of the
owner’s contract or a violation of
the owner’s license and permit, as
applicable. The owner shall reimburse the City for the cost of removing and storing the telephone before
the telephone may be reclaimed by
the owner. Such costs shall also
include the cost of removing any
installation ancillary to the outdoor
pay telephone and the cost of restoring the public right-of-way to its
original condition.
(c) If the Director determines
that the nuisance may be abated by
the reducticn in the total number of
pay telephones in an area, the
removal of pay telephones shall be
ordered based upon the total period
of time that a telephone has been
registered with or permitted by the
City or placed pursuant to a contract with the City, with the telephones
registered,
permitted,
or
made a part of a contract for the
least amount of time being ordered
removed first.

36
(d) The Director of Public Safety
will inform in writing the member
of Council who made the complaint
regarding the pay telephone the
result of such investigation and the
Director shall notify the member in
writing of any order issued by the
Director.
(e) Other than in the circumstance of a removal order pursuant
to Section 670B.03(b)(6), if an outdoor
pay
telephone
has
been
removed from a location because it
is a nuisance, no other pay telephone may be installed at the same
location or within 1,000 feet of that
location for a minimum of one
year.
(f) The owner of an outdoor pay
telephone may appeal from the
determination of a nuisance and the
order of special features or removal
issued pursuant to this section to
the Board of Zoning Appeals within
five (5) business days after receipt
of the order. The order shall be
stayed during the pendency of the
appeal before the Board. The Board
shall commence to hear the merits
of an appeal within thirty (30) days
of the filing of an appeal. The
Board shall render a decision within ten (10) days of the date of the
hearing, which decision may affirm,
disaffirm, or grant exception from
the order, requirement, decision or
determination
from
which
the
appeal has been taken. If the Board
affirms an order of the Director that
a telephone constitutes a nuisance,
the owner shall have three (3) business days to remove the outdoor pay
telephone in question; if the owner
fails to correct the violation within
that time, the outdoor pay telephone
may be removed by the Director at
the owner’s expense.
Section 670B.08 PUCO Regulations
Nothing in this Chapter shall be
read so as to limit the authority of
the PUCO to regulate outdoor pay
telephones within the City of Cleveland, nor to conflict with the authority of the PUCO to approve any special services for pay telephones.
Section 670B.99 Penalty
Any owner as defined in this
Chapter, or any owner, lessee, or
person in possession or control of
private property where an outdoor
pay telephone is or has been located, who violates any part of this
Chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and fined a mandatory one

By Councilman Polensek.
An emergency resolution urging
the Mayor and the Director of Public Safety to increase traffic enforcement measures and fines in residential neighborhoods and school

Whereas, there has been increasing number of complaints from citizens about this total disregard by
motorist for speed limits in these

this
Council
strongly urges the Mayor and the

Res. No. 977-97.
By Councilmen Westbrook and
Patton.
An emergency resolution regarding
principles for the restructuring of the
electric utility industry in Ohio.
Whereas, the federal government
and the State of Ohio are considering proposals to restructure the elec-

June 18, 1997
tric utility industry which could
affect the cost of electricity and the
manner in which utilities provide
service; and
Whereas, the purported purpose of
competition is to reduce the cost
electricity and ensure choice of electricity providers; and
Whereas, affordably priced electricity, offered under reasonable
terms, is essential to the health,
safety and economic well being of
all Ohioans; and
Whereas, electric utility deregulation could lead to higher electric
bills,
increased
pollution
and
reduced, degraded or unreliable electric service from coal-fired and
nuclear power plants; and
Whereas, electric utility deregulation could eliminate the guarantee
that all customers receive service
(universal service); and
Whereas, public service objectives
like shut-off protection, bill assistance and payment options, and
energy
efficiency
programs
for
fixed and low income customers
could be eliminated; and
Whereas, electric utility deregulation could result in the elimination
of utility company jobs that would
negatively impact the economy in
Northeast Ohio; and
Whereas, electric utility deregulation could be a disincentive to
increased utilization of energy efficiency practices and the use of
renewable energy resources; and
Whereas,
Northeast
Ohio
customers have already borne the burden of uneconomic electric utility
investments; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That restructuring must
not go forward unless electric utility bills decrease for all Northeast
Ohio customers, and all Northeast
Ohio customers, especially schools,
local governments, and fixed and
low income, residential and small
business customers, share in the
benefits of a restructured electric
utility industry.
Section 2. That consumer and environmental protection must be the
top priorities in any legislation or
policy that introduces competition to
electric utilities in Ohio.
Section 3. That electric utility
restructuring in Ohio must result in
a real, open and competitive market
that brings lower bills to all Northeast Ohio customers and provides
retraining, placement and support
programs for displaced utility workers.
Section 4. That electric utility
restructuring in Ohio must bring
cleaner power to all customers and
provide specific mechanisms to protect and improve the environment,
including incentives for increased
development and use of energy efficiency practices, and gas-fired and
renewable energy technologies.
Section 5. That electric utility
restructuring in Ohio must not
penalize consumers by bailing out
utilities for uneconomical investment (stranded costs).
Section 6. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby is directed to
transmit certified copies of this resolution
to
Governor
George
Voinovich, 77 S. High Street, Columbus, OH 43215; Sen. Bruce Johnson
and Sen. Priscilla Mead (Co-Chairs
of the House-Senate Select Committee on Electric Utility Deregulation), Statehouse, Columbus, OH
43215; the President of the Ohio Senate, the Speaker of the Ohio House;
the U.S. Senators from Ohio, the U.S.

The City Record
Congressperson of this District; the
local Ohio State Senator and Representative; and the Citizen’s Utility
Restructuring Committee at 3294

Section 7. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it received
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City
for any Term Bonds. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds which
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and canceled
by the Registrar, to the extent not
applied
theretofore
as
a
credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of
the principal amount thereof against
the then current Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement (and
corresponding mandatory redemption obligation). Any excess of that
amount
over
the
then
current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement shall be credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligations) in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(b)
Optional
Redemption.
The
Bonds may be subject to redemption
prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole on any
date, or in part on any Interest Payment Date, on the dates and for the

1056

June 18, 1997
prices specified in the Certificate of
Award, or the Director of Finance
may determine that it is in the best
interests of the City for the Bonds
not to be callable prior to their stated maturity. In the event that the
Bonds are callable, the earliest date
for optional redemption shall be no
later than the tenth anniversary of
the first principal payment date and
the maximum redemption price shall
be no greater than 102% of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued
interest to the redemption date.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar, given upon the direction
of the Council of the City by passage
of an ordinance. That notice shall
specify the redemption date and the
principal amount of each maturity of
Bonds to be redeemed, and shall be
given at least forty-five (45) days
prior to the redemption date or such
shorter period as shall be acceptable
to the Registrar. In the event that
notice of redemption shall have been
given by the Registrar to the registered owners as hereinafter provided,
there shall be deposited with the
Registrar on or prior to the redemption date, funds which, in addition to
any other moneys available therefor
and held by the Registrar, will be
sufficient to redeem at the redemption price
thereof,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date, all
of the redeemable Bonds for which
notice of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Bonds by lot when Bonds of
denominations greater than $5,000
are then outstanding, each $5,000
unit of principal thereof shall be
treated as though it were a separate
Bond of the denomination of $5,000.
If it is determined that one or more,
but not all of the $5,000 units of
principal amount represented by a
Bond are to be called for redemption, then upon notice of redemption
of a $5,000 unit or units, the registered owner of that Bond shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i)
for payment of the redemption price
of the $5,000 unit or units called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption and any
premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.

June 18, 1997
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity
of
the
proceedings
for
the
redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph hereof, the Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due and payable
on the redemption date, and, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the
redemption
price,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date. If
money for the redemption of all of
the Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with interest
accrued thereon to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, so as to be available therefor on that date and, if
notice
of
redemption
has
been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
that money shall not be so available
on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held
by
the
Registrar
for
the
redemption of particular Bonds shall
be held in trust for the account of
the registered owners thereof and
shall be paid to them, respectively,
upon presentation and surrender of
those Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section
3) at the close of business on the
fifteenth day of the calendar month
next preceding that Interest Payment
Date
(the
Record
Date).
Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond Ordinance,
so long as the Bonds are held by a
Depository in a book entry system

The City Record
(as described in Section 3), debt
charges on the Bonds will be
payable in lawful money of the United States by wire transfer to the
Depository made by the Escrow
Agent on each Interest Payment
Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance is hereby adopted by reference, and, except for the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 of the General Bond Ordinance
(pertaining generally to the periods
during
which
the
City
is
not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under the
General Bond Ordinance), which are
not included in this Ordinance and
will not apply to the Bonds, the General Bond Ordinance is included as
a part of this Ordinance as fully as
if restated herein. Words and terms
not otherwise defined herein shall
have the same meaning as set forth
in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their faces
the purpose for which they are
issued and that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to
Section 4 of the General Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be authenticated by the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee.
The Bonds shall be signed by the
City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor and
by the City’s Director of Finance or
Acting Director of Finance; provided, however, that in accordance with
Section 9.96 of the Code and the foregoing requirement that each Bond
bear the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee,
either or both of the signatures of
the City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor or
of its Director of Finance or Acting
Director of Finance may be a facsimile. The Bonds shall bear the
seal of the City, which seal may be
a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section
83 of the City’s Charter, the Director of Law or Acting Director of
Law shall prepare the Bonds and
shall endorse thereon his or her
approval of the form and correctness
thereof by his or her manual or facsimile signature.
Star Bank, National Association, is
appointed to act as the authenticating agent, bond registrar, transfer
agent and paying agent for the
Bonds (the Registrar); provided that
the Escrow Agent shall also act as
paying agent for the Bonds so long
as the Bonds are held in a book
entry
system.
The
Director
of
Finance shall sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
the Registrar Agreement among the
City, the Registrar and the Escrow
Agent (the Agreement) in substantially the form as is now on file
with the Clerk of Council in File No.
920-97-A.
The
Agreement
is
approved,
together
with
any
changes or amendments that are not
inconsistent with this ordinance and
not substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Agreement or amendments to the
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reim-

1057

81
bursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Agreement from the
proceeds of the Bonds to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided
in this Section (the Bond Register).
Subject to the provisions of Section
5, the person in whose name a Bond
is registered on the Bond Register
shall be regarded as the absolute
owner of that Bond for all purposes
of this ordinance. Payment of or on
account of the debt charges on any
Bond shall be made only to or upon
the order of that person; neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be
affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Bond at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner
or
by
a
person
legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of
this ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Bonds
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Bonds surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the

82
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized: (i) the
Bonds may be issued in the form of
a single, fully registered Bond representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the beneficial
owners in book entry form shall
have no right to receive Bonds in
the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for
transfer to another Depository or to
another nominee of a Depository,
without further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Bonds from the Depository,
and the Trustee and Registrar shall
authenticate and deliver bond certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to

The City Record
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking
Fund and, if not purchased by such
Trustees, shall be offered to the
Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased by
such Account, shall be sold to
Lehman Brothers, Merrill, Lynch &
Co., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.,
Pryor, McClendon, Counts & Co.,
Inc., and SBK-Brooks Investment
Corp. (collectively, the “Original
Purchaser”); provided, however, that
if, in the reasonable opinion of the
Director of Finance, an underwriter
is incapable of fully performing its
duties or meeting its obligations in
its capacity as Original Purchaser
with respect to the Bonds, the Director of Finance is hereby authorized
and directed, in the name of and on
behalf of the City, to take whatever actions may be necessary to terminate that underwriter’s standing
as Original Purchaser.
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Bonds as set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement, including: the
principal amount of the Bonds, final
purchase price (which shall be not
less than 97% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate
or rates, the amounts and years in
which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements),
the
Interest Payment Dates and the
date of the Bonds (if different from
those set forth in Section 2) and any
other matters required in this Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. If it is determined advisable
by the Director of Finance for the
sale of the Bonds, the Director of
Finance is authorized to sign agreements with a municipal bond insurer issuing a policy of municipal
bond insurance for the Bonds that
are not materially inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Mayor, Director
of Finance, Director of Law and
other appropriate officers of the
City are, and each of them is, authorized and directed to take such
actions as are necessary, appropriate and in the best interest of the
City to establish the terms and
requirements for delivery of the
Bonds and to make such arrangements as are necessary with the
Original Purchaser in order to establish the date, location, and procedure, and conditions for the delivery
of the Bonds to the Original Purchaser,
to
give
all
appropriate
notices and certificates, to cause a
true transcript or proceedings with
reference to the issuance of the
Bonds to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps neces-

1058

June 18, 1997
sary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Mayor and the Director
of Finance are, and each of them is,
hereby
further
authorized
and
directed to execute and deliver on
behalf of the City a bond purchase
agreement
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, between the City and the Original Purchaser setting forth the
terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell and the Original
Purchaser agrees to buy the Bonds,
provided that such agreement shall
not provide for or require the terms
of the Bonds to be inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Bond Purchase
Agreement is approved substantially in the form now on the file with
the Clerk of Council in File No. 92097-A, together with any changes or
amendments that are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and not
substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Bond
Purchase
Agreement
or
amendments to the Bond Purchase
Agreement. It is hereby determined
that the terms of the Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance and as may
be provided in or pursuant to the
Certificate of Award, are in the best
interest of the City and in compliance with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an
Official Statement is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
original issuance of the Bonds, those
officers in their official capacities
are authorized to prepare or cause
to be prepared on behalf of the City
an Official Statement and any necessary supplements thereto, and on
behalf of the City to use and distribute, or authorize the use and distribution of, that Official Statement
and any supplements thereto in connection with the original issuance of
the Bonds, and each of those officers is authorized to sign on behalf
of the City and in his or her official
capacity, that Official Statement and
any supplements thereto approved
by such officer. Those officers are
and each of them is authorized to
sign and deliver, on behalf of the
City and in their official capacities,
such certificates in connection with
the accuracy of the Official Statement and any supplements thereto
as may, in their judgment, be necessary or appropriate. Such officers
are also hereby authorized to determine and certify on behalf of the
City that such disclosure document
is “deemed final” by the City within the meaning of Securities and
Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12
(the “SEC Rule”).
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under, the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
and directed to prepare, or cause to

June 18, 1997
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Bonds in accordance
with the Rule. The performance of
that Agreement shall be subject to
the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of the
occurrence of any other events, the
Director of Finance shall consult
with, as appropriate, the legal counsel and bond or other qualified independent special counsel to the City.
The Director of Finance, acting in
the name and on behalf of the City,
shall be entitled to rely upon any
legal advice provided by any such
counsel in determining whether a
filing should be made.
Pursuant
to
Section
133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds
with other bonds into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of their sale as a single issue to
be designated “Various Purpose General Obligation Bonds, Series 1997”.
Such bonds shall contain a summary statement of purposes encompassing the purpose for which the
Bonds are issued and shall state
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds
promptly when and as the same
falls due, and also to provide for the
discharge of the Bonds at maturity,
there shall be and is hereby levied
on all the taxable property in the
City, in addition to all other taxes,
a direct tax annually during the
period the Bonds are outstanding, in
an amount sufficient to provide for
the payment of that interest, when
and as the same shall fall due, and
also to discharge the principal of
the Bonds at maturity, which tax
shall not be less than the interest
and sinking fund tax required by
Section 11 of Article XII of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of those years are certified, extended and collected. The
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from the tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund as provided pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on
the Bonds when and as the same
fall due; provided, however, that,
subject to the provisions of Section
8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in
each year to the extent that revenues are available from other

The City Record
sources for the payment of the
Bonds and are appropriated for such
purpose, the amount of such tax
shall be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25 and 5705.51 of the
Revised Code, and in accordance
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the
General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt
charges for the Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended and applied for the objects
and purposes for which the Bonds
are issued. Accrued interest and any
premium received from the sale of
the Bonds shall be deposited in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund to be
applied to the payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Bonds are secured by a pledge and
lien on a parity with the pledges
and liens authorized by the General
Bond Ordinance and, in addition to
the taxes and revenues specifically
pledged pursuant to this Ordinance
and the General Bond Ordinance and
the other covenants, terms and
agreements provided hereunder and
in the General Bond Ordinance to
secure payment of the principal of
and interest on the Bonds, the City
hereby determines, declares, warrants and covenants that the Bonds
are general obligations of the City
and that the full faith and credit of
the City are hereby pledged for the
payment of the principal of and
interest on the Bonds in accordance
with the laws and Constitution of
the State of Ohio, this Ordinance and
the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid
and discharged all the outstanding
Bonds, or there shall otherwise be
paid to the holders of the outstanding Bonds all debt charges due or
to become due thereon, and provision shall also be made for paying
all other sums payable hereunder,
then and in that event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of further
effect, and the covenants, agreements and other obligations of the
City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the
request of the City execute and
deliver to the City such instruments
in writing as shall discharge the
lien hereof and enter on the record
such discharge of the lien and such
other instruments as may be reasonably required by the City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if:
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or sub-accounts, in trust for and
irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold
in special accounts or sub-accounts,
in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations

1059

83
of the United States certified by an
independent public accounting firm
of national reputation to be of such
maturities and interest payment
dates and to bear such interest,
without further investment or reinvestment of either the principal
amount thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held
in trust and committed, except as
hereinafter provided), as will be sufficient,
together
with
moneys
referred to in (i) above, for the payment, at their maturities or redemption dates, of all debt charges on the
Bonds to their date of maturity or
redemption, as the case may be, or
if default in such payment shall
have occurred on such date then to
the date of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds
are to be redeemed prior to the
maturity thereof, notice of such
redemption shall have been duly
given or irrevocable provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall have
been duly made for the giving of
such notice. Any moneys held by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with
the provisions of this Section shall
be invested by the Escrow Agent in
direct obligations of the United
States of America maturing, or
redeemable at the option of the holder, at times and in amounts sufficient to meet payment of debt

upon the direction of the Director of
Finance to be set forth in a certificate providing for the final terms of

to maturity without penalty, provided that, if the Director of Finance,
based on the advice of the financial
advisor of the City, determines that
it is in the best interest of the City
in order to enhance the marketability of the Notes, the Director of
Finance may cause the Notes to not
be redeemable for a period which

84
ends no later than the date which is
two (2) years following the date of
issuance of the Notes; shall be designated
“Bridges
and
Roadways
Improvement
Bond
Anticipation
Notes, Series 1997”; shall be issued
in such numbers and denominations
as may be requested by the Note
Purchaser
(hereinafter
defined);
and shall be issued in fully registered form (which may be in a book
entry only system) in denominations
of $5,000 or integral multiples thereof. Interest shall be payable semiannually on the dates set forth in
the Note Certificate of Award; provided that if the Notes mature on or
before the end of the twelfth (12th)
month
following
their
date
of
issuance, interest on the Notes shall

Star Bank, National Association, is
appointed to act as the authenticating agent, registrar, transfer agent
and paying agent for the Notes (the
Registrar);
provided
that
the
Escrow Agent also shall act as paying agent for the Notes so long as
the Notes are held in a book entry
system. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, an agreement among the City, the Registrar
and the Escrow Agent (the Note
Registrar Agreement) providing for
services relating to the registration,
transfer, exchange and payment of
Notes. The Director of Finance shall
provide for the payment of the services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant
to the Note Registrar Agreement
from the proceeds of the Notes to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose.
So long as any of the Notes
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Notes as provided in
this Section (the Note Register).
Subject to the provisions of Section
5, the person in whose name a Note
is registered on the Note Register
shall be regarded as the absolute
owner of that Note for all purposes
of this ordinance. Payment of or on
account of the debt charges on any
Note shall be made only to or upon
the order of that person; neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be
affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Note,
including
interest,
to
the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for
Notes of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Note may be transferred only on
the Note Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Note at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner
or
by
a
person
legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Note or Notes of any

The City Record
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Note
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Notes only after the new
Notes are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Notes exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Notes
in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Notes
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Notes surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Pursuant
to
Section
133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Notes
with other bond anticipation notes
of the City into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of
their sale as a single issue to be
designated “Various Purpose General

purposes encompassing the purpose
for which the Notes are issued and
shall state that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 11. Execution and Payment of the Notes. The Notes shall
be executed by the Director of
Finance and the Mayor, provided
that one of such signatures may be
a facsimile. Such Notes shall express
upon their face the purpose for
which they are issued and that they
are issued pursuant to this ordinance, and may be payable in Federal Reserve funds of the United
States of America if requested by
the Note Purchaser.
Section 12. Sale of the Notes. The
Notes shall be sold at private sale
to the Note Purchaser by the Director of Finance in the principal
amount set forth in a certificate of
award to be executed by the Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate
of Award”) at not less than par and
accrued interest and at a rate not
exceeding that set forth in Section
10 hereof. The Notes shall be sold to
Lehman Brothers, Merrill, Lynch &
Co., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.,
SBK-Brooks Investment Corp., and
Pryor, McClendon, Counts & Co., Inc.
(the “Note Purchaser”). The proceeds of such sale shall be paid into
the proper fund and used for the

being issued under the provisions of
this Ordinance.
Section 13. Security for the Notes.

obligations of the City, and the full
faith, credit and revenue of the City
are hereby pledged for the prompt
payment of the same. The par value
to be received from the sale of the
Bonds and any excess funds resulting from the issuance of the Notes
shall, to the extent necessary, be

1060

June 18, 1997
used for the retirement of the Notes
at maturity, together with the interest thereon, and are hereby pledged
for such purpose.
Section 14. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. During the year
or years while the Notes are outstanding there shall be levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes but within tax limitations, a direct tax annually not less than that which would
have been levied if bonds had been
issued therefor without the prior
issue of the Notes.
Said tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of said year are certified, extended and collected. Said
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from said tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account, which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of the principal and interest of
the Notes or the Bonds in anticipation of which they are issued, when
and as the same falls due; provided,
however, that in each year to the
extent that revenues are available
from other sources for the payment
of the Notes and Bonds and are
appropriated for such purpose, the
amount of such direct tax upon all
of the taxable property in the City
may be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
Section 15. Preparation of Disclosure Document for the Notes. The
Director of Finance is hereby authorized to prepare, execute and deliver to the Note Purchaser, to the
extent required by law, a preliminary and final Official Statement or

the Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing, (ii) restrict
the yield on investment property

now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

the issuance of notes in anticipation

Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Sections
133.01 to 133.70, inclusive, and other
applicable provisions of the Revised
Code, the Charter of the City, the
General Bond Ordinance and this
Ordinance in the principal amount
and for the purpose stated in Section 1. The Bonds shall be designated “Public Facilities Improvement Bonds, Series 1997”. The Bonds

of Finance.
The Bonds shall be dated as of
August 1, 1997, or such other date,
but in no event later than December
31, 1997, specified in the certificate
of award providing for the final
terms of the Bonds and the sale of
the Bonds and signed by the Director of Finance in accordance with
this Ordinance (the “Certificate of
Award”). The Bonds shall bear
interest at the rate of nine percent
(9%) per year or at the rate or rates
per year specified in the Certificate
of Award; provided that if all the
Bonds bear interest at the same rate
per year, then such rate shall not

The City Record
exceed nine percent (9%) per year,
and if the Bonds bear interest at
more than one rate per year, then
the weighted average of such rates
(taking into account the principal
amount and maturity of each Bond
to which a rate applies) shall not
exceed nine percent (9%) per year.
Interest on the Bonds shall be
payable, until the principal amount
is paid, semi-annually on February
1 and August 1 of each year or on
the first day of each of two months
specified in the Certificate of Award
as the dates on which interest on
the Bonds shall be payable (the
“Interest Payment Dates”), beginning February 1, 1998 or on such
other Interest Payment Date specified in the Certificate of Award as
the first Interest Payment Date.
The
Bonds
shall
mature
on
August 1 in twenty (20) substantially equal annual installments,
beginning August 1, 1998, or according to the schedule set forth in the
Certificate of Award, provided that
(i) each principal payment shall
occur on an Interest Payment Date
(hereinafter defined), (ii) the first
principal payment on the Bonds
shall be no earlier than January 1,
1998 and no later than August 1,
1999, (iii) the final maturity date of
the Bonds shall be no later than
twenty (20) years from the first
principal payment date, and (iv) the
principal amount thereof shall be
payable in annual installments such
that the total principal and interest
payments on the Bonds in any fiscal year in which principal is
payable is not more than three times
the amount of those payments in
any other fiscal year.
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the
“Mandatory
Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption prior to stated maturity
as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent
for payment of principal of and
interest on any Term Bonds shall
include
amounts
sufficient
to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term

1062

June 18, 1997
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City
for any Term Bonds. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds which
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and canceled
by the Registrar, to the extent not
applied
theretofore
as
a
credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of
the principal amount thereof against
the then current Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement (and
corresponding mandatory redemption obligation). Any excess of that
amount
over
the
then
current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement shall be credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligations) in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(b)
Optional
Redemption.
The
Bonds may be subject to redemption
prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole on any
date, or in part on any Interest Payment Date, on the dates and for the
prices specified in the Certificate of
Award, or the Director of Finance
may determine that it is in the best
interests of the City for the Bonds
not to be callable prior to their stated maturity. In the event that the
Bonds are callable, the earliest date
for optional redemption shall be no
later than the tenth anniversary of
the first principal payment date and
the maximum redemption price shall
be no greater than 102% of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued
interest to the redemption date.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar, given upon the direction
of the Council of the City by passage of an ordinance. That notice
shall specify the redemption date
and the principal amount of each
maturity of Bonds to be redeemed,

June 18, 1997
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar. In
the event that notice of redemption
shall have been given by the Registrar to the registered owners as
hereinafter provided, there shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, funds
which, in addition to any other moneys available therefor and held by
the Registrar, will be sufficient to
redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus interest accrued to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice
of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Bonds by lot when Bonds of
denominations greater than $5,000
are then outstanding, each $5,000
unit of principal thereof shall be
treated as though it were a separate
Bond of the denomination of $5,000.
If it is determined that one or more,
but not all of the $5,000 units of
principal amount represented by a
Bond are to be called for redemption, then upon notice of redemption
of a $5,000 unit or units, the registered owner of that Bond shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i)
for payment of the redemption price
of the $5,000 unit or units called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption and any
premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity
of
the
proceedings
for
the
redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph hereof, the Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemp-

The City Record
tion shall become due and payable
on the redemption date, and, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the
redemption
price,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date. If
money for the redemption of all of
the Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with interest
accrued thereon to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, so as to be available therefor on that date and, if
notice
of
redemption
has
been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
that money shall not be so available
on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held
by
the
Registrar
for
the
redemption of particular Bonds shall
be held in trust for the account of
the registered owners thereof and
shall be paid to them, respectively,
upon presentation and surrender of
those Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section
3) at the close of business on the
fifteenth day of the calendar month
next preceding that Interest Payment
Date
(the
Record
Date).
Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond Ordinance,
so long as the Bonds are held by a
Depository in a book entry system
(as described in Section 3), debt
charges on the Bonds will be
payable in lawful money of the United States by wire transfer to the
Depository made by the Escrow
Agent on each Interest Payment
Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance is hereby adopted by reference, and, except for the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 of the General Bond Ordinance
(pertaining generally to the periods
during
which
the
City
is
not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under
the General Bond Ordinance), which
are not included in this Ordinance
and will not apply to the Bonds, the
General Bond Ordinance is included
as a part of this Ordinance as fully
as if restated herein. Words and
terms not otherwise defined herein
shall have the same meaning as set
forth in the General Bond Ordinance.

Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their faces
the purpose for which they are
issued and that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to
Section 4 of the General Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be authenticated by the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee.
The Bonds shall be signed by the
City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor and
by the City’s Director of Finance or
Acting Director of Finance; provided, however, that in accordance with
Section 9.96 of the Code and the foregoing requirement that each Bond
bear the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee,
either or both of the signatures of
the City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor or
of its Director of Finance or Acting
Director of Finance may be a facsimile. The Bonds shall bear the
seal of the City, which seal may be
a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section
83 of the City’s Charter, the Director of Law or Acting Director of
Law shall prepare the Bonds and
shall endorse thereon his or her
approval of the form and correctness
thereof by his or her manual or facsimile signature.
Star Bank, National Association, is
appointed to act as the authenticating agent, bond registrar, transfer
agent and paying agent for the
Bonds (the Registrar); provided that
the Escrow Agent shall also act as
paying agent for the Bonds so long
as the Bonds are held in a book
entry
system.
The
Director
of
Finance shall sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
the Registrar Agreement among the
City, the Registrar and the Escrow
Agent (the Agreement) in substantially the form as is now on file
with the Clerk of Council in File No.
921-97-A.
The
Agreement
is
approved,
together
with
any
changes or amendments that are not
inconsistent with this ordinance and
not substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Agreement or amendments to the
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Agreement from the
proceeds of the Bonds to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided
in this Section (the Bond Register).
Subject to the provisions of Section
5, the person in whose name a Bond
is registered on the Bond Register
shall be regarded as the absolute
owner of that Bond for all purposes
of this ordinance. Payment of or on
account of the debt charges on any
Bond shall be made only to or upon
the order of that person; neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be
affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the

88
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Bond at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner
or
by
a
person
legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of
this ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Bonds
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Bonds surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, if it is
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance to be advantageous to the
City, the Bonds may be issued in
book entry form in accordance with
the provisions of this Section. As
used in this Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
Bonds, in book entry form, and

The City Record
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized: (i) the
Bonds may be issued in the form of
a single, fully registered Bond representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the beneficial
owners in book entry form shall
have no right to receive Bonds in
the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for
transfer to another Depository or to
another nominee of a Depository,
without further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Bonds from the Depository,
and the Trustee and Registrar shall
authenticate and deliver bond certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking
Fund and, if not purchased by such
Trustees, shall be offered to the
Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased by
such Account, shall be sold to
Lehman Brothers, Merrill, Lynch &
Co., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.,
Pryor, McClendon, Counts & Co.,
Inc., and SBK-Brooks Investment
Corp. (collectively, the “Original
Purchaser”); provided, however, that
if, in the reasonable opinion of the
Director of Finance, an underwriter
is incapable of fully performing its
duties or meeting its obligations in
its capacity as Original Purchaser
with respect to the Bonds, the Director of Finance is hereby authorized

1064

June 18, 1997
and directed, in the name of and on
behalf of the City, to take whatever actions may be necessary to terminate that underwriter’s standing
as Original Purchaser.
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Bonds as set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement, including: the
principal amount of the Bonds, final
purchase price (which shall be not
less than 97% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate
or rates, the amounts and years in
which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements),
the
Interest Payment Dates and the
date of the Bonds (if different from
those set forth in Section 2) and any
other matters required in this Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. If it is determined advisable
by the Director of Finance for the
sale of the Bonds, the Director of
Finance is authorized to sign agreements with a municipal bond insurer issuing a policy of municipal
bond insurance for the Bonds that
are not materially inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Mayor, Director
of Finance, Director of Law and
other appropriate officers of the
City are, and each of them is, authorized and directed to take such
actions as are necessary, appropriate and in the best interest of the
City to establish the terms and
requirements for delivery of the
Bonds and to make such arrangements as are necessary with the
Original Purchaser in order to establish the date, location, and procedure, and conditions for the delivery
of the Bonds to the Original Purchaser,
to
give
all
appropriate
notices and certificates, to cause a
true transcript or proceedings with
reference to the issuance of the
Bonds to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Mayor and the Director
of Finance are, and each of them is,
hereby
further
authorized
and
directed to execute and deliver on
behalf of the City a bond purchase
agreement
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, between the City and the Original Purchaser setting forth the
terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell and the Original
Purchaser agrees to buy the Bonds,
provided that such agreement shall
not provide for or require the terms
of the Bonds to be inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Bond Purchase
Agreement is approved substantially in the form now on the file with
the Clerk of Council in File No. 92197-A, together with any changes or
amendments that are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and not
substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the

June 18, 1997
Bond
Purchase
Agreement
or
amendments to the Bond Purchase
Agreement. It is hereby determined
that the terms of the Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance and as may
be provided in or pursuant to the
Certificate of Award, are in the best
interest of the City and in compliance with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an
Official Statement is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
original issuance of the Bonds, those
officers in their official capacities
are authorized to prepare or cause
to be prepared on behalf of the City
an Official Statement and any necessary supplements thereto, and on
behalf of the City to use and distribute, or authorize the use and distribution of, that Official Statement
and any supplements thereto in connection with the original issuance of
the Bonds, and each of those officers is authorized to sign on behalf
of the City and in his or her official
capacity, that Official Statement and
any supplements thereto approved
by such officer. Those officers are
and each of them is authorized to
sign and deliver, on behalf of the
City and in their official capacities,
such certificates in connection with
the accuracy of the Official Statement and any supplements thereto
as may, in their judgment, be necessary or appropriate. Such officers
are also hereby authorized to determine and certify on behalf of the
City that such disclosure document
is “deemed final” by the City within the meaning of Securities and
Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12
(the “SEC Rule”).
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under, the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
and directed to prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Bonds in accordance
with the Rule. The performance of
that Agreement shall be subject to
the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of the
occurrence of any other events, the
Director of Finance shall consult
with, as appropriate, the legal counsel and bond or other qualified independent special counsel to the City.
The Director of Finance, acting in
the name and on behalf of the City,

The City Record
shall be entitled to rely upon any
legal advice provided by any such
counsel in determining whether a
filing should be made.
Pursuant
to
Section
133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds
with other bonds into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of their sale as a single issue to
be designated “Various Purpose General Obligation Bonds, Series 1997”.
Such bonds shall contain a summary statement of purposes encompassing the purpose for which the
Bonds are issued and shall state
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds
promptly when and as the same
falls due, and also to provide for the
discharge of the Bonds at maturity,
there shall be and is hereby levied
on all the taxable property in the
City, in addition to all other taxes,
a direct tax annually during the
period the Bonds are outstanding, in
an amount sufficient to provide for
the payment of that interest, when
and as the same shall fall due, and
also to discharge the principal of
the Bonds at maturity, which tax
shall not be less than the interest
and sinking fund tax required by
Section 11 of Article XII of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of those years are certified, extended and collected. The
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from the tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund as provided pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on
the Bonds when and as the same
fall due; provided, however, that,
subject to the provisions of Section
8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in
each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the
Bonds and are appropriated for such
purpose, the amount of such tax
shall be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25 and 5705.51 of the
Revised Code, and in accordance
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the
General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt
charges for the Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended and applied for the objects
and purposes for which the Bonds
are issued. Accrued interest and any
premium received from the sale of
the Bonds shall be deposited in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund to be

1065

89
applied to the payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Bonds are secured by a pledge and
lien on a parity with the pledges
and liens authorized by the General
Bond Ordinance and, in addition to
the taxes and revenues specifically
pledged pursuant to this Ordinance
and the General Bond Ordinance and
the other covenants, terms and
agreements provided hereunder and
in the General Bond Ordinance to
secure payment of the principal of
and interest on the Bonds, the City
hereby determines, declares, warrants and covenants that the Bonds
are general obligations of the City
and that the full faith and credit of
the City are hereby pledged for the
payment of the principal of and
interest on the Bonds in accordance
with the laws and Constitution of
the State of Ohio, this Ordinance and
the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid
and discharged all the outstanding
Bonds, or there shall otherwise be
paid to the holders of the outstanding Bonds all debt charges due or
to become due thereon, and provision shall also be made for paying
all other sums payable hereunder,
then and in that event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of further
effect, and the covenants, agreements and other obligations of the
City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the
request of the City execute and
deliver to the City such instruments
in writing as shall discharge the
lien hereof and enter on the record
such discharge of the lien and such
other instruments as may be reasonably required by the City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if:
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or sub-accounts, in trust for and
irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold
in special accounts or sub-accounts,
in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations
of the United States certified by an
independent public accounting firm
of national reputation to be of such
maturities and interest payment
dates and to bear such interest,
without further investment or reinvestment of either the principal
amount thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held
in trust and committed, except as
hereinafter provided), as will be
sufficient, together with moneys
referred to in (i) above, for the payment, at their maturities or redemption dates, of all debt charges on the
Bonds to their date of maturity or
redemption, as the case may be, or
if default in such payment shall
have occurred on such date then to
the date of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds
are to be redeemed prior to the
maturity thereof, notice of such
redemption shall have been duly
given or irrevocable provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall have
been duly made for the giving of
such notice. Any moneys held by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with
the provisions of this Section shall

90
be invested by the Escrow Agent in
direct obligations of the United
States of America maturing, or
redeemable at the option of the holder, at times and in amounts sufficient to meet payment of debt
charges on the Bonds, as directed by
the Director of Finance. Any income
or interest earned by, or increment
to, the investments held under this
Section shall, to the extent determined from time to time by the
Escrow Agent to be in excess of the
amount required to be held by it for
the purposes of this Section, be
transferred at the time of such
determination as provided in Section
17(a) of the General Bond Ordinance
for unclaimed funds held by a Paying Agent. In the event of nonpresentment of any Bond as described
in Section 17(a) of the General Bond
Ordinance, the moneys held pursuant to this Section shall be held
and paid as provided in said Section
17(a) for unclaimed funds held by a
Paying Agent.
Section 9. Bond Anticipation Notes.
For the purpose of raising money in
anticipation of the issuance of the
Bonds for the purposes set forth in
Section 1 hereof, notes of the City
may be issued in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed Eleven
Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand

(the
“Notes”) upon the direction of the
Director of Finance to be set forth
in a certificate providing for the
final terms of the Notes and the sale
of the Notes and signed by the
Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate of Award”).

set forth in the Note Certificate of
Award, which shall be no later than
five (5) years from such date of

to maturity without penalty, provided that, if the Director of Finance,
based on the advice of the financial
advisor of the City, determines that
it is in the best interest of the City
in order to enhance the marketability of the Notes, the Director of
Finance may cause the Notes to not
be redeemable for a period which
ends no later than the date which is
two (2) years following the date of
issuance of the Notes; shall be designated “Public Facilities Improvement
Bond

or integral multiples thereof. Interest shall be payable semi-annually
on the dates set forth in the Note
Certificate of Award; provided that
if the Notes mature on or before the
end of the twelfth (12th) month following their date of issuance, interest on the Notes shall be payable at
maturity.
Star Bank, National Association, is
appointed to act as the authenticating agent, registrar, transfer agent
and paying agent for the Notes (the
Registrar);
provided
that
the
Escrow Agent also shall act as paying agent for the Notes so long as
the Notes are held in a book entry
system. The Director of Finance

The City Record
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, an agreement among the City, the Registrar
and the Escrow Agent (the Note
Registrar Agreement) providing for
services relating to the registration,
transfer, exchange and payment of
Notes. The Director of Finance shall
provide for the payment of the services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant
to the Note Registrar Agreement
from the proceeds of the Notes to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose.
So long as any of the Notes
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Notes as provided in
this Section (the Note Register).
Subject to the provisions of Section
5, the person in whose name a Note
is registered on the Note Register
shall be regarded as the absolute
owner of that Note for all purposes
of this ordinance. Payment of or on
account of the debt charges on any
Note shall be made only to or upon
the order of that person; neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be
affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Note,
including
interest,
to
the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for
Notes of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Note may be transferred only on
the Note Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Note at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner
or
by
a
person
legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Note or Notes of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Note
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Notes only after the new
Notes are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Notes exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Notes
in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Notes
issued and authenticated upon any

1066

June 18, 1997
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Notes surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Pursuant
to
Section
133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Notes
with other bond anticipation notes
of the City into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of
their sale as a single issue to be
designated “Various Purpose General
Obligation
Bond
Anticipation
Notes, Series 1997”. The Notes shall
contain a summary statement of
purposes encompassing the purpose
for which the Notes are issued and
shall state that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 11. Execution and Payment of the Notes. The Notes shall
be executed by the Director of
Finance and the Mayor, provided
that one of such signatures may be
a facsimile. Such Notes shall express
upon their face the purpose for
which they are issued and that they
are issued pursuant to this ordinance, and may be payable in Federal Reserve funds of the United
States of America if requested by
the Note Purchaser.
Section 12. Sale of the Notes. The
Notes shall be sold at private sale
to the Note Purchaser by the Director of Finance in the principal
amount set forth in a certificate of
award to be executed by the Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate
of Award”) at not less than par and
accrued interest and at a rate not
exceeding that set forth in Section
10 hereof. The Notes shall be sold to
Lehman Brothers, Merrill, Lynch &
Co., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.,
SBK-Brooks Investment Corp., and
Pryor, McClendon, Counts & Co., Inc.
(the “Note Purchaser”). The proceeds of such sale shall be paid into
the proper fund and used for the
purpose for which the Notes are
being issued under the provisions of
this Ordinance.
Section 13. Security for the Notes.
The Notes shall be the full general
obligations of the City, and the full
faith, credit and revenue of the City
are hereby pledged for the prompt
payment of the same. The par value
to be received from the sale of the
Bonds and any excess funds resulting from the issuance of the Notes
shall, to the extent necessary, be
used for the retirement of the Notes
at maturity, together with the interest thereon, and are hereby pledged
for such purpose.
Section 14. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. During the year
or years while the Notes are outstanding there shall be levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes but within tax limitations, a direct tax annually not less than that which would
have been levied if bonds had been
issued therefor without the prior
issue of the Notes.
Said tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of said year are certified, extended and collected. Said
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from said tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account, which, together with the

June 18, 1997
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of the principal and interest of
the Notes or the Bonds in anticipation of which they are issued, when
and as the same falls due; provided,
however, that in each year to the
extent that revenues are available
from other sources for the payment
of the Notes and Bonds and are
appropriated for such purpose, the
amount of such direct tax upon all
of the taxable property in the City
may be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
Section 15. Preparation of Disclosure Document for the Notes. The
Director of Finance is hereby authorized to prepare, execute and deliver to the Note Purchaser, to the
extent required by law, a preliminary and final Official Statement or
any other appropriate disclosure
document of the City in accordance
with the sale and delivery of the
Notes, and to deem such disclosure
document “final” for purposes of
SEC Rule 15c2-12.

Ordinances of the City which are
inconsistent with the provisions of
this Ordinance and the General
Bond Ordinance shall not apply to
the Bonds or the Notes authorized
herein.
(b) All covenants, terms and provisions of the General Bond Ordinance are fully applicable to the
Bonds and the Notes authorized
herein, and nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to alter or

of this Ordinance.
Section
18.
Federal
Tax
Covenants. The City covenants that
it will use, and will restrict the use
and investment of, the proceeds of
the Notes and the Bonds in such
manner and to such extent as may
be necessary so that (a) the Notes
and the Bonds will not (i) constitute
private activity bonds, arbitrage
bonds or hedge bonds under Sections
141, 148 or 149 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
Code) or (ii) be treated other than
as bonds to which Section 103(a) of
the Code applies, and (b) the interest thereon will not be treated as an
item of tax preference under Section
57 of the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the Notes
and the Bonds to be and to remain
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, and (b) it
will not take or authorize to be
taken
any
actions
that
would
adversely affect that exclusion, and
(c) it, or persons acting for it, will,
among other acts of compliance, (i)
apply the proceeds of the Notes and
the Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing, (ii) restrict
the yield on investment property
acquired with those proceeds, (iii)
make timely and adequate payments
to the federal government, (iv)

The City Record
maintain books and records and
make calculations and reports, and
(v) refrain from certain uses of
those proceeds, and, as applicable,
of property financed with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the
extent necessary to assure such
exclusion of that interest under the
Code.
Each covenant made in this section with respect to the Notes and
the Bonds is also made with respect
to all issues any portion of the debt
service on which is paid from proceeds of the Notes or the Bonds
(and, if different, the original issue
and any refunding issues in a series
of refundings), to the extent such
compliance is necessary to assure
exclusion of interest on the Notes
and the Bonds from gross income
for federal income tax purposes, and
the officers identified above are
authorized to take actions with
respect to those issues as they are
authorized in this section to take
with respect to the Notes and the
Bonds.
The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer of
the City having responsibility for
issuance of the Notes and the Bonds
is hereby authorized (a) to make or
effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or
waiver on behalf of the City with
respect to the Notes and the Bonds
as the City is permitted or required
to make or give under the federal
income tax laws, including, without
limitation thereto, any of the elections
provided
for
in
Section
148(f)(4)(C) of the Code or available under Section 148 of the Code,
for the purpose of assuring, enhancing or protecting favorable tax
treatment or status of the Notes and
the Bonds or interest thereon or
assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose, reducing the
burden or expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or
payments or penalties, or making
payments of special amounts in lieu
of making computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as
rebate, or obviating those amounts
or payments, as determined by that
officer, which action shall be in
writing and signed by the officer,
(b) to take any and all other
actions, make or obtain calculations,
make payments, and make or give
reports, covenants and certifications
of and on behalf of the City, as may
be appropriate to assure the exclusion of interest from gross income
and the intended tax status of the
Notes and the Bonds, and (c) to give
one or more appropriate certificates
of the City, for inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Notes
and the Bonds, setting forth the reasonable expectations of the City
regarding the amount and use of all
the proceeds of the Notes and the
Bonds, the facts, circumstances and
estimates on which they are based,
and other facts and circumstances
relevant to the tax treatment of the
interest on and the tax status of the
Notes and the Bonds.

that all formal actions of this Council concerning and relating to the passage of this Ordinance were passed in
an open meeting of this Council, and

Passed June 9, 1997.
Effective June 18, 1997.
Ord. No. 922-97.
By Councilmen Johnson and Westbrook (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance providing for the issuance and sale of
bonds in the maximum principal
amount of $3,250,000 for the purpose
of
providing
funds
to
improve
municipal park and recreation facilities and to pay capitalized interest
and all expenses incurred in connection with the issuance of the
bonds; to authorize agreements with
respect to the bonds; and to authorize the issuance of notes in anticipation of such bonds.
Whereas, this Council desires to
issue bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed Three Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($3,250,000) (the “Bonds”) to
finance the cost of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1; and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of the City, has certified to this Council that the estimated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be financed with
the proceeds of the Bonds is at least
five (5) years and the maximum
maturity of the Bonds is twenty (20)
years; and
Whereas, this Council passed Ordinance No. 1749-80 on October 8, 1980,
and thereafter amended that ordinance by Ordinance No. 1112-83,
passed on May 6, 1983, and Ordinance No. 944-96, passed on June 10,
1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so
amended and as the same may further be amended from time to time
in accordance with its provisions, is
referred to as the “General Bond
Ordinance”), providing the general
terms
and
provisions
for
the
issuance thereunder of unvoted general obligations of the City and the
General Bond Ordinance was passed
in contemplation of this Ordinance
and other ordinances authorizing
the issuance of bonds in accordance
with the provisions thereof (the
“Series Bond Ordinances”); and
Whereas, the issuance of the
Bonds is necessary to provide funds
to pay the costs of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1, which are urgently needed
for the benefit of the City, and as a
result, this Ordinance constitutes an
emergency measure providing for
the immediate preservation of the
public peace, property, health and
safety, and for the usual daily operation of a municipal department;
now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed

Fifty Thousand Dollars ($3,250,000)
for the purpose of providing funds

The City Record
and providing necessary drainage,

signage,
furnishings,
equipment, safety modifications and
site improvements, together with the
payment of all preliminary associated costs and all necessary and
incidental
appurtenances
in
all
cases, including the acquisition of
any required real estate and interests in real estate, and to pay capitalized interest and all expenses
incurred in connection with the
issuance of the Bonds, including all
financing costs within the meaning
of Section 133.01(K) of the Revised
Code and such other costs of the
foregoing permanent improvements
that may be financed with the proceeds of securities as permitted by
Section
133.15(B)
of
the
Ohio
Revised Code and as otherwise permitted by law; and to authorize the
issuance of notes in anticipation of
such Bonds.
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Sections
133.01 to 133.70, inclusive, and other
applicable provisions of the Revised
Code, the Charter of the City, the
General Bond Ordinance and this
Ordinance in the principal amount
and for the purpose stated in Section 1. The Bonds shall be designated “Park and Recreation Facilities
Improvement
Bonds,
Series
1997”. The Bonds shall be issued in
one lot as fully registered Bonds in
denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. The Bonds
shall be numbered as determined by
the Director of Finance.
The Bonds shall be dated as of
August 1, 1997, or such other date,
but in no event later than December
31, 1997, specified in the certificate
of award providing for the final
terms of the Bonds and the sale of
the Bonds and signed by the Director of Finance in accordance with
this Ordinance (the “Certificate of
Award”). The Bonds shall bear
interest at the rate of nine percent
(9%) per year or at the rate or rates
per year specified in the Certificate
of Award; provided that if all the
Bonds bear interest at the same rate
per year, then such rate shall not
exceed nine percent (9%) per year,
and if the Bonds bear interest at
more than one rate per year, then
the weighted average of such rates
(taking into account the principal
amount and maturity of each Bond
to which a rate applies) shall not
exceed nine percent (9%) per year.
Interest on the Bonds shall be
payable, until the principal amount
is paid, semi-annually on February
1 and August 1 of each year or on
the first day of each of two months
specified in the Certificate of Award
as the dates on which interest on
the Bonds shall be payable (the
“Interest Payment Dates”), beginning February 1, 1998 or on such
other Interest Payment Date specified in the Certificate of Award as
the first Interest Payment Date.
The
Bonds
shall
mature
on
August 1 in twenty (20) substantially equal annual installments,
beginning August 1, 1998, or according to the schedule set forth in the
Certificate of Award, provided that
(i) each principal payment shall
occur on an Interest Payment Date
(hereinafter defined), (ii) the first
principal payment on the Bonds
shall be no earlier than January 1,
1998 and no later than August 1,
1999, (iii) the final maturity date of
the Bonds shall be no later than
twenty (20) years from the first

1068

June 18, 1997
principal payment date, and (iv) the
principal amount thereof shall be
payable in annual installments such
that the total principal and interest
payments on the Bonds in any fiscal year in which principal is
payable is not more than three times
the amount of those payments in
any other fiscal year.
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the
“Mandatory
Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption prior to stated maturity
as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent
for payment of principal of and
interest on any Term Bonds shall
include
amounts
sufficient
to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City
for any Term Bonds. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding
the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate is
not timely furnished to the Escrow
Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding
mandatory
redemption
obligation) shall not be reduced. A
credit
against
the
then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding
mandatory redemption obligation)
also shall be received by the City for
any Term Bonds which prior thereto
have been redeemed (other than
through the operation of the Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and canceled by the Registrar, to
the extent not applied
theretofore as a credit against any
mandatory redemption obligation.

June 18, 1997
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of
the principal amount thereof against
the then current Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement (and
corresponding mandatory redemption obligation). Any excess of that
amount
over
the
then
current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement shall be credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligations) in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(b)
Optional
Redemption.
The
Bonds may be subject to redemption
prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole on any
date, or in part on any Interest Payment Date, on the dates and for the
prices specified in the Certificate of
Award, or the Director of Finance
may determine that it is in the best
interests of the City for the Bonds
not to be callable prior to their stated maturity. In the event that the
Bonds are callable, the earliest date
for optional redemption shall be no
later than the tenth anniversary of
the first principal payment date and
the maximum redemption price shall
be no greater than 102% of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued
interest to the redemption date.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar, given upon the direction
of the Council of the City by passage of an ordinance. That notice
shall specify the redemption date
and the principal amount of each
maturity of Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar. In
the event that notice of redemption
shall have been given by the Registrar to the registered owners as
hereinafter provided, there shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, funds
which, in addition to any other moneys available therefor and held by
the Registrar, will be sufficient to
redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus interest accrued to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice
of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Bonds by lot when Bonds of
denominations greater than $5,000
are then outstanding, each $5,000
unit of principal thereof shall be
treated as though it were a separate

The City Record
Bond of the denomination of $5,000.
If it is determined that one or more,
but not all of the $5,000 units of
principal amount represented by a
Bond are to be called for redemption, then upon notice of redemption
of a $5,000 unit or units, the registered owner of that Bond shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i)
for payment of the redemption price
of the $5,000 unit or units called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption and any
premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity
of
the
proceedings
for
the
redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph hereof, the Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due and payable
on the redemption date, and, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the
redemption
price,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date. If
money for the redemption of all of
the Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with interest
accrued thereon to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, so as to be available therefor on that date and, if
notice
of
redemption
has
been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
that money shall not be so available
on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held
by
the
Registrar
for
the
redemption of particular Bonds shall
be held in trust for the account of
the registered owners thereof and
shall be paid to them, respectively,
upon presentation and surrender of
those Bonds.

1069

93
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section
3) at the close of business on the
fifteenth day of the calendar month
next preceding that Interest Payment
Date
(the
Record
Date).
Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond Ordinance,
so long as the Bonds are held by a
Depository in a book entry system
(as described in Section 3), debt
charges on the Bonds will be
payable in lawful money of the United States by wire transfer to the
Depository made by the Escrow
Agent on each Interest Payment
Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance is hereby adopted by reference, and, except for the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 of the General Bond Ordinance
(pertaining generally to the periods
during
which
the
City
is
not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under the
General Bond Ordinance), which are
not included in this Ordinance and
will not apply to the Bonds, the General Bond Ordinance is included as
a part of this Ordinance as fully as
if restated herein. Words and terms
not otherwise defined herein shall
have the same meaning as set forth
in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their faces
the purpose for which they are
issued and that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to
Section 4 of the General Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be authenticated by the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee.
The Bonds shall be signed by the
City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor and
by the City’s Director of Finance or
Acting Director of Finance; provided, however, that in accordance with
Section 9.96 of the Code and the foregoing requirement that each Bond
bear the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee,
either or both of the signatures of
the City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor or
of its Director of Finance or Acting
Director of Finance may be a facsimile. The Bonds shall bear the
seal of the City, which seal may be
a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section
83 of the City’s Charter, the Director of Law or Acting Director of
Law shall prepare the Bonds and
shall endorse thereon his or her
approval of the form and correctness
thereof by his or her manual or facsimile signature.
Star Bank, National Association, is
appointed to act as the authenticating agent, bond registrar, transfer
agent and paying agent for the
Bonds (the Registrar); provided that

94
the Escrow Agent shall also act as
paying agent for the Bonds so long
as the Bonds are held in a book
entry
system.
The
Director
of
Finance shall sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
the Registrar Agreement among the
City, the Registrar and the Escrow
Agent (the Agreement) in substantially the form as is now on file
with the Clerk of Council in File No.
922-97-A.
The
Agreement
is
approved,
together
with
any
changes or amendments that are not
inconsistent with this ordinance and
not substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Agreement or amendments to the
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Agreement from the
proceeds of the Bonds to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided
in this Section (the Bond Register).
Subject to the provisions of Section
5, the person in whose name a Bond
is registered on the Bond Register
shall be regarded as the absolute
owner of that Bond for all purposes
of this ordinance. Payment of or on
account of the debt charges on any
Bond shall be made only to or upon
the order of that person; neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be
affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Bond at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner
or
by
a
person
legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds

The City Record
in accordance with the provisions of
this ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Bonds
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Bonds surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized: (i) the
Bonds may be issued in the form of
a single, fully registered Bond representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the beneficial
owners in book entry form shall
have no right to receive Bonds in
the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for
transfer to another Depository or to
another nominee of a Depository,
without further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book

1070

June 18, 1997
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Bonds from the Depository,
and the Trustee and Registrar shall
authenticate and deliver bond certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking
Fund and, if not purchased by such
Trustees, shall be offered to the
Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased by
such Account, shall be sold to
Lehman Brothers, Merrill, Lynch &
Co., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.,
Pryor, McClendon, Counts & Co.,
Inc., and SBK-Brooks Investment
Corp. (collectively, the “Original
Purchaser”); provided, however, that
if, in the reasonable opinion of the
Director of Finance, an underwriter
is incapable of fully performing its
duties or meeting its obligations in
its capacity as Original Purchaser
with respect to the Bonds, the Director of Finance is hereby authorized
and directed, in the name of and on
behalf of the City, to take whatever actions may be necessary to terminate that underwriter’s standing
as Original Purchaser.
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Bonds as set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement, including: the
principal amount of the Bonds, final
purchase price (which shall be not
less than 97% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate
or rates, the amounts and years in
which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements),
the
Interest Payment Dates and the
date of the Bonds (if different from
those set forth in Section 2) and any
other matters required in this Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. If it is determined advisable
by the Director of Finance for the
sale of the Bonds, the Director of
Finance is authorized to sign agreements with a municipal bond insurer issuing a policy of municipal
bond insurance for the Bonds that
are not materially inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Mayor, Director
of Finance, Director of Law and
other appropriate officers of the
City are, and each of them is, autho-

June 18, 1997
rized and directed to take such
actions as are necessary, appropriate and in the best interest of the
City to establish the terms and
requirements for delivery of the
Bonds and to make such arrangements as are necessary with the
Original Purchaser in order to establish the date, location, and procedure, and conditions for the delivery
of the Bonds to the Original Purchaser,
to
give
all
appropriate
notices and certificates, to cause a
true transcript or proceedings with
reference to the issuance of the
Bonds to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Mayor and the Director
of Finance are, and each of them is,
hereby
further
authorized
and
directed to execute and deliver on
behalf of the City a bond purchase
agreement
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, between the City and the Original Purchaser setting forth the
terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell and the Original
Purchaser agrees to buy the Bonds,
provided that such agreement shall
not provide for or require the terms
of the Bonds to be inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Bond Purchase
Agreement is approved substantially in the form now on the file with
the Clerk of Council in File No. 92297-A, together with any changes or
amendments that are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and not
substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Bond
Purchase
Agreement
or
amendments to the Bond Purchase
Agreement. It is hereby determined
that the terms of the Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance and as may
be provided in or pursuant to the
Certificate of Award, are in the best
interest of the City and in compliance with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an
Official Statement is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
original issuance of the Bonds, those
officers in their official capacities
are authorized to prepare or cause
to be prepared on behalf of the City
an Official Statement and any necessary supplements thereto, and on
behalf of the City to use and distribute, or authorize the use and distribution of, that Official Statement
and any supplements thereto in connection with the original issuance of
the Bonds, and each of those officers is authorized to sign on behalf
of the City and in his or her official
capacity, that Official Statement and
any supplements thereto approved
by such officer. Those officers are
and each of them is authorized to
sign and deliver, on behalf of the
City and in their official capacities,
such certificates in connection with
the accuracy of the Official Statement and any supplements thereto
as may, in their judgment, be necessary or appropriate. Such officers
are also hereby authorized to determine and certify on behalf of the

The City Record
City that such disclosure document
is “deemed final” by the City within the meaning of Securities and
Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12
(the “SEC Rule”).
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under, the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
and directed to prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Bonds in accordance
with the Rule. The performance of
that Agreement shall be subject to
the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of the
occurrence of any other events, the
Director of Finance shall consult
with, as appropriate, the legal counsel and bond or other qualified independent special counsel to the City.
The Director of Finance, acting in
the name and on behalf of the City,
shall be entitled to rely upon any
legal advice provided by any such
counsel in determining whether a
filing should be made.
Pursuant
to
Section
133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds
with other bonds into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of their sale as a single issue to
be designated “Various Purpose General Obligation Bonds, Series 1997”.
Such bonds shall contain a summary statement of purposes encompassing the purpose for which the
Bonds are issued and shall state
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds
promptly when and as the same
falls due, and also to provide for the
discharge of the Bonds at maturity,
there shall be and is hereby levied
on all the taxable property in the
City, in addition to all other taxes,
a direct tax annually during the
period the Bonds are outstanding, in
an amount sufficient to provide for
the payment of that interest, when
and as the same shall fall due, and
also to discharge the principal of
the Bonds at maturity, which tax
shall not be less than the interest
and sinking fund tax required by
Section 11 of Article XII of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied

1071

95
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of those years are certified, extended and collected. The
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from the tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund as provided pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on
the Bonds when and as the same
fall due; provided, however, that,
subject to the provisions of Section
8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in
each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the
Bonds and are appropriated for such
purpose, the amount of such tax
shall be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25 and 5705.51 of the
Revised Code, and in accordance
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the
General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt
charges for the Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended and applied for the objects
and purposes for which the Bonds
are issued. Accrued interest and any
premium received from the sale of
the Bonds shall be deposited in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund to be
applied to the payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Bonds are secured by a pledge and
lien on a parity with the pledges
and liens authorized by the General
Bond Ordinance and, in addition to
the taxes and revenues specifically
pledged pursuant to this Ordinance
and the General Bond Ordinance and
the other covenants, terms and
agreements provided hereunder and
in the General Bond Ordinance to
secure payment of the principal of
and interest on the Bonds, the City
hereby determines, declares, warrants and covenants that the Bonds
are general obligations of the City
and that the full faith and credit of
the City are hereby pledged for the
payment of the principal of and
interest on the Bonds in accordance
with the laws and Constitution of
the State of Ohio, this Ordinance and
the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid
and discharged all the outstanding
Bonds, or there shall otherwise be
paid to the holders of the outstanding Bonds all debt charges due or
to become due thereon, and provision shall also be made for paying
all other sums payable hereunder,
then and in that event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of further
effect, and the covenants, agreements and other obligations of the
City under this Ordinance shall be

96
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the
request of the City execute and
deliver to the City such instruments
in writing as shall discharge the
lien hereof and enter on the record
such discharge of the lien and such
other instruments as may be reasonably required by the City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if:
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or sub-accounts, in trust for and
irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold
in special accounts or sub-accounts,
in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations
of the United States certified by an
independent public accounting firm
of national reputation to be of such
maturities and interest payment
dates and to bear such interest,
without further investment or reinvestment of either the principal
amount thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held
in trust and committed, except as
hereinafter provided), as will be sufficient,
together
with
moneys
referred to in (i) above, for the payment, at their maturities or redemption dates, of all debt charges on the
Bonds to their date of maturity or
redemption, as the case may be, or
if default in such payment shall
have occurred on such date then to
the date of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds
are to be redeemed prior to the
maturity thereof, notice of such
redemption shall have been duly
given or irrevocable provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall have
been duly made for the giving of
such notice. Any moneys held by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with
the provisions of this Section shall
be invested by the Escrow Agent in
direct obligations of the United
States of America maturing, or
redeemable at the option of the holder, at times and in amounts sufficient to meet payment of debt
charges on the Bonds, as directed by
the Director of Finance. Any income
or interest earned by, or increment
to, the investments held under this
Section shall, to the extent determined from time to time by the
Escrow Agent to be in excess of the
amount required to be held by it for
the purposes of this Section, be
transferred at the time of such
determination as provided in Section
17(a) of the General Bond Ordinance
for unclaimed funds held by a Paying Agent. In the event of nonpresentment of any Bond as described
in Section 17(a) of the General Bond

and paid as provided in said Section
17(a) for unclaimed funds held by a
Paying Agent.

Said tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of said year are certified, extended and collected. Said
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from said tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account, which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of the principal and interest of
the Notes or the Bonds in anticipation of which they are issued, when
and as the same falls due; provided,
however, that in each year to the
extent that revenues are available

of the taxable property in the City
may be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.

and the Bonds will not (i) constitute
private activity bonds, arbitrage
bonds or hedge bonds under Sections

(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the Notes
and the Bonds to be and to remain

taken
any
actions

the Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing, (ii) restrict
the yield on investment property
acquired with those proceeds, (iii)
make timely and adequate payments
to the federal government, (iv)

the Bonds is also made with respect
to all issues any portion of the debt
service on which is paid from proceeds of the Notes or the Bonds
(and, if different, the original issue
and any refunding issues in a series
of refundings), to the extent such
compliance is necessary to assure
exclusion of interest on the Notes
and the Bonds from gross income
for federal income tax purposes, and
the officers identified above are
authorized to take actions with
respect to those issues as they are
authorized in this section to take
with respect to the Notes and the

or payments, as determined by that
officer, which action shall be in
writing and signed by the officer,
(b) to take any and all other
actions, make or obtain calculations,
make payments, and make or give
reports, covenants and certifications

limitations set forth in this Series
1997 Bond Legislation, including,
without limitation, the following:
(a)
the

in the case of any Series 1997
Refunding Bonds, except if any
Series 1997 Bonds are to be initially
offered to the public at an original
issue discount, then the maximum
aggregate principal amount of the
Series 1997 Bonds that may be
issued shall be increased over those
amounts by an amount equal to the
sum of the products from multiplying the original issue discount at
which each Series 1997 Bond to be

The City Record
sold with an original issue discount
is to be initially offered to the public by the principal amount of the
Series 1997 Bond to be so offered;
(b) the date or dates of the Series
1997 Bonds;
(c) the Purchase Price;
(d) the Earliest Optional Redemption Date;
(e) the Redemption Prices;
(f)
the
Principal
Retirement
Dates;
(g) the Term Maturity Dates;
(h) the Mandatory Redemption
Dates;
(i)
the
Principal
Retirement
Schedule, including the amount of
any
mandatory
sinking
fund
requirement to be paid on any
Mandatory Redemption Date;
(j) the Specified Interest Rates
for any Series 1997 Bonds that are
not Series 1997 Variable Rate Bonds;
(k) the Capitalized Interest Payment, if any, including any interest
accrued on the Series 1997 Bonds
from their date to the date of the
delivery thereof and payment therefor;
(l) the Renewal and Replacement
Payment attributable to the Series
1997 Bonds;
(m) the amount of proceeds of the
sale of the Series 1997 Bonds to be
deposited
in
the
Bond
Service
Reserve Fund in order to cause the
balance
therein
to
equal
the
Required Bond Service Reserve, if
and to the extent required by the
Third Supplemental Indenture, and
any determination of the Fiscal Officer under Section 4 of this Agreement as to whether there shall be
an alternative special reserve fund
for the Series 1997 Bonds of any
series, separate from the Bond Service Reserve Fund, or a municipal
bond insurance policy, bank letter
or line of credit, or other form of
credit or liquidity facility enhancing
the security for Series 1997 Bonds of
that series in lieu of a funded
reserve fund;
(n) the Paying Agent; and
(o) the determination of the Fiscal Officer pursuant to Section 9 of
this Series 1997 Bond Legislation as
to whether any Series 1997 Bonds of
any series are to be secured by or
payable from a municipal bond
insurance policy, bank letter or line
of credit, or other form of credit or
liquidity facility.
The Series 1997 Certificate of
Award may also specify that the
Series 1997 Bonds may be issued in
one or more separate series, each
bearing a distinctive designation,
provided that the Series 1997 Bonds
of
all
such
series
satisfy
the
requirements of the Indenture and
of this Series 1997 Bond Legislation
as though all such Bonds were of
the same, single series. Separate
series of Series 1997 Bonds may be
issued at the same or different
times, and if separate series of
Series 1997 Bonds are issued at different times, a separate Series 1997
Certificate of Award may be executed for each series. If the Series
1997 Bonds include both Series 1997
Project
Bonds
and
Series
1997
Refunding Bonds but are not identified as such through different
series designations, then the limitations set forth in (a) above shall be
applied to the Series 1997 Bonds
allocated between those purposes.
In the event that the Fiscal Officer determines, based on the advice
of the Issuer’s Financial Advisor,
that the Issuer’s best interests will
be served by causing all or a portion of the Series 1997 Bonds to be

1076

June 18, 1997
Series 1997 Variable Rate Bonds,
then the Fiscal Officer is authorized
to cause such Series 1997 Bonds to
be Series 1997 Variable Rate Bonds
by so specifying in the Series 1997
Certificate of Award. If the Fiscal
Officer so determines, then, in accordance with Section 3.02(c) of the
First Supplemental Indenture, the
Third Supplemental Indenture shall
specify the method and procedure by
which the rate of interest to be
borne by the Series 1997 Variable
Rate Bonds shall be determined, provided that the Series 1997 Variable
Rate Bonds shall not bear interest
at a rate in excess of twelve percent
(12%). That maximum interest rate
shall not apply to Series 1997 Variable Rate Bonds during any period
those Bonds are held by the Credit
Provider as pledged bonds because
they could not be remarketed. The
Third Supplemental Indenture may
also provide for the right of the
holders of Series 1997 Variable Rate
Bonds to tender their Series 1997
Variable Rate Bonds for purchase
by the Issuer at the times, on the
terms, and subject to the conditions
set forth therein, provided that such
tender rights shall be exercisable
only at such times as a credit or liquidity facility is in place that provides for the payment of the purchase price payable to the tendering
holder of a Series 1997 Variable
Rate Bond. If the Fiscal Officer designates any Series 1997 Bonds as
Series 1997 Variable Rate Bonds,
then the Fiscal Officer shall also
designate
in
the
Certificate
of
Award the Credit Provider or Credit Providers for any credit or liquidity facility or facilities to apply
to the Series 1997 Variable Rate
Bonds, and the remarketing agent
or agents for tendered Series 1997
Variable Rate Bonds (if the holders
of the Series 1997 Variable Rate
Bonds are to be entitled to tender
the Series 1997 Variable Rate Bonds
for purchase), which designations
shall be based on the advice of the
Issuer’s Financial Advisor that the
parties so designated possess the
requisite resources and experience
to provide the services required of
them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed
to provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable.
It is hereby determined that the
Purchase Price, the Specified Interest Rates, and the other terms and
details of the Series 1997 Bonds as
so specified and determined in the
Series 1997 Certificate of Award
within the limitations set forth in
this Series 1997 Bond Legislation
will be in the best interest of the
Issuer and consistent with all legal
requirements.
Section 4. Application of Proceeds
of Series 1997 Bonds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Series 1997 Bonds shall be deposited
as follows:
(i) to the Bond Service Fund, that
portion, if any, of such proceeds
constituting the Capitalized Interest
Payment;
(ii) to the Bond Service Reserve
Fund, that portion of such proceeds
required to be deposited in the Bond
Service Reserve Fund in order to
cause the balance therein to equal the
Required Bond Service Reserve, subject to the provisions set forth below
for a lesser or alternative deposit;
(iii) to the Renewal and Replacement Fund, the portion of such proceeds representing the Renewal and
Replacement Payment attributable
to the Series 1997 Bonds;

June 18, 1997
(iv) if Series 1997 Bonds are
issued for the purpose of refunding
outstanding Revenue Bonds, then to
a separate account established in
the Bond Service Fund for that purpose pursuant to Part First of Section 5.03 of the Original Indenture,
the
portion
of
such
proceeds
required to be deposited in that
account to cause the refunded Revenue Bonds to be deemed paid and
discharged
for
purposes
of
the
Indenture; and
(v) to the Construction Fund, the
balance of such proceeds.
Pursuant to Section 3.02(h) of the
First Supplemental Indenture, the
Third Supplemental Indenture may
provide that no deposit to the Bond
Service Reserve Fund shall be made
for or with respect to the Series 1997
Bonds of any series, in which case:
(i) the holders of Series 1997 Bonds
of that series shall have no right or
entitlement to have any portion of
the Bond service charges on Series
1997 Bonds of that series be paid
from amounts in the Bond Service
Reserve Fund, (ii) the lien of and
pledge on the Bond Service Reserve
Fund shall not extend to or be for
the benefit of the holders of Series
1997 Bonds of that series, and (iii)
the Bond service charges on Series
1997 Bonds of that series shall not
be taken into account in determining
the
Required
Bond
Service
Reserve. The Third Supplemental
Indenture alternatively may provide
for the creation of a special reserve
fund solely for Series 1997 Bonds of
any series, separate from the Bond
Service Reserve Fund, and for the
deposit therein of such amount as
may be specified in the Third Supplemental Indenture as the required
reserve for Series 1997 Bonds of that
series or may require the Issuer to
provide a municipal bond insurance
policy, a bank letter or line of credit, or any other form of credit or liquidity facility to enhance the security for Series 1997 Bonds of that
series in lieu of a funded reserve
fund. If the Third Supplemental
Indenture provides for a special
reserve
fund
and
requires
that
deposits be made thereto from Airport Revenues at any time, then
such deposits may be made only
from moneys remaining in the Operating and Maintenance Fund on the
last day of a month before any
deposit is made to the General
Obligation Debt Service Fund (or
the Subordinated Debt Service Fund,
if it shall have been established) or
into any other Special Fund into
which such moneys may be deposited after any required deposits to the
General Obligation Debt Service
Fund. If the Third Supplemental
Indenture provides for no reserve
fund or for a special reserve fund,
then the Third Supplemental Indenture shall also provide that the
amount of any defaulted principal of
or interest on the Series 1997 Bonds
of the applicable series that would
have been timely paid had the
Required Bond Service Reserve for
such Series 1997 Bonds of that series
been fully funded in the Bond Service Reserve Fund shall be paid
only from moneys remaining in the
Operating and Maintenance Fund on
the last day of a month before any
deposit is made to the General
Obligation Debt Service Fund (or
the
Subordinated
Debt
Service
Reserve Fund, if it shall have been
established) or to any other Special
Funds into which such moneys may
be deposited after any required
deposits to the General Obligation

The City Record
Debt Service Fund. The Fiscal Officer is authorized to determine, based
on the advice of the Issuer’s Financial Advisor, which of the options
permitted under this Section 4 for
funding the Bond Service Reserve
Fund or for alternatives to doing so
best serves the Issuer’s interests,
and shall specify that option in the
Series 1997 Certificate of Award.
Section 5. Terms and Provisions
Applicable to the Series 1997 Bonds.
(a) Form; exchange and transfer.
Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the Original Indenture,
(i) all Series 1997 Bonds shall initially be issued in fully registered
form, and (ii) no Series 1997 Bond
shall be exchanged for or transferable into a coupon Revenue Bond or
Bonds unless and until the Indenture shall have been amended in
accordance with the terms thereof to
permit such exchanges or transfers.
To the extent that the Original
Indenture (particularly, but without
limitation, Section 2.05 thereof) permits fully registered Revenue Bonds
to be exchanged for or transferred
into coupon Revenue Bonds or Revenue Bonds payable to bearer, then
the Original Indenture is hereby
amended to prohibit such exchanges
or transfers for the Series 1997
Bonds unless and until the Indenture shall have been amended in
accordance with the terms thereof to
permit such exchanges or transfers.
The Series 1997 Bonds shall be
issued to a Depository for use in a
book entry system and, if and as
long as a book entry system is utilized: (i) the Series 1997 Bonds shall
be issued in the form of a single
registered Series 1997 Bond representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the beneficial
owners in book entry form shall
have no right to receive Series 1997
Bonds in the form of physical securities or certificates; (iii) ownership
of beneficial interests in book entry
form shall be shown by book entry
on the system maintained and operated by the Depository and its participants, and transfers of the ownership of beneficial interests shall
be made only by book entry by the
Depository and its participants; and
(iv) the Bonds as such shall not be
transferable
or
exchangeable,
except
for
transfer
to
another
Depository or to another nominee of
a Depository, without further action
by the Issuer.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Series 1997 Bonds for use in
a book entry system, the Fiscal Officer and Trustee may attempt to
establish
a
securities
depository/book entry relationship
with another qualified Depository. If
the Fiscal Officer and Trustee do
not or are unable to do so, the Director of Finance and Trustee, after
making provision for notification of
the beneficial owners by the then
Depository and any other arrangements deemed necessary, shall permit withdrawal of the Series 1997
Bonds from the Depository, and
authenticate and deliver registered
Series 1997 Bond certificates to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of Issuer
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Executive Officer, the Fiscal
Officer, the Director of Port Control

1077

101
or any one of them are authorized
and directed to the extent necessary
or required to enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with the book entry system
for the Series 1997 Bonds, after
determining (as evidenced by their
signing) that the signing thereof
will not endanger the funds or securities of the Issuer under the Indenture.
(b) Denominations and Dates. The
Series 1997 Bonds shall each be in
the denomination of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof and shall
be dated as of the date or dates
specified in or pursuant to the
Series 1997 Certificate of Award;
provided, however, that so long as a
book entry system is to be used for
the Series 1997 Bonds, then the
Series 1997 Bonds shall be issued in
the form of a single Series 1997
Bond for each maturity. Each Series
1997 Bond shall have only one principal maturity date, except for interim certificates or receipts issued
pending preparation of definitive
Series 1997 Bonds.
(c) Interest and Place of Payment. The Series 1997 Bonds shall
bear interest at their respective
Specified Interest Rates from the
most recent date to which interest
has been paid or duly provided for
or, if no interest has been paid or
duly provided for, from their date.
The principal and Redemption Price,
if any, of and the interest payable
on each Series 1997 Bond shall be
payable at the times, to the persons
and in the manner set forth in the
Indenture, including, without limitation, provisions thereof permitting
special arrangements for payment to
the Depository.
(d) Maturities. The Series 1997
Serial Bonds shall mature on the
Principal Retirement Dates, and the
Series 1997 Term Bonds shall mature
on the Term Maturity Dates, as
specified in the Series 1997 Certificate of Award.
(e)
Optional
and
Mandatory
Redemption. The Series 1997 Bonds
maturing by their stated terms after
the Earliest Optional Redemption
Date shall be subject to redemption
at the option of the Issuer on or
after the earliest Optional Redemption Date in whole on any date or
in part on any Interest Payment
Date at the Redemption Price specified in the Series 1997 Certificate of
Award and in accordance with the
Indenture; provided, however, that
the Series 1997 Certificate of Award
may specify that all or a portion of
the Series 1997 Bonds will not be
subject to redemption at the option
of the Issuer. The Series 1997 Term
Bonds shall also be subject to
mandatory
redemption
prior
to
maturity at the Redemption Price on
each Mandatory Redemption Date in
the aggregate amount of the mandatory sinking fund requirement to be
paid on such Mandatory Redemption
date, all as specified in the Series
1997 Certificate of Award and in
accordance with the Indenture.
(f) Execution. The Series 1997
Bonds shall be executed by the Executive Officer and the Fiscal Officer,
and approved as to form by the Legal
Officer, provided that any or all of
such signatures may be facsimiles,
and shall bear the corporate seal of
the Issuer or a facsimile thereof.
(g) Numbering. The Series 1997
Bonds to be authenticated by the
Trustee shall be numbered and otherwise identified as specified by the
Fiscal Officer in accordance with
the Indenture.

102
Section 6. Refunding of Outstanding Revenue Bonds.
If Series 1997 Bonds are issued for
the purpose of refunding any outstanding Revenue Bonds, then the
Executive Officer, the Fiscal Officer
and the Director of Port Control or
any two of them are authorized and
directed to sign and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of the Issuer,
an escrow agreement between the
Issuer and the Trustee, as escrow
trustee, providing for the investment
and holding in escrow of the proceeds of the Series 1997 Refunding
Bonds to be applied to the refunding of such Revenue Bonds and for
the
application
of
the
moneys
derived from those investments to
the payment of the Bond Service
Charges on such Revenue Bonds.
The Fiscal Officer shall provide for
the payment of the services rendered and for reimbursement of
expenses incurred pursuant to the
escrow agreement from proceeds of
the Series 1997 Refunding Bonds to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose. Provision shall be
made in the escrow agreement to
give the Trustee any written notice
of redemption required under Section 3.02 of the Original Indenture.
The Executive Officer, the Fiscal
Officer, the Director of Port Control
and other appropriate Issuer officials shall execute all documents
and take all other actions necessary
or appropriate on the part of the
Issuer to effect such refunding in
accordance with the Original Indenture and to cause the refunded Revenue Bonds to be deemed paid and
discharged.
Section 7. Tax Covenants.
Certain of the Series 1997 Bonds
are to be issued and sold as obligations bearing interest to be excluded
from gross income for federal income
tax
purposes
(the
“Tax-Exempt
Bonds”). The Issuer covenants that it
will use, and will restrict the use and
investment of, the proceeds of the
Tax-Exempt Bonds in such manner
and to such extent as may be necessary so that (a) the interest on the
Tax-Exempt Bonds will be excluded
from gross income for federal income
tax purposes, and (b) in the case of
any Tax-Exempt Bonds qualifying as
bonds, the interest on which is not
treated as an item of tax preference
under Section 57 of the Code (“NonAMT
Bonds”),
such
Tax-Exempt
Bonds will be treated as Non-AMT
Bonds.
The Issuer further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the TaxExempt Bonds to be and to remain
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will
not take or authorize to be taken
any actions that would adversely
affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or
persons acting for it, will, among
other acts of compliance, (i) apply
the proceeds of the Tax-Exempt
Bonds to the governmental purposes
of the borrowing, (ii) restrict the
yield on investment property, (iii)
make timely and adequate payments
to the federal government, (iv)
maintain books and records and
make calculations and reports, and
(v) refrain from certain uses of
those proceeds and, as applicable, of
property financed with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the
extent necessary to assure such
exclusion of that interest under the
Code.

The City Record
The Fiscal Officer, or any other
officer of the Issuer having responsibility for issuance of the TaxExempt Bonds, is hereby authorized
(a) to make or effect any election,
selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or waiver on behalf
of the Issuer with respect to the
Tax-Exempt Bonds as the Issuer is
permitted or required to make or
give under the federal income tax
laws, including, without limitation
thereto, any of the elections provided for in Section 148(f)(4)(C) of the
Code or available under Section 148
of the Code, for the purpose of
assuring, enhancing or protecting
favorable tax treatment or status of
the Tax-Exempt Bonds or interest
thereon
or
assisting
compliance
with requirements for that purpose,
reducing the burden or expense of
such
compliance,
reducing
the
rebate amount or payments of penalties, or making payments of special
amounts in lieu of making computations to determine, or paying,
excess earnings as rebate, or obviating those amounts or payments, as
determined by that officer, which
action shall be in writing and
signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf
of the Issuer, as may be appropriate
to assure the exclusion of interest
from gross income and the intended
tax status of the Tax-Exempt Bonds,
and (c) to give one or more appropriate certificates of the Issuer, for
inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Tax-Exempt Bonds,
setting forth the reasonable expectations of the Issuer regarding the
amount and use of all the proceeds
of the Tax-Exempt Bonds, the facts,
circumstances
and
estimates
on
which they are based, and other
facts and circumstances relevant to
the tax treatment of the interest on
and the tax status of the TaxExempt Bonds.
Each covenant made in this Section with respect to the Tax-Exempt
Bonds is also made with respect to
all issues any portion of the debt
service on which is paid from proceeds of the Tax-Exempt Bonds
(and, if different, the original issue
and any refunding issues in a series
of refundings), to the extent such
compliance is necessary to assure
exclusion of interest on the TaxExempt Bonds from gross income
for federal income tax purposes, and
the officers identified above are
authorized to take actions with
respect to those issues as they are
authorized in this Section to take
with respect to the Tax-Exempt
Bonds.
Section
8.
Third
Supplemental
Indenture and Other Documents;
Amendments to Use Agreements.
The Executive Officer, the Fiscal
Officer and the Director of Port Control, or any two of them, are hereby authorized and directed, in the
name and on behalf of the Issuer, to
make, execute, acknowledge, and
deliver to the Trustee, a Third Supplemental Indenture, approved as to
form and correctness by the Legal
Officer, substantially in the form on
file with the Clerk in connection
with this Series 1997 Bond Legislation in File No. 923-97-A. The form
of the Third Supplemental Indenture
is approved with such changes
therein as are not inconsistent with
this Series 1997 Bond Legislation
and not adverse to the Issuer and
which are permitted by the Consti-

1078

June 18, 1997
tution and laws of Ohio and as shall
be approved by the officers signing
the Third Supplemental Indenture.
The approval of those changes, and
the determination that such changes
are not adverse to the Issuer, shall
be conclusively evidenced by the
signing of the Third Supplemental
Indenture by those officials. The
Third Supplemental Indenture may
also
include
such
additional
covenants of the Issuer as the Executive Officer, the Fiscal Officer and
the Director of Port Control, or any
two of them signing the Third Supplemental Indenture, deem necessary or appropriate to obtain favorable ratings on or credit enhancement for the Series 1997 Bonds or to
enhance their marketability.
To the extent permitted by the
Indenture, the Issuer is authorized,
from time to time, to enter into one
or more agreements in connection
with or subsequent to the issuance
of the Series 1997 Bonds, for an
interest rate swap, an interest rate
cap, or any other such arrangement
to lower the effective interest rate
on the Series 1997 Bonds or to hedge
the exposure of the Issuer against
fluctuations in prevailing interest
rates (a “Rate Exchange Agreement”), and to secure its obligations
to the counterparties in any such
Rate Exchange Agreements on a
parity with its obligations to holders of Revenue Bonds under the
Indenture, subject to such conditions
and restrictions as may be specified
therein. The Fiscal Officer is authorized, on behalf of the Issuer, to execute and deliver one or more Rate
Exchange Agreements that meet the
requirements of the Indenture and
that he determines, based upon the
advice of the Issuer’s Financial
Advisor, will reduce the net Bond
service charges payable on the
Series 1997 Bonds or otherwise
enhance the timing and amount of
the
payments
thereof
for
the
Issuer’s purposes to an extent that
justifies the cost of the Issuer’s
entering into such Agreements.
The Executive Officer, the Fiscal
Officer, the Director of Port Control,
the Legal Officer, the Clerk and
such other officers of the Issuer as
may be appropriate are authorized
and directed to furnish, execute and
deliver such documents, certifications and instruments as may be
necessary or appropriate to issue
the Series 1997 Bonds and to consummate the transactions contemplated in the Indenture, any Rate
Exchange Agreement, and the Bond
Purchase Agreement described in
Section 9. The Clerk or other appropriate official of the Issuer shall
furnish
the
Original
Purchasers
identified in Section 9 a true transcript of proceedings certified by
the Clerk or other official, of all proceedings had with reference to the
issuance of the Series 1997 Bonds
along with such information for the
records as is necessary to determine
the regularity and validity of the
issuance of the Series 1997 Bonds.
In the event that the Issuer’s
entering into any agreements with
respect to the Series 1997 Bonds or
any
Rate
Exchange
Agreement
requires any amendments to the
Original Indenture as amended and
supplemented by the First and Second Supplemental Indentures that
require the consent of holders of the
requisite percentage of outstanding
Revenue Bonds in order for such
amendments to become effective, in
accordance with Section 13.02 of the
Original Indenture, then, subject to

June 18, 1997
obtaining such consent of those
holders,
the
Third
Supplemental
Indenture may include such amendments to the Original Indenture as
theretofore amended for the purpose
of causing the Indenture to permit
the Issuer, from time to time, to
enter into such agreements. If any
such amendments are required, the
Fiscal Officer is authorized to seek
such consent from the holders of the
Revenue Bonds to be outstanding
upon the issuance of the Series 1997
Bonds, including the Original Purchasers.
This Series 1997 Bond Legislation
shall constitute a part of the Third
Supplemental Indenture as therein
provided and for all purposes thereof, including, without limitation, the
application to this Series 1997 Bond
Legislation of the provisions of the
Indenture relating to amendment,
modification, supplementation and
severability.
The Director of Port Control of
the Issuer is hereby authorized and
directed to execute and deliver to
the Airlines such amendments to the
existing lease and use agreements
as are necessary and appropriate to
cause those agreements to reflect
the issuance of the Series 1997
Bonds and the execution and delivery
of
the
Third
Supplemental
Indenture and to be consistent with
the Third Supplemental Indenture.
Section 9. Designation of Original
Purchasers; Bond Purchase Agreement; Official Statement; Continuing
Disclosure.
The Series 1997 Bonds are hereby
awarded to the following underwriters: Smith Barney Inc., A.G.
Edwards
&
Sons,
Inc.,
Lehman
Brothers, Merrill, Lynch & Co., J.P.
Morgan Securities Inc., and SBKBrooks Investment Corp. (collectively, the “Original Purchasers”); provided, however, that if, in the reasonable opinion of the Fiscal Officer, an underwriter is incapable of
fully performing its duties or meeting its obligations in its capacity as
an Original Purchaser with respect
to the Series 1997 Bonds, the Fiscal
Officer is hereby authorized and
directed, in the name of and on
behalf of the Issuer, to take whatever actions may be necessary to
terminate that underwriter’s standing as Original Purchaser. The Fiscal Officer is further hereby authorized and directed, in the name and
on behalf of the Issuer, to execute
and deliver the Bond Purchase
Agreement, approved as to form and
correctness by the Legal Officer,
which shall incorporate the terms of
the Series 1997 Bonds as determined
pursuant to this Series 1997 Bond
Legislation and the Series 1997 Certificate of Award and shall set forth
the date, location, procedure and
conditions for the delivery of the
Series 1997 Bonds, including without
limitation any conditions relating to
the obtaining of an insurance policy, bank letter or line of credit, or
other form of credit or liquidity
facility to enhance the security or
marketability of the Series 1997
Bonds, the obtaining of which credit or liquidity facility the Fiscal
Officer determines serves the best
interest of the Issuer by achieving
a net reduction in the Bond service
charges on the Series 1997 Bonds.
The Bond Purchase Agreement shall
be substantially in the form now on
file with the Clerk in File No. 92397-A with such changes therein or
thereto not inconsistent with the
Indenture, this Series 1997 Bond
Legislation or the Series 1997 Cer-

The City Record
tificate of Award and not substantially adverse to the Issuer as may
be approved by the Fiscal Officer.
The approval of any such changes
by the Fiscal Officer and the determination by the Fiscal Officer that
no such change is substantially
adverse to the Issuer shall be conclusively evidenced by the execution
of the Bond Purchase Agreement by
the Fiscal Officer.
The Executive Officer, the Fiscal
Officer, the Director of Port Control,
the Legal Officer and other Issuer
officials as appropriate are directed
to make the necessary arrangements
on behalf of the Issuer to establish
the date, location, procedure and
conditions for the delivery of the
Series 1997 Bonds to the Original
Purchaser and to take all actions
necessary to effect due signing,
authentication and delivery of the
Series 1997 Bonds under the terms
of the Series 1997 Bond Legislation,
the Third Supplemental Indenture,
the Bond Purchase Agreement and
the Indenture.
The Executive Officer, the Fiscal
Officer and other Issuer officials as
deemed appropriate, each are authorized and directed, on behalf of the
Issuer and in their official capacities, to (i) prepare or cause to be
prepared, and make or authorize
modifications,
completions
or
changes of or supplements to, a disclosure document in the form of a
preliminary official statement relating to the issuance of the Series
1997 Bonds, and (ii) determine, and
certify or otherwise represent, when
the preliminary official statement as
so prepared is a “deemed final” official statement (except for permitted
omissions) by the Issuer as of its
date for purposes of SEC Rule 15c212(b)(1). The distribution and use
of such a preliminary official statement
is
hereby
authorized
and
approved.
Those officers and each of them
are also authorized and directed, on
behalf of the Issuer and in their
official capacities, to complete that
preliminary official statement with
such modifications, changes and
supplements as those officers shall
approve or authorize for the purpose
of preparing and determining, and
to certify or otherwise represent,
that the official statement as so
revised is a final official statement
for purposes of SEC Rule 15c2-12(b)
(3) and (4). Those officers each are
further authorized to use and distribute, or authorize the use and distribution of, the final official statement and supplements thereto in
connection
with
the
original
issuance of the Series 1997 Bonds as
may, in their judgment, be necessary or appropriate. Those officers
each are further authorized to sign
and deliver, on behalf of the Issuer
and in their official capacities, the
final official statement and such
certificates in connection with the
accuracy of the preliminary official
statement and the final official

also be necessary or appropriate.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Series 1997 Bonds, the Issuer
agrees, in accordance with, and as
an obligated person with respect to
the Series 1997 Bonds under, SEC
Rule 15c2-12, to provide or cause to
be provided such financial information and operating data and notices,
in such manner, as may be required

1079

103
terms of the Issuer’s continuing disclosure agreement for that purpose,
and
thereby
to
implement
that
agreement, including provisions for
enforcement, amendment and termination, the Executive Officer and
the Fiscal Officer are authorized
and directed to prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
Issuer,
a
continuing
disclosure
agreement
or
certificate,
which
shall constitute the continuing disclosure agreement made by the
Issuer for the benefit of the holders
and beneficial owners of the Series
1997 Bonds in accordance with SEC
Rule 15c2-12. The performance of
that agreement shall be subject to
the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the Issuer would be required to
incur to perform it.
The Fiscal Officer is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the Issuer with its continuing
disclosure
agreement,
including the timely provision of
information and notices. Prior to
making any filing in accordance
with that agreement or providing
notice of the occurrence of any other
events, the Fiscal Officer shall consult with, as appropriate, the legal
counsel and bond or other qualified
independent special counsel to the
Issuer. The Fiscal Officer, acting in
the name and on behalf of the
Issuer, shall be entitled to rely upon
any legal advice provided by any
such
counsel
in
determining
whether a filing should be made.
The preparation and distribution
of a preliminary official statement
with respect to the Series 1997 Bonds
are hereby authorized and approved.
A
final
official
statement
with
respect to the Series 1997 Bonds
shall be prepared, executed and
delivered to the Original Purchasers
by the Fiscal Officer and the Director of Port Control, or either of them
on behalf of the Issuer and in their
respective capacities, in form and
substance suitable for the purposes
thereof as the officer or officers executing the same on behalf of the
Issuer shall approve. The Original
Purchasers’ use and distribution of
such Official Statement and any supplements thereto as so executed in
accordance with the terms of the
Bond Purchase Agreement is hereby
authorized and approved.
Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, the Fiscal Officer
may decline to execute and deliver
the Bond Purchase Agreement on
behalf of the Issuer in the event
that the Original Purchasers fail to
offer to purchase the Series 1997
Bonds on terms which are consistent
with the requirements of this Series
1997 Bond Legislation or in the
event that the Fiscal Officer determines that the terms offered by the
Original Purchasers are otherwise
unacceptable to the Issuer, but the
execution of the Bond Purchase
Agreement by the Fiscal Officer
shall
conclusively
evidence
the
absence of any such determination.

Whereas, this Council passed Ordinance No. 1749-80 on October 8, 1980,
and thereafter amended that ordinance by Ordinance No. 1112-83,
passed on May 6, 1983, and Ordinance No. 944-96, passed on June 10,
1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so
amended and as the same may further be amended from time to time
in accordance with its provisions, is
referred to as the “General Bond
Ordinance”), providing the general
terms
and
provisions
for
the
issuance thereunder of unvoted general obligations of the City and the
General Bond Ordinance was passed
in contemplation of this Ordinance
and other ordinances authorizing
the issuance of bonds in accordance
with the provisions thereof (the
“Series Bond Ordinances”); and
Whereas, the issuance of the
Bonds is necessary to provide funds
to advance refund the Refunded
Bonds which will enable the City to
obtain debt service savings which
are urgently needed for the benefit
of the City, and as a result, this
Ordinance constitutes an emergency
measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public, peace,
property, health and safety, and for
the usual daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary that Bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed
Forty-Five
Million
Dollars
($45,000,000) be issued for the purpose
of
advance
refunding
the
Refunded Bonds that the Director of
Finance determines, based on the
advice of the City’s financial advisor, would be advantageous to the
City to advance refund due to savings in bond service charges or the
restructuring of the currently scheduled bond service charges or otherwise to better serve the interests of
the City, and for the purpose of paying any expenses relating to the
advance refunding of the Refunded
Bonds and the issuance of the
Bonds, including all financing costs
within the meaning of Revised Code
Section 133.15(B).
The aggregate principal amount
of Bonds to be issued shall not
exceed $45,000,000 and shall be in an
amount determined by the Director
of Finance to be the aggregate principal amount of Bonds that are
required to be issued, taking into
account
any
discount
from
the
aggregate principal amount of the
Bonds at which they are sold to the
Original Purchaser, in order to
effect the purpose for which the
Bonds are to be issued, including
the payment of any expenses relating to the advance refunding of the
Refunded Bonds and the issuance of
the Bonds, which amount shall be
set forth in the certificate providing
for the final terms of the Bonds and
the sale of the Bonds and signed by
the Director of Finance in accordance with this Ordinance (the “Certificate of Award”). The Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that additional
maturities or different maturities of
the series of unvoted general obligation bonds of the City identified in
the preambles of this Ordinance and
issued for the purpose of providing
funds to pay costs of Project Nos. 1
through 9 may be refunded and
thereby constitute Refunded Bonds;
provided that in adding or changing
such maturities the Director of
Finance determines, based on advice

1081

105
from the City’s financial advisor,
that advance refunding such maturities generates present value debt
service savings to the City or otherwise is in the best interests of the
City, taking into account all the factors that the Director of Finance
and the City’s financial advisor
deem relevant to such determination.
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Revised
Code Chapter 133, and other applicable provisions of the Revised Code,
the Charter of the City, the General
Bond Ordinance, and this Ordinance
in the principal amount and for the
purpose stated in Section 1. The
Bonds shall be designated “Refunding Bonds, Series 1997” or as otherwise determined by the Director of
Finance.
The Bonds shall be issued in one
lot as fully registered Bonds in
denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof but in no case
as to a particular maturity date
exceeding
the
principal
amount
maturing on that date. The Bonds
shall be numbered as determined by
the Director of Finance.
The Bonds shall be dated as of
August 1, 1997 or such other date
specified
in
the
Certificate
of
Award, but in no event later than
December 31, 1997. The Bonds shall
bear interest at the rate of nine percent (9%) per year or at the rate or
rates per year specified in the Certificate of Award; provided that if
all the Bonds bear interest at the
same rate per year, then such rate
shall not exceed nine percent (9%)
per year, and if the Bonds bear
interest at more than one rate per
year, then the weighted average of
such rates (taking into account the
principal amount and maturity of
each Bond to which a rate applies)
shall not exceed nine percent (9%)
per year. Interest on the Bonds shall
be
payable,
until
the
principal
amount is paid, semi-annually on
February 1 and August 1 of each
year or on the first day of each of
two months specified in the Certificate of Award as the dates on which
interest on the Bonds shall be
payable
(the
“Interest
Payment
Dates”), beginning February 1, 1998,
or on such other Interest Payment
Date specified in the Certificate of
Award as the first Interest Payment
Date. The Bonds shall bear interest
from the most recent date to which
interest has been paid or provided
for or, if no interest has been paid
or provided for, from their date.
The Bonds shall mature in the
years and principal amounts as
shall be determined by the Director
of Finance and specified in the Certificate of Award, provided that (i)
each principal payment shall occur
on an Interest Payment Date, (ii)
the first principal payment on the
Bonds shall be no earlier than January 1, 1998 and no later than
August 1, 1999, (iii) the final maturity date of the Bonds shall be no
later than the last maturity permitted by law for the Refunded Bonds,
and (iv) the principal amount thereof shall be payable in annual
installments such that the total principal and interest payments on the
Bonds in any fiscal year in which
principal is payable, is not more
than three times the amount of
those payments for the Refunded
Bonds in any fiscal year in which
principal
was
payable
on
the
Refunded Bonds.

106
The Director of Finance also
shall determine, in the Certificate of
Award or otherwise, on or prior to
the date of delivery of the Bonds to
the Original Purchaser, that portion
of the aggregate principal amount
of the Bonds that is allocable to
each Project, and the principal
amount of Bonds allocated to each
Project that shall be payable annually at stated maturity or pursuant
to Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements
(as
defined
below) on each principal payment
date; provided, that (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds
allocable to a Project shall be determined by the Director of Finance on
a pro rata basis by reference to the
respective amount of funds that is
required for the advance refunding
of the Refunded Bonds that are allocable to that Project, taking into
account any funds other than the
proceeds of the Bonds that are available and appropriated for that purpose, (ii) no portion of the aggregate principal amount of Bonds allocated to a Project shall be payable
later than the maximum maturity
for that portion of the Bonds as certified by the Director of Finance,
and (iii) a portion of the aggregate
principal amount of Bonds allocated
to a Project shall be payable annually at stated maturity or pursuant
to Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements on each principal
payment date on which the Director
of Finance determines in the Certificate of Award or otherwise that
principal of Bonds allocated to that
Project shall be payable.
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The
Director
of
Finance
shall
determine
in
the
Certificate
of
Award whether any of the Bonds
shall be issued as Term Bonds, any
dates (the “Mandatory Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption prior to stated maturity
as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent
for payment of principal of and
interest on any Term Bonds shall
include
amounts
sufficient
to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit

The City Record
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City
for any Term Bonds. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds which
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and canceled
by the Registrar, to the extent not
applied
theretofore
as
a
credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of
the principal amount thereof against
the then current Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement (and
corresponding mandatory redemption obligation). Any excess of that
amount
over
the
then
current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement shall be credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligations) in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(b)
Optional
Redemption.
The
Bonds may be subject to redemption
prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole on any
date, or in part on any Interest Payment Date, on the dates and for the
prices specified in the Certificate of
Award, or the Director of Finance
may determine that it is in the best
interests of the City for the Bonds
not to be callable prior to their stated maturity. In the event that the
Bonds are callable, the earliest date
for optional redemption shall be no
later than the tenth anniversary of
the first principal payment date and
the maximum redemption price shall
be no greater than 102% of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued
interest to the redemption date.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar, given upon the direction
of the Council of the City by passage of an ordinance. That notice
shall specify the redemption date
and the principal amount of each
maturity of Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption

1082

June 18, 1997
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar. In
the event that notice of redemption
shall have been given by the Registrar to the registered owners as
hereinafter provided, there shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, funds
which, in addition to any other moneys available therefor and held by
the Registrar, will be sufficient to
redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus interest accrued to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice
of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Bonds by lot when Bonds of
denominations greater than $5,000
are then outstanding, each $5,000
unit of principal thereof shall be
treated as though it were a separate
Bond of the denomination of $5,000.
If it is determined that one or more,
but not all of the $5,000 units of
principal amount represented by a
Bond are to be called for redemption, then upon notice of redemption
of a $5,000 unit or units, the registered owner of that Bond shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i)
for payment of the redemption price
of the $5,000 unit or units called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption and any
premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity
of
the
proceedings
for
the
redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph hereof, the Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due and payable
on the redemption date, and, upon

June 18, 1997
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the
redemption
price,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date. If
money for the redemption of all of
the Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with interest
accrued thereon to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, so as to be available therefor on that date and, if
notice
of
redemption
has
been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
that money shall not be so available
on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held
by
the
Registrar
for
the
redemption of particular Bonds shall
be held in trust for the account of
the registered owners thereof and
shall be paid to them, respectively,
upon presentation and surrender of
those Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that person’s address appearing, on the Bond
Register (as defined in Section 3) at
the close of business on the fifteenth
day of the calendar month next preceding that Interest Payment Date
(the Record Date). Notwithstanding
any contrary provision in the General Bond Ordinance, so long as the
Bonds are held by a Depository in a
book entry system (as described in
Section 3), debt charges on the
Bonds will be payable in lawful
money of the United States by wire
transfer to the Depository made by
the Escrow Agent on each Interest
Payment Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance is hereby adopted by reference, and, except for the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 of the General Bond Ordinance
(pertaining generally to the periods
during
which
the
City
is
not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under the
General Bond Ordinance), which are
not included in this Ordinance and
will not apply to the Bonds, the General Bond Ordinance is included as
a part of this Ordinance as fully as
if restated herein. Words and terms
not otherwise defined herein shall
have the same meaning as set forth
in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their faces
the purpose for which they are

The City Record
issued and that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to
Section 4 of the General Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be authenticated by the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee.
The Bonds shall be signed by the
City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor and
by the City’s Director of Finance or
Acting Director of Finance; provided, however, that in accordance with
Section 9.96 of the Code and the foregoing requirement that each Bond
bear the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee,
either or both of the signatures of
the City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor or
of its Director of Finance or Acting
Director of Finance may be a facsimile. The Bonds shall bear the
seal of the City, which seal may be
a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section
83 of the City’s Charter, the Director of Law or Acting Director of
Law shall prepare the Bonds and
shall endorse thereon his or her
approval of the form and correctness
thereof by his or her manual or facsimile signature.
Star Bank, N.A., is appointed to act
as the authenticating agent, bond
registrar, transfer agent and paying
agent for the Bonds (the Registrar);
provided that the Escrow Agent also
shall act as paying agent for the
Bonds so long as the Bonds are held
in a book entry system. The Director of Finance shall sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City,
the
Registrar
Agreement
among the City, the Registrar and
the Escrow Agent (the Agreement)
in substantially the form as is now
on file with the Clerk of Council in
File No. 924-97-A. The Agreement is
approved, together with any changes
or amendments that are not inconsistent with this ordinance and not
substantially adverse to the City and
that are approved by the Director of
Finance on behalf of the City, all of
which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of the Agreement or amendments to the Agreement. The Director of Finance shall
provide for the payment of the services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant
to the Agreement from the proceeds
of the Bonds to the extent available
and then from other money lawfully
available and appropriated or to be
appropriated for that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided in
this Section (the Bond Register).
Subject to the provisions of Section
5, the person in whose name a Bond
is registered on the Bond Register
shall be regarded as the absolute
owner of that Bond for all purposes
of this ordinance. Payment of or on
account of the debt charges on any
Bond shall be made only to or upon
the order of that person; neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be
affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid and
effectual to satisfy and discharge
the City’s liability upon the Bond,
including interest, to the extent of
the amount or amounts so paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender
at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together with
a request for exchange signed by

1083

107
the registered owner or by a person
legally empowered to do so in a
form satisfactory to the Registrar. A
Bond may be transferred only on the
Bond Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Bond at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar
together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in a form satisfactory
to the Registrar. Upon exchange or
transfer the Registrar shall complete, authenticate and deliver a new
Bond or Bonds of any authorized
denomination
or
denominations
requested by the owner equal in the
aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond surrendered
and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of
this ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Bonds
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Bonds surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.

108
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a
book entry system is utilized: (i)
the Bonds may be issued in the
form of a single, fully registered
Bond representing each maturity
and registered in the name of the
Depository or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the
custody of the Depository; (ii) the
beneficial owners in book entry
form shall have no right to receive
Bonds in the form of physical securities or certificates; (iii) ownership
of beneficial interests in book entry
form shall be shown by book entry
on the system maintained and operated by the Depository and its Participants, and transfers of the ownership of beneficial interests shall
be made only by book entry by the
Depository and its Participants; and
(iv) the Bonds as such shall not be
transferable
or
exchangeable,
except
for
transfer
to
another
Depository or to another nominee of
a Depository, without further action
by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Bonds from the Depository,
and the Trustee and Registrar shall
authenticate and deliver bond certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking
Fund and, if not purchased by such
Trustees, shall be offered to the
Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased by
such Account, shall be sold to
Lehman Brothers, Merrill, Lynch &
Co., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.,
Pryor, McClendon, Counts & Co.,
Inc., and SBK-Brooks Investment
Corp. (collectively, the “Original
Purchaser”); provided, however, that
if, in the reasonable opinion of the
Director of Finance, an underwriter
is incapable of fully performing its
duties or meeting its obligations in
its capacity as Original Purchaser
with respect to the Bonds, the Director of Finance is hereby authorized
and directed, in the name of and on
behalf of the City, to take whatever actions may be necessary to terminate that underwriter’s standing
as Original Purchaser.
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in

The City Record
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Bonds as set forth in the Bond Purchase
Agreement
including:
the
principal amount of the Bonds, the
final purchase price (which shall be
not less than 97% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest to
their date of delivery), the interest
rate or rates, the amounts and years
in which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements),
the
Interest Payment Dates and the
date of the Bonds (if different from
those set forth in Section 2) and the
portion of the principal amount of
the Bonds allocable to each Project.
If it is determined advisable by the
Director of Finance for the sale of
the Bonds, the Director of Finance
is authorized to sign agreements
with a municipal bond insurer issuing a policy of municipal bond
insurance for the Bonds that are not
materially inconsistent with this
Ordinance. The Mayor, Director of
Finance, Director of Law and other
appropriate officers of the City are,
and each of them is, authorized and
directed to take such actions as are
necessary, appropriate and in the
best interest of the City to establish
the terms and requirements for
delivery of the Bonds and to make
such arrangements as are necessary
with the Original Purchaser in order
to establish the date, location, and
procedure, and conditions for the
delivery of the Bonds to the Original Purchaser, to give all appropriate notices and certificates, to cause
a true transcript or proceedings
with reference to the issuance of the
Bonds to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Mayor and the Director
of Finance are, and each of them is,
hereby
further
authorized
and
directed to execute and deliver on
behalf of the City a bond purchase
agreement
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, between the City and the Original Purchaser setting forth the
terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell and the Original
Purchaser agrees to buy the Bonds,
provided that such agreement shall
not provide for or require the terms
of the Bonds to be inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Bond Purchase
Agreement is approved substantially in the form now on the file with
the Clerk of Council in the File No.
referenced in Section 3 of this Ordinance, together with any changes or
amendments that are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and not
substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Bond
Purchase
Agreement
or
amendments to the Bond Purchase
Agreement. It is hereby determined
that the terms of the Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance and as may
be provided in or pursuant to the
Certificate of Award, are in the best
interest of the City and in compliance with all legal requirements.

1084

June 18, 1997
If, in the judgment of the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an
Official Statement is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
original issuance of the Bonds, those
officers in their official capacities
are authorized to prepare or cause
to be prepared on behalf of the City
an Official Statement and any necessary supplements thereto, and on
behalf of the City to use and distribute, or authorize the use and distribution of, that Official Statement
and any supplements thereto in connection with the original issuance of
the Bonds, and each of those officers is authorized to sign on behalf
of the City and in his or her official
capacity, that Official Statement and
any supplements thereto approved
by such officer. Those officers are
and each of them is authorized to
sign and deliver, on behalf of the
City and in their official capacities,
such certificates in connection with
the accuracy of the Official Statement and any supplements thereto
as may, in their judgment, be necessary or appropriate. Such officers
are also hereby authorized to determine and certify on behalf of the
City that such disclosure document
is “deemed final” by the City within the meaning of Securities and
Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12
(the “SEC Rule”).
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under, the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
and directed to prepare or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute an agreement made by the
City for the benefit of the holders
and beneficial owners of the Bonds
in accordance with the Rule. The
City’s performance of that agreement shall be subject to the availability of funds and their annual
appropriation to meet costs the City
would be required to incur to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of the
occurrence of any other events, the
Director of Finance shall consult
with, as appropriate, the legal counsel and bond or other qualified independent special counsel to the City.
The Director of Finance, acting in
the name and on behalf of the City,
shall be entitled to rely upon any
legal advice provided by any such
counsel in determining whether a
filing should be made.
Pursuant
to
Section
133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds
with other bonds into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purpos-

June 18, 1997
es of their sale as a single issue to
be designated “Various Purpose General Obligation Bonds, Series 1997”.
Such bonds shall contain a summary statement of purposes encompassing the purpose for which the
Bonds are issued and shall state
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds
promptly when and as the same
falls due, and also to provide for the
discharge of the Bonds at maturity,
there shall be and is hereby levied
on all the taxable property in the
City, in addition to all other taxes,
a direct tax annually during the
period the Bonds are outstanding, in
an amount sufficient to provide for
the payment of that interest, when
and as the same shall fall due, and
also to discharge the principal of
the Bonds at maturity, which tax
shall not be less than the interest
and sinking fund tax required by
Section 11 of Article XII of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of those years are certified, extended and collected. The
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from the tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund as provided pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on
the Bonds when and as the same
fall due; provided, however, that,
subject to the provisions of Section
8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in
each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the
Bonds and are appropriated for such
purpose, the amount of such tax
shall be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25 and 5705.51 of the
Revised Code, and in accordance
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the
General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt
charges for the Bonds.

for (a) accrued interest thereon and
any premium and (b) the proceeds
of the Bonds to be applied to pay

the part of the City to effect the
refunding of the Refunded Bonds in
accordance with the General Bond

as otherwise directed by law, and to
cause the Refunded Bonds to be
deemed paid and discharged.
If U.S. Treasury Securities —
State and Local Government Series
are to be purchased for the Escrow
Fund, the Escrow Agent is hereby
specifically authorized to file, on
behalf of the City, subscriptions for
the purchase and issuance of those
U.S. Treasury Securities - State and
Local Government Series.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Bonds are secured by a pledge and
lien on a parity with the pledges
and liens authorized by the General
Bond Ordinance and, in addition to
the taxes and revenues specifically
pledged pursuant to this Ordinance
and the General Bond Ordinance and
the other covenants, terms and
agreements provided hereunder and
in the General Bond Ordinance to
secure payment of the principal of
and interest on the Bonds, the City

1085

109
hereby determines, declares, warrants and covenants that the Bonds
are general obligations of the City
and that the full faith and credit of
the City are hereby pledged for the
payment of the principal of and
interest on the Bonds in accordance
with the laws and Constitution of
the State of Ohio, this Ordinance and
the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid
and discharged all the outstanding
Bonds, or there shall otherwise be
paid to the holders of the outstanding Bonds all debt charges due or
to become due thereon, and provision shall also be made for paying
all other sums payable hereunder,
then and in that event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of further
effect, and the covenants, agreements and other obligations of the
City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the
request of the City execute and
deliver to the City such instruments
in writing as shall discharge the
lien hereof and enter on the record

other instruments as may be reasonably required by the City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of

irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold
in special accounts or sub-accounts,
in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations

referred to in (i) above, for the payment, at their maturities or redemption dates, of all debt charges on the
Bonds to their date of maturity or
redemption, as the case may be, or
if default in such payment shall
have occurred on such date then to
the date of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds
are to be redeemed prior to the
maturity thereof, notice of such
redemption shall have been duly
given or irrevocable provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall have
been duly made for the giving of
such notice. Any moneys held by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with
the provisions of this Section shall
be invested by the Escrow Agent in
direct obligations of the United
States of America maturing, or
redeemable at the option of the holder, at times and in amounts sufficient to meet payment of debt
charges on the Bonds, as directed by
the Director of Finance. Any income
or interest earned by, or increment
to, the investments held under this
Section shall, to the extent determined from time to time by the
Escrow Agent to be in excess of the
amount required to be held by it for
the purposes of this Section, be

110
transferred at the time of such
determination as provided in Section
17(a) of the General Bond Ordinance
for unclaimed funds held by a Paying Agent. In the event of nonpresentment of any Bond as described
in Section 17(a) of the General Bond
Ordinance, the moneys held pursuant to this Section shall be held
and paid as provided in said Section
17(a) for unclaimed funds held by a
Paying Agent.
Section 9. Miscellaneous.

are inconsistent with the provisions
of this Ordinance and the General
Bond Ordinance shall not apply to
the Bonds authorized herein.
(b) All covenants, terms and provisions of the General Bond Ordinance are fully applicable to the
Bonds authorized herein, and nothing in this Ordinance shall be
deemed to alter or restrict such full
application of the General Bond
Ordinance, except for the exclusion

the third paragraph of Section 4 of
the General Bond Ordinance pursuant to Section 2 of this Ordinance.

Section
11.
Federal
Tax
Covenants. The City covenants that
it will use, and will restrict the use
and investment of, the proceeds of
the Bonds in such manner and to
such extent as may be necessary so
that (a) the Bonds will not (i) constitute private activity bonds, arbitrage bonds or hedge bonds under
Sections 141, 148 or 149 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) or (ii) be treated
other than as bonds to which Section 103(a) of the Code applies, and
(b) the interest thereon will not be
treated as an item of tax preference
under Section 57 of the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required of
it for the interest on the Bonds to be
and to remain excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, and (b) it will not take or
authorize to be taken any actions
that would adversely affect that
exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting for it, will, among other acts of
compliance, (i) apply the proceeds of
the Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing, (ii) restrict
the yield on investment property
acquired with those proceeds, (iii)
make timely and adequate payments
to the federal government, (iv) maintain books and records and make calculations and reports, and (v) refrain

made with respect to all issues any
portion of the debt service on which
is paid from proceeds of the Bonds
(and, if different, the original issue
and any refunding issues in a series
of refundings), to the extent such
compliance is necessary to assure
exclusion of interest on the Bonds
from gross income for federal income
tax purposes, and the officers identified above are authorized to take

purpose, reducing the burden or
expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or payments
or penalties, or making payments of
special amounts in lieu of making

which action shall be in writing and
signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants

tax status of the Bonds.

Passed June 9, 1997.
Effective June 18, 1997.
Ord. No. 925-97.
By Councilman Westbrook (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance providing for the issuance and sale of
bonds in the maximum principal
amount of $1,150,000 for the purpose
of
providing
funds
for
public
improvements of municipal properties and easements in residential
areas and to pay capitalized interest and all expenses incurred in connection with the issuance of the
bonds; to authorize agreements with
respect to the bonds; and to authorize the issuance of notes in anticipation of such bonds.
Whereas, this Council desires to
issue bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed One Million One Hundred Fifty Thousand

June 18, 1997
Dollars ($1,150,000) (the “Bonds”) to
finance the cost of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1; and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of the City, has certified to this Council that the estimated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be financed with
the proceeds of the Bonds is at least
five (5) years and the maximum
maturity of the Bonds is twenty (20)
years; and
Whereas, this Council passed Ordinance No. 1749-80 on October 8, 1980,
and thereafter amended that ordinance by Ordinance No. 1112-83,
passed on May 6, 1983, and Ordinance No. 944-96, passed on June 10,
1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so
amended and as the same may further be amended from time to time
in accordance with its provisions, is
referred to as the “General Bond
Ordinance”), providing the general
terms
and
provisions
for
the
issuance thereunder of unvoted general obligations of the City and the
General Bond Ordinance was passed
in contemplation of this Ordinance
and other ordinances authorizing
the issuance of bonds in accordance
with the provisions thereof (the
“Series Bond Ordinances”); and
Whereas, the issuance of the
Bonds is necessary to provide funds
to pay the costs of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1, which are urgently needed
for the benefit of the City, and as a
result, this Ordinance constitutes an
emergency measure providing for
the immediate preservation of the
public peace, property, health and
safety, and for the usual daily operation of a municipal department;
now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary to issue the Bonds in an
aggregate principal amount not to
exceed One Million One Hundred
Fifty Thousand Dollars ($1,150,000)
for the purpose of providing funds
for public improvements of municipal properties and easements in residential areas by constructing and
reconstructing sidewalks, curbs, gutters
and
driveway
approaches,
together with the provision of all
necessary and incidental appurtenances in all cases, including the
acquisition of any required real
estate and interests in real estate,
and to pay capitalized interest and
all expenses incurred in connection
with the issuance of the Bonds,
including any financing costs within the meaning of Revised Code Section 133.01(K), and such other costs
of the foregoing permanent improvements that may be financed with
the proceeds of securities as permitted by Revised Code Section
133.15(B) and as otherwise permitted by law; and to authorize the
issuance of notes in anticipation of
such Bonds.
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Sections
133.01 to 133.70, inclusive, and other
applicable provisions of the Revised
Code, the Charter of the City, the
General Bond Ordinance and this
Ordinance in the principal amount
and for the purpose stated in Section 1. The Bonds shall be designated “Residential Areas Improvement Bonds, Series 1997”. The Bonds
shall be issued in one lot as fully
registered Bonds in denominations
of $5,000 or any integral multiple

The City Record
thereof. The Bonds shall be numbered as determined by the Director
of Finance.
The Bonds shall be dated as of
August 1, 1997, or such other date,
but in no event later than December
31, 1997, specified in the certificate
of award providing for the final
terms of the Bonds and the sale of
the Bonds and signed by the Director of Finance in accordance with
this Ordinance (the “Certificate of
Award”). The Bonds shall bear
interest at the rate of nine percent
(9%) per year or at the rate or rates
per year specified in the Certificate
of Award; provided that if all the
Bonds bear interest at the same rate
per year, then such rate shall not
exceed nine percent (9%) per year,
and if the Bonds bear interest at
more than one rate per year, then
the weighted average of such rates
(taking into account the principal
amount and maturity of each Bond
to which a rate applies) shall not
exceed nine percent (9%) per year.
Interest on the Bonds shall be
payable, until the principal amount
is paid, semi-annually on February
1 and August 1 of each year or on
the first day of each of two months
specified in the Certificate of Award
as the dates on which interest on
the Bonds shall be payable (the
“Interest Payment Dates”), beginning February 1, 1998 or on such
other Interest Payment Date specified in the Certificate of Award as
the first Interest Payment Date.
The
Bonds
shall
mature
on
August 1 in twenty (20) substantially equal annual installments,
beginning August 1, 1998, or according to the schedule set forth in the
Certificate of Award, provided that
(i) each principal payment shall
occur on an Interest Payment Date
(hereinafter defined), (ii) the first
principal payment on the Bonds
shall be no earlier than January 1,
1998 and no later than August 1,
1999, (iii) the final maturity date of
the Bonds shall be no later than
twenty (20) years from the first
principal payment date, and (iv) the
principal amount thereof shall be
payable in annual installments such
that the total principal and interest
payments on the Bonds in any fiscal year in which principal is
payable is not more than three times
the amount of those payments in
any other fiscal year.
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the
“Mandatory
Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption prior to stated maturity
as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100

1087

111
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent
for payment of principal of and
interest on any Term Bonds shall
include
amounts
sufficient
to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City
for any Term Bonds. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds which
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and canceled
by the Registrar, to the extent not
applied
theretofore
as
a
credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of
the
principal
amount
thereof
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption
obligation).
Any
excess of that amount over the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement shall be
credited against subsequent Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements (and corresponding
mandatory redemption obligations)
in the order directed by the Director of Finance.
(b) Optional
Redemption. The
Bonds may be subject to redemption
prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole on any
date, or in part on any Interest Payment Date, on the dates and for the
prices specified in the Certificate of
Award, or the Director of Finance
may determine that it is in the best
interests of the City for the Bonds
not to be callable prior to their stated maturity. In the event that the
Bonds are callable, the earliest date
for optional redemption shall be no
later than the tenth anniversary of
the first principal payment date and
the
maximum
redemption
price
shall be no greater than 102% of the
principal amount redeemed, plus
accrued interest to the redemption
date.

112
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar, given upon the direction
of the Council of the City by passage of an ordinance. That notice
shall specify the redemption date
and the principal amount of each
maturity of Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar. In
the event that notice of redemption
shall have been given by the Registrar to the registered owners as
hereinafter provided, there shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, funds
which, in addition to any other moneys available therefor and held by
the Registrar, will be sufficient to
redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus interest accrued to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice
of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Bonds by lot when Bonds of
denominations greater than $5,000
are then outstanding, each $5,000
unit of principal thereof shall be
treated as though it were a separate
Bond of the denomination of $5,000.
If it is determined that one or more,
but not all of the $5,000 units of
principal amount represented by a
Bond are to be called for redemption, then upon notice of redemption
of a $5,000 unit or units, the registered owner of that Bond shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i)
for payment of the redemption price
of the $5,000 unit or units called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption and any
premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the

The City Record
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity
of
the
proceedings
for
the
redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph hereof, the Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due and payable
on the redemption date, and, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the
redemption
price,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date. If
money for the redemption of all of
the Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with interest
accrued thereon to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, so as to be available therefor on that date and, if
notice
of
redemption
has
been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
that money shall not be so available
on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held
by
the
Registrar
for
the
redemption of particular Bonds shall
be held in trust for the account of
the registered owners thereof and
shall be paid to them, respectively,
upon presentation and surrender of
those Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section
3) at the close of business on the
fifteenth day of the calendar month
next preceding that Interest Payment
Date
(the
Record
Date).
Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond Ordinance,
so long as the Bonds are held by a
Depository in a book entry system
(as described in Section 3), debt
charges on the Bonds will be
payable in lawful money of the United States by wire transfer to the
Depository made by the Escrow
Agent on each Interest Payment
Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance is hereby adopted by reference, and, except for the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) of the

1088

June 18, 1997
General Bond Ordinance (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 of the General Bond Ordinance
(pertaining generally to the periods
during
which
the
City
is
not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under the
General Bond Ordinance), which are
not included in this Ordinance and
will not apply to the Bonds, the General Bond Ordinance is included as
a part of this Ordinance as fully as
if restated herein. Words and terms
not otherwise defined herein shall
have the same meaning as set forth
in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their faces
the purpose for which they are
issued and that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to
Section 4 of the General Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be authenticated by the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee.
The Bonds shall be signed by the
City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor and
by the City’s Director of Finance or
Acting Director of Finance; provided, however, that in accordance with
Section 9.96 of the Code and the foregoing requirement that each Bond
bear the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee,
either or both of the signatures of
the City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor or
of its Director of Finance or Acting
Director of Finance may be a facsimile. The Bonds shall bear the
seal of the City, which seal may be
a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section
83 of the City’s Charter, the Director of Law or Acting Director of
Law shall prepare the Bonds and
shall endorse thereon his or her
approval of the form and correctness
thereof by his or her manual or facsimile signature.
Star Bank, National Association, is
appointed to act as the authenticating agent, bond registrar, transfer
agent and paying agent for the
Bonds (the Registrar); provided that
the Escrow Agent shall also act as
paying agent for the Bonds so long
as the Bonds are held in a book
entry
system.
The
Director
of
Finance shall sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
the Registrar Agreement among the
City, the Registrar and the Escrow
Agent (the Agreement) in substantially the form as is now on file
with the Clerk of Council in File No.
925-97-A.
The
Agreement
is
approved,
together
with
any
changes or amendments that are not
inconsistent with this ordinance and
not substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Agreement or amendments to the
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Agreement from the
proceeds of the Bonds to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange

June 18, 1997
and transfer of Bonds as provided
in this Section (the Bond Register).
Subject to the provisions of Section
5, the person in whose name a Bond
is registered on the Bond Register
shall be regarded as the absolute
owner of that Bond for all purposes
of this ordinance. Payment of or on
account of the debt charges on any
Bond shall be made only to or upon
the order of that person; neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be
affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid. Any Bond may be exchanged
for Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate
trust office of the Registrar, together with a request for exchange
signed by the registered owner or
by a person legally empowered to do
so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. A Bond may be transferred
only on the Bond Register upon presentation and surrender of the Bond
at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar together with
an assignment signed by the registered owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of
this ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Bonds
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Bonds surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee

The City Record
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized: (i) the
Bonds may be issued in the form of
a single, fully registered Bond representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the beneficial
owners in book entry form shall
have no right to receive Bonds in
the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for
transfer to another Depository or to
another nominee of a Depository,
without further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Bonds from the Depository,
and the Trustee and Registrar shall
authenticate and deliver bond certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking
Fund and, if not purchased by such
Trustees, shall be offered to the

1089

113
Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased by
such Account, shall be sold to
Lehman Brothers, Merrill, Lynch &
Co., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.,
Pryor, McClendon, Counts & Co.,
Inc., and SBK-Brooks Investment
Corp. (collectively, the “Original
Purchaser”); provided, however, that
if, in the reasonable opinion of the
Director of Finance, an underwriter
is incapable of fully performing its
duties or meeting its obligations in
its capacity as Original Purchaser
with respect to the Bonds, the Director of Finance is hereby authorized
and directed, in the name of and on
behalf of the City, to take whatever actions may be necessary to terminate that underwriter’s standing
as Original Purchaser.
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Bonds as set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement, including: the
principal amount of the Bonds, final
purchase price (which shall be not
less than 97% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate
or rates, the amounts and years in
which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements),
the
Interest Payment Dates and the
date of the Bonds (if different from
those set forth in Section 2) and any
other matters required in this Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. If it is determined advisable
by the Director of Finance for the
sale of the Bonds, the Director of
Finance is authorized to sign agreements with a municipal bond insurer issuing a policy of municipal
bond insurance for the Bonds that
are not materially inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Mayor, Director
of Finance, Director of Law and
other appropriate officers of the
City are, and each of them is, authorized and directed to take such
actions as are necessary, appropriate and in the best interest of the
City to establish the terms and
requirements for delivery of the
Bonds and to make such arrangements as are necessary with the
Original Purchaser in order to establish the date, location, and procedure, and conditions for the delivery
of the Bonds to the Original Purchaser,
to
give
all
appropriate
notices and certificates, to cause a
true transcript or proceedings with
reference to the issuance of the
Bonds to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Mayor and the Director
of Finance are, and each of them is,
hereby
further
authorized
and
directed to execute and deliver on
behalf of the City a bond purchase
agreement
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, between the City and the Original Purchaser setting forth the
terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell and the Original

114
Purchaser agrees to buy the Bonds,
provided that such agreement shall
not provide for or require the terms
of the Bonds to be inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Bond Purchase
Agreement is approved substantially in the form now on the file with
the Clerk of Council in File No. 92597-A, together with any changes or
amendments that are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and not
substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Bond
Purchase
Agreement
or
amendments to the Bond Purchase
Agreement. It is hereby determined
that the terms of the Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance and as may
be provided in or pursuant to the
Certificate of Award, are in the best
interest of the City and in compliance with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an
Official Statement is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
original issuance of the Bonds, those
officers in their official capacities
are authorized to prepare or cause
to be prepared on behalf of the City
an Official Statement and any necessary supplements thereto, and on
behalf of the City to use and distribute, or authorize the use and distribution of, that Official Statement
and any supplements thereto in connection with the original issuance of
the Bonds, and each of those officers is authorized to sign on behalf
of the City and in his or her official
capacity, that Official Statement and
any supplements thereto approved
by such officer. Those officers are
and each of them is authorized to
sign and deliver, on behalf of the
City and in their official capacities,
such certificates in connection with
the accuracy of the Official Statement and any supplements thereto
as may, in their judgment, be necessary or appropriate. Such officers
are also hereby authorized to determine and certify on behalf of the
City that such disclosure document
is “deemed final” by the City within the meaning of Securities and
Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12
(the “SEC Rule”).
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under, the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
and directed to prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Bonds in accordance
with the Rule. The performance of
that Agreement shall be subject to
the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it.

The City Record
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of the
occurrence of any other events, the
Director of Finance shall consult
with, as appropriate, the legal counsel and bond or other qualified independent special counsel to the City.
The Director of Finance, acting in
the name and on behalf of the City,
shall be entitled to rely upon any
legal advice provided by any such
counsel in determining whether a
filing should be made.
Pursuant
to
Section
133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds
with other bonds into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of their sale as a single issue to
be designated “Various Purpose General Obligation Bonds, Series 1997”.
Such bonds shall contain a summary statement of purposes encompassing the purpose for which the
Bonds are issued and shall state
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds
promptly when and as the same
falls due, and also to provide for the
discharge of the Bonds at maturity,
there shall be and is hereby levied
on all the taxable property in the
City, in addition to all other taxes,
a direct tax annually during the
period the Bonds are outstanding, in
an amount sufficient to provide for
the payment of that interest, when
and as the same shall fall due, and
also to discharge the principal of
the Bonds at maturity, which tax
shall not be less than the interest
and sinking fund tax required by
Section 11 of Article XII of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of those years are certified, extended and collected. The
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from the tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund as provided pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on
the Bonds when and as the same
fall due; provided, however, that,
subject to the provisions of Section
8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in
each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the
Bonds and are appropriated for such
purpose, the amount of such tax
shall be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25 and 5705.51 of the
Revised Code, and in accordance
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the
General Bond Ordinance, that the

1090

June 18, 1997
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt
charges for the Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended and applied for the objects
and purposes for which the Bonds
are issued. Accrued interest and any
premium received from the sale of
the Bonds shall be deposited in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund to be
applied to the payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Bonds are secured by a pledge and
lien on a parity with the pledges
and liens authorized by the General
Bond Ordinance and, in addition to
the taxes and revenues specifically
pledged pursuant to this Ordinance
and the General Bond Ordinance and
the other covenants, terms and
agreements provided hereunder and
in the General Bond Ordinance to
secure payment of the principal of
and interest on the Bonds, the City
hereby determines, declares, warrants and covenants that the Bonds
are general obligations of the City
and that the full faith and credit of
the City are hereby pledged for the
payment of the principal of and
interest on the Bonds in accordance
with the laws and Constitution of
the State of Ohio, this Ordinance and
the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid
and discharged all the outstanding
Bonds, or there shall otherwise be
paid to the holders of the outstanding Bonds all debt charges due or
to become due thereon, and provision shall also be made for paying
all other sums payable hereunder,
then and in that event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of further
effect, and the covenants, agreements and other obligations of the
City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the
request of the City execute and
deliver to the City such instruments
in writing as shall discharge the
lien hereof and enter on the record
such discharge of the lien and such
other instruments as may be reasonably required by the City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if:
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or sub-accounts, in trust for and
irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold
in special accounts or sub-accounts,
in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations
of the United States certified by an
independent public accounting firm
of national reputation to be of such
maturities and interest payment
dates and to bear such interest,
without further investment or reinvestment of either the principal
amount thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held
in trust and committed, except as
hereinafter provided), as will be sufficient,
together
with
moneys
referred to in (i) above, for the payment, at their maturities or redemp-

June 18, 1997
tion dates, of all debt charges on the
Bonds to their date of maturity or
redemption, as the case may be, or
if default in such payment shall
have occurred on such date then to
the date of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds
are to be redeemed prior to the
maturity thereof, notice of such
redemption shall have been duly
given or irrevocable provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall have
been duly made for the giving of
such notice. Any moneys held by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with
the provisions of this Section shall
be invested by the Escrow Agent in
direct obligations of the United
States of America maturing, or
redeemable at the option of the holder, at times and in amounts sufficient to meet payment of debt
charges on the Bonds, as directed by
the Director of Finance. Any income
or interest earned by, or increment
to, the investments held under this
Section shall, to the extent determined from time to time by the
Escrow Agent to be in excess of the
amount required to be held by it for
the purposes of this Section, be
transferred at the time of such
determination as provided in Section
17(a) of the General Bond Ordinance
for unclaimed funds held by a Paying Agent. In the event of nonpresentment of any Bond as described
in Section 17(a) of the General Bond
Ordinance, the moneys held pursuant to this Section shall be held
and paid as provided in said Section
17(a) for unclaimed funds held by a
Paying Agent.
Section 9. Bond Anticipation Notes.
For the purpose of raising money in
anticipation of the issuance of the
Bonds for the purposes set forth in
Section 1 hereof, notes of the City
may be issued in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed One Million One Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($1,150,000) (the “Notes”)
upon the direction of the Director of
Finance to be set forth in a certificate providing for the final terms of
the Notes and the sale of the Notes
and signed by the Director of
Finance (the “Note Certificate of
Award”).
Section 10. Term of the Notes. The
Notes: shall bear interest at such
rate, not exceeding nine per cent
(9%) per year, as may be fixed by
the Director of Finance of the City
in the Note Certificate of Award;
shall
be
dated
their
date
of
issuance; shall mature on the date
set forth in the Note Certificate of
Award, which shall be no later than
five (5) years from such date of
issuance; shall be subject to redemption by the City at any time prior
to maturity without penalty, provided that, if the Director of Finance,
based on the advice of the financial
advisor of the City, determines that
it is in the best interest of the City
in order to enhance the marketability of the Notes, the Director of
Finance may cause the Notes to not
be redeemable for a period which
ends no later than the date which is
two (2) years following the date of
issuance of the Notes; shall be designated “Residential Areas Improvement
Bond
Anticipation
Notes,
Series 1997”; shall be issued in such
numbers and denominations as may
be requested by the Note Purchaser
(hereinafter defined); and shall be
issued in fully registered form
(which may be in a book entry only
system) in denominations of $5,000
or integral multiples thereof. Interest shall be payable semi-annually

The City Record
on the dates set forth in the Note
Certificate of Award; provided that
if the Notes mature on or before the
end of the twelfth (12th) month following their date of issuance, interest on the Notes shall be payable at
maturity.
Star Bank, National Association, is
appointed to act as the authenticating agent, registrar, transfer agent
and paying agent for the Notes (the
Registrar);
provided
that
the
Escrow Agent also shall act as paying agent for the Notes so long as
the Notes are held in a book entry
system. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, an agreement among the City, the Registrar
and the Escrow Agent (the Note
Registrar Agreement) providing for
services relating to the registration,
transfer, exchange and payment of
Notes. The Director of Finance shall
provide for the payment of the services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant
to the Note Registrar Agreement
from the proceeds of the Notes to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose.
So long as any of the Notes
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Notes as provided in
this Section (the Note Register).
Subject to the provisions of Section
5, the person in whose name a Note
is registered on the Note Register
shall be regarded as the absolute
owner of that Note for all purposes
of this ordinance. Payment of or on
account of the debt charges on any
Note shall be made only to or upon
the order of that person; neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be
affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Note,
including
interest,
to
the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for
Notes of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender
at the
principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together with
a request for exchange signed by
the registered owner or by a person
legally empowered to do so in a
form satisfactory to the Registrar. A
Note may be transferred only on the
Note Register upon presentation and
surrender of the Note at the principal corporate trust office of the Registrar together with an assignment
signed by the registered owner or by
a person legally empowered to do so
in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon exchange or transfer the
Registrar shall complete, authenticate and deliver a new Note or Notes
of any authorized denomination or
denominations
requested
by
the
owner equal in the aggregate to the
unmatured principal amount of the
Note surrendered and bearing interest at the same rate and maturing
on the same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Notes only after the new
Notes are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Notes exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar

1091

115
shall authenticate and deliver Notes
in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Notes
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Notes surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Pursuant
to
Section
133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Notes
with other bond anticipation notes
of the City into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of
their sale as a single issue to be
designated “Various Purpose General
Obligation
Bond
Anticipation
Notes, Series 1997”. The Notes shall
contain a summary statement of
purposes encompassing the purpose
for which the Notes are issued and
shall state that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 11. Execution and Payment of the Notes. The Notes shall
be executed by the Director of
Finance and the Mayor, provided
that one of such signatures may be
a facsimile. Such Notes shall express
upon their face the purpose for
which they are issued and that they
are issued pursuant to this ordinance, and may be payable in Federal Reserve funds of the United
States of America if requested by
the Note Purchaser.
Section 12. Sale of the Notes. The
Notes shall be sold at private sale
to the Note Purchaser by the Director of Finance in the principal
amount set forth in a certificate of
award to be executed by the Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate
of Award”) at not less than par and
accrued interest and at a rate not
exceeding that set forth in Section
10 hereof. The Notes shall be sold to
Lehman Brothers, Merrill, Lynch &
Co., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.,
SBK-Brooks Investment Corp., and
Pryor, McClendon, Counts & Co., Inc.
(the “Note Purchaser”). The proceeds of such sale shall be paid into
the proper fund and used for the
purpose for which the Notes are
being issued under the provisions of
this Ordinance.
Section 13. Security for the Notes.
The Notes shall be the full general
obligations of the City, and the full
faith, credit and revenue of the City
are hereby pledged for the prompt
payment of the same. The par value
to be received from the sale of the
Bonds and any excess funds resulting from the issuance of the Notes
shall, to the extent necessary, be
used for the retirement of the Notes
at maturity, together with the interest thereon, and are hereby pledged
for such purpose.
Section 14. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. During the year
or years while the Notes are outstanding there shall be levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes but within tax limitations, a direct tax
annually not less than that which
would have been levied if bonds had
been issued therefor without the
prior issue of the Notes.

116
Said tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of said year are certified, extended and collected. Said
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from said tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account, which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of the principal and interest of
the Notes or the Bonds in anticipation of which they are issued, when
and as the same falls due; provided,
however, that in each year to the
extent that revenues are available
from other sources for the payment
of the Notes and Bonds and are
appropriated for such purpose, the
amount of such direct tax upon all
of the taxable property in the City
may be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
Section 15. Preparation of Disclosure Document for the Notes. The
Director of Finance is hereby authorized to prepare, execute and deliver to the Note Purchaser, to the
extent required by law, a preliminary and final Official Statement or
any other appropriate disclosure
document of the City in accordance
with the sale and delivery of the
Notes, and to deem such disclosure
document “final” for purposes of
SEC Rule 15c2-12.
Section 16. Miscellaneous.
(a) Any provisions of the Codified
Ordinances of the City which are
inconsistent with the provisions of
this Ordinance and the General Bond
Ordinance shall not apply to the
Bonds or the Notes authorized herein.
(b) All covenants, terms and provisions of the General Bond Ordinance are fully applicable to the
Bonds and the Notes authorized
herein, and nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to alter or
restrict such full application of the
General Bond Ordinance, except for
the exclusion from application to
the Bonds and the Notes authorized
herein of the provisions of the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) and the
third paragraph of Section 4 of the
General Bond Ordinance pursuant to
Section 2 of this Ordinance.
Section 17. Captions. The captions
or headings in this Ordinance are
for convenience only and in no way
define, limit or describe the scope or
intent of any provisions or sections
of this Ordinance.
Section
18.
Federal
Tax
Covenants. The City covenants that
it will use, and will restrict the use
and investment of, the proceeds of
the Notes and the Bonds in such
manner and to such extent as may
be necessary so that (a) the Notes
and the Bonds will not (i) constitute
private activity bonds, arbitrage
bonds or hedge bonds under Sections
141, 148 or 149 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
Code) or (ii) be treated other than
as bonds to which Section 103(a) of
the Code applies, and (b) the interest thereon will not be treated as an
item of tax preference under Section
57 of the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required of
it for the interest on the Notes and
the Bonds to be and to remain

The City Record
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, and (b) it
will not take or authorize to be
taken
any
actions
that
would
adversely affect that exclusion, and
(c) it, or persons acting for it, will,
among other acts of compliance, (i)
apply the proceeds of the Notes and
the Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing, (ii) restrict
the yield on investment property
acquired with those proceeds, (iii)
make timely and adequate payments
to
the federal government, (iv)
maintain books and records and
make calculations and reports, and
(v) refrain from certain uses of those
proceeds, and, as applicable, of property financed with such proceeds, all
in such manner and to the extent
necessary to assure such exclusion of
that interest under the Code.
Each covenant made in this section with respect to the Notes and
the Bonds is also made with respect
to all issues any portion of the debt
service on which is paid from proceeds of the Notes or the Bonds
(and, if different, the original issue
and any refunding issues in a series
of refundings), to the extent such
compliance is necessary to assure
exclusion of interest on the Notes
and the Bonds from gross income
for federal income tax purposes, and
the officers identified above are
authorized to take actions with
respect to those issues as they are
authorized in this section to take
with respect to the Notes and the
Bonds.
The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer of
the City having responsibility for
issuance of the Notes and the Bonds
is hereby authorized (a) to make or
effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or
waiver on behalf of the City with
respect to the Notes and the Bonds
