as

2.4.2 Phase II Audits; Remediation
Plan.
2.4.2.1 For those Fee Interest
Parcels, if any, for which, based
upon the results of the Phase II
Audit, the Consultant has identified
no
environmental
contamination
that would require remediation to
obtain a No Further Action Letter
and a Covenant Not to Sue, the parties shall proceed to work jointly
with the Consultant to obtain both
a No Further Action Letter and a
Covenant Not to Sue, which documents shall be obtained prior to the
Closing Date.
2.4.2.2 For those Fee Interest
Parcels, if any, for which, based
upon the results of the Phase II
Audits, the Consultant has identified
environmental contamination that
would require remediation in order
to obtain a No Further Action Letter and a Covenant Not to Sue, the
parties shall work with the Consultant to develop a plan for remediation (the “Remediation Plan”) of the
applicable
Fee
Interest
Parcels,
which plan shall be prepared in a
manner that would allow the Consultant to issue a No Further Action
Letter and the OEPA to issue a
Covenant Not to Sue, each in accordance with the VAP, and which
Remediation Plan shall include an

2.4.2.3 Once the Remediation Plan

of the Remediation Plan, if it chooses to undertake remediation of the
Fee Interest Parcels in question.
Cleveland shall not be liable for any
portion of the costs of implementing
a Remediation Plan which exceed
the costs which Cleveland would
have to pay for remediation if the
Fee Interest Parcels were not conveyed under this Agreement, and
Cleveland shall not be required to
pay any costs of the Remediation
Plan earlier than it would have to
pay such costs if the Fee Interest
Parcels were not conveyed under
this Agreement, provided, however,
that this provision shall not be construed to preclude Brook Park or
any subsequent owner of the Fee
Interest Parcels from asserting any
other claim under federal or state
law, including common law, with
respect to the contamination which
is addressed pursuant to the Remediation Plan or any amendment
thereto.
2.4.3 Election Not to Accept Fee
Interest.
2.4.3.1 Notwithstanding anything
in this Paragraph 2.4 to the contrary,
for
those
Fee
Interest
Parcels, if any, for which the Consultant has not recommended that
Phase II Audits be prepared, or, if
the Consultant recommends that
Phase II Audits be prepared, but,
based on such Phase II Audits, does
not recommend that environmental
remediation be conducted, Brook
Park shall have the option to elect
not to accept title to any or all of
such parcels if the Consultant is
unwilling to issue a No Further
Action Letter or if OEPA is unwilling to issue a Covenant Not to Sue
for such parcels. In addition, for
those
Fee
Interest
Parcels
for
which a Phase II Audit and Remediation Plan have been prepared,
Brook Park shall have the option,
based on the results of the Remediation Plan, to elect not to accept
title to any or all of such Fee Interest Parcels.

The City Record
2.4.3.2 Brook Park shall make
such election by written notice to
Cleveland within 30 days after
receipt of notice that either the No
Further
Action
Letter
or
the
Covenant Not to Sue cannot be
obtained, or within 30 days after
receipt of the Remediation Plan,
whichever is applicable. If Brook
Park notifies Cleveland that it has
made such election, the parties shall
proceed to Closing in accordance
with Paragraph 12.4 below, but the
Fee Interest Parcels to be conveyed
to Brook Park shall not include the
parcel or parcels to which Brook
Park has elected not to receive title.
With respect to such Fee Interest
Parcels to which Brook Park has
elected not to receive title, Cleveland shall grant to Brook Park such
right-of-way over such parcels as
may be necessary for construction
and operation of Aerospace Parkway along the Agreed Roadway
Alignment. In addition, for a period
of five years from the Closing Date,

assert for any purpose in any forum
that it has devoted such parcels to
a public purpose.

Parcels a perpetual and assignable
right-of-way and easement for the
free and unobstructed passage of all
aircraft, regardless of the owner or
operator of such, in, through and
across all of the air space above the
Fee Interest Parcels subject to such
rights, terms and conditions as contained herein. (For purposes of this
Agreement, “aircraft” is defined as
any contrivance now known or hereafter invented, used or designed for
navigation of or flight in the air or
space regardless of the form of
propulsion which powers said aircraft in flight.) Cleveland, its successors in interest and assigns, shall
have and hold such easement and

1126

June 25, 1997
right-of-way, and all rights appertaining thereto, until the Airport
shall be abandoned and shall cease
to be used for public airport purposes.
2.5.2 Waiver, Release and Restrictions on Use. Brook Park, its successors in interest and assigns shall:
2.5.2.1 waive, remise and release
any right or cause of action which
Brook Park may now have or may
have in the future against Cleveland, on account of or arising out of
noise, vibrations, fumes, dust, fuel,
particles and all other effects that
may be caused or may have been
caused by the operation of aircraft
landing at, taking off from, or operating at or on the Airport, or in or
near the air space above the Fee
Interest Parcels;
2.5.2.2 not allow any structure,
object, tree, shrubbery, or other vegetation to remain on the Fee Interest Parcels which encroaches upon
or extends into the areas where the
FAA would prohibit such structures,
objects, trees, or other vegetation
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the FAA or where such
structures, objects, trees, or other
vegetation
would
be
prohibited
under the rules and regulations of
the Ohio Airport Protection Act,
Ohio Rev. Code Section 4561.30 et
seq. based upon the Submitted ALP;
2.5.2.3 not use, permit or suffer the
use of the Fee Interest Parcels in
such a manner, based on the Submitted ALP, as to create electrical
interferences with radio communication to or from any aircraft or
between any airport installation and
any aircraft; or as to make it difficult for aircraft pilots to distinguish
between airport lights and other
lights; or as to produce glare or
reflection which would impair aircraft pilots landing or taking off at
the Airport; or as to impair visibility in the vicinity of the Airport, or
as to otherwise endanger the landing, take off, or maneuvering of aircraft;
2.5.2.4 not authorize the construction of any facility or improvement
on the Fee Interest Parcels which
attracts or results in the concentration of birds or other wildlife which,
based on the Submitted ALP, would
interfere with the safe operation of
aircraft in flight; and
2.5.2.5 not construct on the Fee
Interest Parcels a structure which
would be a noncompatible land use
based on the Submitted ALP, pursuant to 14 CFR Section 150.7 (1996
ed.).
2.5.3 Reservation of Rights. Cleveland, its successors in interest and
assigns shall have the continuing
right to cause or allow in all of the
air space above the surface of the
Fee Interest Parcels such noise,
fumes, vibrations, dust, fuel, particles and all other effects that may
be caused by or result from the operation of aircraft, whether or not said
aircraft overfly or intrude into the
easement area described in Paragraph 2.5.1 above.
2.5.4 Injunctive Relief. If Brook
Park defaults in or violates the
obligations set forth in Paragraphs
2.5.1, 2.5.2 or 2.5.3 above, and fails
reasonably to cure such default or
violation upon notification by Cleveland, then Cleveland shall be entitled to injunctive relief as provided
in Paragraph 13.5 below.
2.6 Covenants Running With the
Land. Brook Park and Cleveland
agree that the obligations of Brook
Park set forth in Paragraph 2.5
above
shall
also
constitute

June 25, 1997
covenants running with the land of
the Fee Interest Parcels both as to
burdens and benefits. Whenever
“Brook Park” is used in Paragraphs
2.5 or 2.6, it refers to Brook Park
and its successors in interest and
assigns. Cleveland’s failure to exercise its remedies reserved herein
shall not be construed to waive any
rights
Cleveland
may
have
to
enforce Brook Park’s obligations
through any and all rights and
remedies which Cleveland or its successors in interest and assigns may
have at law or in equity for the
enforcement of covenants. No waiver by Cleveland at any time of any
of Brook Park’s obligations shall be
deemed or taken as a waiver at any
time thereafter of the same or any
other obligation or of the strict and
prompt
performance
thereof.
No
waiver shall be valid against Cleveland unless reduced to writing and
signed by an officer of Cleveland
duly empowered to execute same.
2.7 Easements. Cleveland specifically reserves, and the conveyance
of the Fee Interest Parcels is made
expressly subject to, such easements
in favor of Cleveland as are set
forth in the deeds to the Fee Interest Parcels attached as Appendix 8.
2.8 FAA Approval. As soon as
practical after the Approval Date,
Cleveland shall submit to the FAA
a request, together with all supporting
documentation
that
is
required under FAA Order 5190.6A,
paragraph 4-17b, for approval of any
of the property conveyances set
forth in Paragraph 2.1 above for
which FAA approval is required.
The parties agree that they will
cooperate to take all reasonable
actions necessary to secure such
FAA approval, including compliance, or agreement to comply, with
such terms and conditions as the
FAA may require.
2.9 Brook Park Cooperation. Brook
Park shall cooperate in any reasonable efforts by Cleveland to acquire
the remaining parcels of land that
are located within the Airport Envelope and are not presently owned by
Cleveland.
3. USE OF REAL PROPERTY
3.1 Agreement Not to Contest Public Purpose. Cleveland agrees, for a
period of five years after the
Approval Date, that it will not contest for any purpose in any forum
whether Brook Park has devoted
any property conveyed to Brook
Park pursuant to this Agreement to
a
public
purpose.
Brook
Park
agrees, for a period of five years
after the Approval Date, that it will
not contest for any purpose in any
forum whether Cleveland has devoted any property within the Airport
Envelope to a public purpose.
3.2 Future Property Ownership. At
any time after the Approval Date
that either City acquires fee title,
lease rights, or any other right to
use any real property located in the
other City for Airport or any other
purposes, Brook Park and Cleveland
shall abide by and follow all laws
concerning
zoning
applicable
at
such time with respect to the use of
such real property.
3.3 Access to the Airfield from Fee
Interest Parcels. To the extent that
any of the Fee Interest Parcels are
used for an Airport-Related Business
which requires airfield access for
the conduct of its core business,
Cleveland shall permit such access
subject to the following limitations:
3.3.1 such Airport-Related Busi-

The City Record
ness and airfield access shall comply with all requirements and guidance of the FAA and the Airport
affecting such access;
3.3.2 such Airport-Related Business and access do not materially
interfere
with
any
current
or
planned use of land within the Airport Envelope as shown on the Submitted ALP or any submitted or
approved airport layout plan as it
may appear from time to time; and
3.3.3 all capital, operating, maintenance and security costs of such
access, including the Airport’s standard provisions regarding indemnification and insurance, shall be provided for by Brook Park or the Airport-Related Business in a form (a)
sufficient to guarantee that such
costs will not at any time be paid
by Cleveland, and (b) approved in
writing in advance by Cleveland,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.
3.3.4
Cleveland
shall
not
be
required at any time to adjust plans,
design or use of land or facilities
within the Airport Envelope to facilitate or preserve the opportunity for
airfield access from the Fee Interest Parcels, provided that Cleveland
will not materially interfere with
any such access which is in use at
any time.
3.4 Access to Brook Park from the
Airport Envelope. In addition to any
entry provided pursuant to Paragraph 4.6 below, Brook Park shall
provide the Airport access to public
roadways in Brook Park on terms
no less favorable than those granted to other property owners with
frontage on the applicable public
roadways. If a roadway to which
access is provided on the Approval
Date is closed, relocated or abandoned by Brook Park, Brook Park
shall provide reasonably equivalent
access to other roadways in Brook
Park. Nothing in this Paragraph 3.4
is intended to affect Brook Park’s
obligations under State and federal
law with respect to access to roads
within its jurisdiction.
3.5 Access to Fee Interest Parcel
Located East of the I-X Center. The
Cities acknowledge that access to
the Fee Interest Parcel located east
of the I-X Center currently is available from the Airport service road
located south of the Key Corp.
hangar on the Airport, and that such
service road is not a public roadway. Cleveland shall provide Brook
Park access to such parcel along
such Airport service road so long as
such access does not interfere with
the security and safe operations of
the Airport. If Cleveland eliminates
or closes such service road, Cleveland shall provide reasonably equivalent access to such parcel.
4. AIRPORT DEVELOPMENT
4.1 Changes to Submitted ALP. The
Cities recognize that changes may be
made to the Submitted ALP prior to
issuance of the Record of Decision.
However, after the Approval Date
and prior to the issuance of the
Record of Decision, Cleveland shall
not make or permit any Material
Change, as defined in Paragraph 4.2
below, to the Submitted ALP.
4.2 Material Change Defined. Any
change to the Submitted ALP prior
to the issuance of the Record of
Decision will be deemed material for
purposes of Paragraph 4.1 above if:
4.2.1 based on Ohio Rev. Code Section 4561.30 et seq., it would necessitate height limitations on property located within the New Bound-

1127

15
aries of Brook Park that are more
restrictive than those necessitated
by the improvements contemplated
on the Submitted ALP, or
4.2.2 it requires, in order to comply with FAA requirements or guidance relating to obstructions to navigation, the acquisition by Cleveland
of real property or real property
interests within the New Boundaries
of Brook Park.
4.3 Support for ALP. Brook Park
shall support fully the approval of
the Submitted ALP at all levels of
review, including FAA review and
any required federal and state environmental
reviews.
Brook
Park
shall take any necessary or desirable actions requested by Cleveland
to
demonstrate
support
for
the
approval of the Submitted ALP and
for federal grant and passenger
facility charge (“PFC”) funding of
the capital projects set forth on the
Submitted ALP.
4.4 Depiction of Aerospace Parkway on Future ALPs. Any airport
layout plan that Cleveland submits
to the FAA at any time after the
Approval Date shall depict the location of Aerospace Parkway, either
as proposed or, after its construction
is completed, as constructed.
4.5 Construction within Airport
Envelope.
4.5.1 Restrictions on Construction
in Certain Airport Envelope Areas.
Within the Restricted Area, Cleveland shall authorize or permit construction of only runways, taxiways
and related safety and security
facilities, hangars, aircraft and airport maintenance buildings, and
other facilities (such as overnight
and second-day package delivery
facilities) which because of their
function must be adjacent to aprons
and taxiways.
4.5.2 Reasonable Design and Signage Standards. Subject to applicable federal regulations, orders, policies and standards, and to approval
by the FAA, if required, structures
constructed after the Closing Date
in the Restricted Area shall be consistent with the design and signage
standards set forth in Appendix 9
(“Design Standards”).
4.5.3 Compliance with Laws. All
construction
activities
conducted
within the Restricted Area shall
comply with federal and state laws,
including applicable environmental
laws.
4.5.4
Restrictive
Covenant.
To
insure compliance with Paragraphs
4.5.1 and 4.5.2 above, Cleveland shall
impose the Design Standards on the
Restricted Area by a Declaration of
Restrictions Regarding Construction
and
Design
(the
“Restrictive
Covenant”).
The
Restrictive
Covenant shall be in the form
attached as Appendix 10, shall run
with the land, and shall inure to the
benefit of Brook Park, its successors
in interest and assigns.
4.5.5 Dispute Resolution.
4.5.5.1 At least 15 days prior to
issuance of a building permit for
any construction subject to the
Restrictive
Covenant,
Cleveland
shall deliver written notice thereof
to Brook Park, and shall provide
Brook Park a period of 10 days to
review the plans and specifications
for
such
construction.
If,
upon
review of the plans and specifications, Brook Park believes that such
construction will not comply with
the
terms
of
the
Restrictive
Covenant, Brook Park shall so notify Cleveland on or before the end of
Brook Park’s 10-day review period,
and the Directors of Law of the

16
Cities or their designated representatives shall meet to attempt to
resolve their differences.
4.5.5.2 If the Cities cannot resolve
their differences under Paragraph
4.5.5.1 above, either City may submit
such differences to a panel (the
“Panel”) consisting of one representative appointed by the Mayor of
each City and a third member selected by those two representatives,
which third member shall be a professional experienced in planning or
design. In the event that either City
so elects, both Cities shall proceed
in accordance with this Paragraph
4.5.5.2, and neither City may proceed
with any other remedies at law,
equity or as specifically contemplated under this Agreement until
the process set forth in this Paragraph has been completed. The
Panel shall be selected within 10
days after either City notifies the
other City of its determination that
their differences cannot be resolved.
The Panel shall meet and propose a
resolution not later than 10 days
after all Panel members have been
selected. Proceedings of the Panel
shall be informal, without hearings
or formal submissions, and the
Panel shall have no power to impose
any resolution and its decisions
shall not be binding on the Cities.
The Mayors of the Cities or their
designated
representatives
shall
review the Panel’s proposed resolution and shall meet at least one time
after issuance of the proposed resolution to seek to resolve their differences based on such resolution. If
the Cities are unable to resolve their
differences after such meeting, the
Cities may proceed to invoke any
other remedies at law or in equity
or as set forth in this Agreement for
breach of a provision of this Agreement. The provisions of this Paragraph 4.5.5 shall not apply in the
case of any dispute under this Paragraph 4.5.5 related to property forming any part of the Restricted Area
to which Cleveland no longer holds
title.
4.6 One Public Entry to Airport.
4.6.1 Sole Public Entry. The sole
public entry to the Airport shall be
from Route 237 and/or Snow Road,
although the particular location of
entry from either of these roads may
be changed in Cleveland’s discretion
at any time, or from time to time.
This provision shall not be construed to prevent Cleveland from
maintaining other secondary entries
to the Airport, provided such entries
are not available to scheduled airline passengers and are used exclusively for emergency, service/maintenance, deliveries, air cargo, access
to leased premises by tenants and
subtenants or other airport-related
purposes.
4.6.2 Replacement Public Entry. If
in the future Cleveland desires to
construct any additional or replacement public entry at a different
location, it shall furnish Brook Park
with a map depicting such proposed
public entry not less than 180 calendar days prior to seeking FAA
approval for or beginning construction of such public entry, whichever
is earlier. Brook Park shall have 60
calendar days from the date of
receipt of such map to notify Cleveland that Brook Park desires to
have an equivalent public entry constructed from within Brook Park. If
Brook Park so notifies Cleveland
within the specified time period,
Cleveland shall construct, at its own
expense, an additional public entry
to the Airport from a mutually

The City Record

June 25, 1997

agreed upon location within Brook
Park. Such public entry shall be
equivalent, with regard to all material characteristics affecting public
access, to the proposed public entry
depicted on the map provided pursuant to this Paragraph and shall
be completed within a timeframe
equivalent to the timeframe for completion of the additional or replacement public entry in Cleveland.
4.6.3 Change of Permitted Uses by
Brook Park. Brook Park shall not
take any affirmative actions to
change permitted uses in any way
which would substantially interfere
with the proposed Snow Road interchange depicted on the Submitted
ALP.
5.
SOUND
GRAM

INSULATION

PRO-

5.1 Definition of Program. Cleveland shall seek federal funding, for
a five-year period commencing in
calendar year 1998, for a sound insulation program for residential structures in Cleveland, Brook Park and
other communities near the Airport
(“Sound Insulation Program”). Cleveland acknowledges that the existing
residential structures in Brook Park
within the area shown on the map
attached as Appendix 11, are eligible for participation in the Sound
Insulation Program. Insulation shall
be performed in accordance with
engineering, construction and financial standards generally applicable
in Cleveland’s airport residential
sound insulation program.
5.2 Applications for Sound Insulation Funding.
5.2.1
Application
Requirement.
Cleveland shall, at least annually,
submit an application for Sound
Insulation Program funding under
the FAA’s Airport Improvement Program (“AIP”) or other appropriate
grant program. Cleveland shall provide a copy of any such application
to Brook Park.
5.2.2 Limitations on Statements of
Priority. In order to ensure that that
portion of the Sound Insulation Program applicable within Brook Park
receives equitable consideration for
funding, until such Sound Insulation
Program has been completed, Cleveland shall not state or otherwise
imply in any application or related
material submitted to any agency in
connection with any application for
funding of any noise mitigation program that funding of any noise mitigation program is of higher priority, greater significance or more
immediate importance than funding
for the Sound Insulation Program
applicable within Brook Park. The
fact that an application for noise
mitigation funding seeks greater
funding for other noise mitigation
programs than for the Sound Insulation Program applicable within
Brook Park shall not in itself be
interpreted as a failure to comply
with this paragraph, so long as such
application seeks funding for the
Sound Insulation Program in an
amount sufficient to complete the
Sound Insulation Program.
5.3 Allocation of Funds for Sound
Insulation. Any funds which Cleveland receives or uses for sound insulation purposes from 1998 to 2002
shall be divided annually or cumulatively by Cleveland between sound
insulation in Brook Park and sound
insulation in all other communities
(including Cleveland) in proportion
to the total number of residential
units eligible for the Sound Insulation Program.

1128

5.4 Noise Compatibility Program.
If Cleveland seeks FAA approval of
a Part 150 Noise Compatibility Program between 1998 and 2002, that
program shall incorporate the Sound
Insulation Program.
5.5 Impacts of Airport Development Program. If the final documentation prepared pursuant to the
National Environmental Policy Act
(“NEPA”) for the Airport expansion
program shown on the Submitted
ALP shows that new areas in Brook
Park outside those eligible for participation in the Sound Insulation
Program as of the Approval Date
will lie within the LDN 65 dB contour as a result of the expansion
program, Cleveland shall, in any
subsequent application for federal
grant funds for airport expansion,
include a request for sufficient
funds to pay the cost of insulation
of such residential units in Brook
Park.
6. USE OF
PROPERTY

MODEL

AIRPLANE

6.1 Park. The parties acknowledge
that Brook Park may develop the
Model Airplane Property as a park
or other use. In the event that Brook
Park decides not to develop the
Model Airplane Property as a park
and decides to make it available for
commercial
development,
Brook
Park shall so notify Cleveland, and
shall cooperate with Cleveland in
identifying and recruiting potential
tenants to the Model Airplane Property.
6.2 Alternative Development. In
the event that Brook Park proposes
to enter into a binding agreement
with a third party for the sale or
use of the Model Airplane Property
for a land use other than an AirportRelated Business, Brook Park shall
provide written notice to Cleveland
at least 60 calendar days before
entering into any such agreement.
The
notice
required
under
this
Paragraph 6.2 shall include a summary of key terms of the proposed
binding agreement, including key
financial, tax, and infrastructure
terms, and shall identify explicitly
those terms which Brook Park
deems material.
6.3
Cleveland
Proposal.
Upon
receipt of notice from Brook Park
under the Paragraph 6.2 above,
Cleveland shall have 45 calendar
days in which to present to Brook
Park a counterproposal to develop
the Model Airplane Property for an
Airport-Related
Business.
Brook
Park shall review any such counterproposal and shall determine, in
its reasonable discretion, which of
the two proposals better satisfies
the terms that Brook Park deems
material. If Brook Park determines
that
Cleveland’s
counterproposal
better satisfies such terms, Brook
Park shall accept Cleveland’s counterproposal and enter into an appropriate agreement with the appropriate parties to provide for the implementation of such counterproposal.
7. CONSTRUCTION AND RELOCATION
OF
ROADWAY
AND
POWER LINES
7.1 Completion of Aerospace Parkway. Brook Park may construct
Aerospace
Parkway
along
the
Agreed Road Alignment. The Cities
believe that the Agreed Road Alignment depicted on the map attached
as Appendix 1 to this Agreement is
consistent with FAA guidance on
ensuring the safe, full-service oper-

June 25, 1997
ation of the runways depicted on the
Submitted ALP. The Cities, however, recognize that the results of
required engineering and environmental
studies
may
necessitate
changes in the final alignment for
Aerospace Parkway such that the
actual as-constructed alignment of
Aerospace Parkway may deviate
from the Agreed Road Alignment
but only to the extent that such
alignment is consistent with the
safe, full-service operation of the
runways shown on the Submitted
ALP. Cleveland shall grant Brook
Park a nonexclusive easement for
placement and maintenance of the
CEI Power Lines along the alignment set forth in Appendix 12,
which easement shall not exceed 10
feet from the Agreed Road Alignment on the Airport side, and provided that (a) the placement of such
CEI Power Lines within such easement does not interfere with the
safe, full service operation of the
runways shown on the Submitted
ALP, and (b) there is not sufficient
area for such CEI Power Lines in
the right-of-way on the non-Airport
side of the Agreed Road Alignment.
In addition, the Cities shall cooperate in the making of improvements
to Abram Creek necessitated by the
construction of Aerospace Parkway
and the construction of improvements contemplated on the Submitted ALP.
7.2 Roadway Costs.
7.2.1 Construction of Agreed Road
Alignment. Except as provided in
Paragraph 7.2.3 below, Brook Park
shall pay all costs actually incurred
for the planning, design, engineering, acquisition of non-Cleveland
property interests for, and construction of Aerospace Parkway as provided in Paragraph 7.1 above. If,
either before or after the Closing
Date,
Cleveland
determines,
or
Cleveland is informed by the FAA,
that a surface roadway along the
alignment contemplated in the previous paragraph would interfere
with the safe, full-service operation
of the runways depicted on the Submitted ALP, Cleveland shall have
the right to require Brook Park to
depress or tunnel such roadway, provided, however, that Cleveland shall
have the option to choose whether
the road is tunnelled or depressed
and shall pay for all reasonable
costs and expenses related to such
depression or tunneling as provided
in Paragraph 7.2.2 below.
7.2.2 Tunnelling or Depressing
Road. If Cleveland seeks to require
Brook Park to depress or tunnel
Aerospace Parkway pursuant to
Paragraph 7.2.1 above, Cleveland
shall so notify Brook Park in writing. In such notification, Cleveland
shall specify the changes in elevation of the road surface (i.e., surface, depressed or tunneled) that it
desires based on appropriate documentation, and shall agree to execute such documents as Brook Park
determines, in its reasonable discretion, are necessary to demonstrate
Cleveland’s binding commitment to
reimburse Brook Park for all reasonable costs incurred for changes
in planning, design, engineering and
construction thereby necessitated.
7.2.3 Costs Related to Reconfiguration of Parking at Aerospace
Technology
Park.
The
parties
acknowledge that the location of the
northwestern boundary of the Airport and the construction of Aerospace Parkway adjacent to such
boundary may require the reconfiguration of certain of the parking

The City Record
areas that presently serve Aerospace Technology Park. Cleveland
shall
pay
all
reasonable
costs
incurred by Brook Park or the property owner associated with such
reconfiguration, including, without
limitation, design and engineering
costs, surveying costs, paving and
striping costs, landscaping costs
necessary to landscape the reconfigured parking in a manner consistent with Aerospace Technology
Park design standards, and costs
associated with storm water management.
7.3 FAA Approval. Cleveland shall
take whatever action is necessary,
including paying the cost of tunneling or depressing Aerospace Parkway and any other action required,
to assist Brook Park in obtaining
FAA approval of the completion of
Aerospace Parkway, as described in
Paragraph 7.1 above. Such FAA
approval shall include any FAA
approvals necessary to comply with
the terms of Resolution 95-053 of the
Northeast Ohio Area Coordinating
Agency.
7.4
ODOT/FHWA
Approval.
Brook Park shall assume responsibility for obtaining all necessary
approvals from all governmental
agencies including the Ohio Department of Transportation (“ODOT”)
and the Federal Highway Administration (“FHWA”), for the completion of Aerospace Parkway, as
described in Paragraph 7.1 above,
including any changes in the roadway elevation required under the
terms of Paragraph 7.2.1 above.
Cleveland shall support fully the
approval of the completion of Aerospace Parkway at all levels of
review, including ODOT review,
approval, and local match determination, and FHWA review and
approval. Cleveland shall take such
reasonable actions as Brook Park
requests in order to demonstrate
such support.
7.5
Relocation
of
CEI
Power
Lines.
7.5.1
Relocation.
The
Cities
acknowledge
that
the
planned
expansion
of
the
Airport
will
require relocation of the CEI power
lines (the “CEI Power Lines”) located on the Existing CEI Power Line
Property to the route depicted on
the map attached as Appendix 12 to
this Agreement (with such minor
deviations from such route contained in the final design plans
and/or required by CEI for safe construction
and
operation),
which
route runs primarily underground,
beneath the right-of-ways for the
proposed Aerospace Parkway and
for Ruple Parkway. The Cities further acknowledge that such relocation may require several permits
and approvals, including, without
limitation, approvals from the Ohio
Power Siting Commission, CEI and
Brook Park, as well as significant
costs associated with design, engineering and construction associated
with such relocation. Brook Park
shall issue on a timely basis all
such permits within its authority
without the imposition of unreasonable conditions.
7.5.2 Responsibility for Consents
and
Approvals.
Cleveland
shall
obtain any and all consents or
approvals that are legally required
for this relocation, including, but
not limited to, the consent of CEI
and the Ohio Power Siting Commission, except that Brook Park shall
assume responsibility for review by
the Brook Park Planning Commission.

1129

17
7.5.3 Responsibility for Costs and
Expenses. Cleveland shall be solely
responsible for all costs and expenses associated with such relocation,
including, without limitation, costs
and
expenses
associated
with
obtaining the permits and approvals
necessary
for
such
relocation,
preparing
necessary
design
and
engineering documents, obtaining
new easements and conducting the
physical construction work necessary
to
effect
such
relocation.
Notwithstanding any other provision
in this Agreement, Cleveland shall
not be required to make any payments associated with the relocation
of the CEI Power Lines until such
relocation is reasonably necessary
for Airport safety or efficiency.
7.5.4 Assumption of Obligations by
Brook Park. In the event that Brook
Park’s schedule for construction of
Aerospace Parkway contemplates
the relocation of the CEI Power
Lines in advance of when such relocation is reasonably necessary for
Airport safety or efficiency, Brook
Park may elect to assume Cleveland’s obligations identified in Paragraphs 7.5.2 and 7.5.3 above, in
which case Cleveland shall reimburse Brook Park for any reasonable costs and expenses incurred by
Brook Park in assuming such obligations. Any costs and expenses not
reimbursed within two years of the
date they are incurred by Brook
Park shall be reimbursed with interest thereon at a rate of 4.8 percent
per annum from the date on which
Brook Park invoices Cleveland for
such costs and expenses. In any
event, such costs and expenses shall
be reimbursed no later than such
time as relocation of the CEI Power
Lines would have been necessary
for airport safety or efficiency.
7.5.5 Responsibility for Planning
and
Design.
Brook
Park
shall
assume responsibility for all planning, design, engineering, and construction activities associated with
the relocation. Cleveland shall reimburse Brook Park for all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred in connection
with
this
relocation
as
described in Paragraph 7.5.3 above.
7.6 Environmental Review. The
Cities will allocate as follows the
responsibility for complying, to the
extent mandated by law, with any
requirements for state and federal
environmental review, approval, and
permitting that may be associated
with the implementation of this
Agreement:
7.6.1 Brook Park shall assume
responsibility for any such requirements associated with the completion of Aerospace Parkway and the
relocation of the CEI Power Lines,
including any required review under
NEPA or section 404 of the Clean
Water Act.
7.6.2
Cleveland
shall
assume
responsibility for any such requirements associated with implementing
the Airport expansion depicted on
the Submitted ALP, including any
required review under NEPA or section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
7.6.3 With regard to each set of
requirements
described
in
Paragraphs 7.6.1 and 7.6.2 above, each
City shall support fully the process
of complying with the other City’s
mandatory environmental
requirements, and shall take such reasonable actions as the City bearing
responsibility for each set of requirements requests in furtherance of
such compliance, including providing site access, and providing access
to City staffs and consultants.

8. DISMISSAL OF PENDING LITIGATION
8.1 Stay and Dismissal of Pending
Actions. Within 5 days after the
Approval Date, as provided in Paragraph 12.3.2 below, the Cities shall
take whatever actions may be necessary, including executing and filing
the
pleadings
attached

9. CONSIDERATION
9.1 Payment to Brook Park. In
consideration
for
the
mutual
covenants contained in this Agreement, the transfer of the Jurisdictional Property Interests to Cleveland and the loss of tax revenues to
Brook Park resulting from such
transfer, Cleveland shall pay Brook
Park the amount of $8.75 million
(“Cleveland’s
Payment”).
Cleveland’s Payment shall be paid in a
single payment if AIP or PFC funding in that amount is available on
or before the later of (a) September
30, 1997, or (b) 180 days after the
Closing Date. If such funding is not
available
after
Cleveland’s
best
efforts to obtain it by said date,
Cleveland shall have the option to
pay Cleveland’s Payment over a
three-year period in three annual
installments, as follows:
(i) $2,916,666.66 payable on the
later of (a) September 30, 1997, or
(b) 180 days after the Closing Date;
(ii) $2,916,666.66 payable on the
later of (a) September 30, 1998, or
(b) one year plus 180 days after the
Closing Date; and

(iii) $2,916,666.68 payable on the
later of (a) September 30, 1999, or
(b) two years plus 180 days after
the Closing Date.
Interest on unpaid principal shall
be paid at the rate of 4.8 percent per
year, computed from the Closing
Date. Cleveland shall notify Brook
Park on or before the later of (a)
August 30, 1997, or (b) 150 days
after the Closing Date whether or
not it intends to pay Cleveland’s
Payment in a single payment or
over a three-year period as provided
above in this Paragraph 9.1. If
Cleveland elects to pay Cleveland’s
Payment over a three-year period,
Cleveland shall have the right at
any time or from time to time during such three-year period to prepay
the total amount then due in whole
or in part, together with accrued
interest on the principal so prepaid,
provided, however, that Cleveland
shall notify Brook Park at least 30
days prior to the date that Cleveland intends to make such prepayment.
9.2 Payment to Cleveland. In consideration for the transfer of the
Jurisdictional Property Interests to
Brook Park, and the loss of tax revenues to Cleveland’s General Fund
directly resulting from such transfer, Brook Park shall pay Cleveland
the amount of $3.75 million (“Brook
Park’s Payment”). Brook Park’s
Payment shall be paid in a single
payment on or before the later of
(a) September 30, 1997, or (b) 180
days after the Closing Date. If
Cleveland elects to pay Cleveland’s
Payment over a three-year period as
provided in Paragraph 9.1 above,
Brook Park may likewise pay Brook
Park’s Payment over a three-year
period in three equal annual installments of $1.25 million, payable on
the same dates as the payments by
Cleveland are due pursuant to Paragraph 9.1 above.
Interest on unpaid principal shall
be paid at the rate of 4.8 percent per
annum, computed from the Closing
Date. Brook Park shall have the
right at any time or from time to
time to prepay the total amount
then due in whole or in part, together with accrued interest on the principal so prepaid. In the event Cleveland makes prepayments as provided in Paragraph 9.1 above, Brook
Park shall similarly prepay outstanding principal and interest in
the same proportion to the prepayment amounts received from Cleveland, within 15 days after it receives
any such prepayment from Cleveland.
10. FAIR COMPETITION
10.1 Relocation of Businesses from
Brook Park to Cleveland. In the
event that any Business relocates
from Brook Park Aerospace Technology Park, as it exists as of the
Approval Date outside of the Airport
Envelope, to the Potential Airport
Development
Property,
Cleveland
shall compensate Brook Park annually for the lost revenue from that
Business’s activities. Annual compensation shall be equal to the
Municipal Income Tax Revenue,
Motor Vehicle Lessor Tax Revenue,
Parking Tax Revenue and individual income tax revenue that Brook
Park received from that Business’s
activities for the 12 months prior to
the relocation, indexed to the CPI
Index for all Urban Consumers, U.S.
City Average (1982-84=100) (the
“CPI Index”). Annual compensation
shall continue so long as that Busi-

1130

June 25, 1997
ness remains located within the subject area in Cleveland, or 30 years,
whichever is shorter.
10.2 Relocation of Businesses from
Cleveland to Brook Park. In the
event that any Business relocates
from the Potential Airport Development Property to a location in Brook
Park Aerospace Technology Park,
Brook Park shall compensate Cleveland for the lost revenue from that
Business’s activities. Annual compensation shall be equal to the
Municipal Income Tax Revenue,
Motor Vehicle Lessor Tax Revenue,
Parking Tax Revenue and individual income tax revenue that Cleveland received from that Business’s
activities for the 12 months prior to
the relocation, indexed to the CPI
Index. Annual compensation shall
continue so long as that Business
remains located in Brook Park Aerospace Technology Park, or 30 years,
whichever is shorter.
10.3 Relocation of Car Rental Companies. If any car rental company
that is located within the Airport
Envelope as of the Approval Date
relocates its operations to a location
in Brook Park, Brook Park will use
its best efforts to impose a motor
vehicle lessor tax and parking tax
at rates identical to those imposed
by Cleveland as of the Approval
Date. Brook Park will compensate
Cleveland on an annual basis in the
amount of any revenue generated by
Brook Park from such taxes, if
adopted, but not to exceed the Motor
Vehicle Lessor Tax Revenue and
Parking Tax Revenue received by
Cleveland from the car rental company’s activities for the 12 months
prior to relocation, indexed to the
CPI Index. Annual compensation
under this Paragraph 10.3 will continue so long as that car rental company remains located in Brook Park,
or 30 years, whichever is shorter.

13.1 Duration. This Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect
unless and until terminated by written agreement of both Cities.
13.2 Amendment. This Agreement
may be altered, amended or modified only by a written instrument
executed pursuant to the governmental consent of both Brook Park
and Cleveland. Neither this Agreement, nor any term hereof, may be
changed, modified or abandoned, in
whole or in part, except by instrument in writing.
13.3 Costs Related to Agreement.
The parties acknowledge that preparation and implementation of this
Agreement has required them to
incur various costs and expenses for
consultants and other items associated with the preparation of the
Appendices to this Agreement. The
parties agree that they will share
those costs listed on Appendix 18
(the “Shared Costs”) on an equal
basis, and that they shall reconcile
their respective expenditures related
to the Shared Costs on the Closing
Date. To the extent that any such
expenditures are incurred after the
Closing Date or such expenditures
are incurred before the Closing Date
but invoices therefore are not available until after the Closing Date or
the Closing Date does not occur, the
parties
shall
take
appropriate
actions to insure that they have reconciled such Shared Costs so that
they are shared on an equal basis.
13.4 Timing for Each City is Independent. Each City shall determine
in its sole discretion the appropriate
timing for the implementation of
those elements of this Agreement
that will occur within such City’s
New Boundaries after the Closing
Date, including, but not limited to,
the completion of Aerospace Parkway, and the development activities
planned or undertaken at the Airport. Such determinations shall be
made based on those factors which
such City deems relevant, without
regard to the timing of any development activities planned or undertaken in the other City. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties
acknowledge that time is of the
essence in relocation of the CEI
Power Lines.
13.5 Enforcement.
13.5.1 The parties acknowledge
and agree that damages as a result
of any breach of this Agreement by
either party are not readily ascertainable, that money damages or
other legal relief will not adequately compensate for any such breach,

20
and that the party which has not
breached this Agreement is entitled
to injunctive relief compelling the
specific performance of those obligations under this Agreement. The
parties further acknowledge that
the breach of any of the provisions
of this Agreement would constitute
irreparable harm to the other party,
and each party hereby waives any
defenses to the grant of a temporary
restraining order related to any
such breach.
13.5.2 Subject to Paragraphs 13.7
and 13.8 below, Cleveland or Brook
Park, as the case may be, may pursue all remedies now or hereafter
existing at law or in equity to collect all amounts due or to become
due under this Agreement and to
enforce the performance and observance of any obligation of either
party under this Agreement. All
remedies shall be cumulative and
not exclusive of one another or of
statutory remedies not specifically
referenced herein. The exercise of
any one or more remedies described
above in this Paragraph 13.5.2, or of
any one or more remedies existing
at law, in equity or by statute, shall
not constitute a waiver or election
with respect to any other available
remedy. No delay or omission to
exercise any right or power accruing upon any default shall impair
that right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver thereof, but
any such right and power may be
exercised from time to time and as
often as may be deemed expedient.
13.5.3 The parties further acknowledge that the numerous executory
promises provided for in this Agreement necessitate different remedies
for enforcement of different provisions of this Agreement. Accordingly, any court seeking to enforce the
provisions of this Agreement shall
look first to any enforcement provisions contained in the section of the
Agreement that contains the provision in question and then to this
Paragraph 13.
13.5.4 The parties further acknowledge that changes in circumstances
shall not forgive compliance with
the terms of this Agreement.
13.6 Remedies. Venue for any and
all legal actions regarding this
Agreement or any of its parts shall
lie in the Court of Common Pleas,
Cuyahoga County, Ohio.
13.7 Notice of Default; Informal
Dispute Resolution. At no time
shall Brook Park or Cleveland be
deemed to be in default under this
Agreement unless and until notice
has been provided in writing specifying such default (“Notice of
Default”). Immediately after receipt
of a Notice of Default, the respective Directors of Law of the Cities
shall meet and attempt to resolve
the matter. If they fail to resolve
the matter within 10 days after
delivery of the Notice of Default,
the Mayors of each City shall forthwith
appoint
a
representative
expert in the matters in dispute.
The
designated
representatives
shall meet and attempt to resolve
the matter and shall deliver their
joint or separate reports within 30
days after delivery of the Notice of
Default. If they fail to resolve the
matter, their report or reports shall
be delivered to the respective Mayors and Council presidents of the
Cities, together with such other
information as either City may
elect to present to either Mayor or
Council president. All such information shall be made available to
the public.

The City Record
13.8 Informal Dispute Resolution
Mechanism Mandatory. No action
shall be commenced in any court to
enforce or otherwise apply, interpret
or seek cure for a breach of this
Agreement before 30 days have
elapsed after the completion of the
informal dispute resolution mechanism set forth in the Paragraph 13.7
above, except that either party shall
be entitled to request a temporary
restraining order, as provided in
Paragraph 13.5.1 above, to maintain
the status quo during the pendency
of the informal dispute resolution
mechanism set forth in Paragraph
13.7 above. The dispute resolution
provisions set forth in Paragraphs
13.7 and 13.8 shall apply only to the
Cities of Cleveland and Brook Park
and shall not apply to any successor in interest to either City.
13.9 Actions Prohibited. Whenever
this Agreement prohibits a particular action by either City, that City
also is prohibited from causing or
permitting such action to be taken
by a third party.
13.10 Waiver of Rights. The failure of either City to object to, or to
take affirmative action with respect
to, any conduct of the other which
is in violation of the terms of this
Agreement shall not be construed as
a waiver of such violation or breach,
or of any future violation, breach or
wrongful conduct. Subsequent acceptance of performance under this
Agreement by Brook Park or Cleveland shall not be deemed to be a
waiver of any preceding breach by
the other City of the terms of this
Agreement,
regardless
of
Brook
Park’s or Cleveland’s knowledge of
such preceding breach at the time
of acceptance of performance. No
waiver or relinquishment of a right
or power under this Agreement shall
be deemed a waiver of such right or
power at any other time, nor shall
any failure of either City to require
or exact full and complete compliance with any of the covenants or
conditions of this Agreement be construed as changing in any manner
the terms hereof or preventing
either City from enforcing the full
provisions hereof.
13.11 Waiver of Performance Prior
to Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Paragraph
13.10 above, acceptance of performance at the Closing Date by Brook
Park or Cleveland shall be deemed
to be a waiver of any preceding
breach by the other City.
13.12 Headings. Headings have
been inserted herein only as a matter of convenience and for reference,
and are not to be considered when
construing the provisions of this
Agreement.

real property or a location is identified in this Agreement or an
Appendix hereto by more than one
method, i.e., by legal description,
parcel number, depiction on a map,
and/or textual description, any conflict among these methods of identification shall be resolved by following:

delivered by hand to the Mayor of
the
appropriate

respect to the City of Cleveland, the

material shall be sent to the Mayor
of the appropriate City by overnight
express courier service, and shall be
deemed to have been received on the

service.
13.15 Appendices. Appendices 1
through 18 of this Agreement are
incorporated herein by reference
and made a part hereof.

deemed an original but both of
which together shall constitute one
and the same instrument.
13.17 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be subject to and governed by the laws of the State of
Ohio.
13.18 Severability. If any provision, paragraph, or subparagraph of
this Agreement, with the exception

5.2, 7.2, 7.3, 8 and 9 is adjudged by
any court to be invalid, illegal, or

this adjudication will not affect the
validity of the remainder of this
Agreement, including any other provision, paragraph, or subparagraph.
With the exception of Paragraphs
2.1, 2.2, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2, 5.2, 7.2, 7.3, 8 and
9, each provision, paragraph, and
subparagraph of this Agreement is
separable from every other provision, paragraph, and subparagraph,
and constitutes a separate and distinct covenant.
13.19 No Third Party Beneficiary.
This Agreement is solely for the
benefit of the parties hereto and no
third party shall be entitled to claim
or enforce any rights hereunder
except as specifically provided in
this Agreement.
13.20 Successors and Assigns. This
Agreement shall be binding upon

17, 1991, and 1205-94, passed June 13,
1994, relating to adult entertainment
and to amusement and recreation
uses; and to supplement said codified ordinances by enacting new
Section 331.04 thereof relating to
measurement.
Whereas, numerous cities have
studied the effects of adult entertainment uses on the neighborhoods
and areas in which those uses are
located; and
Whereas, File No. _____ contains
copies of the “Adult Entertainment
Study” dated November 1994 conducted by the New York City
Department
of
Planning;
“Adult
Entertainment Businesses in Indianapolis, An Analysis” dated 1984
conducted by the Department of Metropolitan Development of the City of

Whereas, these numerous studies
conclude, based on documented evidence, that adult entertainment uses
have negative secondary effects
such
as
increased
crime
rates,
decreased property values, curtailed
retail trade and the deterioration of
the quality of urban life; and
Whereas, this Council finds that
the evidence presented and conclusions found in these studies are relevant to the City of Cleveland’s

uses; and
Whereas, this Council finds that
in Cleveland adult entertainment
uses
have
negative
secondary
effects on the areas surrounding

these negative secondary effects by
regulating the location of adult
entertainment uses by preventing
their
concentration
and
location
near certain sensitive uses; and

(a) Purpose. Based upon evidence

effects of adult entertainment uses

Council finds that adult entertainment uses in Cleveland cause negative secondary effects and has created this section to regulate adult

uses and location near specified
other uses. The provisions of this

Whereas, this Council enacted regulations concerning the registration
and placement of outdoor pay telephones on private property and the

The City Record
right-of-way, as Chapter 670B of the
Codified Ordinances, on June 14,
1993, in order to protect the health,
safety and welfare of the public; and
Whereas, this Council has determined that additional regulations
concerning the placement and permitting of outdoor pay telephones
on private property and the right-ofway are needed to further protection
of the public health, safety and welfare; and
Whereas, such additional regulations are needed due to the proliferation of outdoor pay telephones in
the City and the resultant increase
in
the
congregation
of
persons
around and about such phones, both
of which have created noise, have
created congestion for the public
using the right-of-way, parking lots,
service stations and other businesses, as well as seeking to enter and
leave their own or other residences
in the City, and have created aesthetic pollution and physical obstacles, blocking sightlines and causing
confusion for the police, pedestrians
and drivers; and such proliferation
of outdoor pay telephones has also
magnified the existing atmosphere
conducive to the attraction of drug
related crimes and criminals, prostitution,
gang activity, vandalism,
youth crimes and other public nuisances; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the following Sections of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
Section 670B.01, as enacted by

18, 1996,
Section 670B.07, as enacted by
Ordinance No. 2159-92, passed June
14, 1993, as renumbered by Ordinance No. 1545-93, passed July 14,
1993

Any outdoor pay telephone located on private property and registered with the City on the date of

periods of time, to provide lists of
each outgoing call as to the number

areas named in this division.
(i) An owner may apply in writing to the Commissioner for an
exemption
from
the
1,000
feet
restriction to place multiple outdoor
pay telephones at one location, due
to a demonstrated appropriate use
or need for additional outdoor pay
telephones as a result of a high
level of pedestrian and automobile
traffic, and a concentration of heavy
usage of pay telephones at that
location. Any such application shall
be referred to the Director of Planning for review and approval, and
if so approved, shall be submitted to
Council for action. If Council passes the ordinance approving the
exemption, such ordinance shall be
forwarded to the Commissioner who
shall attach the approved exemption
to the license of the owner, and the
owner may then apply for permits
for additional phones, as approved.
Any such approved exemption shall
be effective for the duration of any
permits granted pursuant to the
approved exemption.

application for a permit for a telephone on private property, or the
submission of written notification to

1174

June 25, 1997
the Director, pursuant to an executed contract with the City of the
intent of the owner to install a telephone in the right-of-way, shall be
considered a placement of a pay
telephone.

within
ten
business
days
after
receiving such notification.

of such telephone, other than liability arising from any negligent act
or omission which is solely attributable to the City, and shall furnish,
at said owner’s expense, such general commercial liability insurance
as shall protect said owner and the
City from all claims for damage to
property or bodily injury, including
death, which may arise from installation, maintenance and operation of
the telephone or in connection therewith. Such policy shall name the
City as an additional insured, shall
be in an amount to be determined
by the Director but not less than one
hundred thousand dollars ($100,000)
combined single limit for any injury
to persons and/or damage to property, and shall provide that the

identifying the registration number
and location of the telephone is present on the telephone; and
(3) Verification that the telephone
is well lighted, clean, free from
graffiti and stickers, other than

working order.
Once inspection of all pay telephones has been completed, the
Commissioner will provide a report
to the Director listing all pay telephones that have been installed on
private property within the City that
do not have a permit, or for which
the owner does not have a license,
when required, the owners of such
telephones, and the owners of the
properties where such telephones
are located.
(b) Any owner of a pay telephone
who is not in compliance with this
Chapter shall be notified in writing
by the Commissioner of the violation, a copy of which shall be sent
to the property owner or owners
where such violations exist, and
that the owner must correct the violations within five (5) business
days. If the owner fails to correct
the
violations
within
the
time
required, the Commissioner may
order any telephone in violation
removed within five (5) days, and
the Commissioner may order the
license or permit of the owner suspended until all violations are corrected, or revoked. An owner may
appeal a violation notice, a removal
order, or an order of suspension or
revocation to the Board of Zoning
Appeals within 10 days of the date
of receipt of the notice or order. The
Board shall promptly notify the
Clerk of Council of any appeal and
of the hearing date. The Board shall
hear the appeal within 10 days after
the appeal is filed, and the Board
shall issue a decision within 10 days

No notice of the hearing is required
to be provided to adjoining property owners.
(c) If the license of an owner is
suspended or revoked, the owner
must remove all telephones installed
on private property, and the owner
may not install any more telephones
until the suspension is lifted or a
new license is issued. If the permit
of an owner for a telephone is suspended or revoked, the owner must
remove that telephone until the suspension is lifted or a new permit is
issued. An appeal to the Board of
Zoning Appeals of a removal order,
or of a suspension or revocation,
shall stay such removal order, or the
requirement that one or all telephones be removed by the owner,
pending the decision of the Board.
(d) If an owner’s license or permit is revoked, the owner must
apply for a new license or permit
and pay all fees required for a
license or permit prior to the installation of any telephone. After the

tion, for one year after the date the
revocation is effective and after the
conclusion of any appeal therefrom.

with an order to correct a violation
of the requirements to maintain a
telephone clean or free of graffiti or
stickers within five (5) business
days from receipt of such an order,
the Commissioner may take action
necessary to clean or remove graffiti or stickers from the telephone at
the owner’s expense. The owner
shall reimburse the City for such
expenses.
Section 670B.07 Public Nuisance;
Removal of Outdoor Pay Telephones
(a) Upon request in writing by
the member of Council in whose
ward an outdoor pay telephone is
located in the right-of-way, or on private property, or upon receipt of
verbal or written citizen complaints
concerning such an outdoor pay telephone, the Director of Public Safety
shall conduct an investigation into
whether the installation and maintenance of the outdoor pay telephone constitutes a public nuisance.
Upon determination by the Director
of Public Safety that a particular
outdoor pay telephone constitutes a
public nuisance, the Director shall
order that special telephone service
features as are acceptable to the
Director shall be provided by the
outdoor pay telephone, or if the
Director determines it is necessary,
that the telephone be removed. Nothing in this Section shall preclude the
Director from ordering the removal
of a telephone without first requiring the implementation of special
features. A particular outdoor pay
telephone shall constitute a public
nuisance when the Director of Public Safety determines that one or
more of the following conditions
exist:
(1) The outdoor pay telephone has
been used in the commission of illegal drug transactions or other criminal activity, or substantially contributes by its presence to the commission of illegal drug transactions
or other criminal activity as evidenced by significant numbers of
such crimes occurring in the vicinity of the telephone;
(2) The existence of the outdoor
pay telephone has substantially contributed by its presence to the congregation of persons who have made
loud noises and other disturbances
that have disrupted persons residing
near the telephone or disrupted business enterprises located near the
telephone;
(3) The existence of the outdoor
pay telephone has substantially contributed by its presence to the congregation
of
persons
consuming
alcoholic beverages, except where
such
consumption
is
expressly
authorized by a state license, or consuming illegal or controlled substances;
(4) The existence of the outdoor
pay telephone has substantially contributed by its presence to the congregation of persons who have interfered with pedestrian or vehicular
traffic in the public right-of-way
near the telephone;
(5) Usage of the outdoor pay telephone between the hours of 1:00 a.m.
and 5:00 a.m. is significantly and
repeatedly above normal usage for
similarly situated outdoor pay telephones during the same hours so as
to indicate that the telephone is
being used in the commission of illegal drug activity or other criminal
activity;

The City Record
(6) The pay telephone has been
used to abuse the 911 system.
(b) The special features shall be
instituted,
or
the
owner
shall
remove the telephone, and restore
the right-of-way to its original condition, if applicable, within five (5)
business days of an order to institute special features or remove the
telephone. Any outdoor pay telephone which does not provide special features or is not removed, as
applicable, within five (5) business
days of such an order shall be subject to immediate removal by the
City at the owner’s expense and
shall constitute a default of the
owner’s contract or a violation of
the owner’s license and permit, as
applicable. The owner shall reimburse the City for the cost of removing and storing the telephone before
the telephone may be reclaimed by
the owner. Such costs shall also
include the cost of removing any
installation ancillary to the outdoor
pay telephone and the cost of restoring the public right-of-way to its
original condition.
(c) If the Director determines that
the nuisance may be abated by the
reducticn in the total number of pay
telephones in an area, the removal
of pay telephones shall be ordered
based upon the total period of time
that a telephone has been registered
with or permitted by the City or
placed pursuant to a contract with
the City, with the telephones registered, permitted, or made a part of
a contract for the least amount of
time being ordered removed first.
(d) The Director of Public Safety
will inform in writing the member
of Council who made the complaint
regarding the pay telephone the
result of such investigation and the
Director shall notify the member in
writing of any order issued by the
Director.
(e) Other than in the circumstance of a removal order pursuant
to Section 670B.03(b)(6), if an outdoor
pay
telephone
has
been
removed from a location because it
is a nuisance, no other pay telephone may be installed at the same
location or within 1,000 feet of that
location for a minimum of one year.
(f) The owner of an outdoor pay
telephone may appeal from the
determination of a nuisance and the
order of special features or removal
issued pursuant to this section to
the Board of Zoning Appeals within
five (5) business days after receipt
of the order. The order shall be
stayed during the pendency of the
appeal before the Board. The Board
shall commence to hear the merits
of an appeal within thirty (30) days
of the filing of an appeal. The
Board shall render a decision within ten (10) days of the date of the
hearing, which decision may affirm,
disaffirm, or grant exception from
the order, requirement, decision or
determination
from
which
the
appeal has been taken. If the Board
affirms an order of the Director that
a telephone constitutes a nuisance,
the owner shall have three (3) business days to remove the outdoor pay
telephone in question; if the owner
fails to correct the violation within
that time, the outdoor pay telephone
may be removed by the Director at
the owner’s expense.
Section 670B.08 PUCO Regulations
Nothing in this Chapter shall be
read so as to limit the authority of
the PUCO to regulate outdoor pay
telephones within the City of Cleveland, nor to conflict with the author-

1177

65
ity of the PUCO to approve any special services for pay telephones.
Section 670B.99 Penalty
Any owner as defined in this
Chapter, or any owner, lessee, or
person in possession or control of
private property where an outdoor
pay telephone is or has been located, who violates any part of this
Chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and fined a mandatory one
hundred ($100.00) dollars for a first
offense and five hundred dollars
($500.00) for a second or subsequent
offense. Each day that a violation
occurs or continues constitutes a
separate offense.
Section
2.
That
all
revenue
received by the City from outdoor
pay telephones in the right-of-way
or any pay telephones on or in public property shall be used to fund
computerization and technology projects for the benefit of citizens of

Ord. No. 1173-97.
By Councilman Westbrook (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance providing for the issuance and sale of
bonds in the maximum principal
amount of $11,500,000 to advance
refund certain of the City’s outstanding General Obligation Bonds
issued in 1991 to pay expenses
incurred in the issuance of those
bonds
and
that
refunding,
and
authorizing the execution and delivery of an escrow agreement and
other agreements with repsect to the
bonds and the advance refunding.
Whereas, pursuant to Ordinance
No. 2611-91, passed on November 11,
1991,
General
Obligation
Bonds,
Series 1991C, in the aggregate principal amount of $12,500,000, dated as
of December 1, 1991 (the “1991C General Obligation Bonds”), were issued
for the purpose of providing funds
with which to pay or reimburse the
City for the payment of final judgments rendered against the City,
including
settlements
of
claims
approved by a court, and including
interest thereon to the approximate
date of issuance of the bonds, costs
and expenses assessed or taxed
against and defense costs of the
City, and other costs, including
financing costs, permitted by Chapter 133, Ohio Revised Code, to be
paid from the proceeds of such
bonds (the “1991C Purpose”); and
Whereas, this Council finds and
determines that: (i) it is necessary
and in the best interest of the City
to advance refund the 1991C General Obligation Bonds that are stated
to mature on October 1 in the year
2011 (term bonds in the aggregate
principal amount of $4,100,000) and
in the years 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005,
2006 and 2007 (serial bonds in the
aggregate
principal
amounts
of
$610,000, $660,000, $700,000, $755,000,
$810,000 and $860,000, respectively)
(those outstanding bonds, together
with any other outstanding unvoted
general obligation bonds of the City
designated to be refunded pursuant
to Section 1 are collectively referred
to as the “Refunded Bonds”); and
(ii) to issue the Bonds described in
Section 1 to provide funds for that
purpose, including the payment of
any
expenses
relating
to
the
advance refunding of the Refunded
Bonds or the issuance of the Bonds;
and
Whereas,
pursuant
to
Revised
Code
Sections
133.14(C)
and
133.34(A)(3), the maximum maturity
of the Bonds is December 31, 2016;
and
Whereas, this Council passed Ordinance No. 1749-80 on October 8, 1980,
and thereafter amended that ordinance by Ordinance No. 1112-83,
passed on May 6, 1983, and Ordinance No. 944-96, passed on June 10,
1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so
amended and as the same may further be amended from time to time
in accordance with its provisions, is
referred to as the “General Bond
Ordinance”), providing the general
terms
and
provisions
for
the
issuance thereunder of unvoted general obligations of the City and the
General Bond Ordinance was passed
in contemplation of this Ordinance
and other ordinances authorizing
the issuance of bonds in accordance
with the provisions thereof (the
“Series Bond Ordinances”); and
Whereas, the issuance of the
Bonds is necessary to provide funds
to advance refund the Refunded
Bonds which will enable the City to

The City Record
obtain debt service savings which
are urgently needed for the benefit
of the City, and as a result, this
Ordinance constitutes an emergency
measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public, peace,
property, health and safety, and for
the usual daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary that Bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed
Eleven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($11,500,000) be issued
for the purpose of advance refunding the Refunded Bonds that the
Director
of
Finance
determines,
based on the advice of the City’s
financial advisor, would be advantageous to the City to advance
refund due to savings in bond service charges or the restructuring of
the currently scheduled bond service
charges or otherwise to better serve
the interests of the City, and for the
purpose of paying any expenses
relating to the advance refunding of
the
Refunded
Bonds
and
the
issuance of the Bonds, including all
financing costs within the meaning
of Revised Code Section 133.15(B).
The aggregate principal amount
of Bonds to be issued shall not
exceed $11,500,000 and shall be in an
amount determined by the Director
of Finance to be the aggregate
principal amount of Bonds that are
required to be issued, taking into
account
any
discount
from
the
aggregate principal amount of the
Bonds at which they are sold to the
Original Purchaser, in order to
effect the purpose for which the
Bonds are to be issued, including
the payment of any expenses relating to the advance refunding of the
Refunded Bonds and the issuance of
the Bonds, which amount shall be
set forth in the certificate providing
for the final terms of the Bonds and
the sale of the Bonds and signed by
the Director of Finance in accordance with this Ordinance (the “Certificate of Award”). The Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that additional
maturities or different maturities of
the series of unvoted general obligation bonds of the City identified in
the preambles of this Ordinance and
issued for the 1991C Purpose may be
refunded
and
thereby
constitute
Refunded Bonds; provided that in
adding or changing such maturities
the Director of Finance determines,
based on advice from the City’s
financial
advisor,
that
advance
refunding such maturities generates
present value debt service savings
to the City or otherwise is in the
best interests of the City, taking
into account all the factors that the
Director of Finance and the City’s
financial advisor deem relevant to
such determination.
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Revised
Code Chapter 133, and other applicable provisions of the Revised Code,
the Charter of the City, the General
Bond Ordinance, and this Ordinance
in the principal amount and for the
purpose stated in Section 1. The
Bonds shall be designated as determined by the Director of Finance.
The Bonds shall be issued in one lot
as fully registered Bonds in denominations of $5,000 or any integral

1207

95
multiple thereof but in no case as
to a particular maturity date exceeding the principal amount maturing
on that date. The Bonds shall be
numbered as determined by the
Director of Finance.
The Bonds shall be dated as of
August 1, 1997 or such other date
specified
in
the
Certificate
of
Award, but in no event later than
December 31, 1997. The Bonds shall
bear interest at the rate of nine percent (9%) per year or at the rate or
rates per year specified in the Certificate of Award; provided that if
all the Bonds bear interest at the
same rate per year, then such rate
shall not exceed nine percent (9%)
per year, and if the Bonds bear
interest at more than one rate per
year, then the weighted average of
such rates (taking into account the
principal amount and maturity of
each Bond to which a rate applies)
shall not exceed nine percent (9%)
per year. Interest on the Bonds shall
be
payable,
until
the
principal
amount is paid, semi-annually on
February 1 and August 1 of each
year or on the first day of each of
two months specified in the Certificate of Award as the dates on which
interest on the Bonds shall be
payable
(the
“Interest
Payment
Dates”), beginning February 1, 1998,
or on such other Interest Payment
Date specified in the Certificate of
Award as the first Interest Payment
Date. The Bonds shall bear interest
from the most recent date to which
interest has been paid or provided
for or, if no interest has been paid
or provided for, from their date.
The Bonds shall mature in the
years and principal amounts as
shall be determined by the Director
of Finance and specified in the Certificate of Award, provided that (i)
each principal payment shall occur
on an Interest Payment Date, (ii)
the first principal payment on the
Bonds shall be no earlier than January 1, 1998 and no later than
August 1, 1999, (iii) the final maturity date of the Bonds shall be no
later than the last maturity permitted by law for the Refunded Bonds,
and (iv) the principal amount thereof shall be payable in annual
installments such that the total principal and interest payments on the
Bonds in any fiscal year in which
principal is payable, is not more
than three times the amount of
those payments for the Refunded
Bonds in any fiscal year in which
principal
was
payable
on
the
Refunded Bonds.
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the
“Mandatory
Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption prior to stated maturity
as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandato-

96
ry sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent
for payment of principal of and
interest on any Term Bonds shall
include
amounts
sufficient
to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption obligation) of the
City for any Term Bonds. That
option shall be exercised by the
City on or before the forty-fifth
(45th) day preceding the applicable
Mandatory Redemption Date, by
furnishing the Escrow Agent a certificate, signed by the Registrar,
setting forth the extent of the credit to be applied with respect to the
then current Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement. If
the certificate is not timely furnished to the Escrow Agent, the
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption obligation) shall not be reduced. A credit against the then current Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory redemption obligation)
also shall be received by the City
for any Term Bonds which prior
thereto have been redeemed (other
than through the operation of the
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements) or purchased
for cancellation and canceled by
the Registrar, to the extent not
applied theretofore as
a credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of
the principal amount thereof against
the then current Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement (and
corresponding mandatory redemption obligation). Any excess of that
amount
over
the
then
current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement shall be credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligations) in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(b)
Optional
Redemption.
The
Bonds may be subject to redemption
prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole on any
date, or in part on any Interest Payment Date, on the dates and for the
prices specified in the Certificate of
Award, or the Director of Finance
may determine that it is in the best
interests of the City for the Bonds
not to be callable prior to their stated maturity. In the event that the
Bonds are callable, the earliest date
for optional redemption shall be no
later than the tenth anniversary of
the first principal payment date and
the maximum redemption price shall

The City Record
be no greater than 102% of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued
interest to the redemption date.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar, given upon the direction
of the Council of the City by passage of an ordinance. That notice
shall specify the redemption date
and the principal amount of each
maturity of Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar. In
the event that notice of redemption
shall have been given by the Registrar to the registered owners as
hereinafter provided, there shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, funds
which, in addition to any other moneys available therefor and held by
the Registrar, will be sufficient to
redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus interest accrued to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice
of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Bonds by lot when Bonds of
denominations greater than $5,000
are then outstanding, each $5,000
unit of principal thereof shall be
treated as though it were a separate
Bond of the denomination of $5,000.
If it is determined that one or more,
but not all of the $5,000 units of
principal amount represented by a
Bond are to be called for redemption, then upon notice of redemption
of a $5,000 unit or units, the registered owner of that Bond shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i)
for payment of the redemption price
of the $5,000 unit or units called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption and any
premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given

1208

June 25, 1997
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity
of
the
proceedings
for
the
redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph hereof, the Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due and payable
on the redemption date, and, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the
redemption
price,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date. If
money for the redemption of all of
the Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with interest
accrued thereon to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, so as to be available therefor on that date and, if
notice
of
redemption
has
been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
that money shall not be so available
on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held
by
the
Registrar
for
the
redemption of particular Bonds shall
be held in trust for the account of
the registered owners thereof and
shall be paid to them, respectively,
upon presentation and surrender of
those Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section
3) at the close of business on the
fifteenth day of the calendar month
next preceding that Interest Payment
Date
(the
Record
Date).
Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond Ordinance,
so long as the Bonds are held by a
Depository in a book entry system
(as described in Section 3), debt
charges on the Bonds will be
payable in lawful money of the United States by wire transfer to the
Depository made by the Escrow
Agent on each Interest Payment
Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance is hereby adopted by ref-

June 25, 1997
erence, and, except for the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 of the General Bond Ordinance
(pertaining generally to the periods
during
which
the
City
is
not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under the
General Bond Ordinance), which are
not included in this Ordinance and
will not apply to the Bonds, the General Bond Ordinance is included as
a part of this Ordinance as fully as
if restated herein. Words and terms
not otherwise defined herein shall
have the same meaning as set forth
in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their faces
the purpose for which they are
issued and that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to
Section 4 of the General Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be authenticated by the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee.
The Bonds shall be signed by the
City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor and
by the City’s Director of Finance or
Acting Director of Finance; provided, however, that in accordance with
Section 9.96 of the Code and the foregoing requirement that each Bond
bear the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee,
either or both of the signatures of
the City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor or
of its Director of Finance or Acting
Director of Finance may be a facsimile. The Bonds shall bear the
seal of the City, which seal may be
a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section
83 of the City’s Charter, the Director of Law or Acting Director of
Law shall prepare the Bonds and
shall endorse thereon his or her
approval of the form and correctness
thereof by his or her manual or facsimile signature.
Star Bank, N.A., is appointed to
act as the authenticating agent,
bond registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Bonds (the
Registrar);
provided
that
the
Escrow Agent also shall act as paying agent for the Bonds so long as
the Bonds are held in a book entry
system. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, the Registrar Agreement among the City,
the Registrar and the Escrow Agent
(the Agreement) in substantially
the form as is now on file with the
Clerk of Council in File No. 1173-97A. The Agreement is approved,
together
with
any
changes
or
amendments that are not inconsistent with this ordinance and not
substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Agreement or amendments to the
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Agreement from the
proceeds of the Bonds to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust

The City Record
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided
in this Section (the Bond Register).
Subject to the provisions of Section
5, the person in whose name a Bond
is registered on the Bond Register
shall be regarded as the absolute
owner of that Bond for all purposes
of this ordinance. Payment of or on
account of the debt charges on any
Bond shall be made only to or upon
the order of that person; neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be
affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Bond at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner
or
by
a
person
legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of
this ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Bonds
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Bonds surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) phys-

1209

97
ical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a
book entry system is utilized: (i)
the Bonds may be issued in the
form of a single, fully registered
Bond representing each maturity
and registered in the name of the
Depository or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the
custody of the Depository; (ii) the
beneficial owners in book entry
form shall have no right to receive
Bonds in the form of physical securities or certificates; (iii) ownership
of beneficial interests in book entry
form shall be shown by book entry
on the system maintained and operated by the Depository and its Participants, and transfers of the ownership of beneficial interests shall
be made only by book entry by the
Depository and its Participants; and
(iv) the Bonds as such shall not be
transferable or exchangeable, except
for transfer to another Depository
or to another nominee of a Depository, without further action by the
City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Bonds from the Depository,
and the Trustee and Registrar shall
authenticate and deliver bond certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.

Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking
Fund and, if not purchased by such
Trustees, shall be offered to the
Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased by
such Account, shall be sold to
Lehman Brothers, Merrill, Lynch &
Co., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.,
Pryor, McClendon, Counts & Co.,
Inc., and SBK-Brooks Investment
Corp. (collectively, the “Original
Purchaser”); provided, however, that
if, in the reasonable opinion of the
Director of Finance, an underwriter
is incapable of fully performing its
duties or meeting its obligations in
its capacity as Original Purchaser
with respect to the Bonds, the Director of Finance is hereby authorized
and directed, in the name of and on
behalf of the City, to take whatever actions may be necessary to terminate that underwriter’s standing
as Original Purchaser.
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Bonds as set forth in the Bond Purchase
Agreement
including:
the
principal amount of the Bonds, the
final purchase price (which shall be
not less than 97% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest to
their date of delivery), the interest
rate or rates, the amounts and years
in which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements), and the
Interest Payment Dates and the
date of the Bonds (if different from
those set forth in Section 2). If it is
determined advisable by the Director of Finance for the sale of the
Bonds, the Director of Finance is
authorized to sign agreements with
a municipal bond insurer issuing a
policy of municipal bond insurance
for the Bonds that are not materially inconsistent with this Ordinance.
The
Mayor,
Director
of
Finance, Director of Law and other
appropriate officers of the City are,
and each of them is, authorized and
directed to take such actions as are
necessary, appropriate and in the
best interest of the City to establish
the terms and requirements for
delivery of the Bonds and to make
such arrangements as are necessary
with the Original Purchaser in order
to establish the date, location, and
procedure, and conditions for the
delivery of the Bonds to the Original Purchaser, to give all appropriate notices and certificates, to cause
a true transcript or proceedings
with reference to the issuance of the
Bonds to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Mayor and the Director
of Finance are, and each of them is,
hereby
further
authorized
and
directed to execute and deliver on
behalf of the City a bond purchase
agreement
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, between the City and the Original Purchaser setting forth the

The City Record
terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell and the Original
Purchaser agrees to buy the Bonds,
provided that such agreement shall
not provide for or require the terms
of the Bonds to be inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Bond Purchase
Agreement is approved substantially in the form now on the file with
the Clerk of Council in the File No.
referenced in Section 3 of this Ordinance, together with any changes or
amendments that are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and not
substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Bond
Purchase
Agreement
or
amendments to the Bond Purchase
Agreement. It is hereby determined
that the terms of the Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance and as may
be provided in or pursuant to the
Certificate of Award, are in the best
interest of the City and in compliance with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an
Official Statement is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
original issuance of the Bonds, those
officers in their official capacities
are authorized to prepare or cause
to be prepared on behalf of the City
an Official Statement and any necessary supplements thereto, and on
behalf of the City to use and distribute, or authorize the use and distribution of, that Official Statement
and any supplements thereto in connection with the original issuance of
the Bonds, and each of those officers is authorized to sign on behalf
of the City and in his or her official
capacity, that Official Statement and
any supplements thereto approved
by such officer. Those officers are
and each of them is authorized to
sign and deliver, on behalf of the
City and in their official capacities,
such certificates in connection with
the accuracy of the Official Statement and any supplements thereto
as may, in their judgment, be necessary or appropriate. Such officers
are also hereby authorized to determine and certify on behalf of the
City that such disclosure document
is “deemed final” by the City within the meaning of Securities and
Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12
(the “SEC Rule”).
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under, the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
and directed to prepare or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute an agreement made by the
City for the benefit of the holders
and beneficial owners of the Bonds
in accordance with the Rule. The
City’s performance of that agreement shall be subject to the availability of funds and their annual

1210

June 25, 1997
appropriation to meet costs the City
would be required to incur to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of the
occurrence of any other events, the
Director of Finance shall consult
with, as appropriate, the legal counsel and bond or other qualified independent special counsel to the City.
The Director of Finance, acting in
the name and on behalf of the City,
shall be entitled to rely upon any
legal advice provided by any such
counsel in determining whether a
filing should be made.
Pursuant
to
Section
133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds
with other bonds into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of their sale as a single issue to
be
designated
“Various
Purpose
General Obligation Bonds, Series
1997”. Such bonds shall contain a
summary
statement
of
purposes
encompassing the purpose for which
the Bonds are issued and shall state
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds
promptly when and as the same
falls due, and also to provide for the
discharge of the Bonds at maturity,
there shall be and is hereby levied
on all the taxable property in the
City, in addition to all other taxes,
a direct tax annually during the
period the Bonds are outstanding, in
an amount sufficient to provide for
the payment of that interest, when
and as the same shall fall due, and
also to discharge the principal of
the Bonds at maturity, which tax
shall not be less than the interest
and sinking fund tax required by
Section 11 of Article XII of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is hereby
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers,
in the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes for each of those years are certified, extended and collected. The
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from the tax levies hereby
required shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund as provided pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance which, together with the
interest collected on the same, shall
be irrevocably pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on
the Bonds when and as the same
fall due; provided, however, that,
subject to the provisions of Section
8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in
each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the
Bonds and are appropriated for such
purpose, the amount of such tax
shall be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and
appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25 and 5705.51 of the
Revised Code, and in accordance

June 25, 1997
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the
General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt
charges for the Bonds.

specifically authorized to file, on
behalf of the City, subscriptions for
the purchase and issuance of those

Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
