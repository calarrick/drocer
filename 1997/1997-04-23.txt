ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
____________
Res. No. 1945-96.
By
Councilmen
Miller
and
Rokakis (by departmental request).
An emergency resolution authorizing declarations of official intent
under U.S. Treasury Regulations
with respect to reimbursements from
proceeds of tax-exempt obligations
for temporary advances made, prior
to issuance of those obligations, for
payments for airport improvements.
Whereas, United States Treasury
Regulations
prescribe
conditions
under which proceeds of tax-exempt
bonds, notes or other obligations
used to reimburse advances made
for certain expenditures paid before
the issuance of such obligations will
be deemed to be expended (or properly allocated to expenditures) for
purposes of Sections 103 and 141-150
of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, so that upon such reimbursement the proceeds so used will not
further be subject to requirements
or restrictions under those sections
of the Internal Revenue Code; and
Whereas, certain provisions of
those Regulations require that there
be a Declaration of Official Intent
not later than 60 days, following
payment of the expenditure expected to be reimbursed from proceeds
of such obligations, and that the
reimbursement occur within prescribed time periods after the expenditure is paid or after the property
is placed in service; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
expects to expand and improve its
airport facilities at Cleveland Hopkins
International
Airport
to
increase and improve the transportation services available to the public; and
Whereas, this Council wishes to
take steps to permit those airport
improvements to be later financed
with tax-exempt obligations in compliance with the above-described
United States Treasury Regulations
and thereby reduce the cost of those
facilities, which obligations are to
be authorized by separate and subsequent legislation of this Council;
now therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Definitions. The following definitions apply to the terms
used herein:
“Authorized Officer” means the
Director of Finance of the City.
“Bonds”
means
and
includes
bonds, notes, certificates and other
obligations included in the meaning
of “bonds” under Section 150 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
issued
by
the
City
to
finance
improvements relating to municipal
airport operations and related services and activities, including, without
limitation,
airport
revenue
bonds, special facility bonds payable
solely from rental payments by a
lessee and other obligations payable
from fees or charges relating to airport operations or related services
and activities.
“Declaration of Official Intent”
means a declaration of intent, in the
form and manner and time contemplated in the Reimbursement Regulations, that the advances for expenditures referred to therein are reasonably expected to be reimbursed
from the proceeds of Reimbursement
Bonds to be issued after those
expenditures are paid.
“Reimbursement” or “reimburse”
means the restoration to the City or

to the lessee or other obligor under
agreements between that obligor
and the City, as the case may be, of
money temporarily advanced from
other funds and spent for capital
expenditures
(and
certain
other
types of expenditures qualifying
under the Reimbursement Regulations, including any issuance costs
for Reimbursement Bonds) before
the issuance of the Reimbursement
Bonds, evidenced in writing by an
allocation on the books and records
of the City or the obligor that shows
the use of the proceeds of the Reimbursement Bonds to restore the
money advanced for the original
expenditure.
“Reimbursement”
or
“reimburse”generally
does
not
include the refunding or retiring of
Bonds previously issued and sold to,
or borrowings from, unrelated entities.
“Reimbursement
Bonds”
means
Bonds the proceeds of which are to
be used for reimbursement of such
capital or other qualifying expenditures paid before issuance of the
Bonds.
“Reimbursement
Regulations”
means Treasury Regulations Section
1.150-2 and any amendments thereto
or superseding regulations, whether
in proposed, temporary or final
form, as at the time applicable, prescribing conditions under which the
proceeds of Reimbursement Bonds
when allocated or applied to a reimbursement
will
be
treated
as
expended for all or any purposes of
Sections 103 and 141 to 150 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
Section
2.
Authorization
and
Requirement of Declarations of Official Intent. The Authorized Officer
is authorized to prepare and sign
Declarations of Official Intent with
respect to capital and other expenditures to which the Reimbursement
Regulations apply (and including
any costs of issuance of the Reimbursement Bonds) to be made from
money temporarily available and
which are reasonably expected to be
reimbursed
(in
accordance
with
applicable authorizations, policies
and practices) from the proceeds of
Reimbursement
Bonds,
to
make
appropriate
reimbursement
and
timely allocations from the proceeds
of the Reimbursement Bonds to
reimburse such prior expenditures,
and to take any other actions as
may be appropriate, all at the times
and in the manner required under
the Reimbursement Regulations to
satisfy the requirements for the
reimbursement to be treated as an
expenditure of such proceeds for
purposes of Sections 103 and 141 to
150 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986. No advance from any fund of
account or order for payment may
be made for expenditures (other
than expenditures excepted from
such requirement under the Reimbursement Regulations) that are to
be reimbursed subsequently from
proceeds of Reimbursement Bonds
unless a Declaration of Official
Intent with respect thereto is made
within the time required by the
Reimbursement
Regulations.
All
Declarations
of
Official
Intent
heretofore made on half of the City
are hereby ratified and adopted. The
Director of Finance shall notify the
Council of the amount of any expenditures reimbursed from the Reimbursement Bonds pursuant to this
resolution.
Section 3. Open Meeting. This
Council finds and determines that
all formal actions of this Council
concerning and relating to the adop-

522

April 23, 1997
tion of this Resolution were taken
in an open meeting of this Council
and that all deliberations of this
Council and of any committees that
resulted in those formal actions
were in meetings open to the public
in compliance with the law.
Section 4. Emergency Measure.
This Resolution is declared to be an
emergency measure for the immediate preservation of the public peace,
property, health and safety of the
City by providing authorization to
carry out the Declarations of Official Intent, which are necessary to
preserve the availability of taxexempt
financing
for
airport
improvements urgently needed for
the benefit of the City and, as a
result, this Resolution constitutes
and emergency measure providing
for the usual daily operation of a
municipal department, and, provided
this Resolution receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the
members elected to Council, it shall
take effect and be in force immediately upon its adoption and approval
by the Mayor; otherwise it shall
take effect and be in force from and
after the earliest period allowed by
law.
Adopted April 14, 1997.
Effective April 14, 1997.

repealing Res. No. 26-97, objecting to
said transfer of ownership, pursuant
to a Cooperation Agreement dated

the transfer of a D2, D2X and D3
Liquor Permit to Jeg Lounge Bar

Agreement dated April 8, 1997, a
copy of which is in the file for this
address in the City Law Department; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

transfer of ownership of a D2, D2X
and D3 Liquor Permit to Jeg Lounge
Bar Inc. at 4995-97 Denison Avenue

said objection, be and the same is
hereby repealed and that this Council consents to the immediate transfer of ownership thereof.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
