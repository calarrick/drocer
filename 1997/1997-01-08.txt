(by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing and directing the purchase by
requirement contract of labor and
materials necessary to rehabilitate
snow removal trucks and to rehabilitate or replace salt inserts, for
the Division of Motor Vehicle Maintenance, Department of Public Service.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Public Service is hereby authorized
and directed to make a written
requirement contract in accordance
with the Charter and the Codified
Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
for the requirements for the period
of one year for the necessary items
of labor and materials necessary to
rehabilitate snow removal trucks
and labor and materials necessary
to rehabilitate or replace salt inserts
in the estimated sum of $250,000.00,
to be purchased by the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies upon
a unit basis for the Division of
Motor Vehicle Maintenance, Department of Public Service. Bids shall be
taken in such manner as to permit
an award to be made for all items
as a single contract, or by separate
contract for each or any combination of said items as the Board of
Control shall determine. Alternate
bids for a period less than a year
may be taken if deemed desirable
by the Commissioner of Purchases
and Supplies until provision is made
for the requirements for the entire
year.
Section 2. The cost of said contract shall be charged against the
proper appropriation account and
the Director of Finance shall certify thereon the amount of the initial
purchase thereunder, which purchase, together with all subsequent
purchases, shall be made on order of
the Commissioner of Purchases and
Supplies pursuant to a requisition
against such contract duly certified
by the Director of Finance. (RL
21070)
Section 3. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it

14

January 8, 1997
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Referred to Directors of Public
Service, Finance, Law; Committees
on Public Service, Finance.
Ord. No. 18-97.
By
Councilmen
Jackson
and
Rokakis (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Community
Development to enter into an Enterprise Zone Agreement with the
Young Mens Christian Association
of Cleveland, Ohio, or its designee,
to provide for an eight year abatement for certain real estate taxes as
an incentive to rehabilitate the Central YMCA Branch and residential
tower at East 22nd and Prospect
Avenue in the Cleveland Area Enterprise Zone.
Whereas, pursuant to Ordinance
No. 948-95, passed June 19, 1995, this
Council designated an area which is
in
the
City
of
Cleveland
and
described in File No. 948-95-A, as the
Cleveland
Area
Enterprise
Zone
(the “Zone”) pursuant to Chapter
5709 of the Ohio Revised Code; and
Whereas, in August, 1995, the
Director of Development of the State
of Ohio determined that the Zone
contains the characteristics set forth
in Section 5709.61(A) of the Revised
Code and certified said area as an
“Urban Jobs and Enterprise Zone”
pursuant to Chapter 5709 of the
Revised Code; and
Whereas, the Young Mens Christian Association of Cleveland, Ohio,
or its designee (the “Enterprise”)
has proposed to rehabilitate the Central YMCA Branch and residential
tower at East 22nd and Prospect
Avenue; and
Whereas, the Enterprise has certified to the City that, but for abatement of real estate taxes the Enterprise would be at a competitive disadvantage by operating at this location; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure in that
the same provides for the immediate
preservation of the public peace,
safety, property, and welfare and
for the further reason that its enactment is a necessary prerequisite to
providing immediate assistance to
create and preserve job opportunities and advance and promote commercial and economic development
in the City of Cleveland, such assistance being immediately necessary
or such jobs will be lost; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby approves the application of the
Young Mens Christian Association
of Cleveland, Ohio, or its designee(s), for enterprise zone incentives on the basis that the Young
Mens Christian Association of Cleveland, Ohio is qualified by financial
responsibility and business experience to create and preserve employment opportunities in the Cleveland
Area
Enterprise
Zone
and
to
improve the economic climate of the
City of Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Director of
Community Development is authorized to enter into an Enterprise
Zone Agreement with the Young
Mens Christian Association of Cleveland, Ohio, or its designee(s), to
provide for an eight (8) year abatement for certain real estate taxes as
an incentive to rehabilitate the Central YMCA Branch and residential
tower at East 22nd and Prospect

January 8, 1997
Avenue in Cleveland Ohio; said
abatement shall be subject to annual review of the Tax Incentive
Review Council.
Section 3. That the terms of said
tax abatement shall be in accordance with the term as set forth in
the Executive Summary contained
in File No. 18-97-A.
Section 4. That the Director of
Law shall prepare and approve said
agreement and that said agreement
shall contain such terms and provisions as he deems necessary to protect the City’s interest.
Section 5. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Referred to Directors of Community Development, Finance, Law;
Committees on Community and Economic Development, Finance.

An emergency ordinance authorizing and directing the purchase by
contract of not to exceed thirty six

Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of

Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

and directed to make a written contract in accordance with the Charter
