Liquor Permit to Permit No. 8771382,

Leaf Tavern, 2109 Tate Avenue,
Cleveland, Ohio 44109; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor

state; and

of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the

respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure provid-
