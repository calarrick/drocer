follows:
Section 443.261 Drivers’ Expenses

a) Finding. This Council finds
that the wages earned by drivers of
public hacks are inadequate to

2035

11
insure a sufficient number of taxicabs and capable drivers, and that
the public convenience and necessity require the imposition of a cap
on the expenses paid by drivers of
public hacks.
(b) Definitions. As used in this
section: “Drivers’ expenses” means
all costs, expenses and fees paid by
drivers to a company, association or
independent
operator
currently
charged or hereafter established for
the lease of a public hack, it
includes, by way of example and not
by way of limitation, the costs of
the lease itself, insurance, surcharges, and fuel.
“Base rates” means the drivers’
expenses charge by a company,
association or independent operator
to its drivers on the date of introduction of the ordinance that originally enacted this section.
(c) Drivers’ Expenses Capped. For
the period commencing on the effective date of this ordinance and ending on February 28, 1998, a company, association or independent operator shall not increase its drivers’
expenses over the “base rates” as
defined in division (b) of this section. For the period of March 1, 1998
through December 31, 1998, a company, association or independent
operator shall not increase its drivers’ expenses by more than five per
cent (5%) over the “base rates” as
defined in division (b) of this section. For the period of January 1,
1998 through December 31, 1999 a
company, association or independent
operator shall not increase its drivers’ expenses by more than additional five per cent (5%) over the
“base rates”. Thereafter, a company,
association or independent operator
shall not increase drivers’ expenses
by more than an additional ten per
cent (10%) over the “base rates”.
In the case of fuel only, changes
in the market price of the commodity may be passed along to drivers,
and any such increase shall not be
counted toward the caps imposed by
this division. Overhead costs associated with the sale of fuel by a company, association or independent
operator are subject to the caps
imposed by this division.
(d) Reporting. Within ten (10)
days after the effective date of this
section, each company, association
or independent operator shall submit a schedule of its base rates as
defined in division (b) of this section.
On or before December 31 in each
year subsequent to the effective
date of this section, each company,
association or independent operator
shall submit its then current schedule
of
rates,
identifying
any
changes in drivers’ expenses. The
requirements of this paragraph are
satisfied by the company, association or independent operator by a
certification
of
the
percentage
change in drivers’ expenses from
the previous reporting period.
All reports required by this section shall be certified by an affidavit by the owner of the company,
association or independent operator,
on such forms as the Commissioner
of Assessments and Licenses shall
prescribe.
