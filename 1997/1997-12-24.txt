Section 331.04 Measurement
In all instances where this Zoning
Code requires a separation of use
districts, lots, buildings or uses by
a specified distance, such distance
shall be measured in a geometrically straight line using a scaled map,
or a survey if deemed necessary.
Unless otherwise specified in this
Zoning Code, such line shall be measured to run from the nearest point
on the nearest lot line of the lot or
lots upon which the regulated use
and any accessory parking are
located to either the nearest point
on the nearest lot line of the lot or
lots upon which a use and any
accessory parking are located from
which the regulated use is required
to be separated or the nearest point
on the nearest boundary of the district from which the regulated use
is required to be separated, whichev-

December 24, 1997
er terminal point is applicable. Such
measurement shall be made without
regard to intervening structures,
objects, uses, the street grid, landforms, waterways, or any other topographic feature. The calculation and
application of distance requirements
for separation of uses shall consider uses across the City’s boundary
in the application of divisions (c)(3)
and (4) of Section 347.07, division
(b) and division (c) of Section
347.12, and divisions (d) (2) of Section 347.15. The calculation shall

an agreement whereby each will
consider uses and districts across
the common boundary. The Director
of City Planning shall have authority to enter into such an agreement
upon notification of the councilpersons whose ward is affected.

(c) Definition. For purposes of
this section, a “surface parking lot”
is an off-street parking area which
is located at street-grade level and
which is not enclosed within a
garage structure. The unenclosed
roof surface of a garage shall not
be considered a “surface parking
lot” if such surface is located at
least one story above grade level on
at least one of its frontages.
(d) Prohibition. Notwithstanding
other provisions of the Zoning Code,
no surface parking lot shall be
established or expanded within the
designated
districts
except
as
approved by the City Planning Commission in accordance with this section.
(e) Planning Commission Determination. The City Planning Commission shall approve building permit applications for the establishment or expansion of surface parking lots in the designated districts
only in accordance with the following provisions:
(1) Temporary Parking Lots. If
the City Planning Commission or
Landmarks Commission, as applicable, has approved demolition of a
building within the designated district(s) and has approved, in accordance with the regulations of Sections 341.04 and 341.05 or Section
161.05, as applicable, plans for a new
building or other non-parking use to
replace such building, the subject
property may be used as a surface
parking lot for a maximum period
of one (1) year following the demolition of the building. If all necessary redevelopment permits have
not been obtained within one year
of the commencement of surface
parking use, the property shall be
landscaped as open space or shall be
converted to another appropriate
non-parking use in accordance with
a site plan approved by the Commission.
The Commission may, however,
approve a request by the owner to
extend use of the parking lot for a
single period not greater than one
(1) year in duration if the Commission determines that the owner has
made a “good faith effort” to secure
the approved redevelopment. During
the time period of such extension,
the Commission and the owner shall
undertake
discussions
regarding
efforts to facilitate appropriate redevelopment of the property. At the
conclusion of the extension period,
the property either shall be landscaped as open space or shall be
converted to another appropriate
non-parking use in accordance with
a site plan approved by the Commission or, alternatively, the owner

18
may seek a variance from the Board
of Zoning Appeals in accordance
with the provisions of division (h)
of this section.
(2) Accessory Parking. Establishment or expansion of a surface
parking lot within the designated
districts shall be permitted if the
City Planning Commission determines that the lot will be used
exclusively for accessory parking
spaces to serve a new use or uses
proposed for a development, expansion or redevelopment project which
has been approved by the City Planning
Commission
or
Landmarks
Commission,
as
applicable,
but
which has not yet been completed.
The number of parking spaces in
such accessory lot shall not be
greater than 120% of the number of
spaces which would be required for
such use by the City’s Zoning Code.
(3) Action Areas. The City Planning Commission shall approve an
application for a surface parking lot
if the subject property has been designated for surface parking as part
of an “action area” (as defined in
Section 315.03) of a community
development plan adopted by Council in the manner set forth in Title
V of the Codified Ordinances.
(4) Vacant Lots. On any vacant
lot which was vacant on the initial
effective date of this section, a surface parking lot shall be permitted,
in accordance with all applicable
City regulations.
(f) Existing Surface Lots. Within
the
designated
districts,
surface
parking lots legally established or
approved prior to the initial effective date of this section shall be considered legal nonconforming uses
and may be maintained, repaired
and improved in accordance with
otherwise applicable City regulations. No such lot shall be expanded without approval of the City
Planning Commission, in accordance
with the provisions of this section.
(g) Variances for Establishment
of Parking Lots. In the case of a
request for a variance to permit
establishment of a surface parking
lot which is prohibited by regulations of this section, the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall grant such
variance only if it determines that
denial of the variance would deprive
the owner of all reasonable economic use of the subject property.
In making this determination, the
Board may seek the advice of
experts in relevant fields and shall
consider the potential for long-term
as well as short term economic gain.
(h) Variances for Temporary Lots.
In the case of a request for a variance to extend the use of a parking
lot approved under division (e) (1)
of this section, the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall grant such extension
only if it determines that redevelopment of the subject property has
been
delayed
by
circumstances
which are beyond the control of the
owner and which would be present
regardless of the particular ownership of the property. In such cases,
the Board shall not grant an extension for a period greater than one
(1) year in duration. The property
owner may return to the Board for
consideration of further extensions
if said circumstances persist

Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 443.261 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as enacted by Ordinance No. 1145-97, passed July 16,
1997, is hereby amended to read as
follows:
Section 443.261 Drivers’ Expenses
Capped; Reporting
a) Finding. This Council finds
that the wages earned by drivers of
public hacks are inadequate to
insure a sufficient number of taxicabs and capable drivers, and that
the public convenience and necessity require the imposition of a cap
on the expenses paid by drivers of
public hacks.
(b) Definitions. As used in this
section: “Drivers’ expenses” means
all costs, expenses and fees paid by
drivers to a company, association or
independent
operator
currently
charged or hereafter established for
the lease of a public hack, it
includes, by way of example and not
by way of limitation, the costs of
the lease itself, insurance, surcharges, and fuel.
“Base rates” means the drivers’
expenses charge by a company,
association or independent operator
to its drivers on the date of introduction of the ordinance that originally enacted this section.
(c) Drivers’ Expenses Capped. For
the period commencing on the effective date of this ordinance and ending on February 28, 1998, a company, association or independent operator shall not increase its drivers’
expenses over the “base rates” as
defined in division (b) of this section. For the period of March 1, 1998
through December 31, 1998, a company, association or independent
operator shall not increase its drivers’ expenses by more than five per
cent (5%) over the “base rates” as
defined in division (b) of this section. For the period of January 1,
1998 through December 31, 1999 a
company, association or independent
operator shall not increase its drivers’ expenses by more than additional five per cent (5%) over the
“base rates”. Thereafter, a company,
association or independent operator
shall not increase drivers’ expenses
by more than an additional ten per
cent (10%) over the “base rates”.
In the case of fuel only, changes
in the market price of the commodity may be passed along to drivers,
and any such increase shall not be
counted toward the caps imposed by
this division. Overhead costs associated with the sale of fuel by a company, association or independent
operator are subject to the caps
imposed by this division.
(d) Reporting. Within ten (10)
days after the effective date of this
section, each company, association or
independent operator shall submit a
schedule of its base rates as defined
in division (b) of this section.
On or before December 31 in each
year subsequent to the effective
date of this section, each company,
association or independent operator
shall submit its then current schedule
of
rates,
identifying
any
changes in drivers’ expenses. The
requirements of this paragraph are
satisfied by the company, association or independent operator by a
certification
of
the
percentage
change in drivers’ expenses from
the previous reporting period.
All reports required by this section shall be certified by an affidavit by the owner of the company,
association or independent operator,

repealed.
Section 3. That this ordinance is

all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
