FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS REFERRED
Res. No. 2080-97.
By Councilmen Smith and Dolan.
An emergency resolution urging
the Federal Aviation Authority to
increase the number of air traffic
controllers for the control tower at
Cleveland
Hopkins
Airport
to
appropriate staffing levels to monitor and direct both incoming and
outgoing flights in order to prevent
runway incursions from occurring
and to take all action necessary to
protect the traveling public from
those hazards caused by runway
incursions.
Whereas, there have been several
occurrences of runway incursions at
Cleveland
Hopkins
International
Airport over the past several weeks
that could create a potential threat
to the safety of airline pilots and
passengers; and
Whereas, there have been concerns raised by both pilots and air
traffic controllers about the physical
layout of the airport runways that
often creates difficulty for airline
pilots who try to successfully access
onto the right runway for land and
takeoff; and
Whereas, there have been concerns raised by the National Air
Traffic
Controllers
Association
about an insufficient number of air
traffic controllers that are presently
monitoring
and
directing
both
incoming and outgoing air traffic at
Cleveland
Hopkins
International
Airport; and
Whereas, the National Air Traffic
Controllers Association believes that
an insufficient number of air traffic
controllers at Cleveland Hopkins
International Airport does not provide for proper adequate coverage
in monitoring and directing aircraft
access to taxi runways for both
landing and takeoff thus creating
the potential occurrence of runway
incursions; and
Whereas, the Federal Aviation
Authority according to the National
Air Traffic Controllers Association

does not allow for the use of overtime by air traffic controllers to provide proper appropriate coverage
when there are staffing shortages in
the controller tower, thus increasing
the possibility for the occurrence of
a runway incursion.
Now therefore, be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the administrative
officials of the Federal Aviation
Authority consider increasing the
number of air traffic controllers for
the control tower at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport in order
to provide sufficient coverage for
incoming and outgoing flights to
prevent runway incursions from
occurring.
Section 2. That the administrative
officials of the Federal Aviation
Authority during the interim allow
the use of overtime for the air traffic controllers in order to provide
sufficient coverage for both incoming and outgoing flights in order to
drastically reduce the incident of
airport runway incursions.
Section 3. That the administrative
officers at the Federal Aviation
Authority
immediately
take
all
actions necessary to protect the
traveling public from the hazards
caused by runway incursions at
Cleveland
Hopkins
International
Airport.
Section 4. That additional supervisory staff be added to the air traffic control tower at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport in order
to provide additional coverage to air
traffic control.
Section 5. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby be directed to
transmit two certified copies of this
resolution to the Director of the Federal Aviation Authority and Regional Administrator of the Great Lakes
Region Federal Aviation Authority.
Section 6. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Referred to Directors of Port Control, Law; Committees on Aviation
and Transportation.

An emergency resolution urging

1916

November 19, 1997
Whereas, Ohio’s affirmative action
laws and policies provide a level
playing field to women and minorities in the areas of fair housing, fair
employment, fair contracting and
fair education in the State of Ohio;
and
Whereas, any actions by Governor
Voinovich and the Ohio legislature
to restrict and/or eliminate the
affirmative action laws and policies
of this state must be immediately
stopped; and
Whereas, Ohio’s affirmative action
laws and policies deal with the
issue of fairness to women and
minorities
by
providing
these
groups access in the areas of housing, employment, contracting and
education in this state; and
Whereas, to portray Ohio’s laws
and policies on affirmative action as
anything else but of providing fair
access in the areas of housing,
employment, contracting and education is to totally mischaracterize the
issues and does not deal with these
issues honestly;
Now, therefore, be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
Governor Voinovich to intervene and

An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Board of Pharmacy and the
Ohio legislature to reclassify the
controlled substance Rohypnol, also
known as the date rape drug, to a
Schedule 1 ~depressant which will
allow for stricter enforcement and
penalties.
Whereas,
Rohypnol
(flunitrazepam) is a prescription sleeping aid
that is currently classified as a
Schedule IV drug under Chapter 3719
of the Ohio Revised Code; and
Whereas, there have been increasing reports of Rohypnol being illegally diverted into the United States
and illicitly sold. It is reported that
Rohypnol is being put in women’s
drinks and then a rape occurs without
the
woman
remembering

November 19, 1997
because of the amnesia effect the
drug has on the person taking it;
and
Whereas,
the majority of
the
reports of diversion and illicit use
have been in southern Florida and
Texas; and
Whereas, the Florida legislature
have taken appropriate steps to
reclassify Rohypnol as a Schedule 1
depressant and the federal government, through the Food and Drug
Administration, is also considering
reclassifying the drug as a Schedule
1 drug under the Federal Controlled
Substance Act;
Now, therefore, be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio Board of Pharmacy and the
Ohio legislature to evaluate the
reclassification of the controlled
substance Rohypnol, also known as
the date rape drug, to a Schedule 1
depressant from its current classification as a Schedule IV depressant,
especially in light of the reports of
its use in cases of date rape and the
actions to reclassify it by the FDA
and the State of Florida.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council transmit copies of this resolution
to the Ohio Board of Pharmacy and
the Cuyahoga County delegation of
the Ohio State legislature.
