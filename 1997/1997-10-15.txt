An emergency resolution calling
on Auditor of State James Petro to
perform
an
Independent
Special
Audit on improper transfers of City
funds.
Whereas, approximately $617,000.00
of City of Cleveland taxpayers funds
were improperly given to Black on
Black Crime, Inc. and the City has
not fully recovered all of said taxpayers funds; and
Whereas, on at least two separate
occasions, City of Cleveland taxpayer funds totaling $66,000.00 were
improperly transferred to Ohio City
Near West Development Corporation; and
Whereas, approximately $35,000.00
of additional City of Cleveland taxpayer funds were improperly transferred to Detroit-Shoreway Corp.;
and
Whereas, approximately $14,500.00
of additional taxpayer funds were
improperly transferred to UnionMiles Development Corporation; and
Whereas, it has not been fully
determined whether or not these
amounts represent the only taxpayer funds that have been improperly
transferred by the Department of

the health, safety, and welfare of
their citizens, pay when due principal and interest on their debt obligations, meet financial obligations to
their employees, vendors, and suppliers and provide for proper financial accounting procedures, budgeting, and taxing practice. The failure
of a municipal corporation to so act

hereby
determined

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 1873-97.
By Councilman Lewis.
An emergency resolution urging
the Secretary of HUD to delay the
implementation
of
the
housing
policy that will eliminate Section 8
benefits to landlords owning building that provide housing for Section
8 recipients until replacement housing units can be found.
Whereas, the Department of Housing and Urban Development is in
the process of initiating a policy
that will eliminate Section 8 benefits to landlords owning buildings
that provide housing to Section 8

20
recipients and providing such with
a certificate voucher to seek housing on their own, and;
Whereas, the Hough neighborhood
contains a large number of buildings where landlords receive benefits for providing housing for Section 8 recipients and such policy
will result in many of these buildings to become vacant adversely
affecting the Ward 7 Hough community and;
Whereas, Section 8 recipients will
be forced to find landlords willing
to accept certificate vouchers in
order to find suitable housing, and;
Whereas, this policy by HUD will
create a housing hardship on welfare recipients since many landlords
will refuse to accept certificate
vouchers because of their concerns
over delay of payment thus worsening the housing plight for the disadvantaged and
Whereas, there have been no
efforts made in addressing the problems that Section 8 recipients will
encounter in tying to find suitable
available housing in the City of
Cleveland by the Department of
Housing and Urban Development,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Secretary of HUD to delay the
implementation of this policy until
replacement housing units and facilities can be found for Section 8
recipients who will be displaced
under this program.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby be directed to
transmit a certified copy of this resolution to the Secretary of the
Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted October 6, 1997.
Effective October 14, 1997
Res. No. 1876-97.
By Councilman Skrha.
An emergency resolution withdrawing objection to the issuance of
a D5B Liquor Permit to Gateway
City Center, and repealing Res. No.
1350-97 objecting to said issuance.
Whereas, this Council objected to
the issuance of a D5B Liquor Permit to Gateway City Center Inc., by
Res. No. 1350-97, adopted July 16,
1997; and
Whereas, this Council wishes to
withdraw its objection to the above
issuance
and
consents
to
said
issuance; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal depart:ment; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That objection to the
issuance of a D5B Liquor Permit to
Gateway City Center, be and the
same is hereby repealed and that
this Council consents to the immediate issuance thereof.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of

The City Record
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted October 6, 1997.
Effective October 14, 1997
Res. No. 1877-97.
By Councilman Westbrook.
An emergency resolution objecting to the transfer of ownership of
a D5 Liquor Permit to 9720-24 Lorain
Ave. 1st Fl. & Bsmt.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Director of Liquor Control of an application for the transfer of ownership of a D5 and Liquor
Permit from Permit No. 85627780005,
Steve Gombas Corp., 9720-24 Lorain
Ave. 1st Fl. & Bsmt., Cleveland, Ohio
44102, to Permit No. 6418022, 9722
Lorain Ave. Inc., 9720-24 Lorain Ave.
1st Fl. & Bsmt., Cleveland, Ohio
44102; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement officers or agents of the Department of
Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, safety
and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of
notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby record its objection to the transfer of ownership of a D5 Liquor Permit from Permit No. 85627780005,
Steve Gombas Corp., 9720-24 Lorain
Ave. 1st Fl. & Bsmt., Cleveland, Ohio
44102, to Permit No. 6418022, 9722
Lorain Ave. Inc., 9720-24 Lorain Ave.
1st Fl. & Bsmt., Cleveland, Ohio
44102, and requests the Director of
Liquor Control to set a hearing for
said application in accordance with
provisions of Section 4303.26 of the
Revised Code of Ohio.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby is directed to
transmit two certified copies of this
resolution, together with two copies
of a letter of objection and two
copies of a letter requesting that the
hearing be held in Cleveland, Cuyahoga County.
