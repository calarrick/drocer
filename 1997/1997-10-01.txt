ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
____________
Res. No. 278-97.
By Councilman Zone.
An emergency resolution urging
adoption of a policy against purchasing, leasing, renting, or taking
on consignment goods for use and
for resale by City-owned enterprises
that are produced under sweatshop
conditions.

Whereas, goods and products are
being produced under sweatshop
conditions both in the United States
and abroad; and
Whereas, other cities have adopted policies of not purchasing, leasing, renting or taking on consignment and for use or for resale at
City-owned enterprises which were
produced under sweatshop
conditions; and
Whereas, it is the desire of this
Council to support fair humane
labor practices around the world by
not transacting or trading in goods
or products produced under sweatshop conditions; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that this Council is
greatly
concerned
and
strongly
deplores worker exploitation which
is contrary to fair humane labor
practices; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Administration to establish a
policy of not purchasing, leasing,
renting or taking on consignment
goods for use or for resale at Cityowned enterprises which were produced and said policy should incorporate the following points:
A. The factory does not employ
anybody younger than the legal age
for children to work in the country
in which the factory is located, and
regardless of the legal age, does not
employ anybody younger than age
15.
B. The factory does not use forced
labor of any kind - prison labor,
indentured labor or bonded labor.
C. The factory pays a wage which
enables its employees to meet their
basic needs for food, shelter, clothing and medical care and to set
aside money for future purchases.
The factory also provides all benefits required by law in their country and compensates workers for
overtime.
D. Employees are not required to
work more than 48 hours per week
or less if the law of the country in
which the factory is located sets a
shorter work week.
E. The factory is a workplace free
from physical, sexual or verbal
harassment. Employees have the
right to speak up about conditions
in the factory without fear of retaliation and have the right to form
unions of their own choosing without employer intimidation.
F. The factory provides a safe and
healthy working environment.
Section 2. That this Council further urges the Administration to
prohibit, to the extent possible, the
purchase, lease, rental or taking on
consignment of goods for use or for
resale at City-owned enterprises
which were produced under sweatshop conditions.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted September 22, 1997.
Awaiting the approval or disapproval of the Mayor.

October 1, 1997
Res. No. 1795-97.
By Councilmen Westbrook Coats,
Polensek, Moran, Zone, Smith, Willis, Rybka, Sweeney, Patmon, Robinson, Lewis, Dolan, Melena, Gordon,
White, Skrha, Jackson, Britt and
Patton.
An emergency resolution urging
the voters of the City of Cleveland
to Vote NO on State Issue 2 in order
to repeal Senate Bill 45, the so-called
Workers Compensation Reform Bill.
Whereas, Senate Bill 45 (“S.B.
45”), the so-called Worker’s Compensation Reform Bill, was signed
by Governor Voinovich in the spring
of 1997; and
Whereas, although the American
Medical Association calls the use of
the AMA’s permanent impairment
guidelines for workers’ compensation disability assessment purposes
unfair, arbitrary and unreasonable,
S.B. 45 mandates the use of these
guidelines
in
permanent
partial
impairment hearings; and
Whereas, S.B. 45 will substantially diminish the rights of Cleveland
citizens who are injured while working to receive Workers’ Compensation benefits in several ways, including (1) by preventing consideration
of education or past work experience in determination of permanent
and total disability benefits; (2) by
making it almost impossible to
receive Workers’ Compensation benefits for occupational cancers and
other occupational diseases; and (3)
by making injury, disease and accident inspection records maintained
by the Ohio Division of Safety and
Hygiene secret; and
Whereas, S.B. 45 will effectively
deny coverage for those who suffer
from carpal tunnel injuries and
other
repetitive
motion
injuries,
thereby
discriminating
against
women who incur these injuries in
disproportionately
high
numbers
because of the work that they do;
and
Whereas,
the
drastic
cuts
in
Workers’ Compensation benefits and
coverage incorporated in S.B. 45 will
adversely affect the lives of the
working people of Cleveland and
their families; and
Whereas, on July 21, 1997, a coalition of public interest, labor, and
injured worker organizations submitted 415,000 signatures on petitions to the Ohio Secretary of State,
forcing a referendum of S.B. 45; and
Whereas, this November 4th will
be the first time since 1939 that the
citizens of Ohio will be able to go
to the polls and VOTE NO on a piece
of anti-injured workers legislation;
Now, therefore, be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland has determined
that Senate Bill 45 will negatively
impact those citizens who have suffered injuries and diseases as a consequence of their employment, and
strongly urge the citizens of Cleveland to VOTE NO on Issue 2 on
November 4, 1997.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Whereas, this Council objected to
the transfer of ownership of a D5

by Res. No. 1678-97, adopted September 8, 1997; and

the City of Cleveland:

transfer of ownership of a D5 Liquor
Permit to 1276-80 W. 6th St., be and
the same is hereby withdrawn and

W, by Res. No. 1677-97, adopted September 8, 1997; and

The City Record
Res. No. 1799-97.
By Councilmen Westbrook and
Dolan.
An emergency resolution urging
the U. S. Department of Transportation to seriously examine the safety
issues involved in the proposed
acquisition and distribution of the
assets of Conrail among Norfolk
Southern and CSX Transportation.
Whereas, Norfolk Southern (“NS”)
and CSX Transportation (“CSX”)
have proposed the acquisition and
distribution of the assets of Consolidated Rail Corp. (“Conrail”); and
Whereas,
the
federal
Surface
Transportation Board (“STB”) is the
body studying the proposed acquisition and distribution and is the federal body authorized to act upon the
said proposal; and
Whereas, although the proposed
acquisition and distribution may
offer the potential for economic
development and redevelopment in
this area due to improved freight
movement and intermodal connections, this Council is concerned that
the proposed acquisition will have
negative impacts on our community
due to increased and re-routed traffic throughout the region from 14
trains to 31 to 38 each day; and
Whereas, the negative impacts
include
safety
issues
such
as
increase in injuries to citizens, especially children due to the increase
in train traffic, increase in delays in
emergency
equipment
response,
environmental issues related to air
and noise pollution and the shipment of hazardous cargo; and
Whereas, due to the approximate
threefold increase in freight train
traffic, the fair market values of the
areas residential and non-residential
properties will most likely experience significant decreases in value;
and
Whereas, the STB must review the
proposed plan to determine the existence of alternative routing plans
that will reduce the potential adverse impacts to the citizens of the
City of Cleveland and the City itself,
and on the Greater Cleveland area;
Now, therefore, be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland officially notifies
the Surface Transportation Board of
its concerns that as proposed, the
acquisition and distribution of Conrail’s assets by NS and CSXT will
have a significant adverse impact
on the citizens of the City of Cleveland.
Section 2. That the City of Cleveland coordinate with other interested parties such as the cities of Bay
Village, Lakewood, Rocky River,
Westlake, Avon Lake, Berea, the
Greater Cleveland Growth Association, the Northeast Ohio Areawide
Coordinating Agency, the Greater
Cleveland Regional Transit Authority, and the Ohio Rail Development
Commission, as well as state and
federal legislators such as Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council transmit copies of this resolution
to the Surface Transportation Board
and representatives of NS and CSXT
and other interested parties.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Res. No. 1800-97.
By Councilman Westbrook.
An emergency resolution urging
the Statewide Transportation Coordination Task Force to support a
process which awards funding for
transportation services based on the
size of the relative caseload of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families in each county.
Whereas, the Ohio General Assembly passed welfare reform legislation (Sub. H.B. 408), which was subsequently
signed
by
Governor
Voinovich on July 2, 1997; and
Whereas, under the state’s welfare reform legislation the responsibility for the administration of welfare benefits lies with the county
commissioners, and each board of
county commissioners must develop
a written transportation work plan,
and set policies regarding the transportation needs of low income residents seeking or striving to retain
employment; and
Whereas, approved amendments to
H.B. 408 require the Ohio Department of Human Services to allocate
to counties statewide, up to $5 million in fiscal years 1998 and 1999 to
provide appropriate transportation
services TANF participants; and
Whereas, the Statewide Transportation Coordination Task Force
has been charged with reviewing
current
state
transportation
resources and policies, supporting
new transportation initiatives for
under-employed
and
unemployed
Ohioans; and
Whereas, the Statewide Transportation Coordination Task Force
is developing recommendations and
guidelines for the county-level State
transportation plan and distribution
formula for the $5 million allocation
for transportation services for workrequired TANF participants; and
Whereas, approximately one-fifth
all Ohioans receiving Temporary
Assistance
to
Needy
Families
(TANF) reside in the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
and Cuyahoga County have taken a
leadership role in developing a community-based plan to provide local
transportation for TANF recipients;
and
Whereas, the most appropriate
process for distributing the funds
would be one based on the statewide
distribution of the TANF caseload,
and readiness of the locality to proceed with implementing a viable
plan; and
Now, therefore, be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Cleveland City
Council urges the Statewide Transportation Coordination Task Force
to support a process which awards
funding for transportation services
based on the size of the relative
TANF caseload in each county, local
initiative in designing welfare to
work transportation programs and
readiness to implement a plan which
addresses specific local needs and
circumstances.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council transmit a copy of this resolution
to appropriate federal, state and
local agencies and officials.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

allowed by law.
