Whereas,
any
non-residential
development occurring on the subject property must be sited and
designed in a manner which is not

necessary to ensure proper development of the site; now therefore

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS REFERRED
Res. No. 825-97.
By Councilman Lewis.
An emergency resolution urging
Governor Voinovich, the State Auditor, the Board of County Commissioners and the County Auditor to
audit the tax payments of gas and
oil well operators and collect delinquent taxes for the benefit of the
Cleveland public schools.
Whereas, Ohio law classifies oil
and natural gas as real property
subject to real property taxes; and
Whereas, state law requires Ohio
counties to compile a list annually
of oil and gas wells throughout the
state; and
Whereas, the only oil and gas
wells in county records are those
reported by the operators of the
wells; and
Whereas, a similar honor system
is used to assess the proper taxes to
be paid since the data used to compile the taxes is supplied by the suppliers and not audited by the county or state; and
Whereas, it is estimated that only
a fraction of the returns are being
filed by the well operators and only
a fraction of the tax due is being
paid; and
Whereas, there is little initiative
for counties to trace delinquent producers since about 80% of the
money collected would go to public
schools, not the county; and
Whereas, strict enforcement of the
tax laws with respect to oil and gas
wells in Cuyahoga County could be
a badly needed source of revenue
for the Cleveland school system; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that all potential
sources of revenue to benefit the
Cleveland public schools must be
explored; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
Governor Voinovich, the State Auditor, the Board of County Commissioners and the County Auditor to
audit the tax payments of gas and
oil well operators and collect delinquent taxes for the benefit of public school systems, including the
Cleveland public schools.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Governor
Voinovich, the State Auditor, the
Board of County Commissioners and
the County Auditor.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it

shall take effect and be in force

Referred to Director of Law; Committee on Finance.
Res. No. 826-97.
By Councilmen Lewis and White.
An emergency resolution urging
the Cleveland Board of Education,
the Superintendent of the Cleveland
public school system and to reopen
Aviation High School and Mayor
White to work with the Tuskegee
Airmen to utilize the school solely
for aviation training and support
services.
Whereas, Benjamin Davis High
School, also known as Aviation
High School, has not been utilized
by the Cleveland public school system during the 1996-97 school year
due to the school system’s continuing financial crises; and
Whereas,
the
99th
Fighter
Squadron,
today
known
as
the
Tuskegee Airmen, fought with distinction
during
World
War
II
throughout the Mediterranean and
European theaters; and
Whereas, the successors of these
distinguished pilots can provide the
support and resources necessary to
restore Aviation High School as a
source
of
aviation
training
for
Cleveland school children; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or welfare in that a restored Aviation High School can be a source of
valuable training and future jobs
for Cleveland's youth; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Cleveland Board of Education,
the Superintendent of the Cleveland
public school system and Mayor
White to reopen Aviation High
School
and
to
work
with
the
Tuskegee Airmen to utilize the
school solely for aviation training
and support services.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to the members of the Cleveland Board of Education and the Superintendent of the
Cleveland public schools.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
