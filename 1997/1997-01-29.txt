Res. No. 138-97.
By Councilmen Westbrook, Patton
and Rybka.
An emergency resolution to support the work of the Ohio Farmland
Preservation Task Force and submit
recommendations
in
conjunction
with the First Ring Consortium.
Whereas,
Governor
George
V.
Voinovich has established the Ohio
Farmland Preservation Task Force
for the purposes of studying the loss
of farmland and making recommendations on methods for preserving
land for agricultural production; and
Whereas, the policies, programs
and practices of the State of Ohio
have encouraged development of
farmland at the outer edges of the
Greater Cleveland region over redevelopment and maintenance of built
communities such as Cleveland and
its First Suburbs; and
Whereas, these policies and practices have undermined the economic
strength and attractiveness of Cleveland and its First Suburbs, and put
them at a competitive disadvantage
to newer and developing communities; and
Whereas, conditions have been
created that entice and push citizens
and employers to locate in newer
and developing communities; and
Whereas, growth in public funds
required to service sprawling exurban development coupled with erosion of economic strength in Cleveland and its First Suburbs jeopardizes economic performance of the
Greater Cleveland region; and
Whereas, preservation of farmland at the outer edges of the metropolitan region depends on the creation of more opportunities for citizens and employers to remain or
locate in Cleveland and its First
Suburbs.
Now, therefore be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland hereby requests
that the Ohio Farmland Preservation Task Force include the following in its recommendations to the
Governor:
(a) The State of Ohio policies, programs and activities should be modified so as to favor redevelopment
and maintenance of built communities over development of new communities; and
(b) The State of Ohio should set
objectives for Ohio metropolitan
regions concerning preservation of
farmland and open spaces, and redevelopment and maintenance of built
communities; and
(c) The State of Ohio should
require that the counties that comprise each metropolitan region jointly and cooperatively devise a plan
for meeting the State’s objectives
and establish mechanisms for implementing such plan.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council shall transmit copies of this resolution
to
Governor
George
V.
Voinovich,
the
Ohio
Farmland
Preservation Task Force and the
First Ring Consortium.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
