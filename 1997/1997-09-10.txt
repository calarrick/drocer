FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 1673-97.
By Councilman White.
An emergency resolution urging
the Director of Public Safety and
the Chief of Police to make policy
changes for high-speed police pursuits in the City of Cleveland to
apprehend criminal suspects without
endangering the general public.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
Division of Police has policy protocol Number 10-95 to deal with the
persons suspected of committing a
felony and who attempt to flee
apprehension in a moving vehicle;
and
Whereas, the act of high speed
police pursuit often involves vehicles exceeding the speed limit,
which excess can pose a threat to
the safety of the general public; and
Whereas, Council has researched
high speed police pursuit protocols
in police divisions in other major
municipalities throughout the United
States; and
Whereas, Council based upon its’
research recommends that the following changes to policy protocol
10-95 be implemented by the Director of Public Safety and the Chief
of the Division of Police to ensure
the safety of the general public; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland.
Section 1. That the following policy protocol regarding high speed
police pursuits be implemented by
the Division of Police, Department
of Public Safety of the City of Cleveland:
1. Jurisdiction
That the policy and procedures of
the Division of Police relating to
high speed pursuit in order to apprehend a criminal suspect is under the
control of the Director of Public
Safety and Chief of Police for the
City of Cleveland.
2. Initiation of Police Pursuit
That the decision to initiate a pursuit must be based on the pursuing
officer’s conclusion that the immediate danger to the public created
by the pursuit is less than the immediate or potential danger to the public should the suspect remain at
large. Any law enforcement officer
in an authorized emergency vehicle
may initiate a vehicular pursuit
when all of the following criteria
are met:
(a) The suspect exhibits the intention to avoid arrest by using a
motorized vehicle to flee apprehension for an alleged felony or misdemeanor where a full custody arrest
is authorized.
(b) The suspect operating the
vehicle refuses to stop at the direction of the officer; and
(c) The suspect, if allowed to flee,
would present a danger to human
life or cause serious injury to the
general public.
That the pursuing officer shall
consider
factors
in
determining
whether to initiate a pursuit such as
weather, time of day, amount of
traffic, road conditions and the
capability of the pursuit vehicle,
population density, geographic location, proximity to school areas during school hours and familiarity of
the area.

20
3. Discontinuance of a Vehicle Pursuit
A vehicle pursuit shall be discontinued when the following circumstances occur:
(a) Loss of communication with
the CCS or sector supervisor.
(b) If there is sufficient information to identify and file on the fleeing suspect, and termination of the
pursuit will not result in the lost of
vital evidence.
(c) The distance between the pursuing vehicle and the vehicle being
pursued becomes so great that further pursuit is futile.
(d) If the driver shows a complete
disregard for his/her life or the
lives of others as evidenced by
activity such as not attempting to
slow for red lights or stop signs, driving left of center into oncoming
traffic, or excessive speed relative
to road/traffic conditions, etc.
4. Responsibilities of the Pursuing
Officer
(a) It shall be the responsibility
of the pursuing officer to immediately notify the Communications
Control Section that a pursuit is
underway.
The

officer
shall provide reasoning for the pursuit, direction of travel, description
of the vehicle and license plate number, number of occupants and speeds
involved.
(b) The pursuing officer shall
abandon the pursuit when the danger to life and/or property outweighs the need for immediate
apprehension. The pursuing officer
shall also abandon the pursuit if it
should persist for more than 60 seconds unless directed by that officer’s supervisor.
(c) It shall be the responsibility
of the pursuing officer to use emergency lights and sirens at all times
during the duration of the pursuit.
The pursuing officer shall terminate
the pursuit if radio contact is lost
with the Communications Section
and/or other units involved in the
pursuit
are
lost,
except
where
extraordinary circumstances exist.
The
pursuing
officer
shall
not
engage in, or continue, vehicular
pursuits in areas where the officer
is unfamiliar, exceptions will be permitted only in the most grievous of
circumstances.
(d) The pursuing officer shall not
make any attempt to overtake or
pass the pursued vehicle. At no time
shall the pursuing officer exceed the
maximum speed limit by no more
than 20 mph as long as life or property is not endangered or the following circumstances; areas with
increase traffic and pedestrian density; in a school zone during school
hours.
(e) There shall be no paralleling
of the pursuit route, unless the pursuit
passes
through
a
unit’s
assigned patrol area. Any police
unit that is paralleling shall not
join or interfere with the pursuit
and shall not violate traffic laws to
keep pace with the pursuit.
(f) Stationary roadblocks and the
ramming of vehicles are prohibited
except
in
critical
circumstances
such as preventing injury to pedestrians.
5. Motorcycles and Unmarked Units
That unmarked police vehicles
and motorcycle units may pursue
vehicles as a primary unit only until
the arrival of a marked unit. An
unmarked
police
vehicle
and/or
motorcycle
unit
shall
terminate
involvement when a marked police

The City Record
vehicle with a lightbar becomes
available to take over the pursuit.
Any unmarked police vehicle or
motorcycle unit shall adhere to the
vehicle pursuit policy when involved
in a high speed pursuit. At no time
shall an unmarked unit initiate or
become involved in a pursuit unless
equipped with emergency red or
blue lights and siren.
6. Administrative Responsibilities
Upon notification that a vehicular
pursuit incident is in progress, the
sector
supervisor
shall
assume
responsibility for monitoring control
and termination of the pursuit as it
progresses. The supervisor must
grant permission for the pursuit to
continue or it shall be terminated. It
shall be the responsibility of the
supervisor to control and direct the
pursuit by directing specific units
into and out of the pursuit; redesignating primary support or other
back
up
unit
responsibilities;
approving or ordering alternative
tactics; or terminating the pursuit in
accordance to departmental policy.
7. Jurisdictional Responsibilities
between Cities regarding High Speed
Pursuit.
(a) In the event that a pursuit
from another community enters into
the City of Cleveland, the supervisor will monitor the pursuit and
determine if Cleveland cars are to
be permitted to join the pursuit once
notified by Police Communications.
(b) Should a pursuit enter into
another community, the Cleveland
supervisor shall remain in charge
unless control is requested by another agency, it shall be the responsibility of the supervisor to instruct
the Communications Control Section
to notify the other agency of the
pursuit and any request for assistance.
