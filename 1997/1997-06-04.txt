FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES REFERRED
Ord. No. 988-97.
By Mayor White and Councilmen
Robinson, Patton, White, Patmon,
and Willis.
An emergency ordinance to enact
Sections 680A.01, 680A.02 and 680A.99
of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, relating to restricting the placement or display of outdoor advertisements for cigarettes,
and providing a penalty.
Whereas, Section 2927.02 of the Ohio
Revised Code makes it unlawful for
any person engaged in the manufacturing, production, distribution,
wholesaling, or retailing of cigarettes
or other tobacco products to give, sell,
or otherwise distribute cigarettes or
other tobacco products to any person
under eighteen years of age; and
Whereas, a survey conducted by
the Center for Disease Control during the spring of 1995 reported that
34.8 percent of teenagers under the
age of eighteen reported smoking,
and 16 percent of teenagers under
the age of eighteen said they
smoked 20 or more cigarettes during
the month preceding the survey; and
Whereas, according to the Food
and Drug Administration, tobacco
addiction is a major pediatric disease, with one million children taking up smoking each year; and
Whereas, according to the American Lung Association, each day,
3,000 children smoke their first cigarette; and

Whereas, more than 3.1 million
minors under the age of eighteen
consume more than 947 million
packs of cigarettes annually in the
United States, yielding gross sales
to the tobacco industry each year of
approximately $1 billion; and
Whereas, cigarettes are among
the most heavily marketed product
in America, and the tobacco industry spends approximately $4 billion
a year to promote and advertise
their products, with $421 million
going annually for outdoor advertising of cigarettes; and
Whereas, outdoor advertisements
are a unique and distinguishable
medium of advertising which subjects the general public to involuntary and unavoidable forms of solicitation, as the courts have found:
“Advertisements of this sort are
constantly
before
the
eyes
of
observers on the streets . . . to be
seen without the exercise of choice
or volition on their part. Other forms
of advertising are ordinarily seen as
a matter of choice on the part of the
observer. The young people as well
as the adults have the message of
the billboard thrust upon them by all
the arts and devices that skill can
produce. In the case of newspapers
and magazines, there must be some
seeking by the one who is to see and
read the advertisement. The radio
can be turned off; but not so the billboard . . . . These distinctions clearly place this kind of advertisement
in a position to be classified so that
regulations or prohibitions may be
imposed upon all within the class.
This is impossible with respect to
newspapers and magazines.”; and
Whereas, the Supreme Court and
other courts have recognized the
positive relationship between advertising and consumption as regards a
variety of goods and services, such
as electricity, gambling, cigarettes,
and alcohol; and
Whereas, in addition to judicial
recognition of the general link
between advertising and consumption, there is specific and convincing evidence that tobacco advertising plays a significant role in stimulating illegal consumption of cigarettes by minors, including:

the days they smoked. Significantly
more white (24%) than black students (7%) smoked two or more cigarettes per day.
Twelve percent (12%) of Ohio
high school students smoked cigarettes on school property during the
30 days prior to the survey. Significantly more white (13%) than black

June 4, 1997
Whereas, cigarette advertisements
tend to emphasize youthful vigor,
sexual attraction, and independence
themes, which appeal to teenagers
and young adults struggling with
these issues; and
Whereas, tobacco use is associated
with alcohol and illicit drug use, acting as a “gateway drug” by young
people who enter a sequence of drug
use that can include tobacco, alcohol,
marijuana, and harder drugs, and is
associated with a range of healthcompromising behaviors, including
being involved in fights, carrying
weapons, and engaging in high risk
sexual behavior; and
Whereas, research conducted by
Scenic America, a nonprofit conservative organization indicates that
unlike the print media, the billboard
industry exercises no restraints on
ad placement to protect children.
“They simply put billboards anywhere they can including next to
homes,
schools,
churches,
parks,
playgrounds, health centers, sports
stadiums, shopping centers — literally everywhere”; and
Whereas, an ordinance restricting
the placement or display of advertisements for cigarettes in publicly
visible locations within the City of
Cleveland is a reasonable and necessary measure for reducing illegal consumption of cigarettes by minors; and
Whereas,
the
restrictions
contained in the following Ordinance
will not unduly burden legitimate
business

cigarettes on a retail basis; and
Whereas, in order to protect legitimate business activities and to narrowly focus its efforts on those
advertisements which most directly
affect
minors

engage in recreational activities,
the City of Cleveland has determined not to restrict advertisements
of cigarettes in certain designated
business and industrial zones hereinafter identified, with reasonable

to this ordinance, now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

Ord. No. 989-97.
By Mayor White and Councilmen
Robinson, Patton, White, Patmon,
and Willis.
An emergency ordinance to enact
Sections
680B.01,
680B.02
and
680B.99 of the Codified Ordinances
of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, relating to
restricting the placement or display of outdoor advertisements for
alcoholic beverages, and providing
a penalty.
Whereas, Sections 4301.63 through
4301.632 of the Ohio Revised Code
make it unlawful for any person
under the age of 21 years to order,
attempt to purchase, consume, or
possess any beer or intoxicating
liquor in the state of Ohio, and Section 4301.69 of the Ohio Revised
Code prohibits the sale, furnishing,
or purchasing of beer or intoxicating liquor to or on behalf of underage persons by any persons, including liquor permit holders authorized
to sell such products in the State of
Ohio; and
Whereas, the Center for Science in
the Public Interest (CSPI) has
found that “for American teens, alcohol is by far the most widely used
and abused drug. Despite laws prohibiting use and possession of alcohol by minors and sales to underage
persons, over 4 million young Americans experience serious alcoholrelated
problems
before
leaving
high school.”; and
Whereas, a survey conducted in
1993 by the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration
reported that 41.3 percent of minors
between the ages of twelve and seventeen reported alcoholic beverage
consumption, and according to a
1994 CSPI study, 16.3% of minors 1217 years of age, and 61.3% of minors
18-21 years of age reported alcohol
use within the 30 days prior to the
study; and
Whereas, research by the CSPI
reveals further that:
The median age at which children
begin drinking is just over thirteen
years, and that 67% of 8th graders
have tried alcohol.
Children feel intense peer pressure to drink alcohol. In a 1990 survey, 35% of 4th graders and 49%
of sixth graders said they felt
pressured by their classmates to
drink.
Junior and senior high school students drink 35% of all wine coolers
sold in the United States and 1.1 billion cans of beer each year.
Underage drinkers find alcohol
easy to obtain. In one study conducted in Washington D.C., 19 and
20-year-old youths purchased a sixpack of beer in 97 out of 100
attempts.
Alcohol use has been involved in
as many as 50% - 65% of all suicides among youths.
Alcohol-related traffic crashes are
the number one killer of 16-to-24year-olds.

6
High school students who drink
are four times more likely to have
had sexual intercourse and twice as
likely to have had four or more sex
partners, behaviors which increase
the risk for HIV infection; and
Whereas, alcoholic beverages are
among the most heavily marketed
product in America, and in 1991 the
alcoholic beverage industry spent
approximately $1 billion to promote
and advertise its products, with
more than $81.5 million targeted
specifically for outdoor advertising
of its products; and
Whereas, outdoor advertisements
are a unique and distinguishable
medium of advertising which subjects the general public to involuntary and unavoidable forms of solicitation, as the courts have found:
“Advertisements of this sort are
constantly
before
the
eyes
of
observers on the streets . . . to be
seen without the exercise of choice
or volition on their part. Other forms
of advertising are ordinarily seen as
a matter of choice on the part of the
observer. The young people as well
as the adults have the message of
the billboard thrust upon them by
all the arts and devices that skill
can produce. In the case of newspapers and magazines, there must
be some seeking by the one who is
to see and read the advertisement.
The radio can be turned off; but not
so the billboard . . . These distinctions clearly place this kind of
advertisement in a position to be
classified so that regulations or prohibitions may be imposed upon all
within the class. This is impossible
with respect to newspapers and
magazines.”; and
Whereas, the Supreme Court and
other courts have recognized the
positive relationship between advertising and consumption as regards a
variety of goods and services, such
as electricity, gambling, cigarettes,
and alcohol; and
Whereas, in addition to judicial
recognition of the general link
between advertising and consumption, a report by a Maryland Drug
and Alcohol Abuse Commission on
“The Impact of Alcohol Advertising
and the Use of Alcohol in Television
Programs and Films on Underage
Drinking” (January 1993) concluded:
Research consistently showed that
children’s
attitudes
favorable
to
alcohol are significantly related to
their exposure to alcohol advertisements.
Specific alcoholic beverage advertising practices such as use of cartoon characters and animals (e.g.,
“Spuds McKenzie”) that are especially appealing to children and
youth, using rock stars and athletes
as spokespersons, and associating
drinking with sports and other
activities that have a great appeal
to youth such as race car driving,
rock climbing, water sports, etc.,
greatly contribute to attitudes favorable to alcohol among youth.
Children are exposed to billboards
advertising alcohol on a regular
basis simply by walking to school
or playing in their neighborhood,
and there is no practical means of
parental monitoring or limiting of
exposure to these public advertisements.
The “overwhelming majority” of
research studies showed a definite
correlation between alcohol advertising and underage drinking.
Glamorous
“lifestyle”
alcoholic
beverage advertisements have a
“profound influence” on young people’s attitudes about alcohol; and

The City Record
Whereas,
research
shows
that
when children’s exposure to alcohol
advertising increases, they:
Perceive drinking as more attractive, acceptable, and rewarding;
View drinkers more positively
(i.e., more friendly, relaxed, fun-loving, happy, sophisticated, etc.);
Are more likely to see beer drinking as “cool” and “macho”;
Are more likely to believe that
drinking is a way to relax and deal
with stress;
Are more likely to agree that it is
okay for teenagers to drink;
Are more likely to name alcohol
than water as an appropriate beverage for adults; and
Have increased expectations to
drink in the future; and
Whereas, a variety of studies indicate that alcohol is involved in at
least one-half of all the major causes of death among youth: motor
vehicle crashes, suicides, homicides,
drowning, and other accidents. Alcohol-related accidents are now the
leading cause of death among young
people; and
Whereas, The 1993 Ohio Youth
Risk Behavior Survey conducted by
the Ohio Department of Education,
Student Development Division, found
that:
Alcohol is a major contributing
factor in approximately half of all
homicides, suicides, and motor vehicle crashes, which are leading causes of death and disability among
young people.
Heavy drinking among youth has
been linked conclusively to physical
fights, destroyed property, academic
and job problems, and trouble with
law enforcement authorities.
Overall, 34% of Ohio high school
students had their first drink of
alcohol or other than a few sips
prior to age 13. Forty-four percent
(44%) of ninth graders, 35% of tenth
graders, 31% of eleventh graders,
and 24% of twelfth graders reported
that they drank before age 13.
Eighty percent (80%) of Ohio
high school students had at least
one drink of alcohol during their
life.
During the 30 days prior to the
survey, 46% of Ohio high school students reported that they’d had at
least one drink of alcohol.
During the 30 days preceding the
survey, 30% of Ohio high school students had five or more drinks of
alcohol in a row. Twenty-six percent
(26%) of ninth and tenth graders,
33% of eleventh graders, and 37% of
twelfth graders drank five or more
drinks in a row.
Five percent (5%) of Ohio’s high
school students had at least one
drink of alcohol on school property
during the 30 days preceding the
survey; and
Whereas, according to 1992 reports
by then U.S. Surgeon General, Dr.
Antonia Novello (“Youth and Alcohol: Dangerous and Deadly Consequences”) and then U.S. Inspector
General, Richard Kusserow (“Youth
and Alcohol: Drinking and Crime”):
About one-third of all juvenile
males arrested said they had used
alcohol in the previous 72 hours.
Nearly 40% of youths in adult correctional facilities reported drinking
before committing the crime.
Eighteen percent (18%) of high
school females and 39% of high
school males say that “it’s okay to
force sex if the girl is drunk.”
A “striking association” exists
between alcohol use and using
firearms to commit suicide by 10-to19-year-olds.

830

June 4, 1997
Forty percent (40%) to 50% of
young males who drowned had consumed alcohol prior to drowning.
Forty percent (40%) to 50% of
youths injured diving had consumed
alcohol prior to diving.
Among high school seniors, twice
as many frequent binge drinkers
skipped school (55% versus 25%),
and nearly five times as many
seniors who binged frequently damaged school property (36% versus
8%); and
Whereas,
alcoholic
beverage
advertisements tend to emphasize
youthful vigor, sexual attraction,
and independence themes, which
appeal to teenagers and young
adults struggling with these issues;
and
Whereas, alcohol use is associated with tobacco and illicit drug use,
acting as a “gateway drug” by
young people who enter a sequence
of
drug
use
that
can
include
tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and
harder drugs, and is associated with
a
range
of
health-compromising
behaviors, including being involved
in fights, carrying weapons, and
engaging in high risk sexual behavior; and
Whereas, research conducted by
Scenic America, a nonprofit conservative organization indicates that
unlike the print media, the billboard

ad placement to protect children.
“They simply put billboards anywhere they can including next to

Whereas, an ordinance restricting
the placement or display of advertisements for alcoholic beverages in
publicly visible locations within the
City of Cleveland is a reasonable
and necessary measure for reducing
illegal consumption of alcoholic beverages by minors and for promoting
the welfare and temperance of
minors exposed to such advertisements; and
Whereas, the restrictions contained

By Councilmen Jackson, Westbrook, Britt, Coats, Dolan, Gordon,
Lewis,
Johnson,
Moran,
Patmon,
Polensek, Robinson, Skrha, Smith,
Sweeney, Zone, Patton, Rybka, Melena and White.
An
emergency
resolution
to
demand a moratorium on the new
HUDpolicy because it is government sponsored gentrification, and
it is disruptive and unjust to lowincome people, neighborhoods and
the City of Cleveland, and that the
City needs time to develop a coordinated process to handle the displacement and relocation issues.
Whereas, there are 22,327 public
housing and Section 8 units in Cuyahoga County, the vast majority of
which are in the City of Cleveland;
and
Whereas, there are 11,605 “projectbased” subsidies in the City of
Cleveland; and
Whereas, the federal government
through the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) has changed its policy on
housing the poor; and
Whereas, as a part of the new
HUD policy there will be a reduction of the availability of public
housing units for poor people; and
Whereas, as a part of the new
HUD policy HUD is not renewing
“project-based”
housing
contracts;
and
Whereas,
those
“project-based”
housing contracts that are being
renewed will be only for one year,
and
Whereas, many of the properties
have been in disrepair and substandard condition for many years with
the full knowledge of HUD; and
Whereas, HUD continued to fund
these properties until now; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
held
two
public
hearings
and
received testimony from local HUD,
Cuyahoga
Metropolitan
Housing
Authority (CMHA), housing advocacy groups, and low-income people
affected by the new HUD policy; and
Whereas, the testimony from the
low-income people demonstrated a
high level of fear, confusion, mistrust, along with a keen sense of
unjust treatment; and

36
Whereas, the general public and
city government is not fully aware
of the implication of the new HUD
policy; and
Whereas, the immediate result of
the new HUD policy in Cleveland is
the displacement of hundreds of
families through Section 8 vouchers
that will be renewed only for one
year; and
Whereas, under the new HUD policy there will be thousands more
Cleveland families displaced and
given Section 8 vouchers; and
Whereas, HUD has criticized the
inability of CMHA to process its current volume of Section 8 vouchers;
and
Whereas, there is a need to develop the capacity and coordinated
efforts to address the displacement
and relocation of thousands of lowincome people; and
Whereas, the new HUDpolicy will
result in economic gentrification of
inner city neighborhoods,
Therefore be it resolved that this
council demands;
Section 1. A moratorium on the
new HUD policy because it is government sponsored gentrification of
low-income people, and the new HUD
policy is disruptive and unjust to
low-income people, neighborhoods,
and the City of Cleveland; and
Section 2. The City of Cleveland
be given time to develop a coordinated process for handling the displacement and relocation issues.
Section 3. That a copy of this resolution be forwarded to the President
of the United States, the President of

Res. No. 977-97.
By Councilmen Westbrook and
Patton.
An emergency resolution regarding
principles for the restructuring of
the electric utility industry in Ohio.
Whereas, the federal government
and the State of Ohio are considering proposals to restructure the electric utility industry which could
affect the cost of electricity and the
manner in which utilities provide
service; and
Whereas, the purported purpose of
competition is to reduce the cost
electricity and ensure choice of electricity providers; and
Whereas, affordably priced electricity, offered under reasonable
terms, is essential to the health,
safety and economic well being of
all Ohioans; and
Whereas, electric utility deregulation could lead to higher electric
bills,
increased
pollution
and
reduced, degraded or unreliable electric service from coal-fired and
nuclear power plants; and

June 4, 1997
Whereas, electric utility deregulation could eliminate the guarantee
that all customers receive service
(universal service); and
Whereas, public service objectives
like shut-off protection, bill assistance and payment options, and
energy
efficiency
programs
for
fixed and low income customers
could be eliminated; and
Whereas, electric utility deregulation could result in the elimination
of utility company jobs that would
negatively impact the economy in
Northeast Ohio; and
Whereas, electric utility deregulation could be a disincentive to
increased utilization of energy efficiency practices and the use of
renewable energy resources; and
Whereas,
Northeast
Ohio
customers have already borne the burden of uneconomic electric utility
investments; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That restructuring must
not go forward unless electric utility bills decrease for all Northeast
Ohio customers, and all Northeast
Ohio customers, especially schools,
local governments, and fixed and
low income, residential and small
business customers, share in the
benefits of a restructured electric
utility industry.
Section 2. That consumer and environmental protection must be the
top priorities in any legislation or
policy that introduces competition to
electric utilities in Ohio.
Section
3. That
electric utility
restructuring in Ohio must result in a
real, open and competitive market
that brings lower bills to all Northeast
Ohio customers and provides retraining, placement and support programs
for displaced utility workers.
Section 4. That electric utility
restructuring in Ohio must bring
cleaner power to all customers and
provide specific mechanisms to protect and improve the environment,
including incentives for increased
development and use of energy efficiency practices, and gas-fired and
renewable energy technologies.
Section 5. That electric utility
restructuring in Ohio must not
penalize consumers by bailing out
utilities for uneconomical investment (stranded costs).
Section 6. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby is directed to
transmit certified copies of this resolution to Governor George Voinovich, 77 S. High Street, Columbus,
OH43215; Sen. Bruce Johnson and
Sen. Priscilla Mead (Co-Chairs of the
House-Senate Select Committee on
Electric Utility Deregulation), Statehouse, Columbus, OH 43215; the President of the Ohio Senate, the Speaker of the Ohio House; the U.S. Senators from Ohio, the U.S. Congressperson of this District; the local
Ohio State Senator and Representative; and the Citizen’s Utility Restructuring
Committee

Section 7. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it received

it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it

this Series 1997 Bond Legislation as
to whether any Series 1997 Bonds of
any series are to be secured by or
payable from a municipal bond
insurance policy, bank letter or line
of credit, or other form of credit or
liquidity facility.
The Series 1997 Certificate of
Award may also specify that the
Series 1997 Bonds may be issued in
one or more separate series, each
bearing a distinctive designation,
provided that the Series 1997 Bonds
of all such series satisfy the requirements of the Indenture and of this
Series 1997 Bond Legislation as
though all such Bonds were of the
same, single series. Separate series
of Series 1997 Bonds may be issued
at the same or different times, and
if separate series of Series 1997
Bonds are issued at different times,
a separate Series 1997 Certificate of
Award may be executed for each
series. If the Series 1997 Bonds
include both Series 1997 Project
Bonds and Series 1997 Refunding
Bonds but are not identified as such
through different series designations, then the limitations set forth
in (a) above shall be applied to the
Series 1997 Bonds allocated between
those purposes.
In the event that the Fiscal Officer determines, based on the advice
of the Issuer’s Financial Advisor,
that the Issuer’s best interests will
be served by causing all or a portion of the Series 1997 Bonds to be
Series 1997 Variable Rate Bonds,
then the Fiscal Officer is authorized
to cause such Series 1997 Bonds to
be Series 1997 Variable Rate Bonds
by so specifying in the Series 1997
Certificate of Award. If the Fiscal
Officer so determines, then, in accordance with Section 3.02(c) of the
First Supplemental Indenture, the
Third Supplemental Indenture shall

875

51
specify the method and procedure by
which the rate of interest to be
borne by the Series 1997 Variable
Rate Bonds shall be determined, provided that the Series 1997 Variable
Rate Bonds shall not bear interest
at a rate in excess of twelve percent
(12%). That maximum interest rate
shall not apply to Series 1997 Variable Rate Bonds during any period
those Bonds are held by the Credit
Provider as pledged bonds because
they could not be remarketed. The
Third Supplemental Indenture may
also provide for the right of the
holders of Series 1997 Variable Rate
Bonds to tender their Series 1997
Variable Rate Bonds for purchase
by the Issuer at the times, on the
terms, and subject to the conditions
set forth therein, provided that such
tender rights shall be exercisable
only at such times as a credit or liquidity facility is in place that provides for the payment of the purchase price payable to the tendering
holder of a Series 1997 Variable
Rate Bond. If the Fiscal Officer designates any Series 1997 Bonds as
Series 1997 Variable Rate Bonds,
then the Fiscal Officer shall also
designate
in
the
Certificate
of
Award the Credit Provider or Credit Providers for any credit or liquidity facility or facilities to apply
to the Series 1997 Variable Rate
Bonds, and the remarketing agent
or agents for tendered Series 1997
Variable Rate Bonds (if the holders
of the Series 1997 Variable Rate
Bonds are to be entitled to tender
the Series 1997 Variable Rate Bonds
for purchase), which designations
shall be based on the advice of the
Issuer’s Financial Advisor that the
parties so designated possess the
requisite resources and experience
to provide the services required of
them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed
to provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable.
It is hereby determined that the
Purchase Price, the Specified Interest Rates, and the other terms and
details of the Series 1997 Bonds as
so specified and determined in the
Series 1997 Certificate of Award
within the limitations set forth in
this Series 1997 Bond Legislation
will be in the best interest of the
Issuer and consistent with all legal
requirements.
Section 4. Application of Proceeds
of Series 1997 Bonds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Series 1997 Bonds shall be deposited
as follows:
(i) to the Bond Service Fund, that
portion, if any, of such proceeds constituting the Capitalized Interest
Payment;
(ii) to the Bond Service Reserve
Fund, that portion of such proceeds
required to be deposited in the Bond
Service Reserve Fund in order to
cause the balance therein to equal
the Required Bond Service Reserve,
subject to the provisions set forth
below for a lesser or alternative
deposit;
(iii) to the Renewal and Replacement Fund, the portion of such proceeds representing the Renewal and
Replacement Payment attributable
to the Series 1997 Bonds;
(iv) if Series 1997 Bonds are
issued for the purpose of refunding
outstanding Revenue Bonds, then to
a separate account established in
the Bond Service Fund for that purpose pursuant to Part First of Section 5.03 of the Original Indenture,
the
portion
of
such
proceeds
required to be deposited in that

52
account to cause the refunded Revenue Bonds to be deemed paid and
discharged
for
purposes
of
the
Indenture; and
(v) to the Construction Fund, the
balance of such proceeds.
Pursuant to Section 3.02(h) of the
First Supplemental Indenture, the
Third Supplemental Indenture may
provide that no deposit to the Bond
Service Reserve Fund shall be made
for or with respect to the Series 1997
Bonds of any series, in which case:
(i) the holders of Series 1997 Bonds
of that series shall have no right or
entitlement to have any portion of
the Bond service charges on Series
1997 Bonds of that series be paid
from amounts in the Bond Service
Reserve Fund, (ii) the lien of and
pledge on the Bond Service Reserve
Fund shall not extend to or be for
the benefit of the holders of Series
1997 Bonds of that series, and (iii)
the Bond service charges on Series
1997 Bonds of that series shall not be
taken into account in determining
the Required Bond Service Reserve.
The Third Supplemental Indenture
alternatively may provide for the creation of a special reserve fund solely for Series 1997 Bonds of any series,
separate
from the
Bond Service
Reserve Fund, and for the deposit
therein of such amount as may be
specified in the Third Supplemental
Indenture as the required reserve for
Series 1997 Bonds of that series or
may require the Issuer to provide a
municipal bond insurance policy, a
bank letter or line of credit, or any
other form of credit or liquidity facility to enhance the security for Series
1997 Bonds of that series in lieu of a
funded reserve fund. If the Third
Supplemental Indenture provides for
a special reserve fund and requires
that deposits be made thereto from
Airport Revenues at any time, then
such deposits may be made only from
moneys remaining in the Operating
and Maintenance Fund on the last
day of a month before any deposit is
made to the General Obligation Debt
Service Fund (or the Subordinated
Debt Service Fund, if it shall have
been established) or into any other
Special Fund into which such moneys
may be deposited after any required
deposits to the General Obligation
Debt Service Fund. If the Third Supplemental Indenture provides for no
reserve fund or for a special reserve
fund, then the Third Supplemental
Indenture shall also provide that the
amount of any defaulted principal of
or interest on the Series 1997 Bonds
of the applicable series that would
have been timely paid had the
Required Bond Service Reserve for
such Series 1997 Bonds of that series
been fully funded in the Bond Service
Reserve Fund shall be paid only from
moneys remaining in the Operating
and Maintenance Fund on the last
day of a month before any deposit is
made to the General Obligation Debt
Service Fund (or the Subordinated
Debt Service Reserve Fund, if it shall
have been established) or to any
other Special Funds into which such
moneys may be deposited after any
required deposits to the General
Obligation Debt Service Fund. The
Fiscal Officer is authorized to determine, based on the advice of the
Issuer’s Financial Advisor, which of
the options permitted under this Section 4 for funding the Bond Service
Reserve Fund or for alternatives to
doing so best serves the Issuer’s
interests, and shall specify that
option in the Series 1997 Certificate
of Award.
Section 5. Terms and Provisions

The City Record
Applicable to the Series 1997 Bonds.
(a) Form; exchange and transfer.
Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the Original Indenture,
(i) all Series 1997 Bonds shall initially be issued in fully registered
form, and (ii) no Series 1997 Bond
shall be exchanged for or transferable into a coupon Revenue Bond or
Bonds unless and until the Indenture shall have been amended in
accordance with the terms thereof to
permit such exchanges or transfers.
To the extent that the Original
Indenture (particularly, but without
limitation, Section 2.05 thereof) permits fully registered Revenue Bonds
to be exchanged for or transferred
into coupon Revenue Bonds or Revenue Bonds payable to bearer, then
the Original Indenture is hereby
amended to prohibit such exchanges
or transfers for the Series 1997
Bonds unless and until the Indenture shall have been amended in
accordance with the terms thereof to
permit such exchanges or transfers.
The Series 1997 Bonds shall be
issued to a Depository for use in a
book entry system and, if and as
long as a book entry system is utilized: (i) the Series 1997 Bonds shall
be issued in the form of a single
registered Series 1997 Bond representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the beneficial
owners in book entry form shall
have no right to receive Series 1997
Bonds in the form of physical securities or certificates; (iii) ownership
of beneficial interests in book entry
form shall be shown by book entry
on the system maintained and operated by the Depository and its participants, and transfers of the ownership of beneficial interests shall
be made only by book entry by the
Depository and its participants; and
(iv) the Bonds as such shall not be
transferable
or
exchangeable,
except
for
transfer
to
another
Depository or to another nominee of
a Depository, without further action
by the Issuer.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Series 1997 Bonds for use in
a book entry system, the Fiscal Officer and Trustee may attempt to
establish
a
securities
depository/book entry relationship
with another qualified Depository. If
the Fiscal Officer and Trustee do
not or are unable to do so, the Director of Finance and Trustee, after
making provision for notification of
the beneficial owners by the then
Depository and any other arrangements deemed necessary, shall permit withdrawal of the Series 1997
Bonds from the Depository, and
authenticate and deliver registered
Series 1997 Bond certificates to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of Issuer
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Executive Officer, the Fiscal
Officer, the Director of Port Control
or any one of them are authorized
and directed to the extent necessary
or required to enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with the book entry system
for the Series 1997 Bonds, after
determining (as evidenced by their
signing) that the signing thereof
will not endanger the funds or securities of the Issuer under the Indenture.

876

(b) Denominations and Dates. The
Series 1997 Bonds shall each be in
the denomination of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof and shall
be dated as of the date or dates
specified in or pursuant to the
Series 1997 Certificate of Award;
provided, however, that so long as a
book entry system is to be used for
the Series 1997 Bonds, then the
Series 1997 Bonds shall be issued in
the form of a single Series 1997
Bond for each maturity. Each Series
1997 Bond shall have only one principal maturity date, except for interim certificates or receipts issued
pending preparation of definitive
Series 1997 Bonds.
(c) Interest and Place of Payment. The Series 1997 Bonds shall
bear interest at their respective
Specified Interest Rates from the
most recent date to which interest
has been paid or duly provided for
or, if no interest has been paid or
duly provided for, from their date.
The principal and Redemption Price,
if any, of and the interest payable
on each Series 1997 Bond shall be
payable at the times, to the persons
and in the manner set forth in the
Indenture, including, without limitation, provisions thereof permitting
special arrangements for payment to
the Depository.

after the earliest Optional Redemption Date in whole on any date or
in part on any Interest Payment
Date at the Redemption Price specified in the Series 1997 Certificate of
Award and in accordance with the
Indenture; provided, however, that
the Series 1997 Certificate of Award
may specify that all or a portion of
the Series 1997 Bonds will not be
subject to redemption at the option
of the Issuer. The Series 1997 Term
Bonds shall also be subject to
mandatory
redemption
prior
to
maturity at the Redemption Price on
each Mandatory Redemption Date in
the aggregate amount of the mandatory sinking fund requirement to be
paid on such Mandatory Redemption
date, all as specified in the Series
1997 Certificate of Award and in
accordance with the Indenture.
(f) Execution. The Series 1997
Bonds shall be executed by the
Executive Officer and the Fiscal
Officer, and approved as to form by
the Legal Officer, provided that any
or all of such signatures may be facsimiles, and shall bear the corporate
seal of the Issuer or a facsimile
thereof.
(g) Numbering. The Series 1997
Bonds to be authenticated by the
Trustee shall be numbered and otherwise identified as specified by the
Fiscal Officer in accordance with
the Indenture.
Section 6. Refunding of Outstanding Revenue Bonds.
If Series 1997 Bonds are issued for
the purpose of refunding any outstanding Revenue Bonds, then the
Executive Officer, the Fiscal Officer
and the Director of Port Control or
any two of them are authorized and
directed to sign and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of the Issuer,

June 4, 1997
an escrow agreement between the
Issuer and the Trustee, as escrow
trustee, providing for the investment
and holding in escrow of the proceeds of the Series 1997 Refunding
Bonds to be applied to the refunding of such Revenue Bonds and for
the
application
of
the
moneys
derived from those investments to
the payment of the Bond Service
Charges on such Revenue Bonds.
The Fiscal Officer shall provide for
the payment of the services rendered and for reimbursement of
expenses incurred pursuant to the
escrow agreement from proceeds of
the Series 1997 Refunding Bonds to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose. Provision shall be
made in the escrow agreement to
give the Trustee any written notice
of redemption required under Section 3.02 of the Original Indenture.
The Executive Officer, the Fiscal
Officer, the Director of Port Control
and other appropriate Issuer officials shall execute all documents
and take all other actions necessary
or appropriate on the part of the
Issuer to effect such refunding in
accordance with the Original Indenture and to cause the refunded Revenue Bonds to be deemed paid and
discharged.
Section 7. Tax Covenants.
Certain of the Series 1997 Bonds
are to be issued and sold as obligations bearing interest to be excluded from gross income for federal
income tax purposes (the “TaxExempt
Bonds”).
The
Issuer
covenants that it will use, and will
restrict the use and investment of,
the proceeds of the Tax-Exempt
Bonds in such manner and to such
extent as may be necessary so that
(a) the interest on the Tax-Exempt
Bonds will be excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, and (b) in the case of any
Tax-Exempt Bonds qualifying as
bonds, the interest on which is not
treated as an item of tax preference
under Section 57 of the Code (“NonAMT Bonds”), such Tax-Exempt
Bonds will be treated as Non-AMT
Bonds.
The Issuer further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the TaxExempt Bonds to be and to remain
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will
not take or authorize to be taken
any actions that would adversely
affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or
persons acting for it, will, among
other acts of compliance, (i) apply
the proceeds of the Tax-Exempt
Bonds to the governmental purposes
of the borrowing, (ii) restrict the
yield on investment property, (iii)
make timely and adequate payments
to the federal government, (iv)
maintain books and records and
make calculations and reports, and
(v) refrain from certain uses of
those proceeds and, as applicable, of
property financed with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the
extent necessary to assure such
exclusion of that interest under the
Code.
The Fiscal Officer, or any other
officer of the Issuer having responsibility for issuance of the TaxExempt Bonds, is hereby authorized
(a) to make or effect any election,
selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or waiver on behalf
of the Issuer with respect to the
Tax-Exempt Bonds as the Issuer is

The City Record
permitted or required to make or
give under the federal income tax
laws, including, without limitation
thereto, any of the elections provided for in Section 148(f)(4)(C) of the
Code or available under Section 148
of the Code, for the purpose of
assuring, enhancing or protecting
favorable tax treatment or status of
the Tax-Exempt Bonds or interest
thereon
or
assisting
compliance
with requirements for that purpose,
reducing the burden or expense of
such
compliance,
reducing
the
rebate amount or payments of penalties, or making payments of special
amounts in lieu of making computations to determine, or paying,
excess earnings as rebate, or obviating those amounts or payments, as
determined by that officer, which
action shall be in writing and
signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf
of the Issuer, as may be appropriate
to assure the exclusion of interest
from gross income and the intended
tax status of the Tax-Exempt Bonds,
and (c) to give one or more appropriate certificates of the Issuer, for
inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Tax-Exempt Bonds,
setting forth the reasonable expectations of the Issuer regarding the
amount and use of all the proceeds
of the Tax-Exempt Bonds, the facts,
circumstances
and
estimates
on
which they are based, and other
facts and circumstances relevant to
the tax treatment of the interest on
and the tax status of the TaxExempt Bonds.
Each covenant made in this Section with respect to the Tax-Exempt
Bonds is also made with respect to
all issues any portion of the debt
service on which is paid from proceeds of the Tax-Exempt Bonds
(and, if different, the original issue
and any refunding issues in a series
of refundings), to the extent such
compliance is necessary to assure
exclusion of interest on the TaxExempt Bonds from gross income
for federal income tax purposes, and
the officers identified above are
authorized to take actions with
respect to those issues as they are
authorized in this Section to take
with respect to the Tax-Exempt
Bonds.
Section
8.
Third
Supplemental
Indenture and Other Documents;
Amendments to Use Agreements.
The Executive Officer, the Fiscal
Officer and the Director of Port Control, or any two of them, are hereby authorized and directed, in the
name and on behalf of the Issuer, to
make, execute, acknowledge, and
deliver to the Trustee, a Third Supplemental Indenture, approved as to
form and correctness by the Legal
Officer, substantially in the form on
file with the Clerk in connection
with this Series 1997 Bond Legislation in File No. 923-97-A. The form
of the Third Supplemental Indenture
is approved with such changes
therein as are not inconsistent with
this Series 1997 Bond Legislation
and not adverse to the Issuer and
which are permitted by the Constitution and laws of Ohio and as shall
be approved by the officers signing
the Third Supplemental Indenture.
The approval of those changes, and
the determination that such changes
are not adverse to the Issuer, shall
be conclusively evidenced by the
signing of the Third Supplemental
Indenture by those officials. The

877

53
Third Supplemental Indenture may
also
include
such
additional
covenants of the Issuer as the Executive Officer, the Fiscal Officer and
the Director of Port Control, or any
two of them signing the Third Supplemental Indenture, deem necessary or appropriate to obtain favorable ratings on or credit enhancement for the Series 1997 Bonds or to
enhance their marketability.
To the extent permitted by the
Indenture, the Issuer is authorized,
from time to time, to enter into one
or more agreements in connection
with or subsequent to the issuance
of the Series 1997 Bonds, for an
interest rate swap, an interest rate
cap, or any other such arrangement
to lower the effective interest rate
on the Series 1997 Bonds or to hedge
the exposure of the Issuer against
fluctuations in prevailing interest
rates (a “Rate Exchange Agreement”), and to secure its obligations
to the counterparties in any such
Rate Exchange Agreements on a
parity with its obligations to holders of Revenue Bonds under the
Indenture, subject to such conditions
and restrictions as may be specified
therein. The Fiscal Officer is authorized, on behalf of the Issuer, to execute and deliver one or more Rate
Exchange Agreements that meet the
requirements of the Indenture and
that he determines, based upon the
advice of the Issuer’s Financial
Advisor, will reduce the net Bond
service charges payable on the
Series 1997 Bonds or otherwise
enhance the timing and amount of
the
payments
thereof
for
the
Issuer’s purposes to an extent that
justifies the cost of the Issuer’s
entering into such Agreements.
The Executive Officer, the Fiscal
Officer, the Director of Port Control,
the Legal Officer, the Clerk and
such other officers of the Issuer as
may be appropriate are authorized
and directed to furnish, execute and
deliver such documents, certifications and instruments as may be
necessary or appropriate to issue
the Series 1997 Bonds and to consummate the transactions contemplated in the Indenture, any Rate
Exchange Agreement, and the Bond
Purchase Agreement described in
Section 9. The Clerk or other appropriate official of the Issuer shall
furnish
the
Original
Purchasers
identified in Section 9 a true transcript of proceedings certified by
the Clerk or other official, of all proceedings had with reference to the
issuance of the Series 1997 Bonds
along with such information for the
records as is necessary to determine
the regularity and validity of the
issuance of the Series 1997 Bonds.
In the event that the Issuer’s
entering into any agreements with
respect to the Series 1997 Bonds or
any
Rate
Exchange
Agreement
requires any amendments to the
Original Indenture as amended and
supplemented by the First and Second Supplemental Indentures that
require the consent of holders of the
requisite percentage of outstanding
Revenue Bonds in order for such
amendments to become effective, in
accordance with Section 13.02 of the
Original Indenture, then, subject to
obtaining such consent of those
holders,
the
Third
Supplemental
Indenture may include such amendments to the Original Indenture as
theretofore amended for the purpose
of causing the Indenture to permit
the Issuer, from time to time, to
enter into such agreements. If any
such amendments are required, the

54
Fiscal Officer is authorized to seek
such consent from the holders of the
Revenue Bonds to be outstanding
upon the issuance of the Series 1997
Bonds, including the Original Purchasers.
This Series 1997 Bond Legislation
shall constitute a part of the Third
Supplemental Indenture as therein
provided and for all purposes thereof, including, without limitation, the
application to this Series 1997 Bond
Legislation of the provisions of the
Indenture relating to amendment,
modification, supplementation and
severability.
The Director of Port Control of
the Issuer is hereby authorized and
directed to execute and deliver to
the Airlines such amendments to the
existing lease and use agreements
as are necessary and appropriate to
cause those agreements to reflect
the issuance of the Series 1997
Bonds and the execution and delivery
of
the
Third
Supplemental
Indenture and to be consistent with
the Third Supplemental Indenture.
Section 9. Designation of Original
Purchasers; Bond Purchase Agreement; Official Statement; Continuing
Disclosure.
The Series 1997 Bonds are hereby
awarded to the following underwriters: Smith Barney Inc., A.G.
Edwards & Sons, Inc., Lehman
Brothers, Merrill, Lynch & Co., J.P.
Morgan Securities Inc., and SBKBrooks Investment Corp. (collectively, the “Original Purchasers”);
provided, however, that if, in the
reasonable opinion of the Fiscal
Officer, an underwriter is incapable
of fully performing its duties or
meeting its obligations in its capacity as an Original Purchaser with
respect to the Series 1997 Bonds, the
Fiscal Officer is hereby authorized
and directed, in the name of and on
behalf of the Issuer, to take whatever actions may be necessary to
terminate that underwriter’s standing as Original Purchaser. The Fiscal Officer is further hereby authorized and directed, in the name and
on behalf of the Issuer, to execute
and deliver the Bond Purchase
Agreement, approved as to form
and correctness by the Legal Officer, which shall incorporate the
terms of the Series 1997 Bonds as
determined pursuant to this Series
1997
Bond
Legislation
and the
Series 1997 Certificate of Award
and shall set forth the date, location, procedure and conditions for
the delivery of the Series 1997
Bonds, including without limitation
any
conditions
relating
to the
obtaining of an insurance policy,
bank letter or line of credit, or
other form of credit or liquidity
facility to enhance the security or
marketability of the Series 1997
Bonds, the obtaining of which credit or liquidity facility the Fiscal
Officer determines serves the best
interest of the Issuer by achieving
a net reduction in the Bond service
charges on the Series 1997 Bonds.
The
Bond
Purchase
Agreement
shall be substantially in the form
now on file with the Clerk in File
No. 923-97-A with such changes
therein or thereto not inconsistent
with the Indenture, this Series 1997
Bond Legislation or the Series 1997
Certificate of Award and not substantially adverse to the Issuer as
may be approved by the Fiscal Officer. The approval of any such
changes by the Fiscal Officer and
the determination by the Fiscal
Officer that no such change is substantially adverse to the Issuer

The City Record
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the execution of the Bond Purchase
Agreement by the Fiscal Officer.
The Executive Officer, the Fiscal
Officer, the Director of Port Control,
the Legal Officer and other Issuer
officials as appropriate are directed
to make the necessary arrangements
on behalf of the Issuer to establish
the date, location, procedure and
conditions for the delivery of the
Series 1997 Bonds to the Original
Purchaser and to take all actions
necessary to effect due signing,
authentication and delivery of the
Series 1997 Bonds under the terms
of the Series 1997 Bond Legislation,
the Third Supplemental Indenture,
the Bond Purchase Agreement and
the Indenture.
The Executive Officer, the Fiscal
Officer and other Issuer officials as
deemed appropriate, each are authorized and directed, on behalf of the
Issuer and in their official capacities, to (i) prepare or cause to be
prepared, and make or authorize
modifications,
completions
or
changes of or supplements to, a disclosure document in the form of a
preliminary official statement relating to the issuance of the Series
1997 Bonds, and (ii) determine, and
certify or otherwise represent, when
the preliminary official statement as
so prepared is a “deemed final” official statement (except for permitted
omissions) by the Issuer as of its
date for purposes of SEC Rule 15c212(b)(1). The distribution and use
of such a preliminary official statement
is
hereby
authorized
and
approved.
Those officers and each of them
are also authorized and directed, on
behalf of the Issuer and in their
official capacities, to complete that
preliminary official statement with
such modifications, changes and
supplements as those officers shall
approve or authorize for the purpose
of preparing and determining, and
to certify or otherwise represent,
that the official statement as so
revised is a final official statement
for purposes of SEC Rule 15c2-12(b)
(3) and (4). Those officers each are
further authorized to use and distribute, or authorize the use and distribution of, the final official statement and supplements thereto in
connection
with
the
original
issuance of the Series 1997 Bonds as
may, in their judgment, be necessary or appropriate. Those officers
each are further authorized to sign
and deliver, on behalf of the Issuer
and in their official capacities, the
final official statement and such
certificates in connection with the
accuracy of the preliminary official
statement and the final official
statement
and
any
amendment
thereto as may, in their judgment,
also be necessary or appropriate.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Series 1997 Bonds, the Issuer
agrees, in accordance with, and as
an obligated person with respect to
the Series 1997 Bonds under, SEC
Rule 15c2-12, to provide or cause to
be provided such financial information and operating data and notices,
in such manner, as may be required
for purposes of SEC Rule 15c2-12. In
order to describe and specify certain
terms of the Issuer’s continuing disclosure agreement for that purpose,
and
thereby
to
implement
that
agreement, including provisions for
