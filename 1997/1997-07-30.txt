The City Record
Section 3. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
hereby supplemented by enacting
new Section 443.261 thereof, to read
as follows:
Section 443.261 Drivers’ Expenses
Capped; Reporting.
(a) Finding. This Council finds
that the wages earned by drivers of
public hacks are inadequate to insure
a sufficient number of taxicabs and
capable drivers, and that the public
convenience and necessity require
the imposition of a cap on the expenses paid by drivers of public hacks.
(b) Definitions. As used in this section: “Drivers’ expenses” means all
costs, expenses and fees paid by drivers to a company, association or
independent
operator
currently
charged or hereafter established for
the lease of a public hack, and
includes, by way of example and not
by way of limitation, the costs of the
lease itself, insurance and fuel. “Base
rates” means the drivers’ expenses
charged by a company, association or
independent operator to its drivers
on the date of introduction of the
ordinance enacting this section.
(c) Drivers’ Expenses Capped. For
the period commencing on the effective date of this ordinance and ending on December 31, 1997, a company, association or independent operator shall not increase its drivers’
expenses over the “base rates” as
defined in division (b) of this section.
For the two-year period commencing
on January 1, 1998, a company, association or independent operator shall
not increase its drivers expenses over
the “base rates” as defined in division
(b) of this section. For the two-year
period commencing on January 1,
1998, a company.”
In the case of fuel only, changes
in the market price of the commodity may be passed along to drivers,
and any such increase shall not be
counted toward the percentage caps
imposed by this division. Overhead
costs associated with the sale of
fuel by a company, association or
independent operator are subject to
the caps imposed by this division.
(d) Reporting. Within ten (10)
days after the effective date of this
section, each company, association or
independent operator shall submit a
schedule of its base rates as defined
in division (b) of this section.
On or before December 31 in each
year subsequent to the effective date
of this section, each company, association or independent operator shall
submit its then current schedule of
rates, identifying any changes in drivers’ expenses. The requirements of
this paragraph are satisfied by the
company, association or independent
operator by a certification of the percentage change in drivers’ expenses
from the previous reporting period.
All reports required by this section
shall be certified by an affidavit of
the owner of the company, association or independent operator, on such
forms as the Commissioner of Assessments and Licenses shall prescribe.
Section 4. Non-severability. This
Council finds that an increase in
meter rates serve the public convenience and necessity only if the
caps on drivers’ expenses identified
in Section 443.261 of the Codified
Ordinances are imposed. Accordingly, the provisions of this ordinance
shall not be severable, and the
invalidation of any portion of this
ordinance shall result in the invalidation of the entire ordinance.
Section 5. That Section 443.26 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, as amended by this ordinance shall take effect July 1, 1997.
