Systems
Inc.
(“AMS”)
has
applied to the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (“NRC”) to amend its
license to allow the “free” release of
ground/surface water that collects

483

in the foundation drainage system
of AMS’s London Road facility in
the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, based on information
Cleveland has received and over
Cleveland’s strong objections, Cleveland believes that the NRC is most
likely to grant AMS’s request to
amend its license, which will permit
the “free” release of ground/surface
water into the combined storm/sanitary sewer without requiring testing be performed prior to any discharge; and
Whereas, Cleveland desires that
testing be required to be performed
prior to discharge into the combined
storm/sanitary sewer to confirm
that levels of Cobalt 60 do not
exceed the levels set forth in the
Settlement Order issued in the federal court case recently settled by
the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer
District and AMS; and
Whereas, it is the desire of this
Council to request United States Senators Glenn and DeWine and Congressman Stokes require a federal
investigation into the NRC’s conduct
with
respect
to
AMS’s
license
request (USNRC License No. 3419089-01) to insure to the citizens of
Cleveland that all steps are being
taken to prevent a health or safety
risk to the community or to the
environment;
Now, therefore, be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
request United States Senators John
Glenn and Mike DeWine and Congressman Stokes take all necessary
steps to require the appropriate federal agency or agencies undertake a
federal
investigation
into
the
Nuclear
Regulatory
Commission’s
conduct
and
proceedings
with
respect to Advanced Medical System’s request to amend its license to
permit
the
“free”
release
of
ground/surface water that collects
in the foundation drainage system
of AMS’s London Road facility located in the City of Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council transmit copies of this resolution,
along with a copy of Cleveland’s
correspondence to Roy J. Caniano,
Deputy Director U. S. Regulatory
Commission Region III, dated April
4, 1997, to United States Senators
John Glenn and Mike DeWine, Congressman Louis Stokes and Deputy
Director Caniano.
Section 3. That this resolution is

485

29
337.10, 343.01, 343.11, 345.01, 345.02
and 345.03, as enacted by various
ordinances, all relating to correctional halfway houses.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
hereby supplemented by enacting
new Sections 325.121 and 347.15
thereof to read, respectively, as follows:
Section 325.121 Correctional Halfway House
“Correctional
halfway
house”
means a premises which provides
room and board and correctional
oversight, pursuant to a contract to
provide those services for the Federal Bureau of Prisons or the Ohio
Department of Rehabilitation and
Corrections or the Cuyahoga County
Court of Common Pleas Department
of Probation or any other governmental entity with jurisdiction to
provide
correctional
services,
to
adults who have been assigned to
such facility by either a governmental authority or a court of law.
Such premises may be one building
or a grouping of buildings located
on contiguous properties.
Section 347.15 Correctional Halfway Houses
Correctional halfway houses, as
defined in Section 325.121, shall be
permitted only in accordance with
the following regulations and other
applicable regulations of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland.
(a) Purpose. The regulations of
this section are intended to provide
suitable locations for residential
institutions which assist in enabling
individuals to live independently,
productively and lawfully as members of the larger community, following a period of incarceration or
following a conviction for criminal
activity. These regulations are also
intended to ensure that such institutions are operated in a manner
which serves the best interests of
their residents, while protecting the
safety of residents living in nearly
neighborhoods.
(b) Certificate of Occupancy. No
correctional halfway house shall be
established
or
expanded
before
issuance by the Commissioner of
Building and Housing of a Certificate of Occupancy. The Commissioner shall issue such Certificate
only after approval by the Board of
Zoning Appeals, as required in division (c) of this section.
(c) Board of Zoning Appeals
Approval. No Certificate of Occupancy for establishment or expansion of a correctional halfway house
shall be issued without approval of
such application by the Board of
Zoning Appeals, after public notice
and a public hearing. In order to
ensure compatibility between a proposed correctional halfway house, or
expansion thereof, and surrounding
properties, the Board may require
modifications to a proposal as a condition of its approval. The Board
shall determine the suitability of a
proposed
correctional
halfway
house, or expansion thereof, at a
particular location, through consideration of, among others, the following factors.
(1) conformance of the proposal to

30
the requirements of this section and
to other applicable regulations of
the City’s Codified Ordinances;
(2) the record of the proposed
operator in managing similar facilities; and
(3) the size of the proposed facility as it affects potential over-concentration of a correctional system
population in the immediate vicinity.
(d) Permitted Locations. Correctional halfway houses shall be
allowed in General Retail Business,
Residence-Industry and Semi-Industry zoning districts, in accordance
with all applicable regulations.
(1) Separation Standards. No correctional halfway house shall be
established on a lot or lots within
five hundred (500) feet of a Residential zoning district nor within
five hundred (500) feet of the lot or
lots occupied by a playground, public park, public recreation center,
church or similar place of worship,
public library, pre-school, day-care
center, kindergarten, special education center, or primary or secondary
school, measured in accordance with
the standards of division (d)(3) of
this section. Specifically, however,
along the rear lot line of a property to be occupied by a correctional
halfway house, this separation standard may be waived by the Board
of Zoning Appeals, if, in the determination of the Board, adequate
fencing, buffer areas and/or other
barriers are in place or will be put
in place to screen and separate the
adjoining properties, and to prevent
access between the properties.
(2) Spacing Standard. No correctional halfway house shall be established on a lot or lots within two
thousand (2,000) feet of a lot or lots
occupied by another such facility
measured in accordance with the
standards of division (d)(3) of this
section. Furthermore, not more than
two (2) correctional halfway houses
shall be located in any Police District.
(3) Measurement Standard. In all
instances
where
this
section
requires separation or spacing by a
specified distance, such distance
shall be measured in a geometrically straight line which represents the
shortest distance between the lot or
lots accommodating the proposed
correctional halfway house and the
lot or lots or zoning district from
which
the
correctional
halfway
house is to be separated. Such measurement shall be made using a
scaled map, or a survey if deemed
necessary, and shall be made without regard to intervening structures,
objects, uses, the street grid, landforms, waterways, or any other topographic feature.
(e) Licensing and Supervision. All
correctional halfway houses operating in the City of Cleveland shall
have all required licenses, including
any required for operation of a correctional
halfway
house.
On-site
supervision by qualified staff shall
be provided for all hours during
which residents are on the premises. Security measures shall be sufficient to protect the safety of residents and other citizens in the vicinity of the facility. No correctional
halfway house may operate with a
total resident population of less
than twenty (20) persons, which
twenty persons may include individuals not subject to correctional
oversight.
(f) Floor Area and Occupancy
Standards. A minimum of two hundred (200) square feet of habitable

The City Record
floor area shall be provided, on average, for each resident of a correctional
halfway
house,
including
staff members normally on the
premises after 11:00 p.m. A maximum of one hundred (100) residents
subject to correctional oversight
shall be accommodated at any correctional halfway house.
(g) Parking. A minimum of one
off-street parking space shall be provided for every three residents of a
correctional halfway house, plus one
space for each staff person on duty
during the largest shift. Such spaces
shall be provided either on or directly adjacent to the property occupied
by the facility.
(h) Excluded Residents. Correctional halfway houses shall not
admit or accommodate residents
who, at the time of their admission
or at any time during their stay,
exhibit a pattern of violent behavior, nor shall correctional halfway
houses admit or accommodate residents who have been convicted of
any of the following crimes: murder,
rape or felony crimes against children.
(i) Revocation of Certificate. The
Commissioner of Building and Housing shall revoke the Certificate of
Occupancy issued to a correctional
halfway house if it is determined
that
the
facility
is
no
longer
licensed as required in this section
or if compliance with City regulations or with requirements of the
Board of Zoning Appeals is not
maintained.
(j) Notification. Upon receipt of
an application for a Building Permit
or Certificate of Occupancy for a
correctional
halfway
house,
the
Division of Building and Housing
shall send a copy to the Councilmember in whose ward the proposed facility would be located and
shall submit a notification of the
receipt of the application, including
the proposed address, to the Council
Clerk for publication in the City
Record.
(1) Annual Registration. Prior to
issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for a correctional halfway
house, the operator shall submit
supervisor and operator information
to the Division of Building and
Housing.
This
information
shall
include the names and phone numbers of all on-site supervisors; the

a change to it, and shall be submitted annually to the Division of
Building and Housing by the first
day of February.

determine compliance with the provisions of this section and other
applicable provisions of these Codified Ordinances.
(k) Special Exception. In the case
of an application to establish or
expand
a
correctional
halfway
house in a manner which does not
meet the requirements of this code,
the Board of Zoning Appeals may
approve such application if it determines that the proposed facility, by
virtue of existing conditions or safeguards specifically required by the
Board, will have no significant
adverse impacts on the surrounding
area and will meet the needs of the
facility’s residents.
