An ordinance to supplement the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, by enacting new Section
604.06 thereof relating to the prohibition of pit bull dogs.
Whereas, it has become necessary
to prohibit the ownership or harboring of “pit bull dogs,” as defined
herein,
due
to
the
particularly
vicious characteristics of the breed
and the continued attacks on human
beings by such dogs in the City of
Cleveland; now therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
hereby supplemented by enacting
new Section 604.06 thereof to read as
follows:
Section 604.06 Prohibition of Pit
Bull Dogs
(a) No person shall own, keep,
exercise control over, maintain, harbor, transport or sell within the
municipal limits of the City of
Cleveland, any pit bull dog.
(b) This section is a necessary
control to eliminate the risk of
attack by pit bulls, as defined herein, on human beings in the City
which has become a threat to the
health, safety and welfare of the
public in all areas of the City; and
lack of knowledge and lack of
intent is not a defense to any violation thereof.

November 26, 1997
(c) “Owner” as used herein is
defined as any person who owns,
possesses, exercises control over,
maintains, harbors, transports or
sells an animal.

owner of such dog may file a written petition for a hearing concerning such classification no later than
seven (7) days after impoundment.
Such petition shall include the name
and
address,
including
mailing
address of the petitioner. The Director of Public Safety, or his designee,

The hearing, if any, will be held
before the Director of Public Safety,
or his designee. Any facts which the
petitioner wishes to submit shall be
submitted under oath or affirmation

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTION REFERRED
Res. No. 2112-97.
By Councilman Smith.
An emergency resolution urging
The Federal Aviation Authority to
increase the number of air traffic
controllers by fourteen for the control tower at Cleveland Hopkins Airport to appropriate staffing levels to
monitor and direct both incoming
and outgoing flights in order to prevent runway incursions from occurring and to take all action necessary to protect the traveling public
from those hazards caused by runway incursions.
Whereas, there have been several
occurrences of runway incursions at
Cleveland
Hopkins
International
Airport over the past several weeks
that could create a potential threat
to the safety of airline pilots and
passengers; and
Whereas, there have been concerns raised by both pilots and air
traffic controllers about the physical
layout of the airport runways that
often creates difficulty for airline
pilots who try to successfully access
onto the right runway for land and
takeoff; and
Whereas, there have been concerns raised by the National Air
Traffic Controllers Association about
an insufficient number of air traffic
controllers that are presently monitoring and directing both incoming
and outgoing air traffic at Cleveland
Hopkins International Airport; and
Whereas, the National Air Traffic
Controllers Association believes that
in order
to achieve
appropriate
staffing levels fourteen staff positions need to be filled in the air control tower and radar room in the near
future and for immediate action,
there is a need for eight air traffic
controllers to provide immediate coverage in the air control tower in
order to provide proper monitoring
and directing for incoming and outgoing airline flights at Cleveland
Hopkins International Airport; and
Whereas, the Federal Aviation
Authority according to the National
Air Traffic Controllers Association
does not allow for the use of overtime by air traffic controllers to provide proper appropriate coverage
when there are staffing shortages in
the controller tower, thus increasing
the possibility for the occurrence of
a runway incursion, it is necessary
to fill these staffing positions to
ensure safety for airline passengers
and pilots.

1947

17
Now therefore, be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the administrative
officials of the Federal Aviation
Authority consider increasing the
number of air traffic controllers for
the control tower at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport by hiring
fourteen air traffic controllers in
order to provide sufficient coverage
for incoming and outgoing flights to
prevent runway incursions from
occurring.
Section 2. That the administrative
officials of the Federal Aviation
Authority during the interim consider immediately hiring eight air
traffic controllers in order to provide sufficient coverage for both
incoming and outgoing flights in
order to drastically reduce the incident of airport runway incursions.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby be directed to
transmit two certified copies of this
resolution to the Director of the Federal Aviation Authority and Regional Administrator of the Great Lakes
Region Federal Aviation Authority.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

An emergency resolution urging
President Clinton to veto HR Bill
1534, relating to local land use issues.
Whereas, this Council opposes HR

developers are first required to pursue all local remedies, including
negotiating
with
local
zoning
boards to reach mutually acceptable
agreements that satisfy both the
developer and community residents
before proceeding into court; and
Whereas, unless vetoed, HR 1534
will permit developers to proceed to

use and zoning determinations without first having to exhaust their
local administrative remedies or
being required to pursue a state
court appeal;

An emergency resolution to nominate the Cuyahoga River as an
American Heritage River.
Whereas, President Clinton recently announced a national initiative to designate ten rivers in the
United States as American Heritage
Rivers; and
Whereas, the Cuyahoga River has
a unique history and status as a
symbol of America’s environmental
recovery that makes it an ideal candidate for designation as an “American Heritage River” by the President of the United States; and

qualify the Cuyahoga River for
focused federal attention to assist
the community in implementing its
vision for the river without imposing additional federal regulations;
and

broad-based community support to
be successful;
Now, therefore, be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland concludes that the
Cuyahoga River has a unique history and status as a symbol of America’s environmental recovery that

An emergency resolution urging
Governor Voinovich to intervene and
the Ohio legislature to cease and
desist from its actions to repeal
and/or undermine Ohio’s affirmative
action laws and policies affecting
women and minorities in the State
of Ohio.
Whereas, Ohio’s affirmative action
laws and policies provide a level
playing field to women and minorities in the areas of fair housing, fair
employment, fair contracting and
fair education in the State of Ohio;
and
Whereas, any actions by Governor
Voinovich and the Ohio legislature
to restrict and/or eliminate the
affirmative action laws and policies
of this state must be immediately
stopped; and
Whereas, Ohio’s affirmative action
laws and policies deal with the
issue of fairness to women and
minorities
by
providing
these
groups access in the areas of housing, employment, contracting and
education in this state; and
Whereas, to portray Ohio’s laws
and policies on affirmative action as
anything else but of providing fair
access in the areas of housing,
employment, contracting and education is to totally mischaracterize the
issues and does not deal with these
issues honestly;
Now, therefore, be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
Governor Voinovich to intervene and
the Ohio legislature to cease and
desist from its actions of attacking
and undermining Ohio’s affirmative
action laws and policies that pro-

The City Record
vide women and minorities equal
access in the areas of fair housing,
fair employment, fair contracting
and fair education.

County delegation of the state legislature.

An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Board of Pharmacy and the
Ohio legislature to reclassify the
controlled substance Rohypnol, also
known as the date rape drug, to a
Schedule 1 ~depressant which will
allow for stricter enforcement and
penalties.
Whereas, Rohypnol (flunitrazepam) is a prescription sleeping
aid that is currently classified as
a Schedule IV drug under Chapter
3719 of the Ohio Revised Code;
and
Whereas, there have been increasing reports of Rohypnol being illegally diverted into the United States
and illicitly sold. It is reported that
Rohypnol is being put in women’s
drinks and then a rape occurs without
the
woman
remembering
because of the amnesia effect the
drug has on the person taking it;
and
Whereas,
the majority
of the
reports of diversion and illicit use
have been in southern Florida and
Texas; and
Whereas, the Florida legislature
have taken appropriate steps to
reclassify Rohypnol as a Schedule 1
depressant and the federal government, through the Food and Drug
Administration, is also considering
reclassifying the drug as a Schedule
1 drug under the Federal Controlled
Substance Act;
Now, therefore, be it resolved by
