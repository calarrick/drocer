FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL

Res. No. 1795-97.
By Councilmen Westbrook Coats,
Polensek, Moran, Zone, Smith, Willis, Rybka, Sweeney, Patmon, Robinson, Lewis, Dolan, Melena, Gordon,
White, Skrha, Jackson, Britt and
Patton.
An emergency resolution urging
the voters of the City of Cleveland
to Vote NO on State Issue 2 in order
to repeal Senate Bill 45, the so-called
Workers Compensation Reform Bill.
Whereas, Senate Bill 45 (“S.B.
45”), the so-called Worker’s Compensation Reform Bill, was signed
by Governor Voinovich in the spring
of 1997; and
Whereas, although the American
Medical Association calls the use of
the AMA’s permanent impairment
guidelines for workers’ compensation disability assessment purposes
unfair, arbitrary and unreasonable,
S.B. 45 mandates the use of these
guidelines
in
permanent
partial
impairment hearings; and
Whereas, S.B. 45 will substantially diminish the rights of Cleveland
citizens who are injured while working to receive Workers’ Compensation benefits in several ways, including (1) by preventing consideration
of education or past work experience in determination of permanent
and total disability benefits; (2) by
making it almost impossible to
receive Workers’ Compensation benefits for occupational cancers and
other occupational diseases; and (3)
by making injury, disease and accident inspection records maintained
by the Ohio Division of Safety and
Hygiene secret; and
Whereas, S.B. 45 will effectively
deny coverage for those who suffer
from carpal tunnel injuries and
other
repetitive
motion
injuries,
thereby
discriminating
against
women who incur these injuries in
disproportionately
high
numbers
because of the work that they do;
and
Whereas,
the
drastic
cuts
in
Workers’ Compensation benefits and
coverage incorporated in S.B. 45 will
adversely affect the lives of the
working people of Cleveland and
their families; and
Whereas, on July 21, 1997, a coalition of public interest, labor, and
injured worker organizations submitted 415,000 signatures on petitions to the Ohio Secretary of State,
forcing a referendum of S.B. 45; and
Whereas, this November 4th will
be the first time since 1939 that the
citizens of Ohio will be able to go
to the polls and VOTE NO on a piece
of anti-injured workers legislation;
Now, therefore, be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland has determined
that Senate Bill 45 will negatively
impact those citizens who have suffered injuries and diseases as a consequence of their employment, and
strongly urge the citizens of Cleveland to VOTE NO on Issue 2 on
November 4, 1997.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives

all members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

An emergency resolution urging
the U. S. Department of Transportation to seriously examine the safety
issues involved in the proposed
acquisition and distribution of the
assets of Conrail among Norfolk
Southern and CSX Transportation.
Whereas, Norfolk Southern (“NS”)
and CSX Transportation (“CSX”)
have proposed the acquisition and
distribution of the assets of Consolidated Rail Corp. (“Conrail”); and
Whereas,
the
federal
Surface
Transportation Board (“STB”) is the
body studying the proposed acquisition and distribution and is the federal body authorized to act upon the
said proposal; and
Whereas, although the proposed
acquisition and distribution may
offer the potential for economic
development and redevelopment in
this area due to improved freight
movement and intermodal connections, this Council is concerned that
the proposed acquisition will have
negative impacts on our community
due to increased and re-routed traffic throughout the region from 14
trains to 31 to 38 each day; and
Whereas, the negative impacts
include
safety
issues
such
as
increase in injuries to citizens, especially children due to the increase
in train traffic, increase in delays in
emergency
equipment
response,
environmental issues related to air
and noise pollution and the shipment of hazardous cargo; and
Whereas, due to the approximate
threefold increase in freight train
traffic, the fair market values of the
areas residential and non-residential
properties will most likely experience significant decreases in value;
and
Whereas, the STB must review the
proposed plan to determine the existence of alternative routing plans
that will reduce the potential adverse impacts to the citizens of the
City of Cleveland and the City itself,
and on the Greater Cleveland area;
Now, therefore, be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland officially notifies
the Surface Transportation Board of
its concerns that as proposed, the
acquisition and distribution of Conrail’s assets by NS and CSXT will
have a significant adverse impact on
the citizens of the City of Cleveland.

September 24, 1997
Section 2. That the City of Cleveland coordinate with other interested parties such as the cities of Bay
Village, Lakewood, Rocky River,
Westlake, Avon Lake, Berea, the
Greater Cleveland Growth Association, the Northeast Ohio Areawide
Coordinating Agency, the Greater
Cleveland Regional Transit Authority, and the Ohio Rail Development
Commission, as well as state and
federal legislators such as Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council transmit copies of this resolution
to the Surface Transportation Board
and representatives of NS and CSXT
and other interested parties.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it

By Councilman Westbrook.
An emergency resolution urging
the Statewide Transportation Coordination Task Force to support a
process which awards funding for
transportation services based on the
size of the relative caseload of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families in each county.
Whereas, the Ohio General Assembly passed welfare reform legislation (Sub. H.B. 408), which was subsequently
signed
by
Governor
Voinovich on July 2, 1997; and
Whereas, under the state’s welfare reform legislation the responsibility for the administration of welfare benefits lies with the county
commissioners, and each board of
county commissioners must develop
a written transportation work plan,
and set policies regarding the transportation needs of low income residents seeking or striving to retain
employment; and
Whereas, approved amendments to
H.B. 408 require the Ohio Department of Human Services to allocate
to counties statewide, up to $5 million in fiscal years 1998 and 1999 to
provide appropriate transportation
services TANF participants; and
Whereas, the Statewide Transportation Coordination Task Force
has been charged with reviewing
current
state
transportation
resources and policies, supporting new
transportation initiatives for underemployed and unemployed Ohioans;
and
Whereas, the Statewide Transportation Coordination Task Force
is developing recommendations and
guidelines for the county-level State
transportation plan and distribution
formula for the $5 million allocation
for transportation services for workrequired TANF participants; and
Whereas, approximately one-fifth
all
Ohioans
receiving
Temporary
Assistance to Needy Families (TANF)
reside in the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland and
Cuyahoga County have taken a leadership role in developing a community-based plan to provide local transportation for TANF recipients; and

Res. No. 1677-97.
By Councilman Skrha.
An emergency resolution
objecting to the transfer of ownership and
location of a D1, D2, D3, D3A and
D6 Liquor Permit to 700 St. Clair
Avenue W.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Director of Liquor Control of an application for the transfer of ownership and location of a
D1, D2, D3, D3A and D6 Liquor Permit from Permit No. 2760874, 5304
Detroit Inc. Sol Tushman RCVR 1st
Fl. & Bsmt. & Patio, 5304 Detroit
Ave., Cleveland, Ohio 44113, to Permit No. 26239710005, Fairview Hospitality Inc., 700 St. Clair Ave. W,
Cleveland, Ohio 44113; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, safety
and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of
notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby record its objection to the transfer of ownership and location of a
D1, D2, D3, D3A and D6 Liquor Permit from Permit No. 2760874, 5304

Ave., Cleveland, Ohio 44113, to Permit No. 26239710005, Fairview Hospitality Inc., 700 St. Clair Ave. W,
Cleveland, Ohio 44113; and requests
the Director of Liquor Control to set
a hearing for said application in
accordance with provisions of Section 4303.26 of the Revised Code of
Ohio.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby is directed to

resolution, together with two copies

Whereas, the granting of this

constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department

respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
