Whereas, over the past three
years, Brook Park and Cleveland
have been involved in disputes
regarding the operation and growth
of Cleveland Hopkins International
Airport; and
Whereas, Brook Park and Cleveland have prepared an Agreement to
forge a permanent resolution to
these disputes; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that this Agreement represents a
fair, reasonable and mutually beneficial settlement to these disputes;
and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That, notwithstanding
any other ordinance or Codified
Ordinance
to
the
contrary,
the
Mayor, the Director of Law and the
Director of Port Control are hereby
authorized to enter into a Settlement
Agreement with the City of Brook
Park regarding the expansion of
Cleveland
Hopkins
International
Airport, which shall provide, among
other things, for a change in the
municipal boundaries between the
two cities, the conveyance of fee
interests in certain parcels of land
currently owned by Cleveland, the
filing of requests for stays and subsequent dismissal of certain pending
litigation between the two cities
related to airport expansion and for
the payment of consideration and
other amounts as set forth in the
Settlement Agreement.
Section 2. That the Settlement
Agreement authorized by Section 1
of this ordinance shall be substantially in the form as follows:
SETTLEMENT
AGREEMENT REGARDING
CLEVELAND HOPKINS
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
This
SETTLEMENT
AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is made
this ___ day of _____________, 1997,

CITY
OF
BROOK
PARK (“Brook Park”) and the CITY
OF

(“Cleveland”),

rations

under Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution.
RECITALS
Whereas, the Cleveland Hopkins
International Airport (the “Airport”)
is owned and operated by Cleveland
and bordered to the south by Brook
Park and other suburban communities;
Whereas, over the past three
years, Brook Park and Cleveland
have been involved in long-standing
disputes regarding the operation
and growth of the Airport;
Whereas, on August 1, 1996, the
Mayors of Brook Park and Cleveland
announced
that
they
had
agreed on a Framework for Settlement of the disputes between their
Cities, which Framework includes
provisions that allow for expansion
of the Airport, foster economic
expansion and job creation, allow
for completion of Aerospace Parkway, and facilitate the comprehensive redevelopment of portions of
Brookpark Road;
Whereas, Brook Park and Cleveland recognize that ensuring the
future of the Airport as a safe, efficient facility capable of serving the
region’s long-term air transportation
needs is a vital element in the continuing prosperity of the greater
Cleveland metropolitan area;
Whereas, Brook Park and Cleveland have a mutual interest in fostering economic expansion and job
creation in the greater Cleveland
metropolitan area;
Whereas, Brook Park and Cleveland recognize that valuable contributions to such economic expansion
can be made by (i) completing the
construction of Aerospace Parkway
from the west end of Brook Park to
Route 237; and (ii) initiating a comprehensive redevelopment plan for
the portions of Brookpark Road
which form the boundary between
Brook Park and Cleveland;
Whereas, Brook Park and Cleveland have prepared this Agreement
to forge a permanent resolution to
the long-standing disputes between
them and to avoid the uncertainties
and continued expense to both Cities
of ongoing litigation between them;
Whereas, Brook Park and Cleveland believe that this Agreement
represents a fair, reasonable and
mutually beneficial settlement of
their disputes, and that, in light of
this Agreement, it is appropriate to
dismiss
the
ongoing
litigation
between them in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement; and
Whereas, Brook Park and Cleveland agree that the payments, fee
interest property transfers and jurisdictional property interest transfers
and boundary changes to be effected under this Agreement are fair
and reasonable, represent appropriate consideration for the respective
interests being transferred, and comprise an integral part of this Agreement and the settlement of litigation and claims herein.

2. TRANSFER
JURISDICTIONAL
INTERESTS

OF

FEE AND
PROPERTY

2.1 Transfer of Fee Interests. In
consideration of all the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, Cleveland shall, subject to the reservations set forth in Paragraph 2.5
below, transfer to Brook Park the
Fee Interests in the Fee Interest
Parcels, together with all easements, rights, privileges, hereditaments and appurtenances thereunto
belonging. Such transfer of Fee
Interests shall be authorized by the
Property Transfer Ordinance.
2.2
Transfer
of
Jurisdictional
Property Interests and Adjustment
of Boundary Lines. In consideration
of all the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and pursuant to the
provisions of Section 709.37 of the
Ohio Revised Code, Cleveland and
Brook Park agree that the boundary
line separating Cleveland and Brook
Park shall be changed, transferring
all Jurisdictional Property Interests,
including zoning, franchise and taxing powers therein, and establishing
a new boundary line between the
Cities.
The
new
boundary
line
between Cleveland and Brook Park
shall be as generally depicted on
the map attached as Appendix 2 to
this
Agreement
and
as
legally
described in Appendix 7 to this
Agreement. Such transfer of Jurisdictional
Property
Interests
and
boundary line adjustments shall be
implemented
by
the
Boundary
Adjustment Ordinances which shall
be in accordance with the Ohio
Revised Code.
2.3 Conditions of Fee Interest Conveyance. Title to the Fee Interest
Parcels shall be transferred by official quitclaim deed subject only to
those encumbrances approved by the
parties. The deeds shall be in the
form attached hereto as Appendix 8.
2.4 Potential Environmental Contamination
on
the
Fee
Interest
Parcels.
2.4.1 Phase I and Phase II Audits.
The parties acknowledge that they
have obtained Phase I environmental audits of the Fee Interest
Parcels (the “Phase I Audits”),
which Phase I Audits have been prepared
in
accordance
with
the
requirements of Ohio’s Voluntary
Action
Program
(“VAP”)
as
described in Ohio Revised Code Section 3746.01 et seq. and regulations
promulgated thereunder. Based on
the results of the Phase I Audits,
the parties acknowledge that the
consultant that has prepared the

149

5
Phase I Audits (the “Consultant”)
has recommended that Phase II
Environmental Audits (the “Phase
II Audits”) be conducted for certain
of the Fee Interest Parcels. For
those Fee Interest Parcels for which
the Consultant has not recommended preparation of a Phase II Audit,
the parties shall proceed to work
jointly with the Consultant to obtain
both a “No Further Action Letter”
from
the
Consultant
and
a
“Covenant Not to Sue” from the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency
(“OEPA”), both as defined in the
VAP, which documents shall be
obtained prior to the Closing Date.
For those Fee Interest Parcels for
which the Consultant has recommended preparation of a Phase II
Audit, the parties shall proceed to
have the Consultant complete such
Phase II Audits in accordance with
the requirements of the VAP, which
Phase II Audits are expected to be
completed within 75 days after the
Approval Date.
2.4.2 Phase II Audits; Remediation
Plan.
2.4.2.1 For those Fee Interest
Parcels, if any, for which, based
upon the results of the Phase II
Audit, the Consultant has identified
no
environmental
contamination
that would require remediation to
obtain a No Further Action Letter
and a Covenant Not to Sue, the parties shall proceed to work jointly
with the Consultant to obtain both
a No Further Action Letter and a
Covenant Not to Sue, which documents shall be obtained prior to the
Closing Date.
2.4.2.2 For those Fee Interest
Parcels, if any, for which, based
upon the results of the Phase II
Audits, the Consultant has identified
environmental contamination that
would require remediation in order
to obtain a No Further Action Letter and a Covenant Not to Sue, the
parties shall work with the Consultant to develop a plan for remediation (the “Remediation Plan”) of the
applicable
Fee
Interest
Parcels,
which plan shall be prepared in a
manner that would allow the Consultant to issue a No Further Action
Letter and the OEPA to issue a
Covenant Not to Sue, each in accordance with the VAP, and which
Remediation Plan shall include an
estimate of the costs of implementing such plan.
2.4.2.3 Once the Remediation Plan
is prepared, Brook Park shall proceed to manage the implementation
of the Remediation Plan, if it chooses to undertake remediation of the
Fee Interest Parcels in question.
Cleveland shall not be liable for any
portion of the costs of implementing
a Remediation Plan which exceed
the costs which Cleveland would
have to pay for remediation if the
Fee Interest Parcels were not conveyed under this Agreement, and
Cleveland shall not be required to
pay any costs of the Remediation
Plan earlier than it would have to
pay such costs if the Fee Interest
Parcels were not conveyed under
this Agreement, provided, however,
that this provision shall not be construed to preclude Brook Park or
any subsequent owner of the Fee
Interest Parcels from asserting any
other claim under federal or state
law, including common law, with
respect to the contamination which
is addressed pursuant to the Remediation Plan or any amendment
thereto.

6
2.4.3 Election Not to Accept Fee
Interest.
2.4.3.1 Notwithstanding anything
in this Paragraph 2.4 to the contrary, for those Fee Interest Parcels,
if any, for which the Consultant has
not recommended that Phase II
Audits be prepared, or, if the Consultant recommends that Phase II
Audits be prepared, but, based on
such Phase II Audits, does not recommend that environmental remediation be conducted, Brook Park
shall have the option to elect not to
accept title to any or all of such
parcels if the Consultant is unwilling to issue a No Further Action
Letter or if OEPA is unwilling to
issue a Covenant Not to Sue for such
parcels. In addition, for those Fee
Interest Parcels for which a Phase
II Audit and Remediation Plan have
been prepared, Brook Park shall
have the option, based on the results
of the Remediation Plan, to elect not
to accept title to any or all of such
Fee Interest Parcels.
2.4.3.2 Brook Park shall make
such election by written notice to
Cleveland within 30 days after
receipt of notice that either the No
Further
Action
Letter
or
the
Covenant Not to Sue cannot be
obtained, or within 30 days after
receipt of the Remediation Plan,
whichever is applicable. If Brook
Park notifies Cleveland that it has
made such election, the parties shall
proceed to Closing in accordance
with Paragraph 12.4 below, but the
Fee Interest Parcels to be conveyed
to Brook Park shall not include the
parcel or parcels to which Brook
Park has elected not to receive title.
With respect to such Fee Interest
Parcels to which Brook Park has
elected not to receive title, Cleveland shall grant to Brook Park such
right-of-way over such parcels as
may be necessary for construction
and operation of Aerospace Parkway along the Agreed Roadway
Alignment. In addition, for a period
of five years from the Closing Date,
Cleveland agrees that it will not
assert for any purpose in any forum
that it has devoted such parcels to
a public purpose.
2.4.4
Representation
Regarding
Delivery of Information.
2.4.4.1 Cleveland represents that,
as of the Closing Date, Cleveland
officials have provided to Brook
Park to the best of their knowledge
(1) any sampling data that is within Cleveland’s possession that has
been collected concerning the Fee
Interest Parcels since January 1,
1980; and (2) any information submitted on behalf of the Airport to
OEPA or the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”)
with
respect
to
any
“spill
or
release”, as defined below, on the
Fee Interest Parcels or parcels adjacent to the Fee Interest Parcels.
2.4.4.2 As used in this Paragraph
2.4.4, “spill or release” shall mean
any spill or release onto soils, surface water or groundwater of a substance which is (1) a hazardous
waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (42 U.S.C.
Section 6901 et seq.), (2) a hazardous substance under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act (42
U.S.C. Section 9601 et seq.), (3) a
toxic pollutant or hazardous substance under the Clean Water Act
(33 U.S.C. Section 1251 et seq.), (4)
oil or petroleum products, including

The City Record
waste
oil
or
polychlorinated
biphenyls; or (5) an extremely hazardous substance under the Emergency Planning and Community
Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. Section
11001 et seq.).
2.5
Avigation
Easement,
and
Waiver, Release and Restrictions on
Use.
2.5.1
Reservation
of
Avigation
Easement. Cleveland reserves from
the conveyance of the Fee Interest
Parcels a perpetual and assignable
right-of-way and easement for the
free and unobstructed passage of all
aircraft, regardless of the owner or
operator of such, in, through and
across all of the air space above the
Fee Interest Parcels subject to such
rights, terms and conditions as contained herein. (For purposes of this
Agreement, “aircraft” is defined as
any contrivance now known or
hereafter invented, used or designed
for navigation of or flight in the air
or space regardless of the form of
propulsion which powers said aircraft in flight.) Cleveland, its successors in interest and assigns, shall
have and hold such easement and
right-of-way, and all rights appertaining thereto, until the Airport
shall be abandoned and shall cease
to be used for public airport purposes.
2.5.2 Waiver, Release and Restrictions on Use. Brook Park, its successors in interest and assigns shall:
2.5.2.1 waive, remise and release
any right or cause of action which
Brook Park may now have or may
have in the future against Cleveland, on account of or arising out of
noise, vibrations, fumes, dust, fuel,
particles and all other effects that
may be caused or may have been
caused by the operation of aircraft
landing at, taking off from, or operating at or on the Airport, or in or
near the air space above the Fee
Interest Parcels;
2.5.2.2 not allow any structure,
object, tree, shrubbery, or other vegetation to remain on the Fee Interest Parcels which encroaches upon
or extends into the areas where the
FAA would prohibit such structures,
objects, trees, or other vegetation
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the FAA or where such
structures, objects, trees, or other
vegetation
would
be
prohibited
under the rules and regulations of
the Ohio Airport Protection Act,
Ohio Rev. Code Section 4561.30 et
seq. based upon the Submitted ALP;
2.5.2.3 not use, permit or suffer the
use of the Fee Interest Parcels in
such a manner, based on the Submitted ALP, as to create electrical
interferences with radio communication to or from any aircraft or
between any airport installation and
any aircraft; or as to make it difficult for aircraft pilots to distinguish
between airport lights and other
lights; or as to produce glare or
reflection which would impair aircraft pilots landing or taking off at
the Airport; or as to impair visibility in the vicinity of the Airport, or
as to otherwise endanger the landing, take off, or maneuvering of aircraft;
2.5.2.4 not authorize the construction of any facility or improvement
on the Fee Interest Parcels which
attracts or results in the concentration of birds or other wildlife which,
based on the Submitted ALP, would
interfere with the safe operation of
aircraft in flight; and
2.5.2.5 not construct on the Fee
Interest Parcels a structure which
would be a noncompatible land use
based on the Submitted ALP, pursuant to 14 CFR Section 150.7 (1996
ed.).

150

February 12, 1997
2.5.3 Reservation of Rights. Cleveland, its successors in interest and
assigns shall have the continuing
right to cause or allow in all of the
air space above the surface of the
Fee Interest Parcels such noise,
fumes, vibrations, dust, fuel, particles and all other effects that may
be caused by or result from the operation of aircraft, whether or not said
aircraft overfly or intrude into the
easement area described in Paragraph 2.5.1 above.
2.5.4 Injunctive Relief. If Brook
Park defaults in or violates the
obligations set forth in Paragraphs
2.5.1, 2.5.2 or 2.5.3 above, and fails
reasonably to cure such default or
violation upon notification by Cleveland, then Cleveland shall be entitled to injunctive relief as provided
in Paragraph 13.5 below.
2.6 Covenants Running With the
Land. Brook Park and Cleveland
agree that the obligations of Brook
Park set forth in Paragraph 2.5
above
shall
also
constitute
covenants running with the land of
the Fee Interest Parcels both as to
burdens and benefits. Whenever
“Brook Park” is used in Paragraphs
2.5 or 2.6, it refers to Brook Park
and its successors in interest and
assigns. Cleveland’s failure to exercise its remedies reserved herein
shall not be construed to waive any
rights
Cleveland
may
have
to
enforce Brook Park’s obligations
through any and all rights and
remedies which Cleveland or its successors in interest and assigns may
have at law or in equity for the
enforcement of covenants. No waiver by Cleveland at any time of any
of Brook Park’s obligations shall be
deemed or taken as a waiver at any
time thereafter of the same or any
other obligation or of the strict and
prompt
performance
thereof.
No
waiver shall be valid against Cleveland unless reduced to writing and
signed by an officer of Cleveland
duly empowered to execute same.
2.7 Easements. Cleveland specifically reserves, and the conveyance
of the Fee Interest Parcels is made
expressly subject to, such easements
in favor of Cleveland as are set
forth in the deeds to the Fee Interest Parcels attached as Appendix 8.
2.8 FAA Approval. As soon as
practical after the Approval Date,
Cleveland shall submit to the FAA
a request, together with all supporting
documentation
that
is
required under FAA Order 5190.6A,
paragraph 4-17b, for approval of any
of the property conveyances set
forth in Paragraph 2.1 above for
which FAA approval is required.
The parties agree that they will
cooperate to take all reasonable
actions necessary to secure such
FAA approval, including compliance, or agreement to comply, with
such terms and conditions as the
FAA may require.
2.9 Brook Park Cooperation. Brook
Park shall cooperate in any reasonable efforts by Cleveland to acquire
the remaining parcels of land that
are located within the Airport Envelope and are not presently owned by
Cleveland.
3. USE OF REAL PROPERTY
3.1 Agreement Not to Contest Public Purpose. Cleveland agrees, for a
period of five years after the
Approval Date, that it will not contest for any purpose in any forum
whether Brook Park has devoted
any property conveyed to Brook
Park pursuant to this Agreement to

February 12, 1997
a
public
purpose.
Brook
Park
agrees, for a period of five years
after the Approval Date, that it will
not contest for any purpose in any
forum whether Cleveland has devoted any property within the Airport
Envelope to a public purpose.
3.2 Future Property Ownership. At
any time after the Approval Date
that either City acquires fee title,
lease rights, or any other right to
use any real property located in the
other City for Airport or any other
purposes, Brook Park and Cleveland
shall abide by and follow all laws
concerning
zoning
applicable
at
such time with respect to the use of
such real property.
3.3 Access to the Airfield from Fee
Interest Parcels. To the extent that
any of the Fee Interest Parcels are
used for an Airport-Related Business
which requires airfield access for
the conduct of its core business,
Cleveland shall permit such access
subject to the following limitations:
3.3.1 such Airport-Related Business and airfield access shall comply with all requirements and guidance of the FAA and the Airport
affecting such access;
3.3.2 such Airport-Related Business and access do not materially
interfere
with
any
current
or
planned use of land within the Airport Envelope as shown on the Submitted ALP or any submitted or
approved airport layout plan as it
may appear from time to time; and
3.3.3 all capital, operating, maintenance and security costs of such
access, including the Airport’s standard provisions regarding indemnification and insurance, shall be provided for by Brook Park or the Airport-Related Business in a form (a)
sufficient to guarantee that such
costs will not at any time be paid
by Cleveland, and (b) approved in
writing in advance by Cleveland,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.
3.3.4
Cleveland
shall
not
be
required at any time to adjust plans,
design or use of land or facilities
within the Airport Envelope to facilitate or preserve the opportunity for
airfield access from the Fee Interest Parcels, provided that Cleveland
will not materially interfere with
any such access which is in use at
any time.
3.4 Access to Brook Park from the
Airport Envelope. In addition to any
entry provided pursuant to Paragraph 4.6 below, Brook Park shall
provide the Airport access to public
roadways in Brook Park on terms
no less favorable than those granted to other property owners with
frontage on the applicable public
roadways. If a roadway to which
access is provided on the Approval
Date is closed, relocated or abandoned by Brook Park, Brook Park
shall provide reasonably equivalent
access to other roadways in Brook
Park. Nothing in this Paragraph 3.4
is intended to affect Brook Park’s
obligations under State and federal
law with respect to access to roads
within its jurisdiction.
3.5 Access to Fee Interest Parcel
Located East of the I-X Center. The
Cities acknowledge that access to
the Fee Interest Parcel located east
of the I-X Center currently is available from the Airport service road
located south of the Key Corp.
hangar on the Airport, and that such
service road is not a public roadway. Cleveland shall provide Brook
Park access to such parcel along
such Airport service road so long as
such access does not interfere with

The City Record
the security and safe operations of
the Airport. If Cleveland eliminates
or closes such service road, Cleveland shall provide reasonably equivalent access to such parcel.
4. AIRPORT DEVELOPMENT
4.1 Changes to Submitted ALP.
The Cities recognize that changes
may be made to the Submitted ALP
prior to issuance of the Record of
Decision.
However,
after
the
Approval Date and prior to the
issuance of the Record of Decision,
Cleveland shall not make or permit
any Material Change, as defined in
Paragraph 4.2 below, to the Submitted ALP.
4.2 Material Change Defined. Any
change to the Submitted ALP prior
to the issuance of the Record of
Decision will be deemed material
for purposes of Paragraph 4.1 above
if:
4.2.1 based on Ohio Rev. Code Section 4561.30 et seq., it would necessitate height limitations on property located within the New Boundaries of Brook Park that are more
restrictive than those necessitated
by the improvements contemplated
on the Submitted ALP, or
4.2.2 it requires, in order to comply with FAA requirements or guidance relating to obstructions to navigation, the acquisition by Cleveland
of real property or real property
interests within the New Boundaries
of Brook Park.
4.3 Support for ALP. Brook Park
shall support fully the approval of
the Submitted ALP at all levels of
review, including FAA review and
any required federal and state environmental
reviews.
Brook
Park
shall take any necessary or desirable actions requested by Cleveland
to
demonstrate
support
for
the
approval of the Submitted ALP and
for federal grant and passenger
facility charge (“PFC”) funding of
the capital projects set forth on the
Submitted ALP.
4.4 Depiction of Aerospace Parkway on Future ALPs. Any airport
layout plan that Cleveland submits
to the FAA at any time after the
Approval Date shall depict the location of Aerospace Parkway, either
as proposed or, after its construction
is completed, as constructed.
4.5 Construction within Airport
Envelope.
4.5.1 Restrictions on Construction
in Certain Airport Envelope Areas.
Within the Restricted Area, Cleveland shall authorize or permit construction of only runways, taxiways
and related safety and security
facilities, hangars, aircraft and airport maintenance buildings, and
other facilities (such as overnight
and second-day package delivery
facilities) which because of their
function must be adjacent to aprons
and taxiways.
4.5.2 Reasonable Design and Signage Standards. Subject to applicable federal regulations, orders, policies and standards, and to approval
by the FAA, if required, structures
constructed after the Closing Date
in the Restricted Area shall be consistent with the design and signage
standards set forth in Appendix 9
(“Design Standards”).
4.5.3 Compliance with Laws. All
construction
activities
conducted
within the Restricted Area shall
comply with federal and state laws,
including applicable environmental
laws.

151

7
4.5.4
Restrictive
Covenant.
To
insure compliance with Paragraphs
4.5.1 and 4.5.2 above, Cleveland shall
impose the Design Standards on the
Restricted
Area
by
restrictive
covenant (“Restrictive Covenant”).
The Restrictive Covenant shall be in
the form attached as Appendix 10,
shall run with the land and shall
inure to the benefit of Brook Park,
its
successors
in
interest
and
assigns. The Restrictive Covenant
shall further provide that, at least
15 days prior to issuance of a building permit for any construction subject to the Restrictive Covenant,
Cleveland
shall
deliver
written
notice thereof to Brook Park, and
shall provide Brook Park a period
of 10 days to review the plans and
specifications for such construction.
If, upon review of such plans and
specifications, Brook Park believes
that such construction will not comply with the terms of the Restrictive
Covenant, Brook Park shall so notify Cleveland on or before the end of
Brook Park’s 10-day review period,
and the Directors of Law of the
Cities or their designated representatives shall meet to attempt to
resolve their differences.
4.5.5 Dispute Resolution. If the
Cities cannot resolve their differences under Paragraph 4.5.4 above,
either City may submit such differences to a panel (the “Panel”) consisting
of
one
representative
appointed by the Mayor of each City
and a third member selected by
those two representatives, which
third member shall be a professional
experienced
in
planning
or
design. In the event that either City
so elects, both Cities shall proceed
in accordance with this Paragraph
4.5.5, and neither City may proceed
with any other remedies at law,
equity or as specifically contemplated under this Agreement until
the process set forth in this Paragraph has been completed. The
Panel shall be selected within 10
days after either City notifies the
other City of its determination that
their differences cannot be resolved.
The Panel shall meet and propose a
resolution not later than 10 days
after all Panel members have been
selected. Proceedings of the Panel
shall be informal, without hearings
or formal submissions, and the
Panel shall have no power to impose
any resolution and its decisions
shall not be binding on the Cities.
The Mayors of the Cities or their
designated
representatives
shall
review the Panel’s proposed resolution and shall meet at least one time
after issuance of the proposed resolution to seek to resolve their differences based on such resolution. If
the Cities are unable to resolve their
differences after such meeting, the
Cities may proceed to invoke any
other remedies at law or in equity
or as set forth in this Agreement for
breach of a provision of this Agreement.
4.6 One Public Entry to Airport.
4.6.1 Sole Public Entry. The sole
public entry to the Airport shall be
from Route 237 and/or Snow Road,
although the particular location of
entry from either of these roads may
be changed in Cleveland’s discretion
at any time, or from time to time.
This provision shall not be construed to prevent Cleveland from
maintaining other secondary entries
to the Airport, provided such entries
are not available to scheduled airline passengers and are used exclu-

The City Record

8
sively for emergency, service/maintenance, deliveries, air cargo, access
to leased premises by tenants and
subtenants or other airport-related
purposes.
4.6.2 Replacement Public Entry. If
in the future Cleveland desires to
construct any additional or replacement public entry at a different
location, it shall furnish Brook Park
with a map depicting such proposed
public entry not less than 180 calendar days prior to seeking FAA
approval for or beginning construction of such public entry, whichever
is earlier. Brook Park shall have 60
calendar days from the date of
receipt of such map to notify Cleveland that Brook Park desires to
have an equivalent public entry constructed from within Brook Park. If
Brook Park so notifies Cleveland
within the specified time period,
Cleveland shall construct, at its own
expense, an additional public entry
to the Airport from a mutually
agreed upon location within Brook
Park. Such public entry shall be
equivalent, with regard to all material characteristics affecting public
access, to the proposed public entry
depicted on the map provided pursuant to this Paragraph and shall
be completed within a timeframe
equivalent to the timeframe for completion of the additional or replacement public entry in Cleveland.
4.6.3 Change of Permitted Uses by
Brook Park. Brook Park shall not
take any affirmative actions to
change permitted uses in any way
which would substantially interfere
with the proposed Snow Road interchange depicted on the Submitted
ALP.
5.
SOUND
GRAM

INSULATION

PRO-

5.1 Definition of Program. Cleveland shall seek federal funding, for
a five-year period commencing in
calendar year 1998, for a sound insulation program for residential structures in Cleveland, Brook Park and
other communities near the Airport
(“Sound
Insulation
Program”).
Cleveland acknowledges that the
existing residential structures in
Brook Park within the area shown
on the map attached as Appendix 11,
are eligible for participation in the
Sound Insulation Program. Insulation shall be performed in accordance with engineering, construction and financial standards generally applicable in Cleveland’s airport residential sound insulation
program.
5.2 Applications for Sound Insulation Funding.
5.2.1
Application
Requirement.
Cleveland shall, at least annually,
submit an application for Sound
Insulation Program funding under
the FAA’s Airport Improvement Program (“AIP”) or other appropriate
grant program. Cleveland shall provide a copy of any such application
to Brook Park.
5.2.2 Limitations on Statements of
Priority. In order to ensure that that
portion of the Sound Insulation Program applicable within Brook Park
receives equitable consideration for
funding, until such Sound Insulation
Program has been completed, Cleveland shall not state or otherwise
imply in any application or related
material submitted to any agency in
connection with any application for
funding of any noise mitigation program that funding of any noise mitigation program is of higher priority, greater significance or more

immediate importance than funding
for the Sound Insulation Program
applicable within Brook Park. The
fact that an application for noise
mitigation
funding
which
seeks
greater funding for other noise mitigation programs than for the Sound
Insulation Program applicable within Brook Park shall not in itself be
interpreted as a failure to comply
with this paragraph, so long as such
application seeks funding for the
Sound Insulation Program in an
amount sufficient to complete the
Sound Insulation Program.
5.3 Allocation of Funds for Sound
Insulation. Any funds which Cleveland receives or uses for sound insulation purposes from 1998 to 2002
shall be divided annually or cumulatively by Cleveland between sound
insulation in Brook Park and sound
insulation in all other communities
(including Cleveland) in proportion
to the total number of residential
units eligible for the Sound Insulation Program.
5.4 Noise Compatibility Program.
If Cleveland seeks FAA approval of
a Part 150 Noise Compatibility Program between 1998 and 2002, that
program shall incorporate the Sound
Insulation Program.
5.5 Impacts of Airport Development Program. If the final documentation prepared pursuant to the
National Environmental Policy Act
(“NEPA”) for the Airport expansion
program shown on the Submitted
ALP shows that new areas in Brook
Park outside those eligible for participation in the Sound Insulation
Program as of the Approval Date
will lie within the LDN 65 dB contour as a result of the expansion
program, Cleveland shall, in any
subsequent application for federal
grant funds for airport expansion,
include a request for sufficient
funds to pay the cost of insulation
of such residential units in Brook
Park.
6. USE OF
PROPERTY

MODEL

AIRPLANE

6.1 Park. The parties acknowledge
that Brook Park may develop the
Model Airplane Property as a park
or other use. In the event that Brook
Park decides not to develop the
Model Airplane Property as a park
and decides to make it available for
commercial
development,
Brook
Park shall so notify Cleveland, and
shall cooperate with Cleveland in
identifying and recruiting potential
tenants to the Model Airplane Property.
6.2 Alternative Development. In
the event that Brook Park proposes
to enter into a binding agreement
with a third party for the sale or
use of the Model Airplane Property
for a land use other than an AirportRelated Business, Brook Park shall
provide written notice to Cleveland
at least 60 calendar days before
entering into any such agreement.
The notice required under this Paragraph 6.2 shall include a summary
of key terms of the proposed binding agreement, including key financial, tax, and infrastructure terms,
and shall identify explicitly those
terms which Brook Park deems
material.
6.3
Cleveland
Proposal.
Upon
receipt of notice from Brook Park
under the Paragraph 6.2 above,
Cleveland shall have 45 calendar
days in which to present to Brook
Park a counterproposal to develop
the Model Airplane Property for an
Airport-Related
Business.

Park shall review any such counterproposal and shall determine, in
its reasonable discretion, which of
the two proposals better satisfies
the terms that Brook Park deems
material. If Brook Park determines
that
Cleveland’s
counterproposal
better satisfies such terms, Brook
Park shall accept Cleveland’s counterproposal and enter into an appropriate agreement with the appropriate parties to provide for the implementation of such counterproposal.
7. CONSTRUCTION AND RELOCATION
OF
ROADWAY
AND
POWER LINES
7.1 Completion of Aerospace Parkway. Brook Park may construct
Aerospace
Parkway
along
the
Agreed Road Alignment. The Cities
believe that the Agreed Road Alignment depicted on the map attached
as Appendix 1 to this Agreement is
consistent with FAA guidance on
ensuring the safe, full-service operation of the runways depicted on the
Submitted ALP. The Cities, however, recognize that the results of
required engineering and environmental
studies
may
necessitate
changes in the final alignment for
Aerospace Parkway such that the
actual as-constructed alignment of
Aerospace Parkway may deviate
from the Agreed Road Alignment
but only to the extent that such
alignment is consistent with the
safe, full-service operation of the
runways shown on the Submitted
ALP. Cleveland shall grant Brook
Park a nonexclusive easement for
placement and maintenance of the
CEI Power Lines along the alignment set forth in Appendix 12,
which easement shall not exceed 10
feet from the Agreed Road Alignment on the Airport side, and provided that (a) the placement of such
CEI Power Lines within such easement does not interfere with the
safe, full service operation of the
runways shown on the Submitted
ALP, and (b) there is not sufficient
area for such CEI Power Lines in
the right-of-way on the non-Airport
side of the Agreed Road Alignment.
7.2 Roadway Costs.
7.2.1 Construction of Agreed Road
Alignment. Except as provided in
Paragraph 7.2.3 below, Brook Park
shall pay all costs actually incurred
for the planning, design, engineering, acquisition of non-Cleveland
property interests for, and construction of Aerospace Parkway as provided in Paragraph 7.1 above. If,
either before or after the Closing
Date,
Cleveland
determines,
or
Cleveland is informed by the FAA,
that a surface roadway along the
alignment contemplated in the previous paragraph would interfere
with the safe, full-service operation
of the runways depicted on the Submitted ALP, Cleveland shall have
the right to require Brook Park to
depress or tunnel such roadway, provided, however, that Cleveland shall
have the option to choose whether
the road is tunnelled or depressed
and shall pay for all reasonable
costs and expenses related to such
depression or tunneling as provided
in Paragraph 7.2.2 below.
7.2.2 Tunnelling or Depressing
Road. If Cleveland seeks to require
Brook Park to depress or tunnel
Aerospace Parkway pursuant to
Paragraph 7.2.1 above, Cleveland
shall so notify Brook Park in writing. In such notification, Cleveland
shall specify the changes in elevation of the road surface (i.e., sur-

February 12, 1997
face, depressed or tunneled) that it
desires based on appropriate documentation, and shall agree to execute such documents as Brook Park
determines, in its reasonable discretion, are necessary to demonstrate
Cleveland’s binding commitment to
reimburse Brook Park for all reasonable costs incurred for changes
in planning, design, engineering and
construction thereby necessitated.
7.2.3 Costs Related to Reconfiguration of Parking at Aerospace
Technology
Park.
The
parties
acknowledge that the location of the
northwestern boundary of the Airport and the construction of Aerospace Parkway adjacent to such
boundary may require the reconfiguration of certain of the parking
areas that presently serve Aerospace Technology Park. Cleveland
shall
pay
all
reasonable
costs
incurred by Brook Park or the property owner associated with such
reconfiguration, including, without
limitation, design and engineering
costs, surveying costs, paving and
striping costs, landscaping costs
necessary to landscape the reconfigured parking in a manner consistent with Aerospace Technology
Park design standards, and costs
associated with storm water management.
7.3 FAA Approval. Cleveland shall
take whatever action is necessary,
including paying the cost of tunneling or depressing Aerospace Parkway and any other action required,
to assist Brook Park in obtaining
FAA approval of the completion of
Aerospace Parkway, as described in
Paragraph 7.1 above. Such FAA
approval shall include any FAA
approvals necessary to comply with
the terms of Resolution 95-053 of the
Northeast Ohio Area Coordinating
Agency.
7.4 ODOT/FHWA Approval. Brook
Park shall assume responsibility for
obtaining all necessary approvals
from
all
governmental
agencies
including the Ohio Department of
Transportation (“ODOT”) and the
Federal
Highway
Administration
(“FHWA”), for the completion of
Aerospace Parkway, as described in
Paragraph 7.1 above, including any
changes in the roadway elevation
required under the terms of Paragraph 7.2.1 above. Cleveland shall
support fully the approval of the
completion of Aerospace Parkway at
all levels of review, including ODOT
review, approval, and local match
determination, and FHWA review
and approval. Cleveland shall take
such reasonable actions as Brook
Park requests in order to demonstrate such support.
7.5
Relocation
of
CEI
Power
Lines.
7.5.1
Relocation.
The
Cities
acknowledge
that
the
planned
expansion
of
the
Airport
will
require relocation of the CEI power
lines (the “CEI Power Lines”) located on the Existing CEI Power Line
Property to the route depicted on
the map attached as Appendix 12 to
this Agreement (with such minor
deviations from such route contained in the final design plans
and/or required by CEI for safe construction
and
operation),
which
route runs primarily underground,
beneath the right-of-ways for the
proposed Aerospace Parkway and
for Ruple Parkway. The Cities further acknowledge that such relocation may require several permits
and approvals, including, without
limitation, approvals from the Ohio
Public Utilities Commission, CEI

The City Record
and Brook Park, as well as significant costs associated with design,
engineering and construction associated with such relocation. Brook
Park shall issue on a timely basis
all such permits within its authority without the imposition of unreasonable conditions.
7.5.2 Responsibility for Consents
and
Approvals.
Cleveland
shall
obtain any and all consents or
approvals that are legally required
for this relocation, including, but
not limited to, the consent of CEI
and the Ohio Public Utilities Commission, except that Brook Park
shall
assume
responsibility
for
review by the Brook Park Planning
Commission.
7.5.3 Responsibility for Costs and
Expenses. Cleveland shall be solely
responsible for all costs and expenses associated with such relocation,
including, without limitation, costs
and
expenses
associated
with
obtaining the permits and approvals
necessary
for
such
relocation,
preparing
necessary
design
and
engineering documents, obtaining
new easements and conducting the
physical construction work necessary
to
effect
such
relocation.
Notwithstanding any other provision
in this Agreement, Cleveland shall
not be required to make any payments associated with the relocation
of the CEI Power Lines until such
relocation is reasonably necessary
for Airport safety or efficiency.
7.5.4 Assumption of Obligations by
Brook Park. In the event that Brook
Park’s schedule for construction of
Aerospace Parkway contemplates
the relocation of the CEI Power
Lines in advance of when such relocation is reasonably necessary for
Airport safety or efficiency, Brook
Park may elect to assume Cleveland’s obligations identified in Paragraphs 7.5.2 and 7.5.3 above, in
which case Cleveland shall reimburse Brook Park for any reasonable costs and expenses incurred by
Brook Park in assuming such obligations. Any costs and expenses not
reimbursed within two years of the
date they are incurred by Brook
Park shall be reimbursed with interest thereon at a rate of 4.8 percent
per annum from the date on which
Brook Park invoices Cleveland for
such costs and expenses. In any
event, such costs and expenses shall
be reimbursed no later than such
time as relocation of the CEI Power
Lines would have been necessary
for airport safety or efficiency.
7.5.5 Responsibility for Planning
and
Design.
Brook
Park
shall
assume responsibility for all planning, design, engineering, and construction activities associated with
the relocation. Cleveland shall reimburse Brook Park for all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred in connection
with
this
relocation
as
described in Paragraph 7.5.3 above.
7.6 Environmental Review. The
Cities will allocate as follows the
responsibility for complying, to the
extent mandated by law, with any
requirements for state and federal
environmental review, approval, and
permitting that may be associated
with the implementation of this
Agreement:
7.6.1 Brook Park shall assume
responsibility for any such requirements associated with the completion of Aerospace Parkway and the
relocation of the CEI Power Lines,
including any required review under
NEPA or section 404 of the Clean
Water Act.
7.6.2
Cleveland
shall
assume

153

9
responsibility for any such requirements associated with implementing
the Airport expansion depicted on
the Submitted ALP, including any
required review under NEPA or section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
7.6.3 With regard to each set of
requirements
described
in
Paragraphs 7.6.1 and 7.6.2 above, each
City shall support fully the process
of complying with the other City’s
mandatory environmental requirements, and shall take such reasonable actions as the City bearing
responsibility
for
each
set
of
requirements requests in furtherance of such compliance, including
providing site access, and providing
access to City staffs and consultants.

annum, computed from the Closing
Date. Brook Park shall have the
right at any time or from time to
time to prepay the total amount
then due in whole or in part, together with accrued interest on the principal so prepaid. In the event Cleveland makes prepayments as provided in Paragraph 9.1 above, Brook

shall remain in full force and effect
unless and until terminated by written agreement of both Cities.
13.2 Amendment. This Agreement
may be altered, amended or modified only by a written instrument
executed pursuant to the governmental consent of both Brook Park
and Cleveland. Neither this Agreement, nor any term hereof, may be
changed, modified or abandoned, in
whole or in part, except by instrument in writing.
13.3 Costs Related to Agreement.
The parties acknowledge that preparation and implementation of this
Agreement has required them to
incur various costs and expenses for
consultants and other items associated with the preparation of the
Appendices to this Agreement. The
parties agree that they will share
those costs listed on Appendix 18
(the “Shared Costs”) on an equal
basis, and that they shall reconcile
their respective expenditures related
to the Shared Costs on the Closing
Date. To the extent that any such
expenditures are incurred after the
Closing Date or such expenditures
are incurred before the Closing Date
but invoices therefore are not available until after the Closing Date or
the Closing Date does not occur, the
parties
shall
take
appropriate
actions to insure that they have reconciled such Shared Costs so that
they are shared on an equal basis.
13.4 Timing for Each City is Independent. Each City shall determine
in its sole discretion the appropriate
timing for the implementation of
those elements of this Agreement
that will occur within such City’s
New Boundaries after the Closing
Date, including, but not limited to,
the completion of Aerospace Parkway, and the development activities
planned or undertaken at the Airport. Such determinations shall be
made based on those factors which
such City deems relevant, without
regard to the timing of any development activities planned or undertaken in the other City. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties

155

11
acknowledge that time is of the
essence in relocation of the CEI
Power Lines.
13.5 Enforcement.
13.5.1 The parties acknowledge
and agree that damages as a result
of any breach of this Agreement by
either party are not readily ascertainable, that money damages or
other legal relief will not adequately compensate for any such breach,
and that the party which has not
breached this Agreement is entitled
to injunctive relief compelling the
specific performance of those obligations under this Agreement. The
parties further acknowledge that
the breach of any of the provisions
of this Agreement would constitute
irreparable harm to the other party,
and each party hereby waives any
defenses to the grant of a temporary
restraining order related to any
such breach.
13.5.2 Subject to Paragraphs 13.7
and 13.8 below, Cleveland or Brook
Park, as the case may be, may pursue all remedies now or hereafter
existing at law or in equity to collect all amounts due or to become
due under this Agreement and to
enforce the performance and observance of any obligation of either
party under this Agreement. All
remedies shall be cumulative and
not exclusive of one another or of
statutory remedies not specifically
referenced herein. The exercise of
any one or more remedies described
above in this Paragraph 13.5.2, or of
any one or more remedies existing
at law, in equity or by statute, shall
not constitute a waiver or election
with respect to any other available
remedy. No delay or omission to
exercise any right or power accruing upon any default shall impair
that right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver thereof, but
any such right and power may be
exercised from time to time and as
often as may be deemed expedient.
13.5.3 The parties further acknowledge that the numerous executory
promises
provided
for
in
this
Agreement
necessitate
different
remedies for enforcement of different provisions of this Agreement.
Accordingly, any court seeking to
enforce the provisions of this Agreement shall look first to any enforcement provisions contained in the
section of the Agreement that contains the provision in question and
then to this Paragraph 13.
13.5.4 The parties further acknowledge that changes in circumstances
shall not forgive compliance with
the terms of this Agreement.
13.6 Remedies. Venue for any and
all legal actions regarding this
Agreement or any of its parts shall
lie in the Court of Common Pleas,
Cuyahoga County, Ohio.
13.7 Notice of Default; Informal
Dispute Resolution. At no time shall
Brook Park or Cleveland be deemed
to be in default under this Agreement unless and until notice has
been provided in writing specifying
such default (“Notice of Default”).
Immediately
after
receipt
of
a
Notice of Default, the respective
Directors of Law of the Cities shall
meet and attempt to resolve the matter. If they fail to resolve the matter within 10 days after delivery of
the Notice of Default, the Mayors of
each City shall forthwith appoint a
representative expert in the matters
in dispute. The designated representatives shall meet and attempt to
resolve the matter and shall deliver
their joint or separate reports within 30 days after delivery of the

12
Notice of Default. If they fail to

Whereas, on March 8, 1996, this

the Office of the Mayor of the City
of Cleveland has found and determined that the goals set forth in

Whereas, these new goals for the

prepared by the Director of the
Office of Equal Opportunity and
have been submitted to this Council
for consideration; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 231-97.
By Councilmen Westbrook and
Robinson.
An emergency resolution urging
Governor George V. Voinovich to
direct
the
Ohio
Department
of
Human Services to implement the
approved waiver of the food stamp
cutoff provision in the federal welfare law.
Whereas, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 contains a provision that limits single, childless,
unemployed workers to eligibility
for food stamp benefits for three
months during a three-year period;
and
Whereas, Congress added provisions to allow states to apply for a
waiver of the provision in areas of
high unemployment or insufficient
jobs; and
Whereas, the State of Ohio has
applied for and received a waiver
for areas within the State, including
the City of Cleveland, that have
been deemed surplus labor areas by
the United States Department of
Labor; and
Whereas,
these
surplus
labor
areas had unemployment rates that
exceeded the national average by
20% during the years 1994 and 1995;
and
Whereas, without the implementation of the approved waiver, approximately 11,000 Cleveland residents
will lose their food stamp benefits
within a few weeks; the economic
value of these food stamp benefits
to Cleveland residents is estimated
at $8 million; and
Whereas, the implementation of
the approved waiver will not interfere with the State of Ohio’s ability
to enforce strict work requirements
for food stamp recipients; and
Whereas, the population which

February 12, 1997
will be affected if the waiver is not
implementation is very poor with little or no safety net available to
them; nearly half of the persons subjected to the proposed time limit
receive no benefits other than food
stamps.
Forty
percent
of
those
affected are women, one-third are
over the age of 40, and many are
veterans or are homeless; now,
therefor,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby
urges
Governor
George
V.
Voinovich to direct the Ohio Department of Human Services to implement the waiver of the food stamp
cutoff provision in the federal welfare law.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to Governor
George V. Voinovich and to the

Human Services.

measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,

allowed by law.

ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the

to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good

on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
