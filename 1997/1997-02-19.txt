ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 231-97.
By Councilmen Westbrook and
Robinson.
An emergency resolution urging
Governor George V. Voinovich to
direct
the
Ohio
Department
of
Human Services to implement the
approved waiver of the food stamp
cutoff provision in the federal welfare law.
Whereas, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 contains a provision that limits single, childless,
unemployed workers to eligibility
for food stamp benefits for three
months during a three-year period;
and
Whereas, Congress added provisions to allow states to apply for a
waiver of the provision in areas of
high unemployment or insufficient
jobs; and
Whereas, the State of Ohio has
applied for and received a waiver
for areas within the State, including
the City of Cleveland, that have
been deemed surplus labor areas by
the United States Department of
Labor; and
Whereas,
these
surplus
labor
areas had unemployment rates that
exceeded the national average by
20% during the years 1994 and 1995;
and
Whereas, without the implementation of the approved waiver, approximately 11,000 Cleveland residents
will lose their food stamp benefits
within a few weeks; the economic
value of these food stamp benefits
to Cleveland residents is estimated
at $8 million; and
Whereas, the implementation of
the approved waiver will not interfere with the State of Ohio’s ability
to enforce strict work requirements
for food stamp recipients; and
Whereas, the population which
will be affected if the waiver is not
implementation is very poor with
little or no safety net available to
them; nearly half of the persons subjected to the proposed time limit
receive no benefits other than food
stamps.
Forty
percent
of
those
affected are women, one-third are
over the age of 40, and many are
veterans or are homeless; now,
therefor,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby
urges
Governor
George
V.
Voinovich to direct the Ohio Depart-

192

February 19, 1997

cutoff provision in the federal welfare law.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to Governor
George V. Voinovich and to the
Director of the Ohio Department of
Human Services.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency

the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

An emergency resolution objecting to the stock transfer of a C2,

Permit to Permit No. 9125555, Two
N. Inc., dba Convenient Food Mart
3112, 5910 Detroit Avenue, Cleveland,
Ohio 44102; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, safety
and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of

all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
