Sweeney, Melena and Rybka.
An emergency resolution calling
on Auditor of State James Petro to
perform
an
Independent
Special
Audit on improper transfers of City
funds.
Whereas, approximately $617,000.00
of City of Cleveland taxpayers funds
were improperly given to Black on
Black Crime, Inc. and the City has
not fully recovered all of said taxpayers funds; and
Whereas, on at least two separate
occasions, City of Cleveland taxpayer funds totaling $66,000.00 were
improperly transferred to Ohio City
Near West Development Corporation; and
Whereas, approximately $35,000.00
of additional City of Cleveland taxpayer funds were improperly transferred to Detroit-Shoreway Corp.;
and
Whereas, approximately $14,500.00
of additional taxpayer funds were
improperly transferred to UnionMiles Development Corporation; and
Whereas, it has not been fully
determined whether or not these
amounts represent the only taxpayer funds that have been improperly
transferred by the Department of

and
Whereas,
pursuant
to
Section
118.02(A) of the Ohio Revised Code,

purpose of the state to require fiscal integrity of municipal corporations so that they may provide for
the health, safety, and welfare of
their citizens, pay when due principal and interest on their debt obligations, meet financial obligations to
their employees, vendors, and suppliers and provide for proper financial accounting procedures, budgeting, and taxing practice. The failure
of a municipal corporation to so act
is
hereby
determined
to
affect
adversely the health, safety, and
welfare not of the people of the
municipal corporation but also of
other people of the State”;
Now, therefore, be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council does
hereby record its concern over the
improper
transfer
of
taxpayers
funds and does hereby call upon the
Auditor of the State of Ohio, James
M. Petro, to perform an independent
audit and/or an independent investigation
of
the
Department
of
Finance of the City of Cleveland,
including the procedures followed
by the Division of Accounts within
thirty (30) days from the passage of
this resolution.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby is directed to
transmit a certified copy of this resolution to the Auditor of the State
of Ohio, James M. Petro, at 88 East
Broad Street, Columbus, Ohio 43215.
