certain tangible personal property

to purchase machinery and equipment for its facility which will be
located in the Cleveland Industrial

Whereas, pursuant to Ordinance
No. 948-95, passed June 19, 1995, this
Council designated an area which is
in
the
City
of
Cleveland
and
described in File No. 948-95-A, as the

Area
Enterprise
Zone
(the “Zone”) pursuant to Chapter
5709 of the Ohio Revised Code; and
Whereas, in August, 1995, the
Director of Development of the State
of Ohio determined that the Zone
contains the characteristics set forth
in Section 5709.61(A) of the Revised
Code and certified said area as an
“Urban Jobs and Enterprise Zone”

Revised Code; and
Whereas,
NorthStar
Equipment
Corp. (the “Enterprise”) has proposed to construct a new facility
and to purchase machinery and
equipment for its facility to be located in the Cleveland Industrial Park;
and
Whereas, the Enterprise has certified to the City that, but for abatement of personal property and real
estate taxes the Enterprise would be
at a competitive disadvantage by
operating at this location; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure in that
the same provides for the immediate
preservation of the public peace,
safety, property, and welfare and for
the further reason that its enactment
is a necessary prerequisite to providing immediate assistance to create and preserve job opportunities
and advance and promote commercial and economic development in the
City of Cleveland, such assistance
being immediately necessary or such
jobs will be lost; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

of
NorthStar Equipment Corp., or its
designee(s), provided that said designee(s) is wholly owned by NorthStar Equipment Corp. for enterprise
zone incentives on the basis that
NorthStar Equipment Corp. is qualified by financial responsibility and
business experience to create and
preserve employment opportunities
in the Cleveland Area Enterprise
Zone and to improve the economic
climate of the City of Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Director of Economic Development is authorized to
enter into an Enterprise Zone Agreement
with
NorthStar
Equipment
Corp., or its designee(s), provided
that said designee(s) is wholly
owned by NorthStar Equipment Corp.
to provide for a ten (10) year abatement for certain tangible personal
property and real estate taxes as an
incentive to construct a new facility
and to purchase machinery and
equipment at their facility which
will be located in the Cleveland
Industrial
Park;
said
abatement
shall not be transferrable or assignable by the enterprise to any entity
without the prior authorization by
this council, and said abatement
shall be subject to annual review of
the Tax Incentive Review Council.
Section 3. That the terms of said
tax abatement shall be in accordance with the terms as set forth in
the Executive Summary contained
in File No. 334-97-A.

May 28, 1997
On page (4) of said Executive
Summary, “development recommendation” number three (3) is deleted
in its entirety, and the following
provision is inserted in its place:
That NorthStar Equipment Corporation shall use its best efforts to
employ 25% of the new hires from
Ward 1, and the remainder of City
of Cleveland hires from other City
wards.
Section 4. That the Director of
Economic Development is hereby
authorized to charge and accept fees
in an amount not to exceed the maximum allowable under Chapter 5709
of the Revised Code and such funds
are hereby appropriated for the purposes set forth in Chapter 5709 of
the Revised Code. Such fees shall be
deposited to and expended from
Fund No. 17 SF 305, Loan Fees Fund
including provisions prohibiting (a)
the Enterprise from assigning or
transferring its rights under the
Agreement to any entity without
first
receiving
the
approval
of

exemption from taxation for real or
tangible personal property (including

revenue that the Cleveland City

same ordinance, resolution, or section thereof requires the owner of
the improvement or the City of
Cleveland or the owner and the City
together, to reimburse in a timely
manner the Cleveland City School
District General Fund for the full
amount of property taxes that would
have been payable to the Cleveland
City School District had the improvement not been exempted from taxation, dollar for dollar, with payments to be due and legally enforceable at the same time and in the
same manner as the taxes that they
purport to replace. This limitation
shall not apply to ordinances or resolutions or sections thereof solely
for the benefit of owner occupied
property improved by new construction, renovations, or additions of single and/or double houses for a period not to exceed seven (7) years.
Section 7. That for the reasons
