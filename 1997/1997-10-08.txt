the funds in question that amounts
to approximately $42,655, and;
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has commissioned a thorough comprehensive audit to review all of the
activities and finances of Hough

By Councilman Lewis.
An emergency resolution urging
the Secretary of HUD to delay the
implementation
of
the
housing
policy that will eliminate Section 8
benefits to landlords owning building that provide housing for Section
8 recipients until replacement housing units can be found.
Whereas, the Department of Housing and Urban Development is in
the process of initiating a policy
that will eliminate Section 8 benefits to landlords owning buildings
that provide housing to Section 8
recipients and providing such with
a certificate voucher to seek housing on their own, and;
Whereas, the Hough neighborhood
contains a large number of buildings
where landlords receive benefits for
providing housing for Section 8
recipients and such policy will result
in many
of these buildings to
become vacant adversely affecting
the Ward 7 Hough community and;
Whereas, Section 8 recipients will
be forced to find landlords willing
to accept certificate vouchers in
order to find suitable housing, and;
Whereas, this policy by HUD will
create a housing hardship on welfare
recipients since many landlords will
refuse to accept certificate vouchers
because of their concerns over delay
of payment thus worsening the housing plight for the disadvantaged and
Whereas, there have been no
efforts made in addressing the problems that Section 8 recipients will
encounter in tying to find suitable
available housing in the City of
Cleveland by the Department of
Housing and Urban Development,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Secretary of HUD to delay the
implementation of this policy until
replacement housing units and facilities can be found for Section 8
recipients who will be displaced
under this program.

Res. No. 278-97.
By Councilmen Zone Gordon, Melena, Moran, Westbrook, Polensek,
Coats, Lewis, Robinson and Patmon.
An emergency resolution urging
adoption of a policy against purchasing, leasing, renting, or taking
on consignment goods for use and
for resale by City-owned enterprises
that are produced under sweatshop
conditions.
Whereas, goods and products are
being produced under sweatshop
conditions both in the United States
and abroad; and
Whereas, other cities have adopted policies of not purchasing, leasing, renting or taking on consignment and for use or for resale at
City-owned enterprises which were
produced under sweatshop
conditions; and
Whereas, it is the desire of this
Council to support fair humane
labor practices around the world by
not transacting or trading in goods
or products produced under sweatshop conditions; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that this Council is
greatly
concerned
and
strongly
deplores worker exploitation which
is contrary to fair humane labor
practices; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Administration to establish a
policy of not purchasing, leasing,
renting or taking on consignment
goods for use or for resale at Cityowned enterprises which were pro-

The City Record

50
duced and said policy should incorporate the following points:
A. The factory does not employ
anybody younger than the legal age
for children to work in the country
in which the factory is located, and
regardless of the legal age, does not
employ anybody younger than age
15.
B. The factory does not use forced
labor of any kind - prison labor,
indentured labor or bonded labor.
C. The factory pays a wage which
enables its employees to meet their
basic needs for food, shelter, clothing and medical care and to set
aside money for future purchases.
The factory also provides all benefits required by law in their country and compensates workers for
overtime.
D. Employees are not required to
work more than 48 hours per week
or less if the law of the country in
which the factory is located sets a
shorter work week.
E. The factory is a workplace free
from physical, sexual or verbal
harassment. Employees have the

right to speak up about conditions
in the factory without fear of retaliation and have the right to form
unions of their own choosing without employer intimidation.
F. The factory provides a safe and
healthy working environment.
Section 2. That this Council further urges the Administration to
prohibit, to the extent possible, the
purchase, lease, rental or taking on
consignment of goods for use or for
resale at City-owned enterprises
which were produced under sweatshop conditions.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
