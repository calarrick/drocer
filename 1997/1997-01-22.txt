of Control Resolution No. 847-96,
adopted November 27, 1996, the City
of Cleveland is authorized to enter
into a contract with Interstate Gas
Supply, Inc. (Interstate) for the furnishing of natural gas for a one (1)
year term commencing December 1,
1996 and terminating November 30,
1997 for the various divisions of City
government; and
Whereas, the price to be charged
to the City per thousand cubic feet
(MCF) of natural gas is the commodity price per MCF of natural gas
on
the
New
York
Mercantile
Exchange (NYMEX) plus an incremental amount bid by Interstate;
and
Whereas, the commodity price per
MCF of natural gas on the NYMEX
is currently higher than the price of
natural gas being charged to the
City by The East Ohio Gas Company (EOG) and will remain higher
until approximately April 1, 1997,
thus making it more costly for the
City to purchase natural gas from
Interstate until the latter date; and

Interstate has requested the consent
of the City to the assignment of the
contract to EOG for the contract
period
from
December
1,
1996
through March 31, 1997 or such earlier date as the Director of Finance
determines will result in the most
advantageous price to the City for

the request of Interstate Gas Supply,
Inc. for consent of the City to the
assignment of the contract with
Interstate to The East Ohio Gas
Company for the period from December 1, 1996 through March 31, 1997
or such earlier date as the Director
of Finance determines will result in
the most advantageous price to the
City for natural gas is hereby
approved.
Be it further resolved that the
Director of Finance is hereby authorized to complete and execute all
documents necessary and appropriate to effect the consent to assignment hereby approved.
