By Councilman Westbrook (by

An emergency resolution requesting the County Auditor to make tax
advances during the year 1998, pursuant to Section 321.34, Ohio Revised
Code.
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the County Auditor be and he hereby is requested to
draw, and the County Treasurer to

Res. No. 2089-97.
By Councilmen Polensek, Smith,
Robinson, Britt, Lewis, Rybka, Zone
and Skrha.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Board of Pharmacy and the
Ohio legislature to reclassify the
controlled substance Rohypnol, also
known as the date rape drug, to a
Schedule 1 ~depressant which will
allow for stricter enforcement and
penalties.
Whereas,
Rohypnol
(flunitrazepam) is a prescription sleeping aid
that is currently classified as a
Schedule IV drug under Chapter 3719
of the Ohio Revised Code; and
Whereas, there have been increasing reports of Rohypnol being illegally diverted into the United States
and illicitly sold. It is reported that
Rohypnol is being put in women’s
drinks and then a rape occurs without the woman remembering because
of the amnesia effect the drug has
on the person taking it; and
Whereas,
the majority
of
the
reports of diversion and illicit use
have been in southern Florida and
Texas; and
Whereas, the Florida legislature
have taken appropriate steps to
reclassify Rohypnol as a Schedule 1
depressant and the federal government, through the Food and Drug
Administration, is also considering
reclassifying the drug as a Schedule
1 drug under the Federal Controlled
Substance Act;
Now, therefore, be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio Board of Pharmacy and the
Ohio legislature to evaluate the
reclassification of the controlled
substance Rohypnol, also known as
the date rape drug, to a Schedule 1
depressant from its current classification as a Schedule IV depressant,

1983

especially in light of the reports of
its use in cases of date rape and the
actions to reclassify it by the FDA
and the State of Florida.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council transmit copies of this resolution
to the Ohio Board of Pharmacy and
the Cuyahoga County delegation of
the Ohio State legislature.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

ownership of a C1 and C2 Liquor
Permit to 552 East 152nd Street &
Gas Pumps, and repealing Res. No.
1534-97, objecting to said transfer of
ownership.
Whereas, this Council objected to
the transfer of ownership of a C1
and C2 Liquor Permit to 552 East
152nd Street & Gas Pumps, by Res.
No. 1534-97, adopted August 13, 1997;
and
Whereas, this Council wishes to
withdraw its objection to the above
transfer of ownership and consents
to said transfer of ownership; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

14
Section 1. That objection to the
transfer of ownership of a C1 and
C2 Liquor Permit to 552 East 152nd
Street & Gas Pumps, be and the
same is hereby withdrawn and Res.
No. 1534-97, containing said objection, be and the same is hereby
repealed and that this Council consents to the immediate transfer of
ownership thereof.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted November 24, 1997.
Effective December 2, 1997.
Res. No. 2116-97.
By Councilman Coats.
An emergency resolution urging
President Clinton to veto HR Bill
1534, relating to local land use
issues.
Whereas, this Council opposes HR
1534, the so called taking legislation; and
Whereas, HR 1534 will seriously
impair the ability of local governments and agencies to protect the
public health, safety and environment of their respective citizenry;
and
Whereas,
under
current
law,
developers are first required to pursue all local remedies, including
negotiating
with
local
zoning
boards to reach mutually acceptable
agreements that satisfy both the
developer and community residents
before proceeding into court; and
Whereas, unless vetoed, HR 1534
will permit developers to proceed to
federal court to challenge local land
use and zoning determinations without first having to exhaust their
local administrative remedies or
being required to pursue a state
court appeal;
Now, therefore, be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges President
Clinton to veto HR 1534 for the reasons set forth in the above “Whereas” clauses.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council transmit a copy of this resolution
to President Clinton, Senators Glenn
and DeWine, and Representatives
Stokes and Kucinich.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted November 24, 1997.
Effective December 2, 1997.
Res. No. 2117-97.
By Councilman Rybka.
An emergency resolution to nominate the Cuyahoga River as an
American Heritage River.
Whereas, President Clinton recently announced a national initiative to designate ten rivers in the
United States as American Heritage
Rivers; and
Whereas, the Cuyahoga River has
a unique history and status as a

The City Record
symbol of America’s environmental
recovery that makes it an ideal candidate for designation as an “American Heritage River” by the President of the United States; and
Whereas, this designation would
qualify the Cuyahoga River for
focused federal attention to assist
the community in implementing its
vision for the river without imposing additional federal regulations;
and
Whereas, this effort will require
broad-based community support to
be successful;
Now, therefore, be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland concludes that the
Cuyahoga River has a unique history and status as a symbol of America’s environmental recovery that
makes it an ideal candidate for designation as an “American Heritage
River” by the President of the United States.
Section 2. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland endorses the initiative seeking to designate the
Cuyahoga River as an “American
Heritage River” and hereby requests
favorable action by President Clinton.
Section 3. That local communities
and other interested parities are
encouraged to endorse this designation as a sign of broad public support for the Cuyahoga River as a
model for community based environmental restoration.
Section 4. That the Clerk of Council transmit a copy of this resolution
to President Clinton, Senators Glenn
and DeWine, and Representatives
Stokes and Kucinich and other
appropriate federal, state and local
agencies.
Section 5. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
