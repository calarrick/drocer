Section 443.261 Drivers’ Expenses
Capped; Reporting.
(a) Finding. This Council finds
that the wages earned by drivers of
public hacks are inadequate to
insure a sufficient number of taxicabs and capable drivers, and that
the public convenience and necessity require the imposition of a cap
on the expenses paid by drivers of
public hacks.
(b) Definitions. As used in this
section: “Drivers’ expenses” means
all costs, expenses and fees paid by
drivers to a company, association or
independent
operator
currently
charged or hereafter established for
the lease of a public hack, and
includes, by way of example and not
by way of limitation, the costs of
the lease itself, insurance and fuel.
“Base rates” means the drivers’
expenses charged by a company,
association or independent operator
to its drivers on the date of introduction of the ordinance enacting
this section.
(c) Drivers’ Expenses Capped.
For the period commencing on the
effective date of this ordinance and
ending on December 31, 1997, a company, association or independent
operator shall not increase its drivers’ expenses over the “base rates”
as defined in division (b) of this
section. For the two-year period
commencing on January 1, 1998, a
company, association or independent
operator shall not increase its drivers expenses over the “base rates”
as defined in division (b) of this
section. For the two-year period
commencing on January 1, 1998, a
company.”

The City Record
In the case of fuel only, changes
in the market price of the commodity may be passed along to drivers,
and any such increase shall not be
counted toward the percentage caps
imposed by this division. Overhead
costs associated with the sale of
fuel by a company, association or
independent operator are subject to
the caps imposed by this division.
(d) Reporting. Within ten (10)
days after the effective date of this
section, each company, association
or independent operator shall submit a schedule of its base rates as
defined in division (b) of this section.
On or before December 31 in each
year subsequent to the effective
date of this section, each company,
association or independent operator
shall submit its then current schedule
of
rates,
identifying
any
changes in drivers’ expenses. The
requirements of this paragraph are
satisfied by the company, association or independent operator by a
certification
of
the
percentage
change in drivers’ expenses from
the previous reporting period.
All reports required by this section shall be certified by an affidavit of the owner of the company,
association or independent operator,
on such forms as the Commissioner
of Assessments and Licenses shall
prescribe.
Section 4. Non-severability. This
Council finds that an increase in
meter rates serve the public convenience and necessity only if the
caps on drivers’ expenses identified
in Section 443.261 of the Codified
Ordinances are imposed. Accordingly, the provisions of this ordinance
shall not be severable, and the
invalidation of any portion of this
ordinance shall result in the invalidation of the entire ordinance.

the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended by this
