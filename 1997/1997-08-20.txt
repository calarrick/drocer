Whereas, this Council finds that
certain types of uses have a negative secondary effect on the ares in
which
they
are
located,
which
effects are increased if these uses
are concentrated together;
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
shares its borders with many other
jurisdictions;
Whereas, some of these certain
types of uses are located outside of
the City of Cleveland, but near to
its borders;
Whereas, this Council desires to
restrict the impact of the negative
secondary effects by regulating the
concentration of these uses, even if
a use is located across the City’s
jurisdictional boundary;
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of

Section 331.04 Measurement
In all instances where this Zoning
Code requires a separation of use
districts, lots, buildings or uses by
a specified distance, such distance
shall be measured in a geometrically straight line using a scaled map,
or a survey if deemed necessary.
Unless otherwise specified in this
Zoning Code, such line shall be measured to run from the nearest point
on the nearest lot line of the lot or
lots upon which the regulated use
and any accessory parking are
located to either the nearest point
on the nearest lot line of the lot or
lots upon which a use and any
accessory parking are located from
which the regulated use is required
to be separated or the nearest point
on the nearest boundary of the district from which the regulated use
is required to be separated, whichever terminal point is applicable. Such
measurement shall be made without
regard to intervening structures,
objects, uses, the street grid, landforms, waterways, or any other topographic feature. The calculation and
application of distance requirements
for separation of uses shall consider uses across the City’s boundary
in the application of divisions (c)(3)
and (4) of Section 347.07. division
(b) of Section 347.12, and division

authority to enter into such an
agreement.

shall apply only to land or property
located within the districts hereafter
described and thereafter referred to

this section, a “surface parking lot”
is an off-street parking area which
is located at street-grade level and
which is not enclosed within a
garage structure. The unenclosed
roof surface of a garage shall not
be considered a “surface parking
lot” if such surface is located at
least one story above grade level on

other provisions of the Zoning Code,
no surface parking lot shall be established or expanded within the designated districts except as approved by
the City Planning Commission in
accordance with this section.
(e) Planning Commission Determination. The City Planning Commission shall approve building permit applications for the establishment or expansion of surface parking lots in the designated districts
only in accordance with the following provisions:
(1) Temporary Parking Lots. If
the City Planning Commission or
Landmarks Commission, as applicable, has approved demolition of a
building within the designated district(s) and has approved, in accordance with the regulations of Sections 341.04 and 341.05 or Section
161.05, as applicable, plans for a new
building or other non-parking use to
replace such building, the subject
property may be used as a surface
parking lot for a maximum period of
one (1) year following the demolition of the building. If all necessary
redevelopment
permits
have
not
been obtained within one year of the
commencement of surface parking
use, the property shall be landscaped
as open space or shall be converted
to another appropriate non-parking
use in accordance with a site plan
approved by the Commission.
The Commission may, however,
approve a request by the owner to
extend use of the parking lot for a
single period not greater than one
(1) year in duration if the Commission determines that the owner has
made a “good faith effort” to secure
the approved redevelopment. During
the time period of such extension,
the Commission and the owner shall
undertake
discussions
regarding
efforts to facilitate appropriate redevelopment of the property. At the
conclusion of the extension period,
the property either shall be landscaped as open space or shall be
converted to another appropriate
non-parking use in accordance with
a site plan approved by the Commission or, alternatively, the owner
may seek a variance from the Board
of Zoning Appeals in accordance
with the provisions of division (h)
of this section.
(2) Accessory Parking. Establishment or expansion of a surface
parking lot within the designated
districts shall be permitted if the
City Planning Commission deter-

1454

August 20, 1997
mines that the lot will be used
exclusively for accessory parking
spaces to serve a new use or uses
proposed for a development, expansion
or
redevelopment
project
which has been approved by the
City Planning Commission or Landmarks Commission, as applicable,
but which has not yet been completed. The number of parking
spaces in such accessory lot shall
not be greater than 120% of the
number of spaces which would be
required for such use by the City’s
Zoning Code.
(3) Action Areas. The City Planning Commission shall approve an
application for a surface parking lot
if the subject property has been designated for surface parking as part
of an “action area” (as defined in
Section 315.03) of a community
development plan adopted by Council in the manner set forth in Title
V of the Codified Ordinances.
(4) Vacant Lots. On any vacant
lot which was vacant on the initial
effective date of this section, a surface parking lot shall be permitted,
in accordance with all applicable
City regulations.
(f) Existing Surface Lots. Within
the
designated
districts,
surface
parking lots legally established or
approved prior to the initial effective date of this section shall be considered legal nonconforming uses
and may be maintained, repaired
and improved in accordance with
otherwise applicable City regulations. No such lot shall be expanded without approval of the City
Planning Commission, in accordance
with the provisions of this section.
(g) Variances for Establishment
of Parking Lots. In the case of a
request for a variance to permit
establishment of a surface parking
lot which is prohibited by regulations of this section, the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall grant such
variance only if it determines that
denial of the variance would deprive
the owner of all reasonable economic use of the subject property.
In making this determination, the
Board may seek the advice of
experts in relevant fields and shall
consider the potential for long-term
as well as short term economic gain.
(h) Variances for Temporary Lots.
In the case of a request for a variance to extend the use of a parking
lot approved under division (e) (1)
of this section, the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall grant such extension
only if it determines that redevelopment of the subject property has
been
delayed
by
circumstances
which are beyond the control of the
owner and which would be present
regardless of the particular ownership of the property. In such cases,
the Board shall not grant an extension for a period greater than one
(1) year in duration. The property
owner may return to the Board for
consideration of further extensions
if said circumstances persist
Section 2. That existing Section
349.14 of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as enacted by
Ordinance No. 1876-94, passed February 27, 1995, is hereby repealed.
Section 3. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it

located
at
308
Euclid Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio,
has been a retail business in the
Downtown Cleveland Community for
almost seventy-five (75) years of its
one-hundred-eighteen (118) years in
business; and is of considerable historical and commemorative value to
the Downtown Residents and Community; and
Whereas, the Downtown Woolworth Store has been a source of
community
convenience,
employment,
economy,

product
availability, service, assistance, customer satisfaction; and
Whereas, our Woolworth’s is the
last remaining variety store of its
class and caliber in the Downtown
Cleveland Community and should be
allowed to continue to serve Clevelanders now, and in the future; and
Whereas, Woolworth’s is the place
where native Clevelanders and Outof-Town Tourists and Visitors find
a
familiar
“Welcome’’
sight
on
Euclid Avenue; and
Whereas, the liquidation and permanent closing of our Woolworth
Store will cause a hardship to the
Downtown
Cleveland
Community,
Residents, and Economy by the loss
of
approximately
100-jobs;
now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges

An emergency resolution urging
the striking United Parcel Service
(UPS) workers and UPS to bargain
in good faith on issues such as the
use of part-time workers, stronger
pension, health and safety benefits,
higher pay, and restrictions on nonunionized subcontractors.
Whereas, On Monday, August 4, a
strike began at UPS when the
185,000 Teamsters Members at UPS
walked off the job in protest of
employment issues, particularly the
use of part-time workers and nonunionized subcontractors; and
Whereas, the strike affects the
lives of thousands of UPS employees, millions of UPS customers, and
impacts on the U.S. economy to the
extent that 5 percent of the gross
national product will not be moving;
now therefore,
Whereas,
Part-time
employees
make up 60 percent of the UPS
workforce and often pull double
four hour shifts for an average
$10.50 an hour in part-time pay thus
saving UPS a tremendous amount of
money in labor costs, as opposed to
full time employees who can earn a
top wage of $20.52 an hour; and
Whereas, UPS made $1 billion dollars in profits in 1996 because of the
hard work of UPS employees who
deliver 12 million packages a day,
or about 80% of domestic parcel
deliveries; and
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council calls
upon all parties to bargain in good
faith on issues such as the use of
part-time workers, stronger pension,
health and safety benefits, higher
pay for part-time workers that will
result in strong stable incomes, and
restrictions on non-unionized subcontractors.
Section 2. That this Council strongly urges UPS to recognize these
important issues in order to create
an equitable working environment
that will ensure the human rights of
all UPS employees as well as building strong stable communities.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby be directed to
transmit a certified copy of this resolution to the International Brotherhood of the Teamsters, and to the
President and CEO of United Parcel
Service.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two thirds of
all members elected to Council, it
shall be in force immediately upon

officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the

respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public

order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation

the
Downtown
Woolworth
Store at 308 Euclid Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio open.
Whereas, The F. W. Woolworth
Company
Store,
located
at
308
Euclid Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio,
has been a retail business in the
Downtown Cleveland Community for
almost seventy-five (75) years of its
one-hundred-eighteen (118) years in
business; and is of considerable historical and commemorative value to
the Downtown Residents and Community; and
Whereas, the Downtown Woolworth Store has been a source of
community
convenience,
employment,
economy,
variety,
product
availability, service, assistance, customer satisfaction; and
Whereas, our Woolworth’s is the
last remaining variety store of its
class and caliber in the Downtown
Cleveland Community and should be
allowed to continue to serve Clevelanders now, and in the future; and
Whereas, Woolworth’s is the place
where native Clevelanders and Outof-Town Tourists and Visitors find
a
familiar
“Welcome’’
sight
on
Euclid Avenue; and
Whereas, the liquidation and permanent closing of our Woolworth
Store will cause a hardship to the
Downtown

now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges

An emergency resolution urging
the striking United Parcel Service
(UPS) workers and UPS to bargain
in good faith on issues such as the
use of part-time workers, stronger
pension, health and safety benefits,
higher pay, and restrictions on nonunionized subcontractors.
Whereas, On Monday, August 4, a
strike began at UPS when the
185,000 Teamsters Members at UPS
walked off the job in protest of
employment issues, particularly the
use of part-time workers and nonunionized subcontractors; and
Whereas, the strike affects the
lives of thousands of UPS employees, millions of UPS customers, and
impacts on the U.S. economy to the
extent that 5 percent of the gross
national product will not be moving;
now therefore,
Whereas,
Part-time
employees
make up 60 percent of the UPS
workforce and often pull double
four hour shifts for an average
$10.50 an hour in part-time pay thus
saving UPS a tremendous amount of
money in labor costs, as opposed to
full time employees who can earn a
top wage of $20.52 an hour; and
Whereas, UPS made $1 billion dollars in profits in 1996 because of the
hard work of UPS employees who
deliver 12 million packages a day,
or about 80% of domestic parcel
deliveries; and
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council calls
upon all parties to bargain in good
faith on issues such as the use of
part-time workers, stronger pension,
health and safety benefits, higher
pay for part-time workers that will
result in strong stable incomes, and
restrictions on non-unionized subcontractors.
Section 2. That this Council strongly urges UPS to recognize these
important issues in order to create
an equitable working environment
that will ensure the human rights of
all UPS employees as well as building strong stable communities.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby be directed to
transmit a certified copy of this resolution to the International Brotherhood of the Teamsters, and to the
President and CEO of United Parcel
Service.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two thirds of
all members elected to Council, it
shall be in force immediately upon
its adoption and approval by the
Mayor; otherwise it shall take effect
and be in force from and after the
earliest period allowed by law.

pay a portion of the costs of constructing a sports facility, including
the costs of demolition of Municipal
Stadium and site preparation therefor (the “Project”), including costs
of issuance of the Bonds, and to
retire any Notes provided in Section
8 hereof. The Director of Finance
shall
determine
the
principal
amount of the Bonds based on the
amount he determines is necessary
to pay costs of the Project and to
retire outstanding Notes in light of
the
anticipated
timing
of
the
issuance of any other obligations
and the amount of other moneys
available to pay costs of the Project.
The principal amount of the Bonds
issued shall be set forth in the certificate providing for the final terms
of the Bonds and signed by the

Terms Certificate, and shall be
issued in denominations of $5,000 or

of Current Interest Bonds maturing

of interest per year (computed on a
360-day per year basis) as shall be
specified by the Director of Finance

hereafter in this Section) in the
Final Terms Certificate; provided,

interest from the Closing Date at
the compounding rate or rates of

and payable at maturity, which will

Amounts payable at maturity, as
shall be determined by the Director
of Finance (subject to the parameters set forth hereafter in this Section) in the Final Terms Certificate;
provided, that the Capital Appreciation Bonds of any one stated maturity all shall bear the same compounding rate of interest. The total
interest accrued on any Capital
Appreciation Bond as of any particular date shall be an amount equal
to the amount by which the Compound Accreted Amount of that Capital Appreciation Bond exceeds the
original principal amount of that
Capital Appreciation Bond as of that
date. Capital Appreciation Bonds
shall
be
issued
in
Authorized
Denominations, but in no case as to
a particular maturity date exceeding the principal amount maturing
on that date.
The rate or rates of interest per
year to be borne by the Bonds, as
specified by the Director of Finance
in the Final Terms Certificate, shall
be such that the Bonds (taking into
account the Current Interest Bonds
and the Capital Appreciation Bonds,
if any) shall have a True Interest
Rate (as hereinafter defined) not
exceeding 10% per year, provided
that if the interest rate is not to be
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, the True
Interest Rate shall not exceed 12%.
As used in this paragraph, “True
Interest Rate” means the rate determined by doubling the semi-annual
interest rate, computed semi-annually, necessary to discount all payments of principal and interest on
the Bonds to the purchase price of
the Bonds, exclusive of any accrued
interest.
(d) Principal Maturities. Notwithstanding and as an exception to any
prior ordinance passed by this Council, the Bonds shall mature or be
payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements (as hereinafter defined and
described) as specified in the Final
Terms Certificate on the Principal
Payment Dates in the principal
amounts such that the total principal and interest payments on the
Bonds in any fiscal year in which
principal is payable (beginning with
the second such fiscal year) will not
be more than three times the total
of the principal and interest payments in the immediately preceding
year.
Consistent with the foregoing and
in accordance with his determination of the best interest of and
financial advantages to the City, the
Director of Finance shall specify in

August 20, 1997
the Final Terms Certificate (i) the
principal amount of Bonds, if any,
maturing or payable pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements on each Principal
Payment Date, (ii) the Principal
Payment Date or Dates, if any, on
which Bonds not subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption (Serial Bonds) shall mature; (iii) the
Principal Payment Date or Dates, if
any, on which Bonds subject to
mandatory sinking fund redemption
(Term Bonds) shall be stated to
mature; (iv) the Principal Payment
Date or Dates on which any Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption (Mandatory Redemption Dates) and (v) the
number of annual Principal Payment Dates (not to exceed 30).
(e) Redemption. The Bonds shall
be subject to redemption prior to
stated maturity as follows:
(i)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption of Term Bonds. Term
Bonds, if any, shall be subject to
mandatory redemption in part by lot
and be redeemed pursuant to mandatory sinking fund requirements, at a
redemption price of 100% of the
principal amount of any Current
Interest Bonds or the Compounded
Accreted
Value
of
any
Capital
Appreciation Bonds redeemed, plus
accrued interest to the redemption
date, on the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Dates and in the principal amounts payable on those
Dates for which provision is made
above (such Dates and amounts, the
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements).
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Registrar (as
defined in Section 4 of this Ordinance) for payment of principal of
and interest on Term Bonds on each
Mandatory Redemption Date shall
include an amount sufficient to
redeem on that Date the principal
amount of Term Bonds payable on
that Date pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements (less the amount of any credit as provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar for cancellation Term Bonds in any aggregate
principal amount and to receive a
credit against the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption obligation) of the City for Term Bonds
stated to mature on the same Principal Payment Date as the Term
Bonds so delivered. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth day preceding
the applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, by furnishing the Registrar a certificate, signed by the
Director of Finance, setting forth
the extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement for Term Bonds
stated to mature on the same Principal Payment Date. If the certificate is not timely furnished to the
Registrar, the applicable Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds which
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the applicable Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements) or

The City Record
purchased for cancellation and canceled by the Registrar, to the extent
not applied theretofore as a credit
against
any
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement for
Term Bonds stated to mature on the
same Principal Payment Date as the
Term Bonds so redeemed or purchased and canceled.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Registrar at 100% of the principal amount thereof against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) for Term Bonds stated
to mature on the same Principal
Payment Date as the Term Bonds so
delivered, redeemed or purchased
and canceled. Any excess of that
amount
over
the
then
current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement shall be credited
against any subsequent Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements (and corresponding mandatory redemption obligations) for Term
Bonds stated to mature on that Principal Payment Date, in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(ii) Optional Redemption. If provided by the Director of Finance in
the Final Terms Certificate, the Current Interest Bonds shall be subject
to redemption by and at the sole
option of the City, in whole or in
part in integral multiples of $5,000,
on the dates, in the years and at the
redemption prices (expressed as a
percentage of the principal amount
to be redeemed), plus accrued interest to the redemption date, as determined by the Director of Finance in
the Final Terms Certificate; provided that the earliest optional redemption date shall not be earlier than
December 1, 2007 and shall not be
later than December 1, 2011, and the
redemption price for the earliest
optional redemption date shall not
be greater than 103%.
If optional redemption of Term
Bonds at a redemption price exceeding 100% of the principal amount to
be redeemed is to take place as of
any Mandatory Redemption Date
applicable to those Term Bonds, the
Term Bonds, or portions thereof, to
be redeemed optionally shall be
selected by lot prior to the selection
by lot of the Term Bonds of the
same maturity to be redeemed on
the same date by operation of the
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements. Bonds to be
redeemed pursuant to this paragraph shall be redeemed only upon
written notice from the Director of
Finance to the Registrar, given
upon the direction of this Council by
adoption of a resolution or passage
of an Ordinance. That notice shall
specify the redemption date and the
principal amount of each maturity
of Bonds to be redeemed, and shall
be given at least 45 days prior to
the redemption date or such shorter
period as shall be acceptable to the
Registrar.
(iii) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for optional redemption at
one time and Bonds of more than
one maturity are then outstanding,
the Bonds that are called shall be
called as selected by, and selected
in a manner determined by, the City.
If fewer than all of the Bonds of a
single maturity are to be redeemed,
the selection of Bonds of that maturity to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be

1531

89
made by lot in a manner determined
by the Registrar. In the case of a
partial redemption of Bonds by lot
when
Bonds
of
denominations
greater than $5,000 are then outstanding, each $5,000 unit of principal thereof shall be treated as if it
were a separate Bond of the denomination of $5,000. If it is determined
that one or more, but not all, of the
$5,000 units of principal amount represented by a Bond are to be called
for redemption, then, upon notice of
redemption of a $5,000 unit or units,
the registered owner of that Bond
shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i) for payment of the redemption price of the $5,000 unit or units
of
principal
amount
called
for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption and any
premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner, of a new Bond or Bonds of
any
authorized
denomination
or
denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unmatured and unredeemed portion of,
and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(iv) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least 30
days prior to the date fixed for
redemption, to the registered owner
of each Bond subject to redemption
in whole or in part at the registered
owner’s address shown on the Bond
Register (as defined in Section 6 of
this Ordinance) maintained by the
Registrar at the close of business on
the fifteenth day preceding that
mailing. Failure to receive notice by
mail or any defect in that notice
regarding any Bond, however, shall
not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any
Bond.
(v) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
In the event that notice of redemption shall have been given by the
Registrar to the registered owners
as provided above, there shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, moneys that, in addition to any other
moneys available therefor and held
by the Registrar, will be sufficient
to redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus accrued interest to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice
of
redemption
has
been
given.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph hereof, the Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due and payable
on the redemption date, and, subject
to Section 5 of this Ordinance, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the
redemption price, plus accrued interest to the redemption date. If moneys for the redemption of all of the
Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with accrued
interest thereon to the redemption
date, are held by the Registrar on
the redemption date, so as to be

90
available therefor on that date and,
if notice of redemption has been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
those moneys shall not be so available on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All moneys
held
by
the
Registrar
for
the
redemption of particular Bonds shall
be held in trust for the account of
the registered owners thereof and
shall be paid to them, respectively,
upon presentation and surrender of
those Bonds.
Section 3. Execution of Bonds. The
Bonds shall be signed by the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, in the
name of the City and in their official capacities, provided that either
or both of those signatures may be
a facsimile, and shall bear the seal
of the City or a facsimile thereof.
Pursuant to Section 83 of the City’s
Charter, the Director of Law shall
prepare the Bonds and shall endorse
thereon her approval of the form
and correctness by her manual or
facsimile signature. The Bonds shall
be issued in the denominations and
numbers as requested by the original purchaser and approved by the
Director of Finance, shall be numbered as determined by the Director
of Finance, and shall express upon
their faces the purpose, in summary
terms, for which they are issued and
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance. No Bond shall be valid
or obligatory for any purpose or
shall be entitled to any security or
benefit under the Bond Proceedings
unless and until the certificate of
authentication printed on the Bond
is signed by the Registrar (as
defined in Section 4) as authenticating agent. Authentication by the
Registrar shall be conclusive evidence that the Bond so authenticated has been duly issued, signed and
delivered under, and is entitled to
the security and benefit of, the Bond
Proceedings.
The
certificate
of
authentication may be signed by
any authorized officer or employee
of the Registrar or by any other person acting as an agent of the Registrar and approved by the Director
of Finance on behalf of the City.
The same person need not sign the
certificate of authentication on all
of the Bonds.
Section 4. Registrar. The Director
of Finance shall designate a bank
or trust company to act as the
authenticating
agent,
registrar,
transfer agent and paying agent for
the Bonds and, if Notes are issued
that
mature
more
than
twelve
months from their date of issuance,
for such Notes (the Registrar) after
determining that the payment at
that bank or trust company will not
endanger the funds or securities of
the City and that proper procedures
and safeguards are available for
that
purpose.
The
Director
of
Finance shall sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
a Registrar Agreement between the
City and the Registrar (the Registrar Agreement) in substantially the
form as is now on the file with the
Clerk of Council in File No. 1090-97A. The Registrar Agreement is
approved,
together
with
any

The City Record
changes or amendments that are not
inconsistent with this ordinance and
not substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the Registrar Agreement or amendments to
the Registrar Agreement. The Director of Finance shall provide for the
payment of the services rendered
and for reimbursement of expenses
incurred pursuant to the Registrar
Agreement from the proceeds of the
Bonds or Notes, as applicable, and
to the extent available, and then
from other money lawfully available
and appropriated or to be appropriated for that purpose.
Section
5.
Payment
of
Debt
Charges. The debt charges on the
Bonds shall be payable in lawful
money of the United States of America without deduction for the services of the Registrar as paying
agent. Principal and any premium
on the Current Interest Bonds shall
be payable when due upon presentation and surrender of the Bonds at
the principal corporate trust office
of the Registrar. Interest on a Current Interest Bond shall be paid on
each CIB Interest Payment Date by
check or draft mailed to the person
in whose name the Bond was registered, and to that person’s address
appearing, on the Bond Register (as
defined in Section 6) at the close of
business on the 15th day of the calendar month next preceding that
Interest Payment Date (the Record
Date). The debt charges on the Capital Appreciation Bonds shall be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Capital Appreciation Bonds at the principal corporate trust office of the Registrar.
Section 6. Transfer and Exchange
of Bonds. So long as any of the
Bonds remain outstanding, the City
will cause the Registrar to maintain
and keep at its principal corporate
trust office all books and records
necessary
for
the
registration,
exchange and transfer of Bonds as
provided in this Section (the Bond
Register). Subject to the provisions
of Section 5, the person in whose
name a Bond is registered on the
Bond Register shall be regarded as
the absolute owner of that Bond for
all purposes of the Bond Proceedings. Payment of or on account of
the debt charges on any Bond shall
be made only to or upon the order
of that person; neither the City nor
the Registrar shall be affected by
any notice to the contrary, but the
registration may be changed as provided in this Section. All such payments shall be valid and effectual
to satisfy and discharge the City’s
liability upon the Bond, including
interest, to the extent of the amount
or amounts so paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any Authorized Denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Bond at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner
or
by
a
person
legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and

1532

August 20, 1997
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
Authorized Denomination or Denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of
the
Bond
Proceedings.
The
exchange or transfer shall be without charge to the owner, except that
the City and Registrar may make a
charge sufficient to reimburse them
for any tax or other governmental
charge required to be paid with
respect to the exchange or transfer.
The City or the Registrar may
require that those charges, if any,
be paid before the procedure is
begun for the exchange or transfer.
All Bonds issued and authenticated
upon any exchange or transfer shall
be valid special obligations of the
City, evidencing the same debt, and
entitled to the same security and
benefit under the Bond Proceedings,
as the Bonds surrendered upon that
exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be in the best interests of and financially advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
book entry interests in Bonds and
the principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
book entry interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized, (i) the
Bonds may be issued in the form of
a single, fully registered Bond representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the book entry
interest owners in book entry form

August 20, 1997
shall have no right to receive Bonds
in the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of book
entry interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
book entry interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for
transfer to another Depository or to
another nominee of a Depository,
without further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Director of Finance, after
making provision for notification of
the book entry interest owners by
the then Depository and any other
arrangements
deemed
necessary,
shall permit withdrawal of the
Bonds from the Depository, and
authenticate and deliver note certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 7. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking
Fund and, if not purchased by such
Trustees, shall be offered to the
Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased by
such Account, shall be sold to A.G.
Edwards & Sons, Inc., SBK-Brooks
Investment Corp., Pryor, McClendon,
Counts & Co., Inc., Smith Barney
Inc., Lehman Brothers and Key Capital Markets, Inc. (collectively, the
Original Purchaser); provided, however that if, in the reasonable opinion of the Director of Finance, an
underwriter is incapable of fully
performing its duties or meeting its
obligations in its capacity as Original Purchaser with respect to the
Bonds, the Director of Finance is
hereby authorized and directed, in
the name of and on behalf of the
City, to take whatever actions may
be
necessary
to
terminate
that
underwriter’s standing as Original
Purchaser.
The
Bonds
shall
be
awarded to the Original Purchaser
at a purchase price of not less than
97% of par plus any accrued interest from the date of the Bonds to
the date of their delivery to the
Original Purchaser, with the principal amount of the Bonds (including
respective principal amounts of Current Interest Bonds and Capital
Appreciation Bonds), final purchase
price, interest rate or rates, annual
principal installments, Serial Bonds,
Term Bonds, Mandatory Redemption
Dates and Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements,
any
optional redemption provisions, and

The City Record
such other terms and conditions, all
as set forth in the Final Terms Certificate in accordance with law and
the provisions of this Ordinance and
the
Bond
Purchase
Agreement
described below. The Director of
Finance shall sign and deliver, in
the name of and on behalf of the
City, the Bond Purchase Agreement
between the City and the Original
Purchaser in substantially the form
as the Note Purchase Agreement
now on file with the Clerk of Council and referred to below. The Bond
Purchase Agreement is approved,
together
with
any
changes
or
amendments that are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and not
substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Bond
Purchase
Agreement
or
amendments thereto. The Director of
Finance shall cause the Bonds to be
prepared and signed and delivered,
together with a true transcript of
proceedings with reference to the
issuance of the Bonds, to the Original Purchaser upon payment of the
purchase price. The Mayor, the
Clerk of Council, the Director of
Finance, the Director of Law and
other City officials, as appropriate,
are each authorized and directed to
sign
any
transcript
certificates,
financial statements and other documents and instruments, including
but not limited to interest rate
hedges, swap agreements and forward purchase agreements and to
take such actions as are necessary
or appropriate to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this
Ordinance.
Section 8. Issuance of Notes. It is
necessary for the reasons set forth
in the preambles to this Ordinance
to issue and this Council determines
that notes in the aggregate principal amount not to exceed $20,000,000
(the Notes) shall be issued in anticipation of the issuance of the Bonds
and to retire the Outstanding Notes.
The Notes shall bear interest at a
rate or rates not to exceed 9% per
year (computed on a 360-day per
year basis). Interest on the Notes
shall be payable on the dates determined by the Director of Finance in
the certificate or certificates awarding the Notes in accordance with
Section 11 of this Ordinance (the
Certificate of Award) and until the
principal amount is paid or payment
is provided for. The rate or rates of
interest on the Notes shall be determined by the Director of Finance
and set forth in the Certificate of
Award. The Notes may be issued
from time to time in one or more
series if so provided in the Certificate of Award, provided that a separate Certificate of Award shall be
executed for each series and the last
series of Notes shall be authorized
and sold not later than December 31,
1997.
Section
9.
Payment
of
Debt
Charges; Transfer and Exchange of
Notes. The debt charges on the
Notes shall be payable in lawful
money of the United States of America, or in Federal Reserve funds of
the United States of America if so
requested by the Original Purchaser, and shall be payable, without
deduction for services of any paying
agent, at the office of the Paying
Agent (defined below), for Notes
maturing
no
later
than
twelve
months from their date of issuance.
The Notes of each series shall be
dated the date of issuance of the

1533

91
respective series and shall mature
on a date to be determined in the
Certificate of Award for the respective series, provided that such date
shall not be later than twenty-four
months from the date of issuance of
the respective series of Notes. In the
event that the Notes mature not
later than twelve months from their
date of issuance, the Director of
Finance may serve as the City’s paying agent for the Notes or the Director of Finance shall designate a
bank or trust company to serve as
the City’s paying agent (the Paying
Agent) after determining that payment at that bank or trust company
will not endanger the funds or securities of the City and that proper
procedures
and
safeguards
are
available for that purpose. In the
event that the Notes mature later
than twelve months following their
date of issuance, the Notes shall be
issued only as fully registered Notes
and the Registrar designated pursuant to Section 4 shall serve as
authenticating
agent,
registrar,
transfer agent and paying agent for
the Notes.
If agreed to by the Original Purchaser, the Notes shall be prepayable without penalty or premium
at the option of the City in whole
or in part at any time prior to maturity as provided in this Ordinance.
Prepayment prior to maturity shall
be made by deposit with the Paying
Agent or Registrar of the principal
amount of the Notes together with
interest accrued thereon to the date
of prepayment. The City’s right of
prepayment shall be exercised by
mailing a notice of prepayment,
stating the date of prepayment and
the name and address of the Paying
Agent or Registrar, by certified or
registered mail to the Original Purchaser of the Notes not less than
seven days prior to the date of that
deposit, unless that notice is waived
by the Original Purchaser of the
Notes. If money for prepayment is
on deposit with the Paying Agent or
Registrar on the specified prepayment date following the giving of
that notice (unless the requirement
of that notice is waived as stated
above), interest on the principal
amount
prepaid
shall
cease
to
accrue on the prepayment date, and
upon the request of the Director of
Finance, the Original Purchaser of
the Notes shall arrange for the
delivery of the Notes at the designated office of the Paying Agent or
Registrar for prepayment and surrender and cancellation.
Principal on the Notes maturing
later than twelve months following
their date of issuance shall be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Notes at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar. Interest on the Notes
maturing later than twelve months
shall be paid on each interest payment date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Note was registered, and to that person’s address appearing on the Note
Register (defined in the following
paragraph), at the close of business
on the 15th day of the calendar
month next preceding that interest
payment date. So long as any of the
Notes maturing later than twelve
months following their date of
issuance remain outstanding, the
City will cause the Registrar to
maintain and keep at its principal
corporate trust office all books and
records necessary for the registration, exchange and transfer of Notes
as provided in this Section (the Note

92
Register). Subject to the provisions
of this Section, the person in whose
name a Note is registered on the
Note Register shall be regarded as
the absolute owner of that Note for
all purposes of the Bond Proceedings. Payment of or on account of
the debt charges on any Note shall
be made only to or upon the order
of that person; neither the City nor
the Registrar shall be affected by
any notice to the contrary, but the
registration may be changed as provided in this Section. All such payments shall be valid and effectual
to satisfy and discharge the City’s
liability upon the Note, including
interest, to the extent of the amount
or amounts so paid.
Any Note maturing later than
twelve months following their date
of issuance may be exchanged for
Notes of any Authorized Denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Note may be transferred only on
the Note Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Note at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner
or
by
a
person
legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Note or Notes of any
Authorized Denomination or Denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Note
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Notes only after the new
Notes are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Notes exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Notes
in accordance with the provisions of
the
Bond
Proceedings.
The
exchange or transfer shall be without charge to the owner, except that
the City and Registrar may make a
charge sufficient to reimburse them
for any tax or other governmental
charge required to be paid with
respect to the exchange or transfer.
The City or the Registrar may
require that those charges, if any,
be paid before the procedure is
begun for the exchange or transfer.
All Notes issued and authenticated
upon any exchange or transfer shall
be valid special obligations of the
City, evidencing the same debt, and
entitled to the same security and
benefit under the Bond Proceedings,
as the Notes surrendered upon that

City nor the Registrar shall be
required to make any exchange or
transfer of a Note during the period
beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the
mailing of a notice of redemption of
Notes and ending at the close of
business on the day of such mailing
or to transfer or exchange any Note
selected for redemption, in whole or
in part.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be in the best interests of and financially advantageous to the City, the

The City Record
Notes may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
book entry interests in Notes and
the principal of and interest on the
Notes
may
be
transferred
only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Note certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Notes
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
book entry interests in those Notes
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in Notes or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
Notes, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Notes may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized, (i) the
Notes may be issued in the form of
a single, fully registered Note representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the book entry
interest owners in book entry form
shall have no right to receive Notes
in the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of book
entry interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
book entry interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Notes as such shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for
transfer to another Depository or to
another nominee of a Depository,
without further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Notes for use in a book entry
system, the Director of Finance may
attempt to establish a securities
depository/book entry relationship
with another qualified Depository. If
the Director of Finance does not or
is unable to do so, the Director of
Finance, after making provision for
notification of the book entry interest owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Notes from the Depository,
and authenticate and deliver note
certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements deter-

1534

August 20, 1997
mined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the Notes,
after determining that the signing
thereof will not endanger the funds
or securities of the City and after
the approval of the form of any such
agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 10. Execution of Notes.

Mayor and Director of Finance, in
the name of the City and in their
official capacities, provided that one

denomination that is any whole multiple thereof. The Notes shall not
have coupons attached, shall be
numbered as determined by the
Director
of
Finance
and

Section 11. Sale of Notes. The
Notes shall first be offered at par

of the Sinking Fund and, if the
Trustees refuse to take any or all
of them, the Director of Finance
shall offer them to the Mayor and
the Director of Law for purchase for
credit of the Treasury Investment

the Treasury Investment Account,
the Notes shall be sold at not less

however that if, in the reasonable

Bonds, the Director of Finance is
hereby authorized and directed, in
the name of and on behalf of the
City, to take whatever actions may
be
necessary
to

that
underwriter’s standing as Original
Purchaser. The Director of Finance
shall sign the Certificate or Certificates of Award referred to in Sections 8 and 9 evidencing that sale,
cause the Notes to be prepared, and
have the Notes signed and delivered,
together with a true transcript of
proceedings with reference to the
issuance of the Notes if requested
by the Original Purchaser, to the
Original Purchaser upon payment of
the purchase price. The Director of

the name of and on behalf of the
City, the Note Purchase Agreement
between the City and the Original

August 20, 1997

Ordinance
and

appropriate, are each authorized and
directed to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and
other documents and instruments
and to take such actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated

Finance is authorized, if it is determined to be in the best interest of
the City, to combine the issue of
Notes with one or more other note
issues of the City into a consolidated note issue pursuant to Section
133.30(B) of the Revised Code.
Section 12. Security. The Bonds
and the Notes are special obligations of the City, and the principal
and interest on the Bonds and Notes
are payable solely from Nontax Revenues and such payment is secured
by a pledge of those Nontax Revenues established by and as provided in this Ordinance which are on
deposit in the Stadium Bond Fund,
as described below.
There is hereby created by the
City a separate fund named the “Stadium Bond Fund” (the “Bond Fund”)
into which Nontax Revenues shall
be deposited in accordance with the
following provisions. “Nontax Revenues”, as used herein, means, all
moneys of the City which are not
moneys raised by taxation, to the
extent available for such purposes,
including, but not limited to the following: (a) grants from the United
States of America and the State of
Ohio; (b) payments in lieu of taxes
now or hereafter authorized by State
statute; (c) fines and forfeitures
which are deposited in the City’s
General Fund; (d) fees deposited in
the City’s General Fund from properly imposed licenses and permits;
(e) investment earnings on the
City’s General Fund and which are
credited to the City’s General Fund;
(f) investment earnings of other
funds of the City that are credited
to the City’s General Fund; (g) proceeds from the sale of assets which
are deposited in the City’s General
Fund; (h) rental income which is
deposited in the City’s General
Fund; (i) gifts and donations and
(j) charges for services and payments received in reimbursement for
services.
With respect to the Notes, the City
hereby covenants and agrees that on
or before each date on which principal or interest is due and payable
with respect to the Notes, it shall
deposit into the Bond Fund from
Nontax Revenues selected by the
City an amount equal to the debt
service due and payable on the
Notes on such date. With respect to
the
Bonds,
the
City
hereby
covenants and agrees that on the
first day of each month Bonds are
outstanding, the City shall deposit
into the Bond Fund from Nontax
Revenues selected by the City (i)
commencing the later of the first
day of the month following issuance
of the Bonds or the first day of the
sixth month preceding the first CIB
Interest
Payment
Date
on
the

The City Record
Bonds, an amount equal to one-sixth
of the interest payment due on the
next following CIB Interest Payment Date, and (ii) commencing the
first day of the twelfth month preceding the first Principal Payment
Date, an amount equal to onetwelfth of the principal payment due
on the next following Principal Payment Date; in each case, less any
interest earnings accumulated in the
Bond Fund which have not theretofore been used as a credit against a
prior payment obligation. Moneys in
the Bond Fund shall be used solely
and exclusively to pay principal and
interest on the Notes and Bonds
when due.
The City hereby covenants and
agrees that so long as the Notes and
the Bonds are outstanding, it will
appropriate and maintain sufficient
Nontax Revenues each year to make
each payment due under this Section
and to pay principal and interest on
the Notes and Bonds when due; provided, however, the payments due
hereunder and under the Notes and
Bonds are payable solely from Nontax Revenues, which Nontax Revenues are hereby selected by the
City as moneys that are not raised
by taxation. The Notes and Bonds do
not and shall not represent or constitute a general obligation debt or
pledge of the faith or credit or taxing power of the City, and the owners of the Notes or Bonds have no
right to have taxes levied by the
City for the payment of principal
and interest on the Notes or Bonds.
Nothing herein shall be construed
as requiring the City to use or apply
to the payment of principal and
interest on the Notes or the Bonds
any funds or revenues from any
source other than Nontax Revenues.
Nothing herein, however, shall be
deemed to prohibit the City, of its
own volition, from using, to the
extent that it is authorized by law
to do so, any other resources for the
fulfillment of any of the terms, conditions or obligations of this Ordinance or of the Notes or the Bonds.
Section 13. Proceeds of Notes and
Bonds. The proceeds from the sale
of the Notes or Bonds, except any
premium and accrued interest, shall
be paid into the proper fund or
funds and those proceeds are appropriated and shall be used for the
purpose for which the Notes or
Bonds are being issued. Any portion
of those proceeds representing premium and accrued interest shall be
paid into the Bond Fund. If Notes
are issued, the par value to be
received from the sale of the Bonds
or any renewal notes and any
excess funds resulting from the
issuance of the Notes shall, to the
extent necessary, be used to pay the
debt charges on the Notes at maturity and are pledged for that purpose.
Section 14. Disclosure; Rating;
Insurance. If, in the judgment of the
Director of Finance after consultation with the Original Purchaser, an
official statement or other disclosure document is appropriate relating to the initial offering of the
Notes or Bonds, the Director of
Finance, on behalf of the City and
in that officer’s official capacity, is
authorized to (i) cooperate with the
Original Purchaser in the preparation of, and the making of modifications, completions or changes of

the initial offering of the Notes or
Bonds, and (iv) sign certificates,
statements or other documents in
connection with the finality, accuracy and completeness of that disclosure document.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Notes or Bonds, the City
agrees, as the only obligated person
with respect to the Notes or Bonds
under the Rule, to provide or cause
to be provided such financial information and operating data, audited
financial statements and notices, in
such manner, as may be required for
purposes of paragraph (b)(5)(i) of
the Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Director of
Finance is authorized and directed
to sign and deliver, in the name and
on behalf of the City, the Continuing
Disclosure
Certificate
with
respect to the Bonds and the Notes.
The agreement formed, collectively,
by this paragraph and that Certificate, shall be the City’s continuing
disclosure agreement for purposes
of the Rule, and its performance
shall be subject to the annual appropriation of any funds that may be
necessary to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of the
occurrence of any other events, the
Director of Finance shall consult
with, as appropriate, the legal counsel and bond or other qualified independent special counsel to the City.
The Director of Finance, acting in
the name and on behalf of the City,
shall be entitled to rely upon any
legal advice provided by any such
counsel in determining whether a
filing should be made.
If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, after consultation
with the City’s financial advisor, the
filing of an application for (i) a rating on the Notes or Bonds by one or
more nationally-recognized rating
agencies, (ii) a policy of insurance
or other credit enhancement facility
from a company or companies to better assure the payment of principal
of and interest on the Notes or
Bonds, or (iii) a surety bond or
other credit enhancement facility
from a company or other companies
to satisfy any reserve requirement
for the Notes or Bonds is in the best
interest of and financially advantageous to this City, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare
and submit those applications, to
provide to each such agency, company or other credit enhancement
facility provider such information as
may be required for the purpose.
The cost of obtaining each such rating, policy, bond or credit enhancement facility, except to the extent
paid by the Original Purchaser in
accordance with the Bond Purchase
Agreement, shall be paid from the
proceeds of the Notes or Bonds. If,
in the judgment of the Director of
Finance, after consultation with the
City’s financial advisor, a bond
reserve fund or similar fund to

94
secure the Notes or Bonds, or a
pledge of all or a portion of the Nontax Revenues to secure the Notes or
Bonds is in the best interest of and
financially advantageous to this
City, such fund and pledge are hereby authorized and the Director of
Finance and other City officials, as
appropriate, are authorized to take
such actions as are necessary or
appropriate to consummate such
additional security for the Notes or
Bonds.
Section 15. Tax Covenants. The
City covenants that it will use, and
will restrict the use and investment
of, the proceeds of the Notes and
Bonds in such manner and to such
extent as may be necessary so that
(a) neither the Notes nor the Bonds
will (i) constitute private activity
bonds, arbitrage bonds or hedge
bonds under Sections 141, 148 or 149
of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the Code) or (ii)
be treated other than as bonds to
which Section 103(a) of the Code
applies, and (b) the interest on the
Notes and Bonds will not be treated
as an item of tax preference under

such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the Notes
and Bonds to be and remain excluded from gross income for federal
income tax purposes, (b) it will not

actions that would adversely affect
that exclusion, and (c) it, or persons
acting for it, will, among other acts
of compliance, (i) apply the proceeds of the Notes and Bonds to the
governmental purpose of the borrowing, (ii) restrict the yield on
investment
property,
(iii)
make
timely and adequate payments to
the federal government, (iv) maintain books and records and make
calculations and reports and (v)
refrain from certain uses of those
proceeds, and, as applicable, of property financed with such proceeds,

necessary to assure such exclusion

The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer of
the City having responsibility for
issuance of the Notes and Bonds is
hereby authorized (a) to make or
effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or
waiver on behalf of the City with

actions, make or obtain calculations,
make payments, and make or give
reports, covenants and certifications

Notes and Bonds, and (c) to give
one or more appropriate certificates
of the City, for inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Notes
and Bonds, setting forth the reasonable expectations of the City regarding the amount and use of all the
proceeds of the Notes and Bonds, the
facts, circumstances and estimates
on which they are based, and other
facts and circumstances relevant to
the tax treatment of the interest on
and the tax status of the Notes and
Bonds.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or
any other provisions of this Ordinance to the contrary, if the Director of Finance determines prior to
the execution and delivery of the
Bond Purchase Agreement or Note
Purchase Agreement that it is necessary and appropriate and in the
best interests of the City for the
interest on the Notes or the Bonds
to be included in gross income for
federal income tax purposes, the

covenants of this Section 15 with
respect to the Notes or Bonds, as the
