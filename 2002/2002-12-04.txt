another.
(d) Identification Signs.
(1) The name of the publication
using either the full sheet device or

locations within the district upon
which newspaper dispensing devices
may be located, notwithstanding
any other provisions of this section
to the contrary. In determining the
specific locations of newspaper dispensing devices within the district,
the City Planning Commission shall
apply standards that are no more
restrictive, and may be less restrictive, than the provisions of division
(a) of this section. For six (6)
months after the effective date of
this division, the provisions of this
section shall apply to all newspaper
dispensing devices on Public Square.
For purposes of this division, “Public Square” means the four (4) quadrants of Public Square and the sidewalks on either side of the roadways that bound and that intersect

(f) (1) Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in division
(a)(2)B., (a)(6)B., (c)(1), (c)(2) or

and
maintained
directly
adjacent to and flush against that
side of a public bus shelter which
is perpendicular to the curb edge of
the roadway and furthest forward in
the direction of traffic on the street
(the “downstream side”); provided,
however, that if more than one
owner desires to install a device at
any one public bus shelter, only

The City Record
multiple-dispensing-device
modular
units may be installed, placed, and
maintained at such location. No modular unit shall be installed unless
and until the City Planning Commission has approved the design
thereof. Where more than one newspaper dispensing device is located
in the vicinity of the downstream
side of a public bus shelter as of
January 1, 1991, said devices may be
moved adjacent to the downstream
side of the shelter until such time
as the City Planning Commission
approves the design of a modular
unit
for
that
location.
Owners
installing modular units shall be
responsible for their maintenance
and shall purchase such units on
terms and conditions upon which
said owners mutually agree. Newspaper dispensing devices or modular
units
installed
and
maintained
directly adjacent to the downstream
side or public bus shelters may be
placed so that the front of the
device is perpendicular to or at an
angle to the roadway; so long as
such device or modular unit is
placed adjacent to the downstream
side of the shelter.
(2) If a bus company presents to
the City Planning Commission a bus
shelter design which incorporates
newspaper dispensing devices or a
modular frame therefor into the bus
shelter, and if the City Planning
Commission approves said design,
the following shall not apply to any
newspaper dispensing device which
is incorporated into any such bus
shelter or inserted into any such
modular frame, provided that the
bus shelter is installed pursuant to
a permit duly issued by the City:

680.03;
B. the distance requirements contained in divisions (a)(2)B., (a)(6)B.,

device is in place on a concrete pad
at a public bus stop or public bus
shelter in a One-, Two-, or MultiFamily District as of January 1,
1991, and if said device would otherwise not be permitted to remain at
such location because the concrete
pad is of insufficient size to accommodate the placement of such device
in accordance with the provisions of
divisions (a)(2)A. or (a)(2)B. of
this section, said device may remain
at the location it occupied as of January 1, 1991 until such time as the
concrete pad underlying such public
stop or public bus shelter is extended by the bus company and the pad
is of sufficient size to accommodate
the placement of such device. Any
newspaper dispensing device that is
permitted to remain at a public bus
stop or public bus shelter as a result
of the provisions of this division
shall be removed by its owner if a
public bus company installs a shelter on the concrete pad underlying
a public bus stop or enlarges an
existing shelter unless:
(1) the bus company enlarges the
concrete pad underlying the public
bus stop or bus shelter sufficiently

2593

to accommodate placement of the
device in accordance with division
(a)(2)A. or (a)(2)B. of this section;
or
(2) the owner of the device
extends the bus company’s concrete
pad sufficiently to accommodate
placement of the device in accordance with division (a)(2)A. or
(a)(2)B. of this section. In the event

extension:
A. the owner shall be responsible
for maintaining the extension of the
concrete pad; and
B. if the owner removes the
device, the owner shall promptly:
1. remove the extension of the concrete pad and restore the property
underlying said extension to its condition prior to the installation of the

and the public bus company mutually agree;
provided that the Directors of
Public Service and City Planning
may, in their sole discretion, permit
such concrete pad to remain in
place, absent a transfer of interest
pursuant to paragraph (2)B.2. or
(2)B.3. of this division, upon such
terms and conditions as said Directors mutually agree.
(h) Subject to the provisions of
the following sentences in this division and notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in divisions (a)(6) or (a)(12) of this section, if a newspaper dispensing
device is in place on a concrete pad
at a public bus stop or public bus
shelter outside of the Central Business District as of January 1, 1991,
and if such device would otherwise
not be permitted to remain in the
vicinity because a relocation of said
device in order to comply with the
distance requirements of this section
would result in the placement of
said device at a prohibited location,
said device may remain at the location it occupied as of January 1,
1991. Any newspaper dispensing
device that is permitted to remain
at a public bus stop or public bus
shelter as a result of the provisions
of this division shall be removed by
its owner if a public bus company
installs a shelter on the concrete
pad underlying a public bus stop or
enlarges an existing shelter unless:
(1) the bus company enlarges the
concrete pad underlying the public
bus stop or bus shelter sufficiently to
accommodate placement of the device
in accordance with division (a)(2)A.
or (a)(2)B. of this section; or

extends the bus company’s concrete
pad sufficiently to accommodate
placement of the device in accordance with division (a)(2)A. or
(a)(2)B. of this section. In the event
that the owners installs such an
extension:
A. the owner shall be responsible
for maintaining the extension of the
concrete pad; and

device, the owner shall promptly:
1. remove the extension of the concrete pad and restore the property

16
underlying said extension to its condition prior to the installation of the
extension; or

permitted to remain at such location
because of the requirements of division (a)(8) of this section, may
remain at such location until such
time as the bus sign is moved so as
to allow sufficient space for the
newspaper dispensing device to be
located forward of the sign without
violating any provision of this section; and, other than on Euclid

device that is in place more than
eight feet (8') back of a bus company sign at a public bus stop as of
