ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 1935-02.
By Council Members Coats, Jackson, Conwell and Pierce-Scott.
An emergency resolution urging
the federal government to provide
adequate funding to regional political subdivisions and local governments to enable these entities to
comply with the combined sewer
overflow mandates established by
the federal government.
Whereas, the federal government
and the United States Environmental Protection Agency have enacted

2390

November 6, 2002
laws and regulations that mandate
regional political subdivisions and
local governments to address combined sewer overflow issues;
Whereas, this mandate is not coupled with funding necessary to
ensure compliance with the combined sewer overflow requirements
established by the federal government; and
Whereas, many regional political
subdivisions and local governments
are struggling to provide basic services in this challenging economic
time; and
Whereas, many regional political
subdivisions and local governments
are forced to consider utility rate
increases in order to fund the federal government’s combined sewer
overflow mandates; and
Whereas, proposed utility rate
increases, in many instances, exceed
the rate of inflation; and
Whereas, such rate increases, if
approved, would place an unreasonable burden on consumers of utility
services; and
Whereas, it is the opinion of this
Council that the federal government
should provide funding necessary
for regional political subdivisions
and local governments to comply
with the combined sewer overflow
mandates established by the federal
government; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the federal government to provide
adequate funding to regional political subdivisions and local governments to enable these entities to
comply with the combined sewer
overflow mandates established by
the federal government.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to U.S. Senator Michael DeWine, U.S. Senator
George
Voinovich,
Congressman
Dennis Kucinich, Congresswoman
Stephanie
Tubbs-Jones,
Congressman Steven LaTourette, Congressman Sherrod Brown, and Congressman Ralph Regula.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted October 28, 2002.
Effective October 30, 2002.

Res. No. 1944-02.
By Council Member Coats.
An emergency resolution urging
President Bush, the U.S. Senate and
the U.S. House of Representatives to
allocate more federal funds to the
Clean Water Act for storm water
management projects.
Whereas,
the
Northeast
Ohio
Regional Sewer District (“NEORSD”)
is commencing a $1.2 billion improvement to the storm water management
system in Cuyahoga County; and

November 6, 2002
Whereas, the NEORSD has proposed to significantly raise the
sewer rates of the citizens of Cleveland in order to pay for this
improvement; and
Whereas,
in
the
absence
of
increased federal funding under the
Clean Water Act to defray a portion
of the cost of these improvements,
the sewer ratepayers least able to
pay increased sewer use costs will
be asked to pay a significant rate
increase; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
President Bush, the U.S. Senate and
the U.S. House of Representatives to
allocate more federal funds to the
Clean Water Act for storm water
management projects, including the
$1.2 billion storm water management program proposed by the
NEORSD.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to President Bush,
Senator Voinovich, Senator DeWine
and the members of the congressional delegation representing Cuyahoga County.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted October 28, 2002.
Effective October 30, 2002.

Res. No. 2121-02.
By Council Member Cimperman
(by departmental request).
An emergency resolution to name
the Cleveland Browns Football Stadium
Roadway
“Alfred
Lerner
Way”.
Whereas, this Resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the city of Cleveland:
Section 1. That it is with deepest
sympathy that the Citizens of the
City
of
Cleveland
send
their
thoughts and prayers to mourn the
passing of Alfred (“Al”) Lerner. And
that we extend our condolences to
his family, friends and his “extended family”. Thousands of persons
will remember Mr. Lerner for bringing our beloved Cleveland Browns

will remember him for his humanitarian gifts and kindness to local
hospitals and charities. The Cleveland Browns Football Fans and
Players will remember him as a
“Fan” and one of their own. We, the
Citizens of Cleveland, have truly
lost one of our best and dearest
friends; therefore, as a memorial
and tribute to Mr. Lerner we propose:
Section 2. That the name of all

the same is now named “Alfred
Lerner Way”.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
