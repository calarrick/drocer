Section 3103.09 Unsafe Structures;
Violation
and
Remedial
Notices;
Cost Recovery
(a) Legislative Findings.
Council of the City of Cleveland
finds that:
(1) Structures which are vacant
and open to entry at doors, windows
or other points accessible to the general public:
A. Attract children to enter;
B. Become harborage for vermin;
C. Serve as temporary abode for
derelicts, vagrants and criminals;
and
D. Are likely to be damaged by
vandals or set ablaze by arsonists.
(2) Unkept grounds surrounding
such vacant, open structures invite
the dumping of garbage and rubbish
thereupon;
(3) Thousands of structures in
this City are made of wood-frame
construction which is more flammable than other building types;
(4) Thousands of structures in
this City are situated on narrow lots
and in close proximity to one another, thereby increasing the risk of
conflagration and spread of insect
and rodent infestation;
(5) Population loss and economic
decline experienced by the City in
recent years has caused the incidence of vacant, open structures to
increase significantly;
(6) Such vacant, open structures
often become dilapidated because
they are not repaired by the owners
or persons in control of said structures;
(7) Structures that are vacant and
open to entry depress the market
value of surrounding properties;
(8) The existence of certain hazardous conditions may require a
structure to be vacated; such conditions include but are not limited to:
A. Danger of structural collapse;
B. Inadequate heat or use of dangerous heating mechanism;
C. Danger of fire; and
D. Lack of plumbing in safe working order.
(9) Structures that remain boarded for an extended period of time
contribute
to
blight,
cause
a
decrease in neighboring property
values, create targets for arson, and
lead to the cancellation of homeowners’ insurance for neighboring
property owners.
(b) Declaration of Nuisance.
All buildings or structures which
are injurious to or a menace to the
public health, safety or welfare, or
are structurally unsafe, unsanitary
or not provided with adequate safe
egress, or which constitute a fire
hazard, or which are vacant and
open to public entry, or which are
otherwise dangerous to human life
or injurious to the public, or which
in relation to existing use constitute
a hazard to the public health, safety or welfare by reason of inadequate
maintenance,
dilapidation,
obsolescence or abandonment, are,
severally, for the purposes of this
Building Code, declared to be “unsafe structures”. All such unsafe
structures or conditions are hereby

945

23
declared to be public nuisances. The
public nuisance shall be abated by
correction of the violations to the
minimum standards of the Codified
Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
applicable City rules and regulations, the Ohio Revised Code, and
Ohio Administrative Code including
the Ohio Building Code, or by demolition.
(c) Effective Boarding Pending
Rehabilitation
(1) Permits:
Pending the correction of the violations to the minimum standards of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, applicable City
rules and regulations, the Ohio
Revised Code, and the Ohio Administrative Code, including the Ohio
Building Code, the owner of a structure
may
secure
the
structure
through effective boarding. In order
to effectively board the structure,
the owner of the structure shall
apply, within seven (7) days of
receiving a notice of violation, to
the Division of Building and Housing for a permit to board. The Division of Building and Housing shall
review the condition of the structure, determine if it can be effectively boarded, and grant or deny
the owner’s permit to board, setting
forth special requirements, if any,
necessary for compliance with minimum standards for effective boarding. The owner shall effectively
board the structure within seven (7)
days of the issuance of a boarding
permit, or within such other time
limit that the Commissioner deems
appropriate. Structures which are
boarded without first obtaining a
boarding permit shall continue to be
considered public nuisances subject
to demolition. Within thirty (30)
days of the issuance of a permit to
board, the owner of the structure
shall apply for a rehabilitation permit pursuant to Section 3105.06 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976. The Commissioner
may grant an extension of time for
acquiring a rehabilitation permit
upon the owner’s written request
and for good cause shown. Failure
of the owner to obtain a rehabilitation permit subsequent to effective
boarding will result in the structure
being deemed a public nuisance, and
scheduled for demolition.
(2) Materials:
The effective boarding of a structure shall include, but not be limited to, doors, windows, or other areas
of the structure open to ingress and
egress and to weather elements at
any and all levels of the structure.
Such openings shall be secured by
plywood, not less than one-half inch
(1/2") thick, or other material of
equal strength, cut and fit into the
openings. Openings in excess of
forty-eight inches (48") wide shall
be framed with two inch by four
inch (2" x 4") lumber and plywood,
or
equivalent
material
fastened
twenty-four inches (24") on center
onto frame. The plywood or equivalent material shall be fastened into
the openings by screw type nails or
lag screws.
(3) Maintenance:
Upon
effectively
boarding
the
structure, the owner shall monitor
and maintain the structure and its
surrounding premises in a safe, sanitary and secured condition. Any
portion of the exterior structure
which is deemed to be potentially
hazardous due to deteriorated conditions,
or
to
be
structurally
unsound shall be removed or treated in such a manner so as to elim-

24
inate
the
hazard.
The
exterior
premises shall be maintained free of
high weeds, debris, junk vehicles,
and conditions that may provide
harborage for rodents. Failure of
the owner to properly maintain the
building in the above condition, will
result in the structure being deemed
a public nuisance, and scheduled for
demolition.
(4) Rehabilitation;
Rehabilitation of the structure
shall commence within ninety (90)
days of receiving a rehabilitation
permit pursuant to Section 3105.06 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976. If rehabilitation of
the effectively boarded structure
does not commence within this time
period, or if the rehabilitation permit is otherwise invalidated or
revoked,
then
the
Commissioner
may declare that the nuisance has
not been abated and schedule the
structure for demolition.
(d) Examination and Condemna tion.
(1) The Commissioner is authorized to examine or cause to be
examined every building or other
structure reported to be unsafe or
damaged or injurious to or a menace to the public, and shall make a
written record of such examination.
(2) The Commissioner may designate as a public nuisance those particular
structures
or
conditions
found to be unsafe pursuant to subsection (b) hereof.
(3) The Commissioner may also
declare that a nuisance structure
which, due to its advanced state of
dilapidation, substantial fire damage or structural infirmity, is an
immediate hazard to human life or
health, may only be abated by immediate repair and rehabilitation to the
minimum standards of the Codified
Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
applicable City rules and regulations, the Ohio Revised Code, and
Ohio Administrative Code including
the Ohio Building Code, or by demolition.
(4) Whenever the Commissioner
finds a vacant structure open to
entry at doors, windows or other
points accessible to the general public, he may cause the structure to be
secured at those points of entry. The
Commissioner shall be authorized at
any time to enter upon the premises to secure the structure in order
to lessen the severity of the public
nuisance. In securing such structure, the Commissioner may call
upon any department, division or
bureau of the City for whatever
assistance may be necessary, or
may, by private contract, secure
such structure. Such securing shall
not be deemed to constitute “effective boarding” pursuant to subsection (b) hereof, and it does not
abate the nuisance condition of an
unsafe structure, as declared pursuant to subsection (d)(2) hereof,
unless so declared in writing by the
Commissioner.
Subsequent
notice,
issued pursuant to subsection (e)(1)
below, shall include the fact that
the Commissioner has found it necessary to take appropriate action to
secure the structure.
(e) Notice of Violation
(1) Whenever the Commissioner
finds a building, structure or portion thereof to be unsafe and determines it to be a public nuisance, he
shall forward by certified mail to
the owner, agent or person in control of such building, structure or
portion thereof and to any mortgagee of record a written notice of
violation stating the defects there-

The City Record
of. Such notice of violation shall
require the owner within a stated
time to abate the nuisance condition
of such structure by correction of
the violations and defects to the
minimum standards of the Codified
Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
applicable City rules and regulations, the Ohio Revised Code, and
Ohio Administrative Code including
the Ohio Building Code, or by demolition and removal of the building,
structure, or portion thereof. The
notice also shall state that if the
nuisance is not abated within the
required time that the Commissioner may take appropriate action to
take repair or maintenance measures to abate the public nuisance
and that the owner, agent or person
in control shall be responsible for
the cost of the repair or maintenance measures.
(2) If the person to whom such
notice and order is addressed is not
found after a reasonable and diligent search, then such notice and
order shall be sent by certified mail
to his tax mailing address, if available, as indicated on the County tax
duplicate, and a copy of such notice
shall be posted in a conspicuous
place on the premises to which it
relates. Such mailing and posting
shall be deemed legal service of
such notice.
(3) An owner or agent or person
in control of such structure or building, a mortgagee of record, or a lien
holder of record who has received a
notice of violation or a notice to
make corrections to the minimum
standards of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
applicable City rules and regulations, the Ohio Revised Code, and
Ohio Administrative Code including
the Ohio Building Code, or to demolish and remove, as provided for in
this section, shall inform prospective purchasers, vendees, grantees,
assignees, lessees, or land contractees thereof of such notice of
violation or the notice to make corrections, or to demolish and remove.
No person shall transfer to a vendee,
grantee, assignee, lessee, land contractee or any other transferee any
interest in a building, structure or
portion thereof after receiving a
notice of violation to make corrections, or to demolish and remove the
same, without first providing the
transferee with a copy of such
notice.
(4) A. No person, agent, firm or
corporation shall sell, by land contract or otherwise, any interest in
any structure or building without
furnishing the buyer, prior to the
sale a copy of any outstanding
notice or order from the City, including any notice of violation or any
outstanding notice to make corrections to the minimum standards of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio 1976, applicable City rules
and regulations, the Ohio Revised
Code including the Ohio Building
Code, or any outstanding notice to
demolish and remove.
No buyer or grantee, by land contract or otherwise, shall obtain any
interest in any structure or building
without obtaining from the seller,
prior
to
sale,
the
documents
described above.
B. No person, agent, firm or corporation acting in the capacity of an
escrow agent in any real estate
transaction involving the sale of a
structure or building situated in the
City,
shall
disburse
any
funds
unless the provisions of this division
have been met.

946

May 8, 2002
C. Any buyer or grantee, by land
contract or otherwise, of a structure
or building, shall begin at the date
of transfer to comply with any
notice or order obtained or to be
obtained pursuant to this division
and, within ten days of the date of
transfer, shall notify the Commissioner, in writing, of the actions
that will be taken to comply. The
Commissioner may then establish a
reasonable time to comply.
(f) Vacating Buildings and Pro hibiting Use.
The
Commissioner
may
also
require in the notice issued pursuant
to division (e)(1) hereof that the
building, structure or portion thereof be vacated and not reoccupied or
used until the specified repairs and
improvements
are
completed,
inspected, and approved by the
Commissioner.
The
Commissioner
may cause to be posted at each
entrance to such building or structure a notice as follows: “THIS
STRUCTURE IS IN A DANGEROUS
CONDITION AND HAS BEEN CONDEMNED AND ITS USE HAS BEEN
PROHIBITED BY THE COMMISSIONER OF BUILDING AND HOUSING.” Such notice shall remain posted until the required corrections are
made or demolition is completed. No
person shall remove such notice
without written permission of the
Commissioner, nor shall any person
use or enter the building or structure except for the purpose of making the required corrections or
demolishing or effectively boarding
the building or structure, or securing the structure pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) hereof.
(g) Right to Appeal.
The owner, agent or person in control shall have a right to appeal
from the notice and decision of the
Commissioner as provided in this
section and appear before the Board
of Building Standards and Building
Appeals at a specified time and
place to show cause why he should
not comply with such notice. Any
notice served by the Commissioner
shall automatically become a final
order if a written notice of appeal
before the Board is not filed in the
office of the Board within the time
set forth in such notice from the
Commissioner. In the absence of an
appeal, all actions taken pursuant
thereto shall constitute a valid exercise of the police powers of the City
of Cleveland.
(h) Noncompliance with Notice.
In case the owner, agent or person in control fails, neglects or
refuses to comply with the notice to
repair or rehabilitate, or to demolish
and remove a public nuisance or
unsafe building, structure or portion
thereof, the Commissioner may take
appropriate action to demolish and
remove an unsafe structure, or may
advise the Director of Law of the
facts in the case, who, in turn, may
institute appropriate action in the
court to cause correction of the violations and defects, or demolition
and removal, or effective boarding
of such building or structure pending rehabilitation. The securing of
rehabilitation
permits
for
such
building or structure shall not in
and of itself bar the Commissioner
from taking action to abate the nuisance. The Commissioner may, with
respect to any condemned structure,
also take appropriate action to
effectively board such structure, or
to secure it pursuant to paragraph
(d)(4) hereof. The Commissioner
shall specifically state in writing
his findings with respect to such

The City Record

May 8, 2002
structure,
and
shall
determine
whether to secure or to effectively
board, based upon factors which
may include the following: the distance of the structure from neighboring structures, the type of structure, the extent to which the structure is secured, the likelihood of
vandalism or arson, the extent of
the deterioration, the economic likelihood of eventual rehabilitation of
the structure, or cost of securing or
effectively boarding the structure.
In case the owner, agent or person in control fails, neglects or
refuses to comply with the notice to
repair or rehabilitate, or to demolish and remove a public nuisance or
unsafe building, structure or portion
thereof, the Commissioner may take
appropriate action to take repair or
maintenance measures to abate the
public nuisance. The Commissioner
shall specifically state in writing
the findings with respect to the
structure,
and
shall
determine
whether to perform repair or maintenance upon factors which may
include the following: the distance
of the structure from neighboring
structures, the type of structure, the
extent of deterioration, the likelihood of vandalism or arson, the
economic
likelihood
of
eventual
complete rehabilitation of the structure, the cost of repair or maintenance.
Except as provided in subsection
(i) hereof, the Commissioner shall
give written notice informing the
owner, agent, or person in control,
mortgagee of record and lien holders of record of the City’s intention
to demolish and remove the unsafe
building or structure at least thirty
days prior to such intended action
by the City. Such notice may be
effective concurrently with the violation notice. A condemned structure, once effectively boarded by the
owner pending rehabilitation that
subsequently becomes open to entry,
may
then
be
demolished
and
removed, subject to the Commissioner giving written notice as
stated in paragraph (e)(1) hereof
and this subsection (h), upon a finding by the Commissioner that the
structure can no longer be effectively boarded.
(i) Cases of Emergency.
In cases of emergency which, in
the opinion of the Commissioner,
involve immediate danger to human
life or health, the Commissioner
shall promptly cause the building,
structure or portion thereof to be
made safe or removed. For this purpose he may at once enter such
structure or land on which it stands,
or any abutting land or structure,
with such assistance and at such
cost as he deems necessary. He may
request the Director of Public Safety to enforce the orders he gives
that are necessary to cause the
building, structure or portion thereof to be made safe or removed. The
Director of Public Safety has the
authority to enforce such orders. He
may order adjacent structures and
premises to be vacated, and protect
the public by an appropriate fence
or such other means as may be necessary, and for this purpose may
close a public or private way.
(j) Costs.
(1) Any and all expenses or costs
incurred under this section for the
removal, repair, alteration, securing
or boarding of a building or structure shall be paid by the owner of
such building or structure, except
when such expenses or costs are
incurred with respect to a govern-

ment or school building owned by a
governmental entity or political subdivision and are funded by federal
money.
(2) Whenever an inspection is
made after the compliance date stated on a Notice of Violation of the
Building Code, the Housing Code or
the Zoning Code or after a compliance date determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to determine
whether the violation has been
remedied and the violation has not
been remedied, or an additional permit is obtained for work previously
permitted and the original permit
has expired or was appropriately
voided, there shall be charged a fee
of One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) for
each such inspection, except that
this fee shall not apply to one-family and two-family owner-occupied
dwelling structures
(3) If the owner fails to pay for
the costs of removal, repair, alteration, securing or boarding or of
inspections of violations that have
not been remedied within thirty
days after receipt from the Director
of Community Development of a
statement of the charges and costs
incurred therein, the Director may
certify such amount to the Commissioner of Assessments and Licenses.
The Commissioner of Assessments
and Licenses shall make written
return to the County Auditor of the
action under this section with a
statement of the charges for services, the amount paid for the performing of such labor and a proper
description of the premises. Certification to the County Auditor is for
the purpose of making expenses and
costs a lien upon such lands, to be
collected
as
other
taxes
and
returned to the City with the General Fund, with special accounting
thereof in accordance with Ohio R.C.
715.261.
(4) Notwithstanding the method of
collection set forth in this division,
the Director of Law may take any
action necessary to collect the costs
of demolition or boarding from the
owner or other responsible party.

Byrd Bennett, CEO of the School District, and other school administrators
to gain an understanding of the
rationale and process surrounding
the proposed school closures; and
Whereas, since that initial hearing
before Cleveland City Council, there
have been a number of productive
meetings to determine the most
effective manner to educate our children in their neighborhood schools
while dealing with the economic and
administrative constraints facing the
School District; and
Whereas, residents of Ward 13
with children attending Tremont and
Kentucky Elementary Schools are
hopeful that the Cleveland Board of
Education will act fairly and reasonably in dealing with the sensitive
