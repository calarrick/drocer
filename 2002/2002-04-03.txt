FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 610-02.
By Councilmen Cimperman and
Jones.
An emergency resolution renewing Council’s opposition to the transportation of high level nuclear
waste through Ohio and the storage
of such hazardous waste at a site in
Yucca Mountain, Nevada.
Whereas, pursuant to Resolution
No. 145-2000, adopted on January 31,
2000, this Council of the City of
Cleveland unanimously declared its
opposition to the proposal of the
Department of Energy to consolidate
77,000
tons
of
high
level
nuclear waste fuel within Yucca
Mountain, located approximately 100
miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada; and
Whereas, this Council stated its
opposition to the possible transportation of the nuclear
waste by
trucks and rail through Ohio to the
Yucca Mountain site since, at the
time that Resolution No. 145-2000
was adopted, it was estimated that
nine casks a day containing radioactive waste would travel through
Ohio weekly, with a route through
Cleveland approximately 90% of the
time; and
Whereas, Resolution No. 145-2000
called on the Department of Energy
to examine alternative methods for
the disposal of the lethal material
to avoid jeopardizing the safety and
welfare of the citizens of Cleveland
and Northeast Ohio; and

April 3, 2002
Whereas, the federal government
is continuing with its plan to transport high level nuclear waste to
Yucca Mountain and, as such, the
waste will pass through 43 states
within a mile of 50 million Americans putting them at risk for exposure to potential high levels of
radiation due to terrorist attacks,
sabotage, or inevitable accidents;
and
Whereas,
high
level
nuclear
wastes will likely move through
Ohio on I-90, I-480, the Ohio Turnpike, I-70 and major rail lines
through major Ohio urban and farmland areas; and
Whereas,
between
35,000
and
100,000 shipments will be required
during the 25 year emplacement
phase of Yucca Mountain, and most
of these shipments would be routed
through the most heavily populated
areas of major U.S. cities; and
Whereas, according to the DOE’s
own data, between 70 and 310 accidents
and
over
1,000
incidents
would occur during a program of
moving nuclear waste by truck and
the DOE estimates that a shipping
accident with highly radioactive
waste would impact public health
and safety within a 50 mile radius;
and
Whereas, a person standing one
yard away from an unshielded, 10
year
old
fuel
assembly
would
receive a lethal dose of radioactivity in less than three minutes, and
further, the high level nuclear waste
containers that will hold this waste
during shipment have been tested
only in computer simulations and
have never been physically tested
for ability to withstand an accident;
and
Whereas, the transportation of
high level nuclear waste will likely
significantly decrease the property
values of properties along the targeted transportation route; and
Whereas, there is a train accident
in the United States approximately
every 90 minutes and a train carrying hazardous materials runs off the
tracks, spills some of its load and
forces an evacuation about once
every two weeks; and
Whereas, Department of Energy
data indicates that the Yucca Mountain site will fail to contain nuclear
waste and radioactive gases will be
released and radioactive waste will
be washed into the ground water a
short time after the first containers
fail; and
Whereas,
in
1992,
Congress
exempted the Yucca Mountain site
from the EPA standard and instead
enacted a special standard applicable only to that site; and
Whereas, Yucca Mountain is in a
very active earthquake zone and
there have been 621 earthquakes
greater than 2.5 on the Richter Scale
within a 50 mile radius of Yucca
Mountain since 1976, thus exceeding
current Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations for allowing
licensure as a nuclear reactor with
on-site waste storage; and
Whereas, this Council renews its
objection to the Department of Energy proposal to transport nuclear
waste and restates its position that
alternative
methods
of
disposal
must be examined; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure provid-

The City Record
ing for the immediate preservation
of the public safety, welfare and
health; now therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland renews its objection to the transportation to and
storage of high level nuclear waste
at the Yucca Mountain, Nevada and
urges the Secretary of the Department of Energy to declare the site
unsuitable for development of a
nuclear repository now or in the
future, to terminate all work at the
site, and to inform Congress of the
actions being taken.
Section 2. That this Council urges
Congress, the Department of energy
and the state of Ohio to insure adequate national, state and local assistance and appropriations to fund
emergency management activities
for state and local jurisdictions
through which nuclear waste will be
transported well before the first
nuclear waste shipment will take
place and until all shipments cease.
Section 3. That this Council urges
the Department of Energy and the
state of Ohio to diversify our state’s
and nation’s energy portfolio by
investing in and fully utilizing energy efficiency and promoting alternative technologies such as wind,
solar, biomass, low-impact hydro
and geothermal, combined with a
movement toward distributed generation and fuel cells to improve electricity reliability and energy independence.
Section 4. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to transmit
a copy of this resolution to President Bush, Governor Taft, Senators
Voinovich and DeWine, U.S. Representatives
Kucinich
and
Tubbs
Jones, and the Earth Day Coalition.
Section 5. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

An
emergency resolution supporting the passage of Issue 10 for
the
Cleveland-Cuyahoga
County
Port Authority on the May 7, 2002
ballot.
Whereas, the Cleveland-Cuyahoga
County Port Authority has a renewal levy on the May 7, 2002 ballot
known as Issue 10 that is vital to
the
city,
county
and
regional
economies; and
Whereas,
the
Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority was
established to create and retain
jobs in Northeast Ohio, is an integral part of the Port of Cleveland,
and has turned the industrial lakefront into a job producing asset

639

11
and has done so admirably since
1968; and
Whereas, the Port of Cleveland
provides vital low cost transportation
to
the
automotive,
steel,
machinery, raw materials, chemicals, metal processing and other
manufacturing and energy related
industries; and
Whereas, according to credible
independent research, the Port of
Cleveland is crucial to 10,000 maritime and related jobs in the area,
$350
million
in
annual
family
income, $200 million in tax income
for schools and communities, and
17,000 jobs in trade zones; and
Whereas, revenue from Issue 10
will be used to upgrade port maritime facilities, protect local jobs,
help Cleveland and the Greater
Cleveland region to compete worldwide, provide capacity for future
growth in cargo and vessel calls,
and allow the Port to use current
transportation technology to protect
the region’s future economic competitiveness; and
Whereas, Issue 10 is the County’s
smallest levy, will not increase
taxes, and asks the average homeowner to continue a monthly investment of just 37 cents per month; and
Whereas, Issue 10 has earned the
endorsement of Mayor Jane Campbell, the AFL-CIO, the UAW, the
Building
Trades
Council,
the
Greater Cleveland Growth Association and COSE, U.S. Representatives
Dennis Kucinich, Stephanie TubbsJones,
Sherrod
Brown,
Steven
LaTourette,
former
Congressman
Louis Stokes, and Councilman Joe
Cimperman in whose ward the Port
of Cleveland is located; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public safety, welfare and
health; now therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland determines that it
is in the best interest of the residents of the City of Cleveland and
those of Northeast Ohio to support
the passage of Issue 10, a renewal
of a 0.13 mill tax levy of the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority at the May 7, 2002 election.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives

An emergency resolution endorsing working with the County Auditor’s Office to seek refunds from the
State Tax Commissioner for homeowners who have paid the full tax
on property that is exempt pursuant
to the CRA Program.

12
Whereas, pursuant to Ordinance
No. 2831-86, passed February 9, 1987
as amended by Ordinance Nos. 117194, passed July 20, 1994, 959-99,
passed June 7, 1999 and 2095-99,
passed December 13, 1999, and Ordinance No. 1776-A-90, passed April 22,
1991, as amended by Ordinance Nos.
960-99, passed June 7, 1999, 2093-99,
passed December 13, 1999 and 134101, passed August 15, 2001, the City
of Cleveland has established a Community Reinvestment Area (CRA)
Program in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 3735.67
of the Ohio Revised Code; and
Whereas,
the
CRA
Program
allows the City of Cleveland to pursue redevelopment and revitalization of residential property by providing residential tax exemption for
new construction and remodeling of
existing structures; and
Whereas, in order to continue to
receive a tax exemption, a property
owner must maintain the property
and timely pay all taxes; and
Whereas,
pursuant
to
Section
3735.67(D) of the Ohio Revised Code,
“The tax exemption shall first apply
in the year the construction or
remodeling would first be taxable
but for this section;” and
Whereas, because of timing constraints, there is oftentimes a delay
in the delivery of the tax exemption
in the first year that the construction is taxable and this delay causes an undue financial burden on
new homeowners who have incurred
significant costs in the first year of
home construction; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
and the Cuyahoga County Auditor’s
Office have worked cooperatively to
advance the CRA Program and are
in agreement that the tax exemption should be effective the first
year that the construction is taxable; and
Whereas, to that end, the City of
Cleveland and the Cuyahoga County Auditor’s Office will seek refunds
of exempted tax from the State Tax
Commissioner for homeowners who
have paid the full tax on property
that is exempt pursuant to the CRA
Program; and
Whereas the City of Cleveland
and the Cuyahoga County Auditor’s
Office will continue to work together to ensure that the tax exemption
properly applies when it should
apply; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland endorses working
with the County Auditor’s Office to
seek refunds of exempted tax from
the State Tax Commissioner for
homeowners who have paid the full
tax on single family newly constructed property that is exempt
pursuant to the CRA Program and
that the Council urges the State Tax
Commissioner to grant such refunds
where appropriate.
Section 2. That the Clerk is directed to send a copy of this resolution
to the County Auditor and the State
Tax Commissioner.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency

An emergency resolution urging
the airlines to reconsider their plans
to stop paying commissions to travel agents.
Whereas, it has been announced
that Delta Airlines, American Airlines,
Continental
Airlines
and
Northwest Airlines have plans to
stop paying commissions to travel
agents; and
Whereas, the rest of the airline
industry is expected to follow suit;
and
Whereas, travel agents are paid
strictly on commission from various
tour and travel operations, including
airlines, hotels, car rental agencies
and cruise lines; and
Whereas,
air
travel
accounts
make up more than 65 percent of
most travel agencies’ business; and
Whereas, travel agents handle 80
percent of all airline tickets sold in
the United States; and
Whereas, zero base commissions
interfere with the ability of travel
agencies to fulfill their Computer
Reservations Systems (CRS) contract productivity obligations as
travel agents make more use of the
Internet to meet clients’ needs; and
Whereas, that this decision of the
airlines
also
impacts
consumers
because, without question, travel
agents will have to charge travelers
more in fees to make up for the lost
commissions; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the airlines to reconsider their plans
to stop paying commissions to travel agents.

contracts for each or any combination of said items as the Board of
Control shall determine.
Bids shall also be taken so as to
permit an award to be made for provision of such services citywide or

Public Service. Alternate bids for a
period less than the entire term may
be taken if deemed desirable by the

contracts with a term of two (2)
years in lieu of entering into a contract or contracts with a term of one

bids received for a contract or contracts with a term of two (2) years
and the bids received for a contract
or contracts with a term of one (1)
year. The Director of Public Service
shall report to the Chairman of the

The City Record

despite Ohio’s rank as the country’s
seventh largest economy; and
Whereas, Internet usage is lower

comparisons), and is below the
national average (NE Ohio Regional Report on Ohio’s Readiness for
Global Electronic Commerce, Ecom
Ohio, May 2000); and
Whereas, increased computer skills

broader groups like the George

of this Council to assist neighborhood organizations to establish computer centers to provide computer
and Internet access to citizens of

Whereas, Council has been notified by the Director of Liquor Control of an application for the transfer of ownership of a C2 and C2X

Delicatessen, 8315 Woodland Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44104; and
Whereas, the granting of this

this high crime area, which is

qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard

permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health

substantially interferes with public

Res. No. 561-02.
By Councilmen Conwell, Pierce
Scott, and Lewis.
An emergency resolution opposing
the bill passed by the Ohio House of
Representatives that would allow
beer to have twice the alcoholic content and be consumed earlier on
Sundays.
Whereas, last week the Ohio
House overwhelmingly approved a
bill that would allow beer to have
twice the alcoholic content and be
consumed earlier on Sundays; and
Whereas, current Ohio law allows
beer to be bought and sold only if
the alcohol content is below 6 percent by weight; and
Whereas, the House bill would
raise the alcohol content to 12 percent; and
Whereas, the House bill would also
allow beer to be sold beginning at 11

An emergency resolution opposing
the bill passed by the Ohio House
that legalizes carrying concealed
weapons and urging Governor Taft
to veto the legislation if it passes
the Senate.

The City Record
Whereas, last week the Ohio
House overwhelmingly approved a
bill that would legalize concealed
handguns for most Ohioans; and
Whereas, this bill does not have
the support of groups representing
police officers, police chiefs and
highway patrol officers; and
Whereas, the number of crime victims who successfully use firearms
to defend themselves is relatively
small, and more guns lead to more
crime or at least a much smaller
reduction in crime; and
Whereas, in Texas it was found
that the weapons-related offense
rate
among
concealed
handgun
license holders was more than twice
as high as that of the general population; and
Whereas, police officers know
that the very sight of a gun can
escalate a situation and lead to
greater violence and injury; and
Whereas, laws allowing the carrying of concealed weapons have
nothing to do with private firearms
ownership in the home, rather they
relate solely to allowing individuals
to carry concealed guns almost anywhere in the community, including
churches, stores, malls, theaters,
parks, offices, City Hall and other
public places; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes the bill passed by the Ohio House
that legalizes carrying concealed
weapons and urges Governor Taft to
veto the legislation if it passes the
Senate.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
the leaders of the General Assembly
of the State of Ohio.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

An emergency ordinance to amend
Section 161.05 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as
amended by Ordinance No. 96-87,
passed April 27, 1987, relating to procedures for alterations, demolitions,
removals or constructions of designated landmark properties in the
City.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 161.05 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended by
Ordinance No. 96-87, passed April 27,
1987, is hereby amended to read as
follows:
Section 161.05 Regulation of Environmental Changes; Certificate of
Appropriateness
No person owning, renting or occupying property which has been designated a landmark or which is situated in a designated landmark district shall make any environmental
change in such property unless a
certificate of appropriateness has
been previously issued by the Commission with respect to such environmental change. The following
procedures shall apply to all alterations, demolitions, removals or constructions of such property in the
City:
(a) Any application to the Division of Building and Housing for a
building permit for an environmental change shall also be deemed an
application for a certificate of appropriateness, and shall be forwarded to the Commission, together
with copies of all detailed plans,
designs, elevations, specifications
and
documents
relating
thereto,
within seven days after receipt
thereof. An application for a certificate of appropriateness may be
filed by the applicant directly with
the Commission at the same time
that an application for a building
permit is filed or in lieu of filing
for a building permit, if no building
permit is required for the proposed
environmental change.
(b) The Commission shall evaluate
applications
to
determine
whether or not the environmental
change proposed by the applicant
will adversely affect any significant
historical or aesthetic feature of the

The City Record
property and to determine whether
or not the environmental change
proposed by the applicant is consistent with the spirit and purposes of
this chapter.
(1) In evaluating applications for
alterations or construction of property, the Commission shall consider
the following standards created by
the U.S. Department of the Interior:
A. a property shall be used for its
historic purpose or be placed in a
new use that requires minimal
change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and
environment;
B. the historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved.
The removal of historic materials or
alternation of features and spaces
that characterize a property shall be
avoided;
C. each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its
time, place, and use. Changes that
create a false sense of historical
development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural
elements from other buildings, shall
not be undertaken,
D. most properties change over
time,
those
changes
that
have
acquired historic significance in
their own right shall be retained
and preserved;
E. distinctive features, finishes,
and
construction
techniques
or
examples
of
craftsmanship
that
characterize a property shall be preserved;
F. deteriorated historic features
shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature
shall match the old in design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities
and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall
be substantiated by documentary,
physical, or pictorial evidence;
G. chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that
cause damage to historic materials
shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate,
shill be undertaken using the gentlest means possible;
H. significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall
be protected and preserved. If such
resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken
I. new additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction
shall not destroy historic materials
that characterize the property. The
new work shall be differentiated
from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size. scale,
and architectural features to protect
the historic integrity of the property and its environment; and
J. new additions and adjacent or
related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that
if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment
would be unimpaired.
(2) In evaluating applications for
demolition or removal of property,
the Commission shall consider the
following standards:
A. the architectural and historic
significance of the subject building
or structure;

667

39
B. the significance of the building
or structure in contributing to the
architectural or historic character of
its environs;
C. in the case of a request to move
a building or other structure, the
relationship between the location of
the subject building or structure and
its overall significance;
D. the present and potential economic viability of the subject building or structure, given its physical
condition and marketability;
E. if the demolition will remedy
conditions imminently dangerous to
life, health, or property, as determined in writing by the Division of
Building and Housing, the Division
of Fire or the Department of Public
Health; and
F. the appropriateness of the proposed new structure or use and its
impact on the surrounding community.
(c) If the Commission finds that
the environmental change proposed
by the applicant will not adversely
affect any significant historical or
aesthetic feature of the property
and is appropriate and consistent
with the spirit and purposes of this
chapter, or will remedy conditions
imminently
dangerous
to
life,
health or property, as determined
in writing by the Division of Building and Housing or the Division of
Fire or the Department of Public
Health, then the Commission shall
issue a certificate of appropriateness.
(d) If the Commission finds that
the environmental change proposed
by the applicant will adversely
affect any significant historical or
aesthetic feature of the property or
is inappropriate or inconsistent with
the spirit and purposes of this chapter, the Commission may either deny
the application or delay action on
the application. Any decision to
delay action on the application shall
be by mutual agreement of the Commission and the applicant and shall
be for a period not to exceed six (6)
months. During the delay period, the
Commission shall conduct further
investigation with regard to the proposed environmental change, conduct negotiations with the applicant
and any other party in an effort to
find a means of preserving the property, or explore alternatives to the
proposed environmental change. The
Commission may also investigate
the feasibility of all available ways
and
means
of
preserving
the
improvement, including without limitation, inducing by contract or
other consideration the creation of
covenants restricting the use of
property, leasing and subleasing the
property for the purposes of preservation and acquiring by eminent
domain or contract or conveyance
all or any part of or interest in the
property.
(e) At the end of the delay period,
the Commission shall either approve
or deny the application, or delay
action. A decision to delay action, at
the end of one delay period, shall be
by mutual agreement of the Commission and the applicant and shall
be for a period not to exceed six (6)
months. The Commission shall only
agree to a second and final delay
period if the Commission determines
that this additional time period may

40

The City Record

be useful in securing an alternative
to
the
proposed
environmental
change. At the end of the second
and final delay period, the Commission shall either approve or deny the
application
for
a
certificate
of
appropriateness.
(f) Upon the issuance, denial or a
delay in the issuance of a certificate
of appropriateness, the Commission
shall give written notices of the
issuance, denial or delay in the
issuance to the applicant and the
Division of Building and Housing.
The Commission shall provide written notice of the issuance, denial or
delay in the issuance of a certificate
of appropriateness to the applicant
and the Division of Building and
Housing within forty five (45) days
of the receipt by the Commission of
an application from either the applicant or the Division of Building and
Housing.
(g) If no action has been taken
by the Commission on an application for a certificate of appropriateness to approve, deny or delay
action within forty-five (45) days
after such application has been
received by the Commission, the certificate of appropriateness shall be
deemed issued.
