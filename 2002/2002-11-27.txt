Whereas, the City of Cleveland
holds the rights-of-way of the City

and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland is
vitally concerned with the use of the

must be maintained and protected
for the public use in a safe and efficient manner, and managed to promote the public health, safety, and
welfare,
including
the
economic
development of the City; and
Whereas, changes in the public

right-of-way and placement of facilities and structures in the right-ofway; and
Whereas,
in
the
process
of
installing, repairing and maintaining facilities in the City’s rights-ofway, public utility, communications
and other industries are impacting
the rights-of-way in a cumulative
and
repetitive
manner
which
increases the cost to the City to
administer, plan, manage and maintain the utilization of the rights-ofway for the benefit of all users; and
Whereas, it is necessary to appropriately administer the impact of
access to the City’s rights-of-way to
promote
efficiency,
discourage
uneconomic duplication of facilities,
lessen the public inconvenience arising out of uncoordinated work in
the right-of-way, and promote public
safety and welfare; and
Whereas, the City has the authority under the laws and Constitution
of the State of Ohio, including Article 18, Sections 3 and 4, to exercise
powers of local self-government,
exercise police power and to regulate the impacts of use of the rightsof-way within its municipal boundaries; and

owner or to the permittee. Nothing
in this division (a)(5) shall be construed to require the expenditure of
funds or rearrangement of facilities
by a permittee without fair compensation.
(6) Upon reasonable notice of not
less than sixty (60) days, or less in
the case of an emergency threatening the public health, safety or welfare, and at the direction of the

rearrange or reconfigure facilities as
necessary: (i) during any construction, repair or modification of any
street, sidewalk or other public
improvement by the City; (ii) to

practicable, and a part of an overall improvement or project; (iii) if
an additional or subsequent governmental or other public use of the
right-of-way is inconsistent with the
then-current uses of such permittee;
or (iv) for any other lawful cause.
(7) Cooperate with the City in any
emergencies involving the right-ofway.

applicable safety codes. A permittee
shall repair or replace any street,
curb, or other portion of the rightof-way in a manner conforming to
the standards set forth in the Rules
and Regulations. Such standards
shall require permittees to restore

to a condition not less than materially equivalent to its condition prior
to such work and in a manner which
minimizes any inconvenience to the
public, the City and other permittees.

a General Right-of-Way Permit, all
persons holding such a permit are
encouraged to overbuild the installation of ducts and conduit in the

move, remove, relocate or reconfigure temporarily any of the permittee’s wires, cables, poles, or other

who live in a particular area; and
Whereas, in NAACP v. American
Family Mutual Insurance Company,
978 F.2d 287 (7th Circuit 1992), the
court held that redlining in the
insurance industry is a form of discrimination; and
Whereas, it has been brought to
the attention of members of Cleveland City Council that insurance
companies require residents of the
City of Cleveland to pay higher premiums for automobile and property
and casualty insurance than residents of surrounding communities
are required to pay; and
Whereas, such premiums are, in
many instances, significantly higher; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland is
a diverse city; and
Whereas, the practice of requiring
higher insurance premiums for City
of Cleveland residents appears to
have a discriminatory impact on
City of Cleveland residents; and
Whereas, the Housing Advocates,
Inc. has conducted studies to measure the extent of discrimination in
the area of mortgage lending and
property insurance and concluded
that African-American individuals
and Hispanic individuals seeking
homeowners insurance within the
City of Cleveland were more likely
than not to experience some form of
discrimination; and
Whereas, whenever the Ohio Civil
Rights Commission has reasonable
cause to believe that any person or
persons are engaged in a pattern or
practice of resistance to a person or
persons’ full enjoyment of the right
to purchase fire, extended coverage,
or homeowners insurance without
discrimination, the Ohio Civil Rights
Commission is authorized to refer
the matter to the Ohio Attorney General for the commencement of a civil
action in a court of common pleas;
and
Whereas,
the
Director
of
the
Department of Insurance is required
by Ohio law to see that laws relating to insurance are executed and
enforced; and
Whereas, Ohio law provides for
rate regulations; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby requests that the Ohio Civil
Rights Commission investigate the
manner in which premiums for automobile and property and casualty
insurance are calculated to determine if such premiums unlawfully
discriminate against City of Cleveland residents.
Section 2. That, if the Ohio Civil
Rights Commission determines that
insurance premiums are calculated
in a discriminatory manner, this
Council requests that the Ohio Civil
Rights Commission refer the matter
to the Ohio Attorney General for
commencement of a civil action in
the court of common pleas.
Section 3. That this Council hereby requests that the Ohio Depart-

The City Record
ment of Insurance investigate the
manner in which premiums for automobile and property and casualty
insurance are calculated to determine if such premiums unlawfully
discriminate against City of Cleveland residents and to determine if
all insurance laws relating to the
calculation of premiums are being
adhered to by insurance companies.
Section 4. That this Council hereby
requests
that
the
Campbell
Administration investigate the manner in which premiums for automobile and property and casualty
insurance are calculated to determine if such premiums unlawfully
discriminate against City of Cleveland residents and to commence a
civil suit in state or federal court if
such discrimination is found.
Section 5. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to Ohio Governor Bob Taft, Pastor Aaron Wheeler Sr., Chairperson and Commissioner, Ohio Civil Rights Commission,
Jeanine P. Donaldson, Commissioner, Ohio Civil Rights Commission,
Altagracia
Ramos,

Winburn, Commissioner, Ohio Civil
Rights Commission, G. Michael Payton, Executive Director, Ohio Civil
Rights
Commission,
Betty
Montgomery, Ohio Attorney General, and
J. Lee Covington II, Director of the
Ohio Department of Insurance.
Section 6. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it

An emergency resolution strongly
urging the YMCA of Greater Cleveland
to
reconsider
closing
its
Glenville
and
Near
West
Side
branches
and
calling
upon
the
YMCA of Greater Cleveland and
Ken McLaughlin, Executive Director
of the YMCA of Greater Cleveland,
to work with officials and residents
of the City to determine a way to
allow such branches to remain open
in order that they can continue to
provide benefits to the people living
in those communities.
Whereas, the YMCA of Greater
Cleveland has popular, well-used
branches throughout the greater
Cleveland area; and
Whereas, two such branches are
the YMCA branch in Glenville and
the branch on the near west side in
Ohio City; and
Whereas, YMCA facilities serve
the residents of these communities

November 27, 2002
by offering them a place to exercise
and socialize, by providing community-based programs and a safe
place for children to play and learn;
and
Whereas, unimpaired access to a
neighborhood YMCA is essential to
the
well-being
of
children
and
adults alike, not only in the abovementioned
communities,
but
throughout Greater Cleveland; and
Whereas,
closing
either
the
Glenville branch or the Near West
Side branch of the YMCA will have
a serious detrimental effect on the
residents served by those branches
and the communities in which they
reside; and
Whereas, members of this Council
met with Ken McLaughlin, Executive
Director
of
the
YMCA
of
Greater Cleveland, to discuss the
plans to close the Glenville branch
and the Near West Side branch of
the YMCA; and
Whereas, during this meeting,
Executive
Director
McLaughlin
agreed to submit certain proposals
to the YMCA of Greater Cleveland
Board; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby strongly urges the YMCA of
Greater Cleveland to reconsider closing its Glenville and Near West Side
branches and calls upon the YMCA
of Greater Cleveland to work with
officials and residents of the City to
determine a way to allow these
branches to remain open in order
that they can continue to provide
benefits to the people living in those
communities.
Section 2. That this Council supports Executive Director McLaughlin presenting a proposal to the
YMCA of Greater Cleveland Board,
at
its
meeting
on
Thursday,
November 21, 2002, to place a one
year moratorium on plans to close
the Glenville branch and the Near
West Side branch of the YMCA and
on plans to cease providing membership services at these two locations.
Section 3. That this Council supports Executive Director McLaughlin presenting a proposal to the
YMCA of Greater Cleveland Board,
at its meeting on Thursday, November 21, 2002, to establish a committee, appointed by the YMCA of
Greater Cleveland Board and composed of community representatives
and
YMCA
representatives,
to
review plans to close YMCA facilities.
Section 4. That this resolution is

An emergency resolution reaffirming the importance of CDBG
funds and HOME funds and the role
of such funds in improving Cleveland neighborhoods and improving
the quality of life for Cleveland residents and urging the federal government to increase or, at the minimum, maintain the current level of
funding for CDBG and HOME programs.
Whereas, each year the City of
Cleveland
receives
Community
Development Block Grant (“CDBG”)
funds and HOME funds from the
federal government; and
Whereas, CDBG funds and HOME
funds directly aid older urban areas
and help sustain healthy neighborhoods in these areas and, thereby,
enable older urban areas to compete,
amidst
economic
pressures
that
favor rural and non-urban areas,
with surrounding communities, and
Whereas, CDBG funds and HOME
funds are crucial to older urban
areas that seek to preserve an aging
housing stock; and
Whereas, older urban areas have
a disproportionate amount of aging
housing units; and
Whereas, CDBG funds and HOME
funds enable the City of Cleveland
to operate housing, public service,
land reutilization, commercial revitalization, and community development programs that assist Cleveland
residents and improve the quality of
life in Cleveland neighborhoods; and
Whereas, housing programs assist
Cleveland residents in purchasing
new homes and in home renovation
projects and, thereby, improve the
housing stock in the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, public service programs
provide homeless services and AIDS
prevention services; and
Whereas, land reutilization programs assist Cleveland residents in
cleaning up their neighborhoods and
in establishing community gardens;
and
Whereas, commercial revitalization programs provide grant and
support
services
to
Community
Development Corporations; and
Whereas, the federal government
is considering reducing the amount
of CDBG funds and HOME funds
available; and
Whereas,
such
reduction
will
severely limit the number, quality
and scope of programs provided by
the City of Cleveland and will negatively impact the assistance available to seniors, the disabled, and
families at 80% or less of the area’s
median income; and
Whereas, this Council encourages
the federal government to increase
or, at the minimum, maintain the
current level of funding for CDBG
and HOME programs; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,

affordable housing and encouraging
the United States Department of
Housing and Urban Development to
reconsider its decision to change the
subsidized status of Park Lane Villa
apartment complex and encouraging
the United States Department of
Housing and Urban Development to
take any and all action that is necessary to prevent the imminent displacement of families living in the
Park Lane Villa apartment complex.
Whereas, the mission statement of
the United States Department of
Housing and Urban Development
(“HUD”) is to provide a decent, safe,
and sanitary home and suitable living environment for every American; and
Whereas, HUD provides housing
assistance for low income persons;
and
Whereas, according to HUD, 5.4
million households in the United
States live in substandard housing
or are paying more than 30% of
their income on housing costs; and
Whereas, in the City of Cleveland,
50% of the approximately 101,000
rental households pay more than
30% of their income for rent, and
25% pay more than 50% of their
income on rent; and
Whereas, a recipient of SSI, receiving $593 a month, can afford monthly rent of no more than $178; and
Whereas, in the state of Ohio,
9,486
units
of
HUD
subsidized
affordable housing have been lost
since August of 2001 because of
landlord opt-out or prepayments; and

38
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
Consolidated Plan and Cuyahoga
County Continuum of Care recognize
the need for affordable housing
units; and
Whereas, the residents of the
Park Lane Villa apartment complex
located in Ward 6 of Cleveland,
Ohio, are faced with the imminent
danger of receiving HUD vouchers
as a result of HUD’s decision to
change the subsidized status of the
building; and
Whereas, such decision by HUD
may result in the imminent displacement of approximately 185 families living in the Park Lane Villa
apartment complex; and
Whereas, this Council has consistently supported the need and rights
of its citizens to live in safe, decent,
fair, accessible, and affordable housing; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
