Ord. No. 1844-02.
By Council Members Zone and Cimperman.
An emergency ordinance to amend Section 337.031 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended by Ordinance No. 552-96, passed June 10, 1996, relating to townhouse districts.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 337.031 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended by Ordinance
No. 552-96, passed June 10, 1996 is hereby amended to read as follows:
Section 337.031 Townhouse (RA) Districts
(a) Purpose. Townhouse Districts (i.e., Residential Attached districts) are established to provide sites for lowrise development of attached residential units at medium to high densities. Such developments are intended to
serve as a transition between areas of detached residences and areas of higher intensity development or to serve
as a means of clustering housing units on sites which can be developed most appropriately through such clustering.
(b) Definitions. A “townhouse unit” is a single dwelling unit, situated at ground level, served by its own
exclusive exterior entrance, and attached to one or more other such units by fire walls or fire separation walls.
A “townhouse building” is a building composed of two or more townhouse units. The terms “townhouse” and “row
house” shall have the same meaning unless otherwise indicated.
(c) Permitted Uses. In a Townhouse District, permitted uses are limited to townhouse buildings and all main
and accessory uses permitted and as regulated in Two-Family Districts. However, notwithstanding the provisions
of Section 355.05 regarding existing lots of record, lots established for development of attached residences shall
not be developed or redeveloped for detached residences unless such lots meet all prevailing regulations applicable
to the development of detached residences.
(d) Ownership. Townhouse units may be in condominium ownership, where two or more units are located on
a single lot, or in a type of ownership where each unit is located on a separate lot. Each townhouse development shall conform to the regulations applicable to its form of ownership.
(e) District Establishment. The following Townhouse Districts are hereby established: RA-1, RA-2, and RA-3
(with the abbreviation “RA” indicating “Residential, Attached” and the numerals indicating that the districts are
listed in order of “density,” from lowest to highest).
(f) Site Planning and Design. No Building Permit shall be issued for the original construction of a townhouse
unit or townhouse building without approval of the City Planning Commission, which shall seek to ensure that
the development meets the following standards of site planning and architectural design.
(1) Compatibility. The development shall be visually compatible with nearby properties with respect to such
design elements as scale, height, setback, orientation to existing streets, open spaces, roof lines, architectural
style, materials, colors, and proportions of architectural features. Furthermore, the development shall not adversely
affect the use of nearby properties with respect to such factors as pedestrian and vehicular access, privacy, safety, and obstructions to light and air.
(2) Site Layout. Buildings, structures and landscape features shall be arranged so as to create visual interest,
avoid monotony, maximize privacy, conserve natural features, minimize the need for grading, provide for usable
areas of common and private open space, facilitate efficient vehicular and pedestrian circulation, and promote
security and personal safety.

An emergency ordinance authorizing the purchase, lease or lease to
purchase by requirement contract of
various types of heavy duty vehicles
and apparatus for various divisions
of the Departments of Public Service, Parks, Recreation and Properties, and Public Safety.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Public Service is authorized to make
a written requirement contract or
contracts in accordance with the
Charter and the Codified Ordinances
of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, for the
requirements for the period of one
year for the necessary items of various types of heavy duty vehicles
and apparatus set forth in File No.
1845-02-A, in the estimated sum of
$6,250,000, to be purchased, leased or
leased to purchase by the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies
upon a unit basis for the various
divisions of the Departments of Public Service, Parks, Recreation and
Properties, and Public Safety. Bids
shall be taken in such manner as to
permit an award to be made for all
items as a single contract, or by separate contract for each or any combination of the items as the Board
of Control shall determine. Alternate
bids for a period less than a year
may be taken if deemed desirable
by the Commissioner of Purchases
and Supplies until provision is made
for the requirements for the entire
year.
Section 2. That the cost of the contract or contracts shall be charged
against the proper appropriation
account and the Director of Finance
shall certify thereon the amount of
the initial purchase or procurement
thereunder, which purchase or procurement, together with all subsequent purchases or procurements,
shall be made on order of the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies
pursuant to a requisition against
such contract duly certified by the
Director of Finance.
Section 3. That the City may enter
into a lease-purchase arrangement
for the heavy duty vehicles and
apparatus with a bank, leasing company or any other organization that
is not the manufacturer or vendor of
the vehicles or apparatus that submitted a bid for the sale, lease or
lease to purchase described in this
ordinance, provided that:
(I) the
Director of Finance determines that
it is in the best interest of the City
to enter into that lease-purchase
arrangement,
(II)
the
maximum
term of any lease-purchase arrangement does not exceed ten (10) years,
(III) the aggregate principal obligation of the City under the lease-purchase arrangement does not exceed
$7,000,000, (IV) if the lease-purchase
arrangement provides that the lease
payments are to have a principal
component and an interest component, the maximum interest rate for
the interest component does not
exceed seven percent
(7%)
per
annum, (V) the obligations of the
City
under
that
lease-purchase
arrangement for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2002 are subject to annual appropriations being

The City Record
made by the City sufficient to pay
the lease payments and to meet the
other obligations of the City under
that lease-purchase arrangement in
each of these fiscal years, and (VI)
the obligations of the City thereunder for the current fiscal year do not
exceed $210,000, which amount is
appropriated for that purpose. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign and deliver, for and on behalf
of the City and in the Director’s official capacity, such written agreements, certificates and instruments
as may be necessary and appropriate in order to provide for that leasepurchase arrangement under the
terms and conditions authorized and
containing such additional terms
and conditions as are acceptable to
the Director of Finance and the
Director of Law. Those agreements
may include a lease-purchase agreement, an escrow agreement for the
deposit by the lessor of the purchase
price of the vehicles and apparatus,
acceptance certificates evidencing
the City’s acceptance of the vehicles
from the vendors, and certificates as
to insurance, tax compliance and
related matters necessary to carry
out the transaction. The lease-purchase arrangement may provide that
the lease payments are to have a
principal component and an interest
component and that the interest component is to be excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes. In that event, the Director of
Finance and other City officials, as
appropriate,
are
authorized
to
covenant on behalf of the City that
(I) the City will use and will restrict
the use of the vehicles and apparatus leased by the City under the
lease-purchase agreement and will
use, and will restrict the investment
of, any proceeds of the lease-purchase agreement in such manner
and to such extent as may be necessary so that the lease-purchase
agreement will not constitute a private activity bond, an arbitrage
bond or a hedge bond under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (The “Code”), or be treated
other than as an obligation to which
Section 103(a) of the Code applies,
and (II) the City will take or cause
to be taken such actions that may
be required of it for the interest component of the lease payments to be
and to remain excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes and the City will not take or
authorize to be taken any actions
that would adversely affect that
exclusion. In the event that the City
enters into such a lease-purchase
arrangement, the Director of Public
Service may assign to the lessor
under the lease-purchase arrangement, or the lessor’s designee, the
rights of the City under the contracts for purchase of the vehicles
and apparatus authorized in this
ordinance. The Director of Law,
Clerk of Council and other appropriate officials of the City are authorized to sign and deliver any documents, certificates and other instruments as the Director of Law determines are necessary and appropriate
to carry out the transactions authorized by this ordinance.
Section 4. That it is found and
determined that all formal actions
of the Council concerning and relating to the passage of this ordinance
were adopted in open meetings of
this Council, and any of its committees that resulted in such formal
action were in meetings open to the
public in compliance with the law.

Britt.
An emergency resolution recognizing the accomplishments and
value of the Clean Water Act and
declaring October 18, 2002 to be
“Clean Water Act Day” in the City
of Cleveland.
Whereas, maintaining and improving water quality is essential to protect public health, fisheries, wildlife
and watersheds and to ensure abundant opportunities for public recreation and economic development;
and
Whereas,
Cleveland’s
beaches,
streams and Lake Erie are an
invaluable natural resource benefiting local residents and contributing
to a flourishing recreation and
tourism industry; and
Whereas, due to pollution, 53% of
Ohio’s lakes, rivers and coastal
areas are unfishable and unswimmable; and

September 18, 2002
Whereas, wetlands continue to be
lost at an alarming rate within the
State of Ohio and within the City of
Cleveland; and
Whereas, raw sewage discharges
still
flow
through
communities
across the United States, including
Cleveland; and
Whereas, it is the responsibility of
the government and of all American
citizens to provide and protect clean
water for future generations; and
Whereas the Clean Water Act is
the primary federal law that protects our nation’s lakes, rivers, aquifiers and coastal areas and seeks to
ensure Americans will enjoy clean
water safe for swimming and fishing; and
Whereas,
the
quality
of
our
waters has improved dramatically
as a result of cooperative efforts by
federal, state, tribal and local governiments to implement the pollution control programs established in
1972 by the Clean Water Act, as well
as tireless efforts by other non-governmental organizations and citizens; and
Whereas, serious water pollution
problems still persist throughout
Cleveland and Ohio and significant
challenges lie ahead in the effort to
protect water resources from point
and nonpoint sources of pollution
including raw sewage discharges
and contaminated storm water discharges and in the effort to clean
up those water resources that are
already polluted beyond standards;
and
Whereas, the Clean Water Act
continues to provide a clear path for
clean water and a solid foundation
for an effective national clean water
program; and
Whereas,
enforcement
of
the
Clean Water Act is tantamount to
realization of the goals of fishable
and swimmable waters for all; and
Whereas, the 30th anniversary of
the enactment of the Clean Water
Act in October, 2002 is a prime
opportunity to recommit to meeting
the goals of the Clean Water Act;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby recognizes the accomplishments
and value of the Clean Water Act

Res. No. 1755-02.
By Council Members Cintron, Zone,
Cimperman, Coats, Conwell, O’Malley,
Pierce Scott, Westbrook, Sweeney,
Gordon, Lewis, Dolan, Brady and Britt.
An emergency resolution urging
Cargill
Deicing
Technology
to
restore former strikers to their
rightful jobs, urging the Mayor of
the City of Cleveland to refrain from
purchasing salt from Cargill until
the former strikers are returned to
their jobs, and urging the federal
government to investigate Cargill’s
compliance with federal laws and
regulations.

2081

19
Whereas, the right to strike and
bargain collectively without retaliation from employers is a fundamental democratic principle enshrined
in federal labor law; and
Whereas, 165 workers employed
by
Cargill
Deicing
Technology
(“Cargill”) and members of Teamsters
Local
436,
who
perform
extremely difficult labor in the salt
mines under Lake Erie, went on
strike May 6, 2002 to defend their
working conditions, seniority rights
and living standards; and
Whereas, as a result of such
strike Cargill proceeded to hire
armed guards and imported out-ofstate strike breakers; and
Whereas, the workers voted on
August 13, 2002 to return to their
jobs and were told by Cargill that
they could do so; and
Whereas, upon returning to work,
the workers were told that only 26
workers would be rehired and that
the remaining jobs would be given
to the strikebreakers; and
Whereas, this Council considers
such action a violation of community standards of fairness and the
rights of working people; and
Whereas, these actions of Cargill
cause
this
Council
to
question
Cargill’s compliance with federal
safety laws and regulations enacted
to protect workers; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of

Res. No. 1756-02.
By Council Members Conwell and
Brady.
An emergency resolution supporting area seniors in their efforts to
obtain approval from the State
Attorney General of a petition to the
Ohio legislature for a discount plan
for prescription drug prices and
encouraging the State Attorney General to quickly determine the accuracy of the description of the proposed law so that said seniors can
meet the December deadline in
which to obtain signatures to place
the Prescription Drug Fair Pricing
Act before the state legislature during its upcoming session.
Whereas, seven weeks ago, area
seniors submitted a petition to State
Attorney General Betty Montgomery
requesting that she review the
description of a proposed law that
would discount prescription drug
prices for seniors; and
Whereas, the Attorney General
must review and determine whether
the description of the proposed law
is fair and accurate; and
Whereas, after such determination
is made, seniors and other supporters of the proposed law, known as
the Prescription Drug Fair Pricing
Act, may collect signatures in order
to place said proposed law before
the state legislature during its
upcoming session; and
Whereas, supporters of the proposed law must collect 100,626 signatures from half of Ohio’s counties
by December so that lawmakers can
take up the proposal at their next
session; and
Whereas, this Council understands
that this is a complicated issue and
that the Attorney General must
ensure that the language describing
the proposed law is clear; and
Whereas, given the number of signatures required and that there are
less than three months to collect the
signatures, and given that the Attorney General has already had the
proposed language before her for
seven weeks, it is not unreasonable
to request that the Attorney General move forward quickly in making
her determination; and
Whereas,
this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports area seniors in their
efforts to obtain approval from the
State Attorney General of a petition
to the Ohio legislature for a discount plan for prescription drug
prices and encourages the State
Attorney General to quickly determine the accuracy of the description
of the proposed law so that said
seniors can meet the December
deadline in which to obtain signatures to place the Prescription Drug
Fair Pricing Act before the state
legislature during its upcoming session.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to forward a
copy of this resolution to Betty
Montgomery, Attorney General of
the State of Ohio.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force

By Council Member Conwell.
An emergency resolution urging
the Congress of the United States to
spend
more
federal
dollars
on
research for the prevention and cure
of pancreatic cancer and urging that
such research be done in the name
of Gloria Rollins Conwell, a pancreatic cancer patient.
Whereas, the pancreas is an organ
of the digestive system; and
Whereas,
approximately
27,000
people are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer annually; and
Whereas,
approximately
27,000
people die annually from pancreatic
cancer; and
Whereas, pancreatic cancer is the
fifth leading cause of cancer deaths
following breast cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer and prostate cancer; and
Whereas, those that have a history of smoking, high intakes of meat
and fat, cirrhosis, chronic pancreatitis, diabetes and surgery to the upper
digestive tract are more at risk of
getting pancreatic cancer; and
Whereas, for unknown reasons,
pancreatic cancer has great potential to invade and spread very early;
however, pancreatic cancer does not
manifest specific symptoms until
late in the disease, usually proceeding silently and going unnoticed
until late in the disease; and
Whereas,
pancreatic
cancer
is
notorious in its ability to resist
many chemotherapy drugs; and
Whereas, due to difficulties in
diagnosis, the intrinsic aggressive
nature of pancreatic cancers and the
sparse systemic treatment options
available, only approximately 4% of
patients diagnosed with pancreatic
cancer will be alive five years after
diagnosis; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland hereby urges the
Congress of the United States to
spend
more
federal
dollars
on
research for the prevention and cure
of pancreatic cancer and further
urges such research to be done in
the name of Gloria Rollins Conwell,
a pancreatic cancer patient.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to the
appropriate members of the United
States Congress.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency

the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
