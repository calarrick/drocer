Res. No. 191-02.

Jones.
An emergency resolution urging
the prompt passage of Ohio House
Bill 290 and Ohio Senate Bill 127, the
Ohio Prescription Drug Fair Pricing
Act.
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland has supported, by passage of numerous resolutions, the
right to affordable, accessible health
care and the ability to secure prescription medication at reasonable
prices; and
Whereas, it is estimated that one
of four Americans, including 2.2 million Ohioans, have no prescription
drug coverage; and
Whereas, prescription drug prices
are rising twice as fast as the rate

Whereas,
individual
Americans
pay 30% to 70% more than Canadians and Mexicans for the same prescriptions and about twice what the

10
federal government pays for the
same drugs under the Federal Supply Schedule; and
Whereas, U.S. prescription drug

industry in the world, making profits of 18.3% compared to an average
profit of 5% for other industries;

program participants, with the State

and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public safety, welfare and
health; now therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the

such, the loss of the capability to
produce steel domestically poses a
threat to national security and the
nation’s ability to retain a manufacturing base; and
Whereas,
America’s
crumbling
infrastructure needs to be rebuilt and
domestically produced steel could be
used to assist in the rebuilding of
our cities and towns; and

have spiked to 40% of the U.S. market, up from 20% just two years
ago, by selling steel at prices that
are significantly below the cost of
production; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public safety, welfare and
health; now therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the

appropriate remedies to limit the

industry by imposing tariffs that
equalize steel prices for domestic
and foreign-made steel; and (2)

legislative action that will provide
legacy cost relief for the domestic
steel industry.

hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives

it shall take effect and be in force
