ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
____________
Res. No. 1018-02.
By Councilmen Cimperman, Zone,
O’Malley and Jones.
An emergency resolution urging
the state legislature to reenact Ohio
Revised Code Section 4582 .07 requiring
port
authorities
to
publish
development plans and to hold public hearings on those plans and stating Council’s intention to hold hearings on the development and operation of the port.

May 29, 2002
Whereas, the Cleveland-Cuyahoga
County Port Authority was established to create and retain jobs in
Northeast Ohio and has turned the
industrial lakefront into a job producing asset and has done so
admirably since 1968; and
Whereas, the voters passed a
renewal levy for the ClevelandCuyahoga County Port Authority on
the May 7, 2002; and
Whereas, according to credible
independent research, the Port of
Cleveland, which includes the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority, is crucial to 10,000 maritime and
related jobs in the area, $350 million
in annual family income, $200 million in tax income for schools and
communities, and 17,000 jobs in
trade zones; and
Whereas, Ohio Revised Code Section
4582.07,
enacted
in
1955,
required the board of directors of a
port authority to prepare or cause to
be prepared a plan for the future
development,
construction
and
improvement of the port and its
facilities setting forth the location
and character of the work to be
undertaken by the port authority,
and the board was required to publish information about the proposed
plan in local newspapers and then
hold a public hearing on the plan in
which comments from the public
were solicited; and
Whereas, in April, 2001, the state
legislature repealed ORC Section
4582.07, eliminating the requirement
for port authorities to publish development and construction plans and
eliminating the requirement that
public hearings be held to permit
comments on those plans; and
Whereas, while this Council of the
City of Cleveland is supportive of
the mission and objectives of Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority, this Council strongly advocates
that development, planning and proposed improvements for the Port
must be done openly and with input
from the public; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public safety, welfare and
health; now therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland is supportive of
the mission and objectives of Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority and strongly advocates that any
plans
for
the
development
and
improvement of the Port must be
done openly and with input from the
public, and therefore urges the state
legislature to reenact Ohio Revised
Code
Section
4582.07
that
was
repealed in April, 2001.
Section
2.
That
this
Council
intends to hold hearings over the
summer months to discuss and
review the development and operations of the Port Authority and its
impact on the City of Cleveland.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted May 20, 2002.
Effective May 23, 2002.

The City Record
Res. No. 1019-02.
By Councilman Jackson.
An emergency resolution fixing
the summer schedule of meetings of
the Council of the City of Cleveland.
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the schedule of
meetings during the summer months
for the Council of the City of Cleveland is hereby fixed as follows:
July 17, 2002
August 14, 2002
A notice identifying the time of the
meeting as well as a schedule of
committee meetings, if any, to be
held prior to the meeting shall be
prepared by the Clerk of Council
prior to each of the above meeting
dates. The Council will resume regular session at 7:00 P.M. on Monday,
September 9, 2002.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted May 20, 2002.
Effective May 23, 2002.
Res. No. 1020-02.
By Councilman Polensek.
An emergency resolution opposing
loans made by the State of Ohio and
the Cuyahoga County Commissioners and the lease made by the Cleveland Cuyahoga County Port Authority to assist TRW in relocating and
equipping 30 employees to work in
Warrensville Heights as opposed to
Cleveland.
Whereas, it was recently reported
that the State of Ohio and the Cuyahoga County Commissioners have
issued low interest loans to TRW in
order to relocate 30 employees to
Warrensville Heights and to purchase equipment for use by those
employees; and
Whereas, in addition to those
loans totaling $791,000, the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority will lease equipment to TRW for
use at the Warrensville Heights
site; and
Whereas, TRW was once a vital
and integral part of the Collinwood
neighborhood until its management
chose to relocate from the City of
Cleveland leaving many of its workers without employment; and
Whereas, the State of Ohio, the
Cleveland-Cuyahoga
County
Port
Authority and the Cuyahoga County
Commissioners should refrain from
actions, such as making loans and
leases, that encourage businesses
such as TRW from relocating from
the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

1155

17
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland expresses its opposition to loans made by the State of
Ohio and the Cuyahoga County Commissioners and the lease made by
the
Cleveland
Cuyahoga
County
Port Authority to assist TRW in
relocating and equipping 30 employees to work Warrensville Heights as
opposed to Cleveland.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted May 20, 2002.
Effective May 23, 2002.
Res. No. 1021-02.
By Councilmen Westbrook, Zone,
Jones, O’Malley, Cintron, and Dolan.
An emergency resolution urging
the Administration to reestablish
the Fourth of July fireworks display
at Edgewater Park.
Whereas, Clevelanders welcome
the opportunity to celebrate the
Fourth of July holiday by barbecuing, swimming and watching fireworks with family and friends; and
Whereas, traditionally the fireworks display for Cleveland had
been held at Edgewater Park; and
Whereas, for the past two years
the fireworks display was held at a
location other than Edgewater Park,
and that decision proved to have a
negative impact on the number of
Clevelanders that were able to enjoy
the display; and
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland urges the Administration to reestablish the Fourth of
July fireworks display at Edgewater Park so that Cleveland residents
can return to their decades old family tradition of starting their day
with grilling breakfast outdoors and
ending it with marshmallow toasting while watching fireworks over
Lake Erie; and
Whereas, this Council encourages
Clevelanders to join with family and
friends to enjoy a safe and professional fireworks display at Edgewater Park as opposed to igniting
fireworks at home since such displays have potentially dangerous
and injurious consequences; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland urges the Administration to reestablish the Fourth of
July fireworks display at Edgewater Park.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted May 20, 2002.
Effective May 23, 2002.
