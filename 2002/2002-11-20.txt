Whereas,
pursuant

An emergency resolution strongly
urging the YMCA of Greater Cleveland
to
reconsider
closing
its
Glenville
and
Near
West
Side
branches
and
calling
upon
the
YMCA of Greater Cleveland and
Ken McLaughlin, Executive Director
of the YMCA of Greater Cleveland,
to work with officials and residents
of the City to determine a way to
allow such branches to remain open
in order that they can continue to
provide benefits to the people living
in those communities.
Whereas, the YMCA of Greater
Cleveland has popular, well-used
branches throughout the greater
Cleveland area; and
Whereas, two such branches are
the YMCA branch in Glenville and
the branch on the near west side in
Ohio City; and
Whereas, YMCA facilities serve
the residents of these communities
by offering them a place to exercise
and socialize, by providing community-based programs and a safe
place for children to play and learn;
and
Whereas, unimpaired access to a
neighborhood YMCA is essential to
the
well-being
of
children
and
adults alike, not only in the abovementioned
communities,
but

The City Record
throughout Greater Cleveland; and
Whereas,
closing
either
the
Glenville branch or the Near West
Side branch of the YMCA will have
a serious detrimental effect on the
residents served by those branches
and the communities in which they
reside; and
Whereas, members of this Council
met with Ken McLaughlin, Executive
Director
of
the
YMCA
of
Greater Cleveland, to discuss the
plans to close the Glenville branch
and the Near West Side branch of
the YMCA; and
Whereas, during this meeting,
Executive
Director
McLaughlin
agreed to submit certain proposals
to the YMCA of Greater Cleveland
Board; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby strongly urges the YMCA of
Greater Cleveland to reconsider closing its Glenville and Near West Side
branches and calls upon the YMCA
of Greater Cleveland to work with
officials and residents of the City to
determine a way to allow these
branches to remain open in order
that they can continue to provide
benefits to the people living in those
communities.
Section 2. That this Council supports Executive Director McLaughlin presenting a proposal to the
YMCA of Greater Cleveland Board,
at its meeting on Thursday, November 21, 2002, to place a one year
moratorium on plans to close the
Glenville branch and the Near West
Side branch of the YMCA and on
plans to cease providing membership services at these two locations.
Section 3. That this Council supports Executive Director McLaughlin presenting a proposal to the
YMCA of Greater Cleveland Board,
at its meeting on Thursday, November 21, 2002, to establish a committee, appointed by the YMCA of
Greater Cleveland Board and composed of community representatives
and
YMCA
representatives,
to
review plans to close YMCA facilities.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it received

An emergency resolution reaffirming the importance of CDBG
funds and HOME funds and the role
of such funds in improving Cleveland neighborhoods and improving
the quality of life for Cleveland res-

2475

31
idents and urging the federal government to increase or, at the minimum, maintain the current level of
funding for CDBG and HOME programs.
Whereas, each year the City of
Cleveland
receives
Community
Development Block Grant (“CDBG”)
funds and HOME funds from the
federal government; and
Whereas, CDBG funds and HOME
funds directly aid older urban areas
and help sustain healthy neighborhoods in these areas and, thereby,
enable older urban areas to compete,
amidst
economic
pressures
that
favor rural and non-urban areas,
with surrounding communities, and
Whereas, CDBG funds and HOME
funds are crucial to older urban
areas that seek to preserve an aging
housing stock; and
Whereas, older urban areas have
a disproportionate amount of aging
housing units; and
Whereas, CDBG funds and HOME
funds enable the City of Cleveland
to operate housing, public service,
land reutilization, commercial revitalization, and community development programs that assist Cleveland
residents and improve the quality of
life in Cleveland neighborhoods; and
Whereas, housing programs assist
Cleveland residents in purchasing
new homes and in home renovation
projects and, thereby, improve the
housing stock in the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, public service programs
provide homeless services and AIDS
prevention services; and
Whereas, land reutilization programs assist Cleveland residents in
cleaning up their neighborhoods and
in establishing community gardens;
and
Whereas, commercial revitalization programs provide grant and
support
services
to
Community
Development Corporations; and
Whereas, the federal government
is considering reducing the amount
of CDBG funds and HOME funds
available; and
Whereas,
such
reduction
will
severely limit the number, quality
and scope of programs provided by
the City of Cleveland and will negatively impact the assistance available to seniors, the disabled, and
families at 80% or less of the area’s
median income; and
Whereas, this Council encourages
the federal government to increase
or, at the minimum, maintain the
current level of funding for CDBG
and HOME programs; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council reaffirms the importance of CDBG funds
and HOME funds and the role of

neighborhoods and the quality of

An emergency resolution reaffirming the importance and need for
affordable housing and encouraging
the United States Department of
Housing and Urban Development to
reconsider its decision to change the
subsidized status of Park Lane Villa
apartment complex and encouraging
the United States Department of
Housing and Urban Development to
take any and all action that is necessary to prevent the imminent displacement of families living in the
Park Lane Villa apartment complex.
Whereas, the mission statement of
the United States Department of
Housing and Urban Development
(“HUD”) is to provide a decent, safe,
and sanitary home and suitable living environment for every American; and
Whereas, HUD provides housing
assistance for low income persons;
and
Whereas, according to HUD, 5.4
million households in the United
States live in substandard housing
or are paying more than 30% of
their income on housing costs; and
Whereas, in the City of Cleveland,
50% of the approximately 101,000
rental households pay more than
30% of their income for rent, and
25% pay more than 50% of their
income on rent; and
Whereas,
a
recipient
of
SSI,
receiving $593 a month, can afford
monthly rent of no more than $178;
and
Whereas, in the state of Ohio,
9,486
units
of
HUD
subsidized
affordable housing have been lost
since August of 2001 because of
landlord opt-out or prepayments; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
Consolidated Plan and Cuyahoga
County Continuum of Care recognize
the need for affordable housing
units; and
Whereas, the residents of the
Park Lane Villa apartment complex
located in Ward 6 of Cleveland,
Ohio, are faced with the imminent
danger of receiving HUD vouchers
as a result of HUD’s decision to
change the subsidized status of the
building; and
Whereas, such decision by HUD
may result in the imminent displacement of approximately 185 families living in the Park Lane Villa
apartment complex; and
Whereas, this Council has consistently supported the need and rights
of its citizens to live in safe, decent,
fair, accessible, and affordable housing; and
