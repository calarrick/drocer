Ord. No. 737-02.
By Councilmen Jackson, Lewis
and Reed.
An emergency ordinance to repeal
Sections 659.01 through 659.06 and
659.99 and 178.181 of the Codified
Ordinances of the City of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, enacted by Ordinance No.
372-02 passed March 4, 2002, and Section 178.07 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, as amended by Ordinance
No. 2353-93 passed February 14, 1994
and Ordinance No. 372-02 passed
March 4, 2002, and to supplement the
Codified Ordinances of the City of
Cleveland, 1976 by enacting new Sections 659.01 through 659.06 and 659.99
and Section 178.181 thereof, relating
to predatory lending, and to amend
Section 178.07 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976 as
amended by Ordinance No. 2353-93
passed February 14, 1994 and Ordinance No. 372-02 passed March 4,
2002.
Whereas,
many
citizens
from
lower and moderate income neighborhoods in the City of Cleveland
have been unable to access legitimate financing for home purchases
and renovations, allowing predatory
lenders to thrive; and
Whereas, these predatory lenders
are charging exorbitant fees and
interest rates and are persuading
citizens to incur mortgage debt in
excess of their needs or ability to
pay,
often
through
fraudulent
means; and
Whereas, many senior citizens
and homeowners in the City of
Cleveland are targeted by unethical
home improvement contractors, mortgage brokers, mortgage lenders and
finance
companies
engaging
in
predatory lending practices that
result in foreclosure and/or stripping the home of equity; and
Whereas, it is the intent and purpose of this Chapter to protect the
citizens of Cleveland and its neighborhoods from lending practices
which strip hard earned equity from
city residents and contribute to the
problem of vacant and abandoned
houses by making loans that families cannot afford to repay; and
Whereas, it is the additional intention of this Chapter to further protect the citizens of Cleveland by:
(a) collecting and making available to the public information necessary for city residents to protect
themselves against predatory lending practices; and
(b) preventing the lenders engaged in predatory lending and
those persons providing referrals
and services to those lenders from
enjoying the privilege of doing business with the City of Cleveland; and
(c) preventing predatory lenders
and those persons providing referrals and services to those lenders
from taking advantage of city programs designed to encourage home
ownership and home repair; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Sections 659.01
through 659.06 and 659.99 and 178.181
of the Codified Ordinances of the
City of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, enacted by Ordinance No. 372-02 passed
March 4, 2002, are hereby repealed.
Section 2. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
hereby supplemented by enacting

loan means the refinancing of an
existing loan secured by owner-occupied residential real estate in the
City of Cleveland on which there is
situated a dwelling for not more
than four families, a condominium
unit, or a cooperative unit when:
i. More than 50% of the prior debt
refinanced bears a lower interest
rate than the new loan unless the
advisability and appropriateness of
the new loan is certified by a counselor employed by a housing counseling agency approved by the
Department of Housing and Urban
Development;
ii. The borrower’s payment of prepaid finance charges and closing
costs reduces the interest rate but it
will take more than five (5) years
for the borrower to recoup the transactions costs; or
iii. A mortgage is refinanced that
originated, or was subsidized or
guaranteed by or through a state,
tribal or local government, or nonprofit organization, which bears

beneficial to the borrower, such as
payments that vary with income, are
limited to a percentage of income,
or where no payments are required
under
specified
conditions,
and
where, as a result of the refinancing, the borrower will lose one or
more of the benefits of the mortgage, unless the borrower has received counseling from a certified
housing counseling agency regarding such refinancing and the borrower and current holder of the loan
consent in writing to the refinancing.
B. “Balloon Payments”. A loan
that contains a scheduled payment
that is more than twice as large as
the average of earlier scheduled
payments or which contains a provision that gives the lender, in its
sole discretion, the right to accelerate the indebtedness in the absence
of the default of the borrower. The
term “balloon payment” shall not
apply to any loan with a maturity
of less than one year, if the purpose
of the loan is a “bridge” loan connected with the acquisition or construction of a dwelling intended to
become the consumer’s principal
dwelling.
C. “Negative Amortization”. Terms
under which the outstanding principal balance will increase at any
time over the course of the loan
because the regular periodic payments do not cover the full amount
of interest due.
D. “Points and Fees”. The financing of points and fees in excess of
four (4) percentage points of the
total
loan
amount
if
the
loan
amount is $16,000 or greater, or $800

$16,000.

10
E. “Increased Interest Rate”. A
loan that provides for an interest
rate applicable after default that is
higher than the interest rate that

which includes terms under which
more than two periodic payments
required under the loan are consolidated and paid in advance from the
loan proceeds provided to the borrower.

way the right of the borrower to
seek relief through a court of law
or equity.
H. “Prepayment Penalties”. A loan
under which a borrower must pay a
prepayment penalty for paying all
or part of the principal before the
date on which the principal is due.
Any method of computing a refund
of unearned scheduled interest is a
prepayment penalty if it is less
favorable to the consumer than the
actuarial
method,
as
“actuarial
method” is defined in division (A)
of Section 1349.25 of the Revised
Code. The term “prepayment penalties” shall not include prepayment
penalties imposed in accordance
with the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994, 15 U.S.C.A.
1639 (c)(2), as amended, and the
regulations adopted thereunder by
the federal reserve board, as amended.
I. “Financing of Credit Insurance”.
The financing of single premium
credit life, credit disability, credit
unemployment, or any other life or
health insurance, directly or indirectly, into one or more loans.

of
division
(b)(1)(B) of Section 659.02, failing
to receive notice from a counselor
employed by a housing counseling
agency approved by the Department
of Housing and Urban Development

loan transaction and the appropriateness of the loan for the borrower based upon the information provided by borrower and lender to the
counselor at the time counseling is
provided to the borrower.
K. “Lending Without Due Regard
to Repayment”. Except in conformity with the provisions of division
(b)(1)(B) of Section 659.02, making,
issuing or originating a loan without reasonable belief at the time the
loan is consummated that the borrower or borrowers (when considered collectively in the case of multiple borrowers) will be able to
make the scheduled payments to
repay the obligation based upon a
consideration of their current and
expected income, current obligations, employment status, and other
financial resources (other than the
borrower’s equity in the dwelling
which secures repayment of the
loan). A borrower shall be presumed
to be able to make the scheduled
payments to repay the obligation if,
at the time the loan is consummated, or at the time of the first rate
adjustment in the case of a lower
introductory interest rate (i) the
borrower’s scheduled monthly payments on the loan (including principal, interest, taxes, insurance and
assessments), combined with the
scheduled payments for all other
debt, do not exceed 50% of the borrower’s documented and verified
monthly gross income, and (ii) pro-

The City Record
vided that the borrower has sufficient “residual income” as defined in
the guidelines established in 38
C.F.R. §36.4337(e) and VA form 266393
to
pay
essential
monthly
expenses after paying the scheduled

than 30% of the total proceeds of
the loan shall be disbursed to the
contractor at the time of closing; or
iii. at the election of the borrower, by a third party escrow agent in
accordance with terms established
in a written agreement signed by
the borrower, the lender and the
contractor before the date of payment.
However, “predatory loan” shall
not include a loan that is made primarily for a business purpose unrelated to the residential real property securing the loan.
(g) “Home Improvement Contractor” means any person who engages
in the business of making home
improvements, and who undertakes
or offers to undertake or agrees to
perform any home improvement,
whether or not such person is registered, or subject to the licensing
and registration requirements of
Chapter 3107 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland, and
whether or not such person is a general contractor.
Section 659.02 Predatory Lending
Practices Prohibited
(a) Prohibited Conduct.
Subject to the limitations of division (b) of this section:
(1) Issuing Predatory Loans. No
person or business entity shall
make, issue, or arrange a predatory
loan, or assist others in doing so. A
person who, when acting in good
faith, fails to comply with this division will not be deemed to have violated this division if the person
establishes that the compliance failure was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid
such errors, and within 60 days after
the discovery of the compliance failure and prior to the institution of
any action under this Chapter or the
receipt of written notice of compliance failure, the borrower is notified
of the compliance failure, appropriate restitution is made, and whatever adjustments are necessary are
made to the loan to either, at the
choice of the borrower, (i) make the
predatory loan satisfy the requirements of this Chapter, or (ii)
change the terms of the loan in a
manner beneficial to the borrower
so that the loan will no longer be
considered a predatory loan subject
to the provisions of this Chapter.
Examples of a bona fide error
include clerical, calculation, computer malfunction and programming,
and printing errors. An error of
legal judgment with respect to a
person’s
obligations
under
this
Chapter is not a bona fide error.
(2) Lending Without Home Loan
Counseling. No person or business
entity shall make, issue or arrange,
or assist others in making, issuing
or arranging, any loan that is
secured by owner-occupied residen-

822

of
credit
is
received by the creditor; or
B. the total points and fees
payable by the consumer at or
before loan closing will exceed the
greater of eight (8) percent of the

rate change in the consumer price
index that was reported on the preceding June 1, unless that person or
business entity first receives notice
from a counselor employed by a
housing
counseling
agency
approved by the Department of Housing and Urban Development that the
borrower has received counseling on
the advisability of the loan transaction and the appropriateness of the
loan for the borrower based upon
the information provided by borrower and lender to the counselor at
the time counseling is provided to
the borrower.
(3) Payments to Home Improve ment Contractors. A home improvement contractor may not receive
directly and solely from the lender,
the proceeds of a loan that is
secured by owner-occupied residential real property located within the
City of Cleveland on which there is
situated a dwelling for not more
than four families, a condominium
unit, or a cooperative unit, in which
the annual percentage rate of the
loan equals or exceeds by more than
four and one half (4 1/2) percentage points in the case of a first lien
mortgage, or equals or exceeds by
more than six and one half (6 1/2) percentage points in the case of a
junior mortgage, the yield on Treasury securities having comparable
periods of maturity to the loan
maturity as of the fifteenth day of
the month immediately preceding
the month in which the application
for
the
extension
of
credit
is
received by the creditor.
(4) Incorporating Governmental
Financial Assistance Funds. All persons shall be barred from promoting,
utilizing, packaging, or in any other
way incorporating funds from any of
the programs administered by the

or other agreement entered into by
the City with any person or business
entity shall contain a provision
requiring that the person or business
entity, in the administration of governmental housing assistance funds,
abide by the provisions of this division as though its administration of

the provisions of this division.
(b) Activities of Certain Financial

April 24, 2002
presence
of
a
loan
provision
described in divisions (f)(2)(B), (C)

that funds a home improvement loan
shall fail to furnish the notice
described in this section. At least

any
home
improvement loan for any work to

the City of Cleveland on which there
is situated a dwelling for not more
than four families, a condominium
unit, or a cooperative unit. Said
notice shall be furnished as a separate document, printed in 16 point
font, with the signature line at the
top of the page, and shall be in substantially the same form as the following, as may be amended from
time to time by the Department of
Consumer Affairs:
IMPORTANT NOTICE TO
CUSTOMERS OF HOME
IMPROVEMENT CONTRACTORS
If you need a loan to pay for home
improvements:
BE CAREFUL. A lender will probably want to take a mortgage on
your house.
You should not borrow more than
you can afford or more than you
need. The loan you are being
offered may be a predatory loan.
You may be eligible for a different
loan which charges significantly
less interest or fees. Be very cautious about consolidating your debt
with a home mortgage. Beware that
if you default on this loan you could
lose your house! In certain cases, it
is now the law in Cleveland that
before you sign a home loan you
must receive housing counseling
assistance.
For the name, address and phone
number of a housing counseling or
legal services agency in your neighborhood, turn this notice over to see
the list of agencies printed on the
reverse side.

The City Record
I received this notice on this date:

of this section, a “home improvement loan” shall not include a loan
commonly known as a “home equity
line of credit”.

Res. No. 742-02.
By Councilman Dolan.
An emergency resolution urging
the FCC to allow local governments
to regulate cable modem services,
and asking the Law Director to file
comments with the FCC in its rulemaking proceeding.
Whereas, Adelphia Cleveland has a
franchise with the City of Cleveland
for the provision of cable television
and related services over its cable
system in the City, and said franchise contains requirements for Adelphia’s use of the rights-of-way of the
City, and requires payment of a franchise fee for the provision of any services offered over Adelphia’s system
located in the right-of-way; and
Whereas, pursuant to its obligation set forth in Ordinance No. 17292000, passed October 16, 2000, Adelphia is constructing an upgrade of
its Cable System, which must be
completed by June 1, 2003, and Adelphia is required under said Cable
Transfer Ordinance to offer cable
modem service to its subscribers in
the City within 120 days of completing and activating portions of
its System Upgrade as it is completed; and
Whereas, cable modem service provides high speed access to the Internet over cable system facilities; and
Whereas, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a
Declaratory Ruling and Notice of
Proposed Rulemaking on March 15,
2002 (GN Docket No. 00-185, and CS
Docket No. 02-52), in which the FCC
seeks comments on its declared policy that cable modem service is an
interstate information service and
not a cable service, and the FCC is
also
seeking
comments
on
the
issues, among others, of: whether
the FCC should preclude state and
local governments from regulating
cable
modem
service,
including
access and franchise requirements
and the payment of franchise fees
on revenues from cable modem service;
whether
the
FCC
should
require cable operators to contribute
to the Universal Service Fund on the
revenues from cable modem service
to promote cable modem use among
low income consumers; and whether
the FCC should allow local governments to impose consumer protection requirements and customer service standards on the provision of
cable modem service; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has the obligation and desire to protect consumers in the City in the
provision of all services offered by
the City’s franchisee Adelphia Cleveland in the City through its use of
the public right-of-way, and its franchise requires Adelphia to pay fees
on
revenues
from
all
services,
including cable modem services;
now therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the FCC not to preclude state and
local authorities from regulating
cable modem services and facilities,
including access requirements, franchise requirements and franchise
fees; rather the FCC must act to protect the right and obligation of state
and local governments to regulate
the rights-of-way in order to protect
the health and safety of their citizens, to provide non-discriminatory
access to the rights-of-way, and to
charge reasonable fees to cover the
costs of maintaining the rights-ofways and protect the public interest
in the services offered through use
of the rights-of-ways.
In addition,

The City Record
this Council urges the FCC to permit local franchising authorities to
impose consumer protection requirements and reasonable measures in
consumers’ interests.
Finally, this
Council urges the FCC to require
cable operators to contribute to the
universal service fund based on revenues from cable modem services.
Section
2.
That
this
Council
strongly urges the Director of Law
to file comments consistent with
this Resolution in the FCC rulemaking proceeding (CS Docket No.
02-52) regarding the appropriate regulatory treatment for broadband
access to the Internet over cable
facilities within the time allowed by
the FCC’s March 15, 2002 Notice.
Section 3. That upon its adoption
by City Council the Clerk of Council shall provide copies of this Resolution to the following: Mayor
Campbell, the Director of Law, the
FCC, and Adelphia Cleveland.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives

all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
