By Council Members Coats and

An emergency resolution recognizing the accomplishments and

declaring October 18, 2002 to be
“Clean Water Act Day” in the City
of Cleveland.
Whereas, maintaining and improving water quality is essential to protect public health, fisheries, wildlife
and watersheds and to ensure abundant opportunities for public recreation and economic development;
and
Whereas,
Cleveland’s
beaches,
streams and Lake Erie are an
invaluable natural resource benefiting local residents and contributing
to a flourishing recreation and
tourism industry; and
Whereas, due to pollution, 53% of
Ohio’s lakes, rivers and coastal
areas are unfishable and unswimmable; and

State of Ohio and within the City of
Cleveland; and

across the United States, including

ensure Americans will enjoy clean
water safe for swimming and fishing; and

The City Record
Whereas,
the
quality
of
our
waters has improved dramatically
as a result of cooperative efforts by
federal, state, tribal and local governiments to implement the pollution control programs established in
1972 by the Clean Water Act, as well
as tireless efforts by other non-governmental organizations and citizens; and
Whereas, serious water pollution
problems still persist throughout
Cleveland and Ohio and significant
challenges lie ahead in the effort to
protect water resources from point
and nonpoint sources of pollution
including raw sewage discharges
and contaminated storm water discharges and in the effort to clean
up those water resources that are
already polluted beyond standards;
and
Whereas, the Clean Water Act
continues to provide a clear path for
clean water and a solid foundation
for an effective national clean water
program; and
Whereas,
enforcement
of
the
Clean Water Act is tantamount to
realization of the goals of fishable
and swimmable waters for all; and
Whereas, the 30th anniversary of
the enactment of the Clean Water
Act in October, 2002 is a prime opportunity to recommit to meeting the
goals of the Clean Water Act; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,

Be it resolved by the Council of

Section 3. Terms of Temporary
Bonds. The Temporary Bonds shall
be dated the date of issuance or
such other date as is designated in
the Certificate of Award but not
later than November 1, 2002. The
Temporary Bonds shall mature on a
date to be determined by the Director of Finance in the Certificate of
Award in accordance with the Director of Finance’s determination of the
best interest of and financial advantages to the City, provided that such
date shall not be later than five
years from the date of issuance of

their date at the rate or rates per
annum set forth in the Certificate of
Award, or if any Temporary Bonds
bear interest at a variable rate, at
the rate determined pursuant to the
method set forth in the Certificate
of Award. Interest on the Temporary Bonds shall be payable on the
dates determined by the Director of
Finance in the Certificate of Award
and until the principal amount is
paid or payment is provided for. If

September 25, 2002
any Temporary Bonds bear interest
at a fixed rate or rates, those rates
shall not exceed eight percent (8%)
per year (computed on the basis of
a 360-day year consisting of twelve
30-day months) and interest shall be
payable not more often than every
six months and at maturity or at
any earlier redemption date. If any
Temporary Bonds bear interest at a
variable rate or rates, those rates
shall not exceed that set forth
below, and interest shall be payable
not more often than once a month
and following purchase and at maturity or at any earlier redemption
date.
In the event that the Director of
Finance determines that the City’s
best interests will be served by
causing all or a portion of the Temporary Bonds to be obligations bearing
interest
at
variable
rates,
redeemable by the City without
penalty or premium on interest
adjustment dates, then the Director
of Finance is authorized to so specify in the Certificate of Award. If
the Director of Finance so determines, then the Director of Finance
shall specify in the Certificate of
Award the method and procedure by
which the variable rate of interest
to be borne by the variable rate
Temporary Bonds shall be determined, whether by reference to a
market index, by a remarketing
agent or otherwise; provided that
the variable rate Temporary Bonds
shall not bear interest at a rate in
excess of sixteen percent (16%) per
annum; provided further that the
maximum interest rate for variable
rate Temporary Bonds during any
period those Temporary Bonds are
held by a provider of a Credit Support Instrument because they could
not be remarketed shall be twentyfive percent (25%). Holders of variable rate Temporary Bonds may be
given the right to tender their variable rate Temporary Bonds for purchase by the City at the times, on
the terms, and subject to the conditions set forth in the Certificate of
Award and any tender agreement;
provided that tender rights shall be
exercisable only at such times as a
Credit Support Instrument is in
place that provides for the payment
of the purchase price payable to the
tendering holder of a variable rate
Temporary Bond. If the Director of
Finance designates any Temporary
Bonds as variable rate Temporary
Bonds, and if the holders of the variable rate Temporary Bonds are to be
entitled to tender the variable rate
Temporary Bonds for purchase, then
the Director of Finance shall also
designate
in
the
Certificate
of
Award for those variable rate Temporary
Bonds
the
provider
or
providers for any Credit Support
Instrument, the tender agent or
agents and the remarketing agent
or agents, which designations shall
be based on the determination of the
Director of Finance that the parties
so designated possess the requisite
resources and experience to provide
the services required of them and
that the terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide
such services are fair and commercially reasonable. The Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements in connection with the
delivery of the variable rate Temporary Bonds, and from time to time

The City Record
thereafter so long as the variable
rate Temporary Bonds are outstanding with providers of Credit Support
Instruments, tender agents (which
may be the Registrar), remarketing
agents (which may be the Original
Purchaser), and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the method of
determining the variable interest
rates permitting holders the right of
tender, providing for liquidity or
credit support for the payment of
the variable rate Temporary Bonds
upon tender for purchase or redemption, and providing for the repayment by the City of any amounts
drawn under the Credit Support
Instrument.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of
the Temporary Bonds, and regardless of the Temporary Bonds bearing interest at variable or fixed
rates, is authorized to contract for a
Credit Support Instrument and to
pay the costs of it from proceeds of
the Temporary Bonds, if the Director of Finance determines that the
Credit
Support
Instrument
will
result in a savings in the cost of
this financing to the City.
Section
4.
Payment
of
Debt
Charges on the Temporary Bonds.
The debt charges on the Temporary
Bonds shall be payable in lawful
money of the United States of America, or in Federal Reserve funds of
the United States of America as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance in the Certificate of Award,
and shall be payable, without deduction for the services of the Registrar as the City’s paying agent. If
agreed to by the Original Purchaser, the Temporary Bonds shall be
subject to redemption without penalty or premium at the option of the
City in whole or in part at any time
prior to maturity as provided in this
Ordinance and the Certificate of
Award.
If fewer than all of the Temporary Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Temporary Bonds of that maturity
to be redeemed, or portions thereof
in amounts of the minimum authorized denomination (as set forth in
Section 8 hereof) or any integral
multiple thereof, shall be made by
lot in a manner determined by the
Registrar. In the case of a partial
redemption of Temporary Bonds by
lot
when
Temporary
Bonds
of
denominations greater than the minimum authorized denomination are
then outstanding, each unit of principal thereof in the amount of the
minimum authorized denomination
shall be treated as if it were a separate Temporary Bond of the denomination of the minimum authorized
denomination. If it is determined
that one or more, but not all, of the
units of principal amount in the
amount of the minimum authorized
denomination represented by a Temporary Bonds are to be called for
redemption, then, upon notice of
redemption of such unit or units, the
registered owner of that Temporary
Bond shall surrender the Temporary
Bond to the Registrar (i) for payment of the redemption price of such
unit or units of principal amount
called for redemption (including,
without
limitation,
the
interest

2145

45
accrued
to
the
date
fixed
for
redemption), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner, of a new Temporary Bond or
Temporary Bonds of any authorized
denomination or denominations in
an
aggregate
principal
amount
equal to the unmatured and unredeemed portion of, and bearing
interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date as, the Temporary Bond surrendered.
The notice of the call for redemption of Temporary Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers, or other distinguishing marks,
the Temporary Bonds or portions
thereof to be redeemed, (ii) the
redemption price to be paid, (iii) the
date fixed for redemption, and (iv)
the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least 30
days prior to the date fixed for
redemption, to the registered owner
of each Temporary Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Register (as defined
in Section 5) maintained by the Registrar at the close of business on the
15th day preceding that mailing.
Failure to receive notice by mail or
any defect in that notice regarding
any Temporary Bond, however, shall
not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any
Temporary Bond.
In
the
event
that
notice
of
redemption shall have been given by
the Registrar to the registered owners as provided above, there shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, moneys that, in addition to any other
moneys available therefore and held
by the Registrar, will be sufficient
to redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus accrued interest to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Temporary Bonds for
which notice of redemption has been
given. Notice having been mailed in
the manner provided in the preceding paragraph hereof, the Temporary Bonds and portions thereof
called for redemption shall become
due and payable on the redemption
date, and, upon presentation and
surrender thereof at the place or
places specified in that notice, shall
be paid at the redemption price, plus
accrued interest to the redemption
date. If moneys for the redemption
of all of the Temporary Bonds and
portions thereof to be redeemed,
together with accrued interest thereon to the redemption date, are held
by the Registrar on the redemption
date, so as to be available therefore
on that date and, if notice of
redemption has been deposited in
the mail as aforesaid, then from and
after the redemption date those
Bonds and portions thereof called
for redemption shall cease to bear
interest and no longer shall be considered to be outstanding. If those
moneys shall not be so available on
the redemption date, or that notice
shall not have been deposited in the
mail as aforesaid, those Temporary
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been

46
called for redemption. All moneys
held
by
the
Registrar
for
the
redemption of particular Temporary
Bonds shall be held in trust for the
account of the registered owners
thereof and shall be paid to them,
respectively, upon presentation and
surrender
of
those
Temporary
Bonds.
Section 5. Registrar. The Director
of Finance shall designate a bank
or trust company to act as the
authenticating
agent,
registrar,
transfer agent and paying agent for
the Temporary Bonds after determining that the payment at that
bank or trust company will not
endanger the funds or securities of
the City and that proper procedures
and safeguards are available for
that purpose (the “Registrar”). The
Director of Finance shall sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, a registrar agreement or
agreements between the City and
the Registrar (the “Registrar Agreement”) in a form consistent with
this Ordinance and as approved by
the Director of Law. In the event
that a trust agreement secures the
Temporary Bonds, as provided in
Section 10, the Registrar Agreement
may be incorporated in such trust
agreement. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Registrar Agreement
from the proceeds of the Temporary
Bonds to the extent available and
then from other money lawfully
available and appropriated or to be
appropriated for that purpose.
The Temporary Bonds shall be
issued only as fully registered Temporary Bonds. Principal on the Temporary Bonds shall be payable when
due upon presentation and surrender
of the Temporary Bonds at the designated office of the Registrar designated in the Registrar Agreement.
Interest on each Temporary Bond
shall be paid on each interest payment date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Temporary Bond was registered,
and to that person’s address appearing on the Register (defined below
in this Section) at the close of business on the 15th day of the calendar month next preceding that interest payment date or such other date
established in the Certificate of
Award if variable rate Temporary
Bonds are issued. The City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange,
and transfer of Temporary Bonds as
provided in this Section (the “Register”) so long as any of the Temporary Bonds remain outstanding.
Subject to the provisions of this Section, the person in whose name a
Temporary Bond is registered on the
Register shall be regarded as the
absolute owner of that Temporary
Bond for all purposes of the Proceedings (except as may otherwise
be required with respect to the
City’s continuing disclosure agreement pursuant to the Rule). Payment of or on account of the debt
charges on any Temporary Bond
shall be made only to or upon the
order of that person; neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be
affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be

The City Record
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Temporary Bond, including interest,
to the extent of the amount or
amounts so paid.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
and so long as the Temporary Bonds
are issued in a book entry system,
principal of and interest on the Temporary Bonds shall be payable in
the manner provided in any agreement entered into by the Director of
Finance, in the name and on behalf
of the City, in connection with the
book entry system.
Section 6. Transfer and Exchange
of Certain Temporary Bonds. Temporary Bonds may be exchanged for
Temporary Bonds of any authorized
denomination upon presentation and
surrender at the office designated
by the Registrar, together with a
request for exchange signed by the
registered owner or by a person
legally empowered to do so in a
form satisfactory to the Registrar. A
Temporary Bond may be transferred
only on the Register, upon presentation and surrender of the Temporary Bond at the office designated
by the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner
or
by
a
person
legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer, the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate, and
deliver a new Temporary Bond or
Temporary Bonds, of any authorized
denomination or authorized denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Temporary Bond surrendered and bearing interest at the same rate and
maturing on the same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Temporary Bonds only
after the new Temporary Bonds are
signed by the authorized officers of
the City. In all cases of Temporary
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Temporary Bonds in accordance with the
provisions of the Proceedings. The
exchange or transfer shall be without charge to the owner, except that
the City and Registrar may make a
charge sufficient to reimburse them
for any tax or other governmental
charge required to be paid with
respect to the exchange or transfer.
The City or the Registrar may
require that those charges, if any,
be paid before the procedure is
begun for the exchange or transfer.
All Temporary Bonds issued and
authenticated upon any exchange or
transfer shall be valid special obligations of the City, evidencing the
same obligation, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under the
proceedings,
as
the
Temporary
Bonds
surrendered
upon
that
exchange or transfer. Neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be
required to make any exchange or
transfer of a Temporary Bond during the period beginning at the
opening of business 15 days before
the day of the mailing of a notice
of redemption of Temporary Bonds
and ending at the close of business
on the day of such mailing or to

2146

September 25, 2002
transfer or exchange any Temporary Bond selected for redemption in
whole or in part.
Section 7. Book Entry. Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this Ordinance, if it is determined
by the Director of Finance to be in
the best interest of and financially
advantageous to the City, the Temporary Bonds may be issued in book
entry form in accordance with the
provisions of this Section.
The Temporary Bonds may be
issued to a Depository for use in a
book entry system and, if and as
long as a book entry system is utilized, (i) the Temporary Bonds may
be issued in the form of a single,
fully registered Temporary Bond
representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered
owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository; (ii) the book
entry interest owners of Temporary
Bonds in book entry form shall have
no
right
to
receive
Temporary
Bonds in the form of physical securities or certificates; (iii) ownership
of book entry interests in book
entry form shall be shown by book
entry on the system maintained and
operated by the Depository and its
participants, and transfers of the
ownership of book entry interests
shall be made only by book entry
by the Depository and its Participants;
and
(iv)
the
Temporary
Bonds as such shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for
transfer to another Depository or to
another nominee of a Depository,
without further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Temporary Bonds for use in
a book entry system, the Director of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Director of Finance, after
making provision for notification of
the book entry interest owners by
the then Depository and any other
arrangements
deemed
necessary,
shall permit withdrawal of the Temporary Bonds from the Depository,
and authenticate and deliver certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance also is
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the Temporary Bonds, after determining
that the signing thereof will not
endanger the funds or securities of
the City and after the approval of
the form of any such agreement by
the Director of Law.
Section 8. Execution of Temporary
Bonds. Temporary Bonds shall be
signed by the Mayor and the Director of Finance, in the name of the
City and in their official capacities,
provided that either or both of those
signatures may be a facsimile, and
shall bear the seal of the City or a
facsimile thereof; provided that no

September 25, 2002
Temporary Bond shall be valid or
obligatory for any purpose or shall
be entitled to any security or benefit under the Proceedings unless and
until the certificate of authentication printed on the Temporary Bond
is signed by the Registrar as
authenticating agent, and authentication by the Registrar shall be conclusive evidence that the Temporary
Bond so authenticated has been duly
issued, signed and delivered under
and is entitled to the security and
benefit of the Proceedings. The certificate of authentication may be
signed by any authorized officer or
employee of the Registrar or by any
other person acting as an agent of
the Registrar and approved by the
Director of Finance on behalf of the
City. The same person need not sign
the certificate of authentication on
all of the Temporary Bonds.
Pursuant to Section 83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
shall prepare the Temporary Bonds
and
shall
endorse
thereon
his
approval of the form and correctness
thereof by his manual or facsimile
signature. The Temporary Bonds
shall be issued in the denominations
as requested by the Original Purchaser and approved by the Director
of Finance, in conformity with this
Ordinance.
The
entire
principal
amount may be represented by a single bond certificate and may be
issued as fully registered securities
and in book entry or other uncertificated form if it is determined by
the
Director
of
Finance
that
issuance of fully registered securities in that form will facilitate the
sale and delivery of the Temporary
Bonds. The Temporary Bonds may
be issued in the authorized denominations of either (a) $100,000 each
or in any denomination that is the
sum of (i) $100,000 and (ii) $5,000 or
any integral multiple thereof, and
not exchangeable for other Temporary Bonds in denominations less
than $100,000, or (b) $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, as determined by the Director of Finance in
the Certificate of Award to be in the
best interest of the City. The Temporary Bonds shall not have coupons
attached, shall be numbered as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance and shall express upon
their faces the purpose, in summary
terms, for which they are issued and
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 9. Sale of Temporary
Bonds. The Temporary Bonds shall
be sold at not less than 97% of par
plus accrued interest at private sale
by the Director of Finance to the
Original Purchaser in accordance
with law and the provisions of this
Ordinance. If, in the reasonable
opinion of the Director of Finance,
an underwriter is incapable of fully
performing its duties or meeting its
obligations in its capacity as Original Purchaser with respect to the
Temporary Bonds, the Director of
Finance is hereby authorized and
directed, in the name of and on
behalf of the City, to take whatever action may be necessary to terminate that underwriter’s standing
as Original Purchaser. The Director
of Finance shall sign the Certificate
of Award referred to in this Ordinance, evidencing that sale to the
Original Purchaser, cause the Tem-

The City Record
porary Bonds to be prepared, and
have the Temporary Bonds signed
and delivered, together with a true
transcript of proceedings with reference to the issuance of the Temporary Bonds if requested by the
Original Purchaser, to the Original
Purchaser upon payment of the purchase price. The Director of Finance
is authorized to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
a bond purchase agreement between
the City and the Original Purchaser, or representative thereof (the
“Purchase Agreement”), in substantially the form submitted to this
Council with such changes therein
not inconsistent with the terms of
this Ordinance and not substantially adverse to the City as approved
by the Director of Finance and
Director of Law, such approval to be
conclusively evidenced by the execution of the Purchase Agreement
by such officers. The Director of
Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and
for
reimbursement
of
expenses
incurred pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement from the proceeds of the
Temporary Bonds to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or as may be appropriated
for that purpose. The Mayor, the
Director of Finance, the Clerk of
Council, the Director of Law, and
other City officials, as appropriate,
are each authorized and directed to
sign
any
transcript
certificates,
financial statements and other documents and instruments and to take
such actions as are necessary or
appropriate
to
consummate
the
transactions contemplated by this
Ordinance.
Section 10. Security for the Temporary Bonds. The Temporary Bonds
shall be special obligations of the
City, and the debt charges on the
Temporary Bonds shall be payable
solely from the Revenues and the
Nontax Revenues. The Payment of
debt charges on the Temporary
Bonds is secured by a pledge of and
lien on (i) the Revenues and (ii) the
Nontax Revenues which are on
deposit in the Urban Renewal Debt
Retirement Fund created below. The
Temporary Bonds are not and shall
not be secured by an obligation or
pledge of any money raised by taxation. The Temporary Bonds do not
and shall not represent or constitute
a debt or pledge of the faith and
credit or taxing power of the City,
and the owners thereof have and
shall have no right to have taxes
levied by the City for the payment
of debt charges thereon. The Temporary Bonds shall contain a statement to that effect and to the effect
that
the
Temporary
Bonds
are
payable solely from the Revenues
and the Nontax Revenues and are
not secured by an obligation or
pledge of any money raised by taxation.
The City covenants and agrees
that while the Temporary Bonds are
outstanding, it will appropriate and
maintain Nontax Revenues at such
times and in such amounts as will
be sufficient, together with the Revenues and any other funds available
or to be available for the purpose
(including proceeds of refunding
obligations),
to
pay
the
debt
charges on the Temporary Bonds

2147

47
and will so restrict other obligations
payable from Nontax Revenues prior
to or on a parity with the Temporary Bonds as will ensure the continuing availability for appropriation of sufficient Nontax Revenues
to pay debt charges when due,
which Nontax Revenues are hereby
selected by the City pursuant to Section 725.05(C) of the Revised Code
as moneys that are not raised by
taxation.
There is hereby created by the
City a separate fund or account designated as the “Urban Renewal Debt
Retirement Fund” (the “Debt Retirement Fund”) into which shall be
deposited (i) the Revenues upon
receipt, and (ii) other Nontax Revenues, and any other funds available for the purpose, on or prior to
the date debt charges on the Temporary Bonds are due, in an amount
sufficient to pay those debt charges.
Any Revenues remaining after payment or provision for payment, of
all debt charges on the Temporary
Bonds shall be deposited to the
extent not otherwise pledged or
encumbered, as follows: half in the
Housing Trust Fund (Fund No. 14
SF 027) and half in the Neighborhood Development Investment Fund
(Fund No. 10 SF 501).
Nothing herein shall be construed
as requiring the City to use or apply
to the payment of debt charges on
the Temporary Bonds any funds or
revenues from any source other than
the Revenues and the Nontax Revenues.
Nothing
herein,
however,
shall be deemed to prohibit the City,
of its own volition, from using, to
the extent that it is authorized by
law to do so, any other resources for
the fulfillment of any of the terms,
conditions or obligations of this
Ordinance or of the Temporary
Bonds.
The City will, solely from the proceeds of the Temporary Bonds or
from the Revenues or the Nontax
Revenues, pay or cause to be paid
the debt charges on the Temporary
Bonds on the dates, at the places
and in the manner provided herein
and in the Temporary Bonds. For
that purpose, in each year while the
Temporary Bonds are outstanding,
this Council, after providing for the
payment of debt charges payable on
the City’s general obligation securities in that year from sources available for that purpose, will appropriate Nontax Revenues required to
pay, and for the purpose of paying
the debt charges due in that year on
the Temporary Bonds and any outstanding parity obligations payable
from Nontax Revenues. Further, this
Council will give effect to such
appropriations in all ordinances it
passes thereafter in that year appropriating money for expenditure and
encumbrance and limit the other
appropriations of Nontax Revenues
in that year to the amount available
after deducting the amount required
for the payment of debt charges
payable on the City’s general obligation securities and to pay those
debt charges. The City covenants
that, so long as any of the Temporary Bonds are outstanding, it shall
not issue any additional obligations
payable from the Nontax Revenues
on a parity with the Temporary
Bonds and any outstanding parity
obligations payable from Nontax
Revenues, unless, prior to passage

48
of the ordinance authorizing such
parity obligations, the Director of
Finance shall have certified to this
Council that the Nontax Revenues
during the preceding calendar year,
adjusted to reflect, if necessary,
changes in the rates or charges
resulting in the Nontax Revenues,
aggregate in amount not less than
100% of the highest amount of (a)
debt charges on the Temporary
Bonds to be paid from Nontax Revenues and (b) required payments on
such proposed parity obligations
and any outstanding parity obligations due in any succeeding calendar year.
Each
obligation
of
the
City
required to be undertaken pursuant
to this Ordinance and the Temporary Bonds is binding upon the City,
and upon each officer or employee
of the City as may from time to time
have the authority under law to
take any action on behalf of the
City as may be necessary to perform
all or any part of such obligation as
a duty of the City and of each of
those officers and employees resulting from an office, trust or station
within
the
meaning
of
Section
2731.01 of the Revised Code, providing for enforcement by writ of mandamus.
In the event that the interest on
the Temporary Bonds is to be provided for from Temporary Bond proceeds, or if in the judgment of the
Director of Finance, after consultation with the Financial Advisor, a
debt service reserve to secure the
Temporary Bonds is in the best
interest of and financially advantageous to the City, the City shall
enter into a trust agreement with
the bank or trust company serving
as Registrar for the Temporary
Bonds and providing for the Debt
Retirement Fund or a debt service
reserve fund, as applicable, to be
held by that bank or trust company,
in its capacity as trustee, and such
fund or funds are hereby authorized.
The Director of Finance shall sign
and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of the City, the trust agreement in a form consistent with this
Ordinance and approved by the
Director of Law. The Mayor and the
Director of Finance and other City
officials, as appropriate, are authorized to take such actions as are
necessary or appropriate to consummate such additional security for
the Temporary Bonds. The City
hereby covenants and agrees to
appropriate annually from the Revenues and the Nontax Revenues into
any such funds amounts sufficient
to maintain the balances required
by the trust agreement and to
restore any deficiency therein.
Section 11. Deposit of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Temporary Bonds are appropriated
and shall be used for the purpose
for which the Temporary Bonds are
being issued. The proceeds from the
sale of the Temporary Bonds (exclusive of amounts to be used to pay
Financing Costs which shall be
deposited in a separate Costs of
Issuance Account) shall be deposited in the Debt Retirement Fund to
be used to refund the Prior Bonds
and, if applicable, to pay interest on
the Temporary Bonds; provided that
any portion of the proceeds of the
Temporary Bonds to be used to

The City Record
make a required deposit to a debt
service reserve fund shall be paid
into the debt service reserve fund
created pursuant to Section 10. Any
premium not used to pay costs of
issuance
and
accrued
interest
received from the sale of the Temporary Bonds shall be deposited in
the Debt Retirement Fund.
Section 12. Disclosure. If, in the
judgment of the Director of Finance,
after consultation with the Financial Advisor and the Original Purchaser, an official statement or
other disclosure document is appropriate relating to the initial offering
of the Temporary Bonds, the Director of Finance, on behalf of the City
and in that officer’s official capacity, is authorized to (i) cooperate
with the Original Purchaser in the
preparation of, and the making of
modifications,
completions
or
changes of or supplements to, such
a disclosure document, (ii) determine, and to certify or otherwise
represent, when the disclosure document is to be deemed final or is
final, (iii) authorize the use and distribution of that disclosure document and any supplements thereto
in connection with the initial offering of the Temporary Bonds, (iv)
notwithstanding the requirements
of, and as an exception to, Codified
Ordinance 177.01(a), contract with a
printer to print the Official Statement, and (v) sign certificates,
statements or other documents in
connection with the finality, accuracy, and completeness of that disclosure document.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Temporary Bonds, the City
agrees, as the only obligated person
with
respect
to
the
Temporary
Bonds under the Rule, to provide or
cause to be provided such financial
information
and
operating
data,
audited financial statements and
notices, in such manner as may be
required for purposes of paragraph
(b)(5)(i) of the Rule. In order to
describe and specify certain terms
of the City’s continuing disclosure
agreement for that purpose and
thereby to implement that agreement,
including
provisions
for
enforcement, amendment, and termination, the Director of Finance is
authorized and directed to sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, and if required under
the Rule, a Continuing Disclosure
Certificate or Certificates in conformance with the reporting requirements of the Rule. The agreement
formed collectively, by this paragraph and that Certificate, shall be
the
City’s
continuing
disclosure
agreement for purposes of the Rule,
and its performance shall be subject
to the annual appropriation of any
funds that may be necessary to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of the
occurrence of any other events, the
Director of Finance shall consult
with, as appropriate, the legal counsel and bond or other qualified

2148

September 25, 2002
independent special counsel to the
City. The Director of Finance, acting in the name and on behalf of
the City, shall be entitled to rely
upon any legal advice provided by
any such counsel in determining
whether a filing should be made.
Section 13. Ratings, Insurance,
and Other Credit Enhancement. If,
in the judgment of the Director of
Finance after consultation with the
Financial Advisor, the filing of an
application for a rating on the Temporary Bonds by one or more nationally recognized rating agencies or a
Credit Support Instrument is in the
best interest of, and financially
advantageous to the City, the Director of Finance is authorized to prepare and submit those applications,
to provide to each such agency, company or credit provider such information as may be required for the
purpose. The cost of obtaining each
rating and Credit Support Instrument, except to the extent paid by
the Original Purchaser in accordance with the Purchase Agreement,
shall be paid from the proceeds of
the Temporary Bonds.
Section 14. Interest Rate Swaps,
Hedges and Caps. For the purpose
of achieving the optimal available
debt structure for the Temporary
Bonds, the Director of Finance may,
based on the written advice of the
Financial Advisor, enter into one or
more
agreements
in
connection
with or subsequent to the issuance
of the Temporary Bonds for an
interest rate swap, an interest rate
cap or other such arrangement to
lower the effective interest rate on
the obligation to the City or, to
hedge the exposure of the City
against fluctuations in prevailing
interest rates, provided, however,
that: (i) the debt structure that is
simulated through the combination
of the Temporary Bonds with any
such agreements shall comply with
the restrictions of this Ordinance on
the terms of and security for the
Temporary Bonds applied to that
structure as though it consisted
solely of Temporary Bonds; (ii) the
counterparty to any swap agreement and the provider of any interest rate cap shall have a rating of
at least “A” by either Moody’s
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard
& Poor’s Corporation; (iii) no such
agreement shall purport to entitle
the counterparty to the agreement
to payment by the City from any
source other than the sources which
secure the Temporary Bonds as
described in this Ordinance; and
(iv) the cost of obtaining any such
interest rate cap or other such
arrangement shall have been determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of the
Financial Advisor, to be justified
by the corresponding benefit to the
City and to be commercially reasonably based on then current market
conditions.
The
notional
amount on which any such agreement is based shall not be subject
to the limitations set forth herein
on the maximum principal amount
of the Temporary Bonds.
Section 15. Covenants. In the event
that
the
Temporary
Bonds
are
issued and sold as obligations bearing interest that is excluded from

September 25, 2002
gross income for federal income tax
purposes, the covenants in this Section 15 shall govern. However, if the
Temporary Bonds are issued and
sold as obligations bearing interest
that is included in gross income for
federal income tax purposes, the
City shall not be bound by the
covenants
of
this
Section
with
respect to the Temporary Bonds.
Subject to the foregoing, the City
covenants that it will use and will
restrict the use and investment of,
the proceeds of the Temporary
Bonds in such manner and to such
extent as may be necessary so that
(a) the Temporary Bonds will not
(i) constitute private activity bonds,
arbitrage bonds or hedge bonds
under Sections 141, 148 or 149 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”) or (ii) be
treated other than as bonds to which
Section 103(a) of the Code applies,
and (b) the interest on the Temporary Bonds will not be treated as an
item of tax preference under Section
57 of the Code. The City further
covenants that (a) it will take or
cause to be taken such actions that
may be required of it for the interest on the Temporary Bonds to be
and remain excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will not take or authorize to be taken any actions that
would adversely affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting
for it, will, among other acts of compliance, (i) apply the proceeds of
the Temporary Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing,
(ii) restrict the yield on investment
property, (iii) make timely and adequate payments to the federal government, (iv) maintain books and
records and make calculations and
reports, and (v) refrain from certain
uses of those proceeds, and, as
applicable,
of
property
financed
with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the extent necessary to
assure such exclusion of that interest under the Code.
The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer of
the City having responsibility for
issuance of the Temporary Bonds is
hereby authorized (a) to make or
effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or
waiver on behalf of the City with
respect to the Temporary Bonds as
the City is permitted to or required
to make or give under the federal
income tax laws, including, without
limitation thereto, any of the elections
provided
for
in
Section
148(f)(4)(C) of the Code or available under Section 148 of the Code,
for the purpose of assuring, enhancing or protecting the favorable tax
treatment or status of the Temporary Bonds or interest thereon or
assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose, reducing the
burden or expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or
payments or penalties, or making
payments of special amounts in lieu
of making computations to determine, or paying excess earnings as
rebate, or obviating those amounts
or payments, as determined by that
officer, which action shall be in
writing and signed by the officer,
(b) to take any and all other
actions, make or obtain calculations,
make payments, and make or give
reports, covenants and certifications

The City Record
of and on behalf of the City, as may
be appropriate to assure the exclusion of interest from gross income
and the intended tax status of the
Temporary Bonds, and (c) to give
one or more appropriate certificates
of the City, for inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Temporary Bonds, setting forth the reasonable expectations of the City
regarding the amount and use of all
the proceeds of the Temporary
Bonds, the facts, circumstances and
estimates on which they are based
and other facts and circumstances
relevant to the tax treatment of the
interest on and the tax status of the
Temporary Bonds.

An emergency ordinance authorizing the purchase by one or more
requirement contracts of maintenance for telephones, products and
ancillary equipment, for the Division of Information Systems Services, Department of Finance for a
period of one year.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of

Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

Finance is authorized to make one
or more written requirement contracts in accordance with the Charter and the Codified Ordinances of
