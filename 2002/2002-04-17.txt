VETO
File No. 130-02-A.
April 10, 2002
By Hand Delivery
The Honorable Frank G. Jackson
President of Council
601 Lakeside Avenue
Cleveland, Ohio 44114
RE: Ordinance No. 130-02
Dear Council President Jackson:
I return to you herewith, disapproved and with my veto noted
thereon, Ordinance No. 130-02.
Prior to passage of Ordinance 13002, the City Council amended the
Community Block Grant budget to
raise the individual ward allocations
from $300,000 to $450,000. By allowing City Council’s version of the
Community
Development
Block
Grant budget to go into effect, the
General Fund budget for 2003 will
be placed in jeopardy by using
money from next year this year. You
have heard me say that fiscal
responsibility is at the core of this
Administration, and I have kept my
word. I cannot in good conscience
allow my signature to be put on a
piece of legislation that is fundamentally flawed.
It is wrong for the citizens of
Cleveland to be put at risk because
City Council wants more money now
to distribute in their wards. We
must not mortgage the future of the
citizens of this City. We cannot
afford to spend money we do not
have. We may put our ability to borrow money for capital projects at a
reasonable cost at risk. Our citizens
may lose vital services if this budget, as it stands, is allowed to go
into effect. Every public service
from safety to waste collection, from
snow removal to parks and recreation, may be at risk in 2003.
The programs funded with the
Council ward allocations are great
programs. We stand ready to work
with any council member to invest
in their neighborhood. In fact, as of
March 25, 2002 there was over $5M
in unspent funds available already
for these ward allocations. Eight
wards have over $300,000 remaining
in their 2001-2002
accounts nearly
three-fourths of the way through
the year. Clearly, those funds will
be available for ward investments.
Furthermore,
the
CDBG
budget
includes a line items for community
development corporations, for home
repair, for social services and other

The City Record

4
key investments in our neighborhoods. By working together we can
spend within our means and invest
in Cleveland’s neighborhoods.
I am vetoing this legislation for
the sake of the Citizens of our great
City. I will do all that I can to make
sure that I will always do what is
in the citizen’s best interests. Clearly, this action is in the best interests of our citizens.
Ordinance 130-02 is not good for
the City of Cleveland, could result
in more expensive debt, and in part,
violates the Charter.
For the above reasons, I hereby
veto Ordinance No. 130-02.
Sincerely,
JANE CAMPBELL
Mayor
City of Cleveland

for a communications technology
grant by Digital Vision, a non-profit
organization
in
Cleveland,
from
Manufacturer 3Com, of Santa Clara,

Whereas, a national report recently ranked Ohio 33rd of 50 states in
transforming to the new information
economy (EcomOhio Report, 2000),
despite Ohio’s rank as the country’s
seventh largest economy; and
Whereas, Internet usage is lower
in Northeast Ohio than in other Ohio
regions (e.g. 14% in NE Ohio, compared to 19% in SE Ohio, by some
comparisons), and is below the
national average (NE Ohio Regional Report on Ohio’s Readiness for
Global Electronic Commerce, Ecom
Ohio, May 2000); and
Whereas,
increased
computer
skills and training for students in
the City can help overcome low education attainment levels and low
graduation rates, and can help
improve economic opportunities for
lower-income Cleveland residents;
and
Whereas, Manufacturer 3Com, of
Santa Clara, California, in partnership with the Conference of Mayors,
is offering an “Urban Challenge
Grant,” of up to $100,000 for the purchase of equipment and services for

help the City bridge the digital
divide, is preparing an application
for a Challenge Grant, and is instituting a process to gain neighborhood input into the development of
the grant, in order to institute a project to improve computer and Internet connectivity for citizens of the
City, and Digital Vision needs the
City’s support and endorsement in
order to apply for this grant; and
Whereas, Cleveland Digital Vision
has created a large, City-wide coalition of neighborhood groups to focus
public attention on the importance
of computer education and training,
it has developed a partnership with
Technology for All, of Houston,
Texas, to provide low-cost courses
and materials and scholarships for
distance-learning programs at public
computer centers, it has developed
or assisted in the expansion of computer centers, including Westown
Development Corporation, League

assisted in the public distribution of
more than 100 computers to individuals in the City, it has contributed
to a state-wide partnership with

Res. No. 645-02.
By Councilmen Cimperman, Westbrook, Sweeney, Reed and O’Malley.
An emergency resolution urging
the Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development to take certain actions
regarding the Asset Control Area
program and the proposed ACD
demonstration program.
Whereas, the Asset Control Area
(ACA)
program
legislation
was
passed in 1998 by Congress to protect community development interests in the disposition of foreclosed
FHA-insured
single-family
homes
and has permitted local governments and experienced non-profit
real estate developers to gain control of HUD’s inventory of foreclosed properties, generating the
productive redevelopment and lasting homeownership of these homes;
and
Whereas, Cleveland’s Asset Control Area program provides a comprehensive community development
solution to the problem of abandoned FHA-insured foreclosures that
have for decades acted as a blighting influence in Cleveland neighborhoods; and
Whereas, currently 100% of this
distressed inventory in specified
Cleveland tracts is purchased by the
Cleveland Housing Network (CHN)
in partnership with its 22 affiliated
community development corporations
and the properties are being redeveloped through CHN’s homeownership programs; and
Whereas, CHN has successfully
met every provision of its ACA contract with HUD, with HUD’s oversight including ongoing site visits,
receipt of quarterly reports detailing
on each ACA property purchased by
CHN rehabilitation cost, sales price,
verified buyer income information,
and other information pertinent to
CHN’s contract; and
Whereas, since Cleveland’s ACA
contract was established in July
2000, CHN has taken title to 203
homes,
has
already
successfully
redeveloped 99 homes, and has generated $17 million of new investments in Cleveland’s neighborhoods;
and
Whereas, on February 25, 2002, the
HUD Inspector General released a
nationwide audit of the ACA program
siting
numerous
problems
with the program and recommended
that HUD terminate the ACA program; and

The City Record
Whereas, in response to this audit,
HUD has imposed a moratorium on
the ACA program, and CHN’s ACA
contract expired on March 31, 2002;
and
Whereas, on February 5, 2002,
HUD published a Notice of FHA Accelerated Claim Disposition (ACD)
Demonstration in the Federal Register, whereby HUD proposes to sell
its interest in troubled FHA-insured
loans to for-profit bidders who will
then step into HUD’s shoes to control the foreclosure, property management, and ultimate resale of
these homes; and
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland believes that this ACD
program will have a blighting influence on inner-city markets, and,
therefore, contends that ACD demonstration must exclude Revitalization
Areas in general and Cleveland’s
Revitalization Areas in particular;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public safety, welfare and
health; now therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland urges the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to exempt Cleveland and its
ACA contractors that can demonstrate both capacity and compliance
with the provisions of its ACA contract from the recently imposed
moratorium on the ACA program.
Unduly hampering the operations of
these successful contracts, such as
the one in Cleveland, will cause
unnecessary losses to HUD and its
high-performing
ACA
contractors
alike, as well as causing needless
blight in urban neighborhoods by
delaying the productive redevelopment and lasting homeownership of
vacant properties.
Section 2. That this Council urges
HUD to adopt the recommendations
made last year by HUD in partnership with national community development intermediaries, local governments and ACA contractors that
would strengthen the performance
and effective oversight of the ACA
program.
Section 3. That this Council urges
HUD to protect vulnerable inner-city
neighborhoods such as Cleveland
from the ACD pilot demonstration
since properties located in areas
with negligible or negative profit
margins will be abandoned or sold
to the highest bidder without regard
to the destabilizing consequences to
inner-city neighborhoods.
Section 4. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to transmit
a copy of this resolution to the U.S.
Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development
and
the
Executive
Director of Cleveland Housing Network, Inc.
Section 5. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
