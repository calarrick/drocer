in Ward 6 of the City of Cleveland;

Whereas, 47 of these units will be

An emergency resolution opposing
the bill passed by the Ohio House of
Representatives that would allow
beer to have twice the alcoholic content and be consumed earlier on
Sundays.
Whereas, last week the Ohio
House overwhelmingly approved a
bill that would allow beer to have
twice the alcoholic content and be
consumed earlier on Sundays; and
Whereas, current Ohio law allows
beer to be bought and sold only if
the alcohol content is below 6 percent by weight; and
Whereas, the House bill would
raise the alcohol content to 12 percent; and
Whereas, the House bill would also
allow beer to be sold beginning at 11
am on Sundays, instead of the current
1 pm start under current law; and
Whereas, this higher alcohol content and earlier sale time will only
serve to increase abuse of alcohol
and alcohol-related crimes; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes the bill passed by the Ohio House
of Representatives that would allow
beer to have twice the alcoholic content and be consumed earlier on
Sundays.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
the leaders of the General Assembly
of the State of Ohio.

Whereas, pursuant to the Codified Ordinances of the City of
Cleveland, the Director of Public
Safety can establish certain traffic
patterns and roadway usage based
on the recommendation of the City’s
Division of Traffic Engineering;
and
Whereas, it is this Council’s desire
to open the City streets and rightof-ways at certain times for the
enjoyment of City residents; and
Whereas,
this
Council
hereby
requests that the Directors of Public Safety and Public Service direct
the Division of Traffic Engineering
to conduct a feasibility study to
determine the viability of closing
the following roadways to vehicular traffic on Sundays from 7:00
a.m. to 7:00 p.m. and to permit only
pedestrian and bicycle access for
those roadways during that time:
that portion of the North Marginal
from East 9th Street to Aviation
High School; that portion of the
South Marginal from East 55th
Street to East 9th Street; and the
rights-of ways
immediately
surrounding Public Square from May
15th through September 15th of
each year; and
Whereas, this Council requests
that the results of the feasibility
study be presented to Council’s City
Planning and Safety Committees
within 60 days of the passage date
of this resolution; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public safety, welfare and
health; now therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland requests that the
Directors of Public Safety and Public Service direct the Division of
Traffic Engineering to conduct a
feasibility study to determine the
viability of closing the following
roadways to vehicular traffic on
Sundays from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.
and to permit only pedestrian and
bicycle access for those roadways
during that time: that portion of the
North Marginal from East 9th Street

Gordon, Johnson, Jones, O’Malley,
Polensek, Reed, Rybka, Sweeney,
Westbrook, White, Zone.
An emergency resolution opposing
the bill passed by the Ohio House
that legalizes carrying concealed
weapons and urging Governor Taft
to veto the legislation if it passes
the Senate.
Whereas, last week the Ohio
House overwhelmingly approved a
bill that would legalize concealed
handguns for most Ohioans; and
Whereas, this bill does not have
the support of groups representing
police officers, police chiefs and
highway patrol officers; and
Whereas, the number of crime victims who successfully use firearms
to defend themselves is relatively
small, and more guns lead to more
crime or at least a much smaller
reduction in crime; and
Whereas, in Texas it was found
that the weapons-related offense
rate
among
concealed
handgun
license holders was more than twice
as high as that of the general population; and
Whereas, police officers know
that the very sight of a gun can
escalate a situation and lead to
greater violence and injury; and
Whereas, laws allowing the carrying of concealed weapons have
nothing to do with private firearms
ownership in the home, rather they
relate solely to allowing individuals
to carry concealed guns almost anywhere in the community, including
churches, stores, malls, theaters,
parks, offices, City Hall and other
public places; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes the bill passed by the Ohio House
that legalizes carrying concealed
weapons and urges Governor Taft to
veto the legislation if it passes the
Senate.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
the leaders of the General Assembly
of the State of Ohio.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

amended by Ordinance No. 96-87,
passed April 27, 1987, relating to procedures for alterations, demolitions,
removals or constructions of desig-

The City Record
nated landmark properties in the
City.
Approved by Directors of Community Development, Public Safety,
Public Health, City Planning Commission, Finance, Law; Relieved of
Committees on Community and Economic Development, Public Safety,
Public Health, City Planning, Legislation, Finance; when amended as
follows:
1. In Section 1, at Section 161.05,
insert a new subsection (b) to read
as follows:
“(b) The Commission shall evaluate
applications
to
determine
whether or not the environmental
change proposed by the applicant
will adversely affect any significant
historical or aesthetic feature of the
property and to determine whether
or not the environmental change
proposed by the applicant is consistent with the spirit and purposes of
this chapter.
(1) In evaluating applications for
alterations or construction of property, the Commission shall consider the following standards created
by the U.S. Department of the Interior:
A. a property shall be used for its
historic purpose or be placed in a
new use that requires minimal
change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and
environment;
B. the historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved.
The removal of historic materials or
alternation of features and spaces
that characterize a property shall be
avoided;
C. each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its
time, place, and use. Changes that
create a false sense of historical
development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural
elements from other buildings, shall
not be undertaken,
D. most properties change over
time,
those
changes
that
have
acquired historic significance in
their own right shall be retained
and preserved;
E. distinctive features, finishes,
and
construction
techniques
or
examples
of
craftsmanship
that
characterize a property shall be preserved;
F. deteriorated historic features
shall
be
repaired
rather
than
replaced. Where the severity of
deterioration requires replacement
of a distinctive feature, the new
feature shall match the old in
design, color, texture, and other
visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated
by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence,
G. chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that
cause damage to historic materials
shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate,
shill be undertaken using the gentlest means possible;
H.
significant
archaeological
resources affected by a project shall
be protected and preserved. If such

592

March 27, 2002
resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken
I. new additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction
shall not destroy historic materials
that characterize the property. The
new work shall be differentiated
from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size. scale,
and architectural features to protect
the historic integrity of the property and its environment; and
J. new additions and adjacent or
related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that
if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment
would be unimpaired.
(2) In evaluating applications for
demolition or removal of property,
the Commission shall consider the
following standards:
A. the architectural and historic
significance of the subject building
or structure;
B. the significance of the building
or structure in contributing to the
architectural or historic character of
its environs,
C. in the case of a request to move
a building or other structure, the
relationship between the location of
the subject building or structure and
its overall significance;
D. the present and potential economic viability of the subject building or structure, given its physical
condition and marketability;
E. if the demolition will remedy
conditions imminently dangerous to
life, health, or property, as determined in writing by the Division of
Building and Housing, the Division
of Fire or the Department of Public
Health; and
F. the appropriateness of the proposed new structure or use and its
impact on the surrounding community.”.
2.
Change
existing
subsection
“(b)”, “(c)”, “(d)”, “(e)” and “(f)” to
new section “(c)”, “(d)”, “(e)”, “(f)”
and “(g)”, respectively.
3. In Section 1, at existing Section
161.05 (c), delete section (c) in its
entirety and insert in lieu thereof
the following:
“(c) If the Commission finds that
the environmental change proposed
by the applicant will adversely
affect any significant historical or
aesthetic feature of the property or
is
inappropriate
or
inconsistent
with the spirit and purposes of this
chapter, the Commission may either
deny the application or delay action
on the application. Any decision to
delay action on the application
shall be by mutual agreement of
the Commission and the applicant
and shall be for a period not to
exceed six (6) months. During the
delay period, the Commission shall
conduct further investigation with
regard to the proposed environmental change, conduct negotiations
with the applicant and any other
party in an effort to find a means
of
preserving
the
property,
or
explore alternatives to the proposed
environmental change. The Com-

March 27, 2002
mission may also investigate the
feasibility of all available ways
and
means
of
preserving
the
improvement,
including
without
limitation, inducing by contract or
other consideration the creation of
covenants restricting the use of
property, leasing and subleasing
the property for the purposes of
preservation and acquiring by eminent domain or contract or conveyance all or any part of or interest in the property.”.
4. In Section 1, at Section 161.05,
delete existing division (d) in its
entirety and insert in lieu thereof
the following:
“(d) At the end of the delay period, the Commission shall either
approve or deny the application, or
delay action. A decision to delay
action, at the end of one delay period, shall be by mutual agreement of
the Commission and the applicant
and shall be for a period not to
exceed six (6) months. The Commission shall only agree to a second
and final delay period if the Commission determines that this additional time period may be useful in
securing an alternative to the proposed environmental change. At the
end of the second and final delay
period, the Commission shall either
approve or deny the application for
a certificate of appropriateness.”.

An emergency resolution declaring this Council’s support of Fairfax
Elderly Homes L.L.P. in its effort to
develop affordable housing units in
the City of Cleveland using housing
tax credits from the Ohio Housing
Finance Agency and repealing Resolution No. 306-02, passed on February 25, 2002.

By Councilmen Cimperman, Zone,
Sweeney and Britt.
An emergency resolution calling
for an “Artists’ Summit and Exhibit”
on May 15, 2002 in Cleveland City
Hall for the purpose of promoting
and
supporting
local
Cleveland
artists, underscoring their importance to this community and fostering cultural and artistic exchange
and opportunities to all artists and
citizens in the City.
Whereas, there is great depth,
diversity and excellence in the arts in
Northeast Ohio in general, and in the
City of Cleveland in particular; and
Whereas, the arts and culture in
this City are true economic generators for this community; and
Whereas, this Council, recognizing the great importance the arts
and culture have in this community,
intends to hold an “Artists’ Summit
and Exhibit” on May 15, 2002 to
develop, define and encourage the
objectives as set forth herein; and
Whereas, access to the arts should
be expanded to the neighborhoods of
the City through development of
arts fairs and festivals, expansion of
arts and cultural events in parks
and recreation centers and expansion and creation of portable arts
and cultural programs; and
Whereas, access to the arts can be
further expanded through the use of
public transportation by routing
such transportation to arts and cultural events, providing arts and culture information in public transit
vehicles, and expanding and developing public transit cultural programs; and
Whereas, cultural education collaborations should be developed by:
building web sites and distance
learning programs that link artists,
organizations, teachers and learners; assisting artists and organizations to promote their educational
programs
and
services
through
trade shows that highlight artists’
efforts;
supporting
professional
development institutes for arts educators, artists and classroom teachers; and creating professional development fellowships; and
Whereas, the arts and culture
should be integrated into the core
curricula of more primary and secondary schools in the City by
expanding
artist
residency
programs to more schools, providing
internships with artists and cultural organizations, organizing student
arts and culture associations or
clubs, convening higher education
leaders to create teacher-training
strategies, and developing more arts
and cultural training for education
degree programs; and
Whereas, arts and cultural “think
tanks” should be created to conduct
exchanges between
cultural
and
civic organizations, artists and their
communities, established and emerging cultural organizations, and individual artists and organizations; and

610

March 27, 2002
Whereas, more public and private
sector leaders should be recruited to
serve in the cultural sector; and
Whereas, accountable public sector investment in arts and culture
should be established by collaborating with local governments to identify revenue sources and giving
local governments technical assistance for public arts programs; and
Whereas, the cultural sector’s business practices and benefits should be
strengthened by: developing cultural
technical assistance, service and
training organizations; establishing
pooled benefits programs; creating a
database of service providers; matching business volunteer expertise to
cultural organization needs; creating
a self-assessment model for cultural
organizations;
and
developing
a
directory of exhibit and performing
spaces; and
Whereas, a certain percentage of
the cost of every major public
improvement should go to public art;
and
Whereas, this Council has illustrated its support for the arts and
culture by recently passing legislation that provides artists with the
ability to live and work in the same
space, as well as and live and work
in the same building with other
artists,
thereby
promoting
and
expanding arts and culture throughout the community; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby calls for an “Artists’ Summit and
Exhibit” on May 15, 2002 in Cleveland City Hall for the purpose of
promoting
and
supporting
local
Cleveland artists, underscoring their
importance to this community and

exchange and opportunities to all
artists and citizens in the City.

Res. No. 492-02.
By Councilmen Coats, Pierce Scott,
Conwell.
An emergency resolution opposing
any action by the State legislature
which would attempt to limit municipal corporations to impose a residency requirement as a condition of
employment and specifically opposing House Bill 258 which provides
that no municipal employee may be
required to live in any specific area
of the state.
Whereas, in past sessions, the
Ohio Legislature has considered bills
seeking to limit the power of municipal corporations in the State of Ohio
to determine the qualifications of
their
employees
by
prohibiting
municipal corporations from imposing a residency requirement as a
condition of employment; and
Whereas, in 1982, the City’s Charter was amended by a vote of the
Cleveland citizens to require that
employees of the City be bona fide

March 27, 2002
residents of the City and remain as
such during their terms of employment; and
Whereas, pending House Bill 258
provides that no municipal employee may be required to live in any
specific area of the state; and
Whereas, this bill purports to eliminate the ability of local governments to set conditions of employment for municipal employees; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes any action by the State legislature which would attempt to limit
municipal corporations to impose a
residency requirement as a condition of employment and specifically
opposes House Bill 258 which provides that no municipal employee
may be required to live in any specific area of the state.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit

the leaders of the General Assembly
of the State of Ohio.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

An emergency resolution urging
Cuyahoga County officials to use
any
unspent
job-training
money
received under the federal Workforce Investment Act for job-training
services in Cuyahoga County before
it must be returned to the state.
Whereas, it has come to Council’s
attention that Cuyahoga County may
have not spent millions of dollars
received under the federal Workforce Investment Act (“WIA”); and
Whereas, the State of Ohio is
being hounded by the United States
Department of Labor for failing to
spend tens of millions of dollars in
WIA money; and
Whereas, the State of Ohio, in
turn, has contacted local county governments and has demanded the
return
of
unspent
job-training
money so it can be redistributed to
counties that have already spent
their share; and
Whereas, counties must use their
WIA money by June 30, 2002, or it
must be returned to the state; and
Whereas, this Council understands
that the State of Ohio has inaccurate accounting and reporting systems for WIA funds, which fails to
accurately report how much money
has been spent; and
Whereas, regardless of the failings of the state’s reporting system,
Cuyahoga County should not allow
any amount of money it may have,
which should be used to provide services to unemployed youths, adults
and workers who have recently been
laid off, to go back to the state
unused; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the

The City Record
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
Cuyahoga County officials to use
any
unspent
job-training
money
received under the federal Workforce Investment Act for job-training
services in Cuyahoga County before
it must be returned to the state.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
the
Commissioners
of
Cuyahoga
County.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

By Councilmen Johnson and Britt.
An emergency resolution declaring
this Council’s support of the proposal of Cleveland New Homes II, LP
to the Ohio Housing Finance Agency
for the development of affordable
housing using housing tax credits.
Whereas, each year the Ohio
Housing Finance Agency allocates
housing credits for affordable housing developments throughout Ohio
using
a
competitive
proposal
process; and
Whereas, Cleveland New Homes
II, LP is proposing to develop up to
40 single family homes on scattered
sites in the Buckeye-Woodland Area
of the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, 100% of these units will
be
occupied
by
families
with
incomes at or below 60% of the area
median income ($36,000), with no
market rate units; and
Whereas, 20% of these units will
serve a special needs population,
specifically
households
with
incomes at or below 35% of the area
median income ($31,000); and
Whereas,
the
Cleveland
New
Homes II, LP project will benefit
the citizens of the City by improving the housing stock through new
home construction, leveraging and
investing millions of dollars from
private and public sources in the
Buckeye neighborhood, creating job
opportunities for Cleveland residents, and encouraging homeownership and continued residency in
Cleveland; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby declares its support of the proposal of Cleveland New Homes II,
LP to the Ohio Housing Finance

affordable housing using housing
tax credits.

Res. No. 495-02.
By Councilman Zone.
An emergency resolution opposing
House
Bill
524
which
proposes
changes in the law governing the
expenditure of the Ohio Schools
Facilities Commission Project dollars in a way that will have a material, adverse impact on the way
Issue 14 bond funds are spent in the
Cleveland Municipal School District.
Whereas, in May, 2001, Cleveland
voters approved Issue 14 – the
largest school bond issue in the
State of Ohio; and
Whereas, at the time Issue 14 was
placed before the voters, the state
law specified that local funds would
be spent after state funds are
exhausted; and
Whereas, this means that the
existing state law entitles the Cleveland Municipal School District to
retain interest earned on bond proceeds from Issue 14, which interest,
accumulated over the multiple-year
duration of the project, could be
potentially $10 million dollars; and
Whereas, this particular feature
of the financing plan was one of the
reasons the bond issue was placed
before the voters of Cleveland; and
Whereas, this particular feature of
the financing plan was also a part
of the presentation and campaign to
the voters when they were asked to
approve the bond issue; and
Whereas, pending H.B. 524 would
change the state law to require Cleveland to spend its local share at the
same time the State spends its share
under the Accelerated Urban School
Building Assistance program; and
Whereas, this proposed change in
the financial plan would cost the
Cleveland Municipal School District
an average of $1 million dollars per
year (or a total of $10 million dollars) in lost interest income; and
Whereas, as H.B. 524 is currently
drafted, this $10 million dollars
which would directly benefit the
children, students and teachers of
the Cleveland Municipal School District, as well as the entire Cleveland
community, will be lost, never to be
regained; and
Whereas, the proposed change in
the law works a substantial financial
hardship
on
the
Cleveland
Municipal School District; and
Whereas, the proposed change in
the law is directly contrary to what
was told to voters in Cleveland,
when asked to vote for Issue 14; and
Whereas, the proposed change in
the law could potentially hurt the
credibility and trust the Cleveland
School Board and Chief Executive
Officer Barbara Byrd-Bennett have
worked so hard to achieve; and
Whereas, it would be appropriate
for the State legislature to include an
accommodation
to
the
Cleveland
Municipal School District within H.B.
524 itself, or compensate the District
because of the revenue loss; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council oppos-

48
es House Bill 524 which proposes
changes in the law governing the
expenditure of the Ohio Schools
Facilities Commission Project dollars in a way that will have a material, adverse impact on the way
Issue 14 bond funds are spent in the
Cleveland Municipal School District.
Section 2. That this Council proposes that the state legislature consider appropriate accommodation to
the Cleveland Municipal School District within H.B. 524 itself, or making some compensatory payment to
the Cleveland Municipal School District because of its revenue loss.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
the leaders of the General Assembly
of the State of Ohio, and all members of the Finance and Appropriations Committee.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
