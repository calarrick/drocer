Council such legislation shall have
the same standing as it had at the
time when re-referred.

department involved sets the reason
for the suspension forth. When it is

and rule 43 requiring reading on
three separate days and rule 41

dispensed with and Ordinance No. ...
(Resolution No. ...) be placed on
final passage?” If two-thirds of all
