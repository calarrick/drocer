Res. No. 1310-02.
By Council Members O’Malley,
Rybka, Jones, Reed, Zone, Coats and
Conwell.
An emergency resolution urging
the Campbell administration and the
City Law Department to investigate
insurance companies’ practice of
charging higher premiums for home
and auto insurance to customers
residing in the City of Cleveland
and to commence appropriate legal
action, if necessary.
Whereas, insurance law is based
on the idea that everybody in the
same risk category should pay the
same premium; and
Whereas, there are many variables that determine risk; and
Whereas, it has come to the attention of this Council that many insurance companies charge higher rates
for home and/or automobile insurance to customers residing in the
city of Cleveland; and
Whereas, residence in the city of
Cleveland should not be a significant factor in determining risk, such
that a persons insurance rates are
significantly increased; and
Whereas, this practice of insurance companies is unfair and discriminatory and puts an undue
burden on city of Cleveland residents, many of whom can least
afford to pay higher insurance premiums; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the Campbell administra-

The City Record
tion and the City Law Department
to investigate insurance companies’ practice of charging higher
premiums
for
home
and
auto
insurance to customers residing in
the City of Cleveland and to commence appropriate legal action, if
necessary.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
