amended by Ordinance No. 1304-2000,
passed December 18, 2000 relating to
excess personal property.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 181.19 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended by
Ordinance
No.1304-2000,

the Commissioner of Purchases and
Supplies. If any such property is
suitable to be used by any other

Commissioner shall, when so directed, sell such property at its current
value to such other department or
office, or shall place it in the City
storerooms
or

such time as it may be needed by
some department or office of the

any department or office of the
City, when so directed by the Board
of Control it shall be sold by the
Commissioner and the proceeds of
such sale shall be turned in to the
fund of the City from which such
property was paid for. Such sale

more than twenty-three (23) years

or with respect to the helmet of a
fire fighter with more than twenty-three (23) years of service in the
Division of Fire, or with respect to
the badge of an EMT/Paramedic
with more than twenty-three (23)
years of service, such weapon, helmet and/or badge shall be turned
over to the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies. Military service time purchased by an officer,
fire fighter or EMT/Paramedic following twenty (20) years of service

provision shall apply to any officer, fire fighter, or EMT/Paramedic under disability retirement.
The Commissioner of Purchases
and Supplies shall, when so directed by the Board of Control, offer to
sell such service weapon, helmet
and/or badge to such police officer,
fire fighter or EMT/Paramedic for
its fair market value. In lieu of
paying cash for the weapon, helmet
and/or badge, such police officer,
fire
fighter
or
EMT/Paramedic
may elect to forego all or any portion of any uniform or uniform
maintenance allowance to which he
is entitled at the time of the purchase; provided, however, that the

1798

allowances devoted to the purchase
shall equal the fair market value
of the item or items.

Safety makes a determination in
accordance with Section 101 of the
Charter with respect to any apparatus, equipment and/or personal property of the Division of Fire, upon
resolution of the Board of Control,
such apparatus, equipment and/or

over to the Western Reserve Fire
Museum at Cleveland, or a like entity existing to preserve the history
of the Division of Fire, for use in a
fire fighter museum. Any fire fighter meeting the criteria set forth in
division (b) of this section may voluntarily donate his or her helmet to
said museum, instead of purchasing
said helmet under division (b).

the review has granted the applicant an extension in order to allow
for submission of additional materials or revisions. The Commissions
may seek advice from any designated local design review advisory
committee.
(f) Short-Term Permits. If the
peddling activity is proposed to be
conducted for a period of seven (7)
days or less, the Commissioner may
issue a short-term peddling permit,
except that if any person or persons have obtained a short-term
peddling permit for a particular
