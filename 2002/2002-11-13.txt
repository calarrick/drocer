By Council Member Dolan.
An emergency ordinance authorizing the continuation of City-provided group health and life insurance
coverage, under the same terms and
conditions currently in effect, and
further authorizing a continuation
of military leave with pay to all
City employees who would otherwise lose such benefits as a result
of a call to active military duty in
connection with the terrorists acts
that occurred in New York City and
Washington, D.C. on September 11,
2001.
Whereas, City employees have
been, or may soon be called to
active military service pursuant to
an order by the President of the
United States in connection with the
terrorists acts in New York City and
Washington, D.C. on September 11,
2001; and
Whereas, the City pays military
leave with pay in accordance with
the Codified Ordinances of the City
and the respective collective bargaining agreements and management compensation plans when an
employee is called to active military
duty at the direction of the President or the Governor; and
Whereas, it is the belief of this
Council that the possible discontin-

2419

15
uation of City-provided group health
and life insurance and the limitation
on military leave with pay could
cause economic and procedural hardships for affected employees and
their families; and
Whereas, Council desires to support and assist those City employees
who have been called to active military duty and their families who
have been financially burdened by
the employees’ call to active military duty; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That, notwithstanding
and as an exception to the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio,
1976, all employees of the City who
are now serving or may in the
future serve as part of the active
military forces of the United States
in connection with the terrorists
acts that occurred in New York
City and Washington, D.C. on September 11, 2001, shall be paid by
the City throughout such employee’s active military service in connection with the terrorists acts
that occurred in New York City
and Washington, D.C. on September 11, 2001 the difference in
money
between
the
employee’s
City pay and the employee’s military pay so long as the employee’s
military
pay
is
less than the
employee’s City pay for the same
time period.
Section 2. That, notwithstanding
and as an exception to the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio,
1976, the group health and life
insurance benefits currently provided to all City employees pursuant to the Codified Ordinances
and the City’s collective bargaining agreements, shall remain in
full force and effect for those City
employees otherwise eligible for
such benefits, who are now serving or may in the future serve as
part of the active military forces
of the United States in connection
with
the
terrorists
acts
that
occurred in New York City and
Washington, D.C. on September 11,
2001. Such benefits shall continue
for the duration of such employees’
active military service in connection with the terrorists acts that

An emergency resolution urging
the Mayor and Director of Public

consider
using
the

the City of Cleveland safety initiative, and to initiate a pilot program
using this technology in a number
of neighborhoods for a period of
twelve months in order to determine
overall effectiveness.
Whereas, the 311 Response System
provides improved accessibility and
service to citizens as well as providing improved support to city
departments and divisions in their
efforts to deliver services to Cleveland residents; and
Whereas, the 311 Response System
effectively establishes priorities/policies in response to citizen and

Whereas, the 311 Response System
records critical statistics including
citizen demand for services and performance of service delivery; and
Whereas, the 311 Response System
effectively gets service requests
directly to the staff responsible for

effective; and
Whereas, the reverse 911 is a
public safety tool that allows officials to alert the citizens in a community on any emergency situation
that may arise in their communities; and
Whereas, reverse 911 allows safety authorities and personnel to target a precise geographic area of the
city with computer software and
geographic information technologies
that are linked to telecommunications systems, which will enable

2420

them to saturate a specific area
with thousands of calls per hour
notifying residents of acute emergencies; and
Whereas, the reverse 911 system
can be programmed to call specific
lists, such as neighborhood crime
watch groups, or send text messages
to pagers, cellular phones, and fax
machines to notify citizens in affected areas of immediate emergencies;
and
Whereas, the 311 Response System
and reverse 911 allows both the
police and community to be more
directly involved with each other,
which can greatly enhance the safety and welfare of the general public; and
Whereas, the 311 Response System
and reverse 911 can greatly improve
the quality of life of residents in the
City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
supports and champions the use of
strategic cost-effective Information

November 13, 2002
Technology (IT) initiatives, which
enhance government services to

the quality of life for our citizens;
and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
endorses the implementation of a
Citywide 311 Response System and
all of its functionality and supports
the
integration
of
the
Reverse 911 core functionality into
the Citywide 311 Response System
project; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
can actively participate to review
and suggest citywide policies that
guide the appropriate usage of the
311 Response System and the Reverse 911 Citizen Alert System; and
Whereas, the implementation and
administration
of
the
311
and
Reverse 911 systems will be the sole
responsibility
of
the
Executive
branch of city government; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
can
be
provided
with
periodic
progress reports on the implementation and performance of the Citywide 311 Response System and the

well as any development of new
policies

it
pertains

REPRINT
Res. No. 1935-02.
By Council Members Coats, Jackson, Conwell, Pierce-Scott and Zone.
An emergency resolution urging
the federal government to provide
adequate funding to regional political subdivisions and local governments to enable these entities to
comply with the combined sewer
overflow mandates established by
the federal government.
Whereas, the federal government
and the United States Environmental Protection Agency have enacted
laws and regulations that mandate
regional political subdivisions and
local governments to address combined sewer overflow issues;
Whereas, this mandate is not coupled with funding necessary to
ensure compliance with the combined sewer overflow requirements
established by the federal government; and
Whereas, many regional political
subdivisions and local governments
are struggling to provide basic services in this challenging economic
time; and
Whereas, many regional political
subdivisions and local governments
are forced to consider utility rate
increases in order to fund the federal government’s combined sewer
overflow mandates; and
Whereas, proposed utility rate
increases, in many instances, exceed
the rate of inflation; and
Whereas, such rate increases, if
approved, would place an unreasonable burden on consumers of utility
services; and
Whereas, it is the opinion of this
Council that the federal government
should provide funding necessary
for regional political subdivisions
and local governments to comply
with the combined sewer overflow
mandates established by the federal
government; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the federal government to provide
adequate funding to regional political subdivisions and local governments to enable these entities to
comply with the combined sewer
overflow mandates established by
the federal government.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to U.S. Senator Michael DeWine, U.S. Senator

2432

November 13, 2002
George
Voinovich,
Congressman
Dennis Kucinich, Congresswoman
Stephanie
Tubbs-Jones,
Congressman Steven LaTourette, Congressman Sherrod Brown, and Congressman Ralph Regula.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted October 28, 2002.
Effective October 30, 2002.

REPRINT
Res. No. 1944-02.
By Council Members Coats and
Zone.
An emergency resolution urging
President Bush, the U.S. Senate and
the U.S. House of Representatives to
allocate more federal funds to the
Clean Water Act for storm water
management projects.
Whereas,
the
Northeast
Ohio
Regional Sewer District (“NEORSD”)
is commencing a $1.2 billion improvement to the storm water management
system in Cuyahoga County; and
Whereas, the NEORSD has proposed to significantly raise the
sewer rates of the citizens of Cleveland in order to pay for this
improvement; and
Whereas,
in
the
absence
of
increased federal funding under the
Clean Water Act to defray a portion
of the cost of these improvements,
the sewer ratepayers least able to
pay increased sewer use costs will
be asked to pay a significant rate
increase; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
President Bush, the U.S. Senate and
the U.S. House of Representatives to
allocate more federal funds to the
Clean Water Act for storm water
management projects, including the
$1.2 billion storm water management program proposed by the
NEORSD.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to President Bush,
Senator Voinovich, Senator DeWine
and the members of the congressional delegation representing Cuyahoga County.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
