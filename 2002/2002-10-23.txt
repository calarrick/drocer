FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 2074-02.
By Council Members Brady, Britt,
Gordon, Reed, Pierce-Scott, Conwell,
Cimperman, Zone and Jones.
An emergency resolution supporting the passage of H.R. 4066, the
Mental Health Equitable Treatment
Act of 2002, requiring equal mental
health benefits in health insurance
coverage.
Whereas, H.R. 4066, the Mental
Health Equitable Treatment Act of
2002
(“Mental
Health
Equitable
Treatment Act”), was introduced in
the U.S. House of Representatives in
March of 2002; and
Whereas, the Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act requires equal
mental health benefits in health
insurance coverage; and
Whereas, the Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act prohibits certain employee group health plans or
related insurance plans providing
both medical surgical and mental
health benefits from imposing mental health treatment limitations or
financial requirements unless comparable
limitations
and
requirements are imposed upon medical
surgical benefits; and
Whereas, H.R. 4066 is cosponsored
by over 240 members of the House
of Representatives and is supported
by over 230 national organizations;
and
Whereas, the Cuyahoga County
Community Mental Health Board supports the passage of H.R. 4066; and
Whereas, each year, mental illness affects the lives of one out of
every five Americans and mental illness frequently disrupts families;
and
Whereas, health insurance practices do not, in many instances,
offer Americans living with mental
illness the treatment needed to lead
productive lives; and
Whereas, as a result of such
health insurance practices, local
governments are forced to address
actions and circumstances that arise
from Americans not receiving necessary mental health treatment; and
Whereas, such actions and circumstances include issues relating
to suicide, homelessness, loss of productivity,
and
the
inappropriate
“criminalization” of mental illness;
