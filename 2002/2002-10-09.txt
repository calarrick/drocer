Section 3. Terms of Bonds. The

issuance or such other date as is
designated in the Certificate of
Award. The Bonds shall mature on
the dates and in the respective principal amounts to be determined by
the Director of Finance in the Certificate of Award in accordance with
his determination of the best interest of, and financial advantages to,
the City; provided that the final
maturity date shall be not later than
30 years from the date of issuance
of the Bonds. The Bonds shall bear
interest from their date at the rate
or rates per year set forth in the
Certificate of Award, or if any
Bonds bear interest at a variable
rate, at the rate determined pursuant to the method set forth in the
Certificate of Award. Interest on the
Bonds shall be payable on the dates
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance in the Certificate of Award,
and the Bonds shall bear interest at
those
rates
until
the
principal
amount of the Bonds is paid or payment is provided for. If any Bonds
bear interest at a fixed rate, that
rate shall not exceed eight percent
(8%) per year (computed on the
basis of a 360-day year consisting of
twelve 30-day months) and interest
shall be payable not more often
than every six months and at maturity or at any earlier redemption
date. If any Bonds bear interest at

date.
The Bonds may be issued in one

satisfy the requirements of this
Ordinance. Separate series of Bonds
may be issued at the same or different times. The Bonds of each
series shall be designated as provided in the applicable Certificate of
Award. A separate Certificate of
Award may be delivered for each
Series.In the event that the Director
of Finance, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, determines that the City’s best interests
will be served by causing all or a
portion of the Bonds to be obligations bearing interest at variable
rates, redeemable by the City without penalty or premium on interest
adjustment dates, then the Director
of Finance is authorized to so specify in the Certificate of Award. If
the Director of Finance so determines, then the Director of Finance
shall specify in the Certificate of
Award the method and procedure by
which the variable rate of interest
to be borne by the variable rate
Bonds shall be determined, whether
by reference to a market index, by
a remarketing agent or otherwise;
provided that the variable rate
Bonds shall not bear interest at a
rate in excess of sixteen percent
(16%) per year. Notwithstanding
that limitation, Bonds held by a
provider of a Credit Support Instrument may bear interest at a rate not
in excess of twenty-five percent
(25%) per year as provided in the
agreement with the provider of the
Credit Support Instrument. Holders
of variable rate Bonds may be given
the right to tender their variable
rate Bonds for purchase by the City

The City Record
at the times, on the terms, and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Certificate of Award and any tender
agreement; provided that tender
rights shall be exercisable only at
such times as a Credit Support
Instrument is in place that provides
for the payment of the purchase
price payable to the tendering holder of a variable rate Bond. If the
Director of Finance designates any
Bonds as variable rate Bonds, and
if the holders of the variable rate
Bonds are to be entitled to tender
the variable rate Bonds for purchase, then the Director of Finance
shall also designate in the Certificate of Award for those variable
rate Bonds the provider or providers
for any Credit Support Instrument,
the tender agent or agents and the
remarketing agent or agents, which
designations shall be based on the
determination of the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed
to provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable. The Director of Finance is authorized to enter
into agreements in connection with
the delivery of the variable rate
Bonds, and from time to time thereafter so long as the variable rate
Bonds
are
outstanding,
with
providers of Credit Support Instruments, tender agents (which may be
the Trustee), remarketing agents,
and others as may be determined by
the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the method of
determining the variable interest
rates, permitting holders the right
of tender, providing for liquidity or
credit support for the payment of
the variable rate Bonds upon tender
for purchase or redemption, and providing for the repayment by the
City of any amounts drawn under
the Credit Support Instrument.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of
the Bonds, and regardless of the
Bonds bearing interest at variable
or fixed rates, is authorized to contract for one or more Credit Support
Instruments, and to pay their costs
from proceeds of the Bonds, if he
determines that the Credit Support
Instrument
or
Instruments
will
result in a savings in the cost of
this financing to the City, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor.
The Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, shall further determine and
specify in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds are subject to optional redemption prior to
maturity, the earliest date on which
redeemable Bonds shall be subject
to prior redemption, which shall not
be later than ten years from the
first interest payment date, and the
applicable redemption premium for
the redeemable Bonds, which shall
be not greater than 103% of the
principal amount redeemed.
Section 4. Registration, Transfer
and Exchange. The Bonds shall be
issued
only
as
fully
registered
Bonds. The Trustee shall act as the
authenticating
agent,
registrar,
transfer agent, and paying agent for

office of the Trustee designated in

name the Bond was registered, and
to that person’s address appearing
on the Register (defined below in
this Section) at the close of business
on the record date provided in the
Trust Agreement. The Trustee shall
maintain and keep all books and
records necessary for the registration, exchange, and transfer of
Bonds as provided in the Trust
Agreement (the “Register”) so long
as any of the Bonds remain outstanding. Subject to the provisions
in the Trust Agreement, the person
in whose name a Bond is registered
on the Register shall be regarded as
the absolute owner of that Bond for
all purposes of the Proceedings.
Payment of or on account of the
debt charges on any Bond shall be
made only to or upon the order of
that person; neither the City nor the
Trustee shall be affected by any
notice to the contrary, but the registration may be changed as provided in the Trust Agreement. All
such payments shall be valid and
effectual to satisfy and discharge
the City’s liability upon the Bond,
including interest, to the extent of
the amount or amounts so paid.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
and so long as the Bonds are issued
in a book entry system, principal of
and interest on the Bonds shall be
payable in the manner provided in
any agreement entered into by the
Director of Finance, in the name
and on behalf of the City, in connection with the book entry system.
Bonds may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the office designated by the
Trustee, together with a request for
exchange signed by the registered
owner
or
by
a
person
legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Trustee.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized, (i) the
Bonds may be issued in the form of
a single, fully registered Bond representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the book entry
interest owners of Bonds in book
entry form shall have no right to
receive Bonds in the form of physical securities or certificates; (iii)
ownership of book entry interests in
book entry form shall be shown by
book entry on the system maintained and operated by the Depository and its Participants, and transfers of the ownership of book entry
interests shall be made only by book
entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv) the Bonds as
such shall not be transferable or
exchangeable, except for transfer to
another Depository or to another
nominee of a Depository, without
further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of

October 9, 2002
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Director of Finance, after
making provision for notification of
the book entry interest owners by
the then Depository and any other
arrangements
deemed
necessary,
shall permit withdrawal of the
Bonds from the Depository, and
authenticate and deliver certificates
in registered form to the assigns of
the Depository or its nominee, all at
the cost and expense (including any
costs of printing), if the event is not
the result of City action or inaction,
of those persons requesting such
issuance.
The Director of Finance also is
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 5. Execution of Bonds.
Bonds shall be signed by the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, in the
name of the City and in their official capacities, provided that either
or both of those signatures may be
a facsimile, and shall bear the seal
of the City or a facsimile thereof;
provided that no Bond shall be valid
or obligatory for any purpose or
shall be entitled to any security or
benefit
under
the
Proceedings
unless and until the certificate of
authentication printed on the Bond
is signed by the Trustee as authenticating agent, and authentication
by the Trustee shall be conclusive
evidence that the Bond so authenticated has been duly issued, signed
and delivered under, and is entitled
to the security and benefit of, the
Proceedings.
The
certificate
of
authentication may be signed by
any authorized officer or employee
of the Trustee or by any other person acting as an agent of the
Trustee and approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City.
The same person need not sign the
certificate of authentication on all
of the Bonds.
Pursuant to Section 83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
shall prepare the Bonds and shall
endorse thereon his approval of the
form and correctness thereof by his
manual or facsimile signature. The
Bonds shall be issued in the denominations as requested by the Original Purchaser and approved by the
Director of Finance, in conformity
with this Ordinance. The entire principal amount may be represented by
a single bond certificate and may be
issued as fully registered securities
and in book entry or other uncertificated form if it is determined by
the
Director
of
Finance
that
issuance of fully registered securities in that form will facilitate the
sale and delivery of the Bonds. The
Bonds may be issued in the authorized denominations of either (a)
$100,000 each or in any denomination that is the sum of (i) $100,000
and (ii) $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof, and not exchangeable
for other Bonds in denominations
less than $100,000, or (b) $5,000 or

The City Record
any integral multiple thereof, as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance in the Certificate of Award
to be in the best interests of the
City. The Bonds shall not have
coupons attached, shall be numbered
as determined by the Director of
Finance and shall express upon
their faces the purpose, in summary
terms, for which they are issued and
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 6. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall be sold at not less than
97% of par plus accrued interest at
private sale by the Director of
Finance to the Original Purchaser
in accordance with law and the provisions of this Ordinance. If the
Director
of
Finance
determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that an underwriter is incapable of fully performing its duties or meeting its
obligations in its capacity as Original Purchaser with respect to the
Bonds, the Director of Finance is
hereby authorized and directed, in
the name of and on behalf of the
City, to take whatever action may
be
necessary
to
terminate
that
underwriter’s standing as Original
Purchaser. The Director of Finance
shall sign the Certificate of Award
referred to in this Ordinance, evidencing that sale to the Original
Purchaser, cause the Bonds to be
prepared,
and
have
the
Bonds
signed and delivered, together with
a true transcript of proceedings
with reference to the issuance of the
Bonds if requested by the Original
Purchaser, to the Original Purchaser upon payment of the purchase
price. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
a bond purchase agreement between
the City and the Original Purchaser, or representative thereof (the
“Purchase Agreement”), in a form
consistent with this Ordinance and
as approved by the Director of Law.
The Director of Finance shall provide for the payment of the services
rendered and for reimbursement of
expenses incurred pursuant to the
Purchase Agreement from the proceeds of the Bonds to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose. The Mayor, the Director of Finance, the Clerk, the Director of Law, and other City officials,
as appropriate, are each authorized
and directed to sign any transcript
certificates,
financial
statements
and other documents and instruments and to take such actions as
are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance.
Section 7. Security for the Bonds.
The Bonds shall be special obligations of the City, and the debt
charges on the Bonds shall be
payable solely from the Net Project
Revenues and the Nontax Revenues.
The payment of debt charges on the
Bonds is secured by the Trust
Agreement and by a pledge of and
lien on the Bond Fund and the Bond
Reserve Fund held by the Trustee
under the Trust Agreement. The
Bonds are not and shall not be
secured by an obligation or pledge
of any money raised by taxation.
The Bonds do not and shall not represent or constitute a debt or pledge

2213

9
of the faith and credit or taxing
power of the City, and the owners
thereof have and shall have no right
to have taxes levied by the City for
the payment of debt charges thereon. The Bonds shall contain a statement to that effect and to the effect
that the Bonds are payable solely
from the Net Project Revenues and
the Nontax Revenues and are not
secured by an obligation or pledge
of any money raised by taxation.
The City covenants and agrees
that while the Bonds are outstanding, it will appropriate and maintain
Nontax Revenues at such times and
in such amounts as will be sufficient, together with the Net Project
Revenues and any other funds available for the purpose, to pay the debt
charges on the Bonds and will so
restrict other obligations payable
from Nontax Revenues prior to or on
a parity with the Bonds as will
ensure the continuing availability
for appropriation of sufficient Nontax Revenues to pay debt charges
when due.
There is created by the City in the
custody of the Trustee a separate
fund or account designated as the
Core City Program Bond Retirement
Fund (the “Bond Fund”) into which
shall be deposited (i) any Net Project Revenues, and (ii) other Nontax
Revenues on or prior to the date debt
charges on the Bonds are due, in an
amount sufficient to pay those debt
charges. There is created by the City
in the custody of the Trustee another separate fund or account designated as the Core City Program Bond
Reserve Fund (the “Bond Reserve
Fund”). On the date of delivery of
the Bonds there shall be deposited in
the Bond Fund and Bond Reserve
Fund from the Nontax Revenues in
Economic Development Land Sale
Fund No. 10-504 of the City or from
proceeds of the Bonds or by Credit
Support Instrument the respective
amounts set forth in the Certificate
of Award as being sufficient, in the
opinion of the Director of Finance
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, to enhance the
marketability of the Bonds and to
enable the City to stabilize its budget
against
fluctuations
in
the
receipt of Nontax Revenues. Money
in the Bond Fund and Bond Reserve
Fund shall be applied and invested
as provided in the Trust Agreement.
Amounts drawn on the Bond Reserve
Fund shall be restored to the extent,
and over the period of time, provided in the Trust Agreement. The City
shall apply funds for that purpose
from the following sources and in
the following priority: first from the
Net Project Revenues, second from
the Nontax Revenues in Economic
Development Land Sale Fund No. 10504, third from other Nontax Revenues. In consideration of the availability of the Nontax Revenues to the
Core City program, there shall be
transferred to Fund No. 01-001 following passage of this Ordinance
amounts on deposit as of the date of
passage in Economic Development
JDA Highland Hills Shared Income
Tax Fund No. 10-5-28 and in Economic Development JDA Chagrin
Highland Fund No. 10-5-27.
Section
8.
Payment
of
Debt
Charges on the Bonds. Nothing herein shall be construed as requiring
the City to use or apply to the payment of debt charges on the Bonds
any funds or revenues from any

10
source other than Net Project Revenues and the Nontax Revenues.
Subject
to
the
requirements
of
Revised Code Section 176.04, nothing
herein, however, shall be deemed to
prohibit the City, of its own volition,
from using, to the extent that it is
authorized by law to do so, any
other resources for the fulfillment of
any of the terms, conditions or obligations of this Ordinance or of the
Bonds.
The City will, solely from the proceeds of the Bonds or from the Net
Project Revenues or the Nontax
Revenues, pay or cause to be paid
the debt charges on the Bonds on
the dates, at the places and in the
manner provided herein and in the
Bonds. For that purpose, in each
year while the Bonds are outstanding, this Council, after providing for
the
payment
of
debt
charges
payable on the City’s general obligation securities in that year from
sources available for that purpose,
will appropriate Nontax Revenues
required to pay, and for the purpose
of paying, the debt charges due in
that year on the Bonds (less other
money available for the purpose)
and any outstanding parity obligations payable from Nontax Revenues. Further, this Council will
give effect to such appropriations in
all ordinances it passes thereafter in
that year appropriating money for
expenditure and encumbrance and
limit the other appropriations of
Nontax Revenues in that year to the
amount available after deducting
the amount required for the payment of debt charges payable on the
City’s general obligation securities
and to pay those debt charges. The
City covenants that, so long as any
of the Bonds are outstanding, it
shall not issue any additional obligations payable from the Nontax Revenues on a parity with the Bonds
and any outstanding parity obligations payable from Nontax Revenues, unless, prior to passage of
the ordinance authorizing such parity
obligations,
the
Director
of
Finance shall have certified to this
Council that the Nontax Revenues
during the preceding calendar year,
adjusted to reflect, if necessary,
changes in the rates or charges
resulting in the Nontax Revenues,
aggregate in amount not less than
100% of the highest amount of (a)
debt charges on the Bonds and (b)
required payments on such proposed
parity obligations and any outstanding parity obligations due in
any succeeding calendar year.
Each
obligation
of
the
City
required to be undertaken pursuant
to this Ordinance and the Bonds is
binding upon the City, and upon
each officer or employee of the City
as may from time to time have the
authority under law to take any
action on behalf of the City as may
be necessary to perform all or any
part of such obligation, as a duty of
the City and of each of those officers and employees resulting from
an office, trust or station within the
meaning of Section 2731.01 of the
Revised Code, providing for enforcement by writ of mandamus.
Section 9. Trust Agreement. The
City shall enter into the Trust
Agreement with a bank or trust
company designated as Trustee for
the
Bonds
by
the
Director
of
Finance in the Certificate of Award,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the entity so
designated possesses the requisite

The City Record
resources to provide the services of
Trustee under the Trust Agreement
and that the terms on which it has
agreed to provide the services of
Trustee are fair and commercially
reasonable.
The Mayor
and
the
Director of Finance shall sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, the Trust Agreement in
a form consistent with this Ordinance and approved by the Director
of Law. The Mayor and the Director
of Finance and other City officials,
as appropriate, are authorized to
take such actions and sign and
deliver such related instruments as
are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance.
Section 10. Project Fund; Deposit
of Proceeds. The proceeds from the
sale of the Bonds are appropriated
and shall be used for the purpose
for which the Bonds are being
issued. There is created by the City,
as a separate fund or account, in the
custody and control of the Trustee,
a fund designated the “Core City
Program Project Fund” (the “Project
Fund”). Within the Project Fund the
City shall establish as accounts or
subaccounts: the Economic Development Account, the Housing Account
and the Undesignated Account. The
proceeds from the sale of the Bonds
shall be deposited initially in the
Undesignated Account of the Project
Fund. Additional funds, from whatever source, may be voluntarily
deposited in any account of the Project Fund by the City. Funds in the
Undesignated Account of the Project
Fund may be transferred to the Economic Development Account to pay
costs of a Project, or to make loans
to others to pay costs of that Project, consistent with Revised Code
Chapter 165, following certification
of the Project by the Corporation as
being in accordance with the Economic Development Plan. Funds in
the Undesignated Account of the
Project Fund may be transferred to
the Housing Account of the Project
Fund to pay costs of a Project for
residential housing, or to make
grants or loans to others or subsidies to loans or otherwise to pay
costs of that Project, upon certification to the Trustee by the Director
of Community Development or the
Director of Finance of the City that
the Project is consistent with the
Housing Plan and was submitted for
review to the Housing Advisory
Board, all pursuant to Revised Code
176.04. Money in the respective
accounts of the Project Fund are
appropriated for, and shall be used
to pay, costs of Projects consistent
with the requirements of this Ordinance. The City may establish additional accounts or subaccounts within the Project Fund as necessary or
convenient to ascertain the dates,
amounts and sources of deposits. At
such time as disbursements are to
be made from the Project Fund to
pay costs of a Project, the City shall
direct
the
Trustee
to
transfer
amounts in the applicable account
of the Project Fund to the City for
subsequent
disbursement
by
the
City for Project purposes. Any portion of the proceeds of the Bonds to
be used to pay interest on the Bonds
shall be deposited in a capitalized
interest subaccount of the Project
Fund. Any premium and accrued
interest received from the sale of
the Bonds shall be deposited in the
Bond Fund.

Section 11. Disclosure. If, in the
judgment of the Director of Finance,
after consultation with a Financial
Advisor and the Original Purchaser,
an official statement or other disclosure
document
is
appropriate
relating to the initial offering of the
Bonds, the Director of Finance, on
behalf of the City and in that officer’s official capacity, is authorized
to (i) cooperate with the Original
Purchaser in the preparation of, and
the making of modifications, completions or changes of or supplements to, such a disclosure document, (ii) determine, and to certify
or otherwise represent, when the
disclosure document is to be deemed
final or is final, (iii) authorize the
use and distribution of that disclosure document and any supplements
thereto in connection with the initial offering of the Bonds, and (iv)
sign certificates, statements or other
documents in connection with the
finality, accuracy, and completeness
of that disclosure document.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, as the
only obligated person with respect to
the Bonds under the Rule, to provide
or cause to be provided such financial information and operating data,
audited
financial statements and
notices, in such manner, as may be
required for purposes of paragraph
(b)(5)(i) of the Rule. In order to
describe and specify certain terms of
the
City’s
continuing
disclosure
agreement for that purpose, and
thereby to implement that agreement,
including provisions for enforcement,
amendment,
and
termination, the
Director of Finance is authorized and
directed to sign and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of the City, and
if required under the Rule, a Continuing Disclosure Certificate or Certificates in conformance with the
reporting requirements of the Rule.
The agreement formed, collectively,
by this paragraph and that Certificate, shall be the City’s continuing
disclosure agreement for purposes of
the Rule, and its performance shall
be subject to the annual appropriation of any funds that may be necessary to perform it. The Director of
Finance is further authorized and
directed to establish procedures in
order to ensure compliance by the
City with its continuing disclosure
agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices.
Section 12. Ratings, Insurance,
and Other Credit Enhancement. If,
in the judgment of the Director of
Finance, based on written advice of
a Financial Advisor, the filing of an
application for a rating on the
Bonds by one or more nationally recognized rating agencies or one or
more Credit Support Instruments is
in the best interest of, and financially advantageous to, the City, the
Director of Finance is authorized to
prepare and submit those applications, to provide to each such
agency, company or credit provider
such information as may be required
for the purpose. The cost of obtaining each rating and each Credit Support
Instrument,
except
to
the
extent paid by the Original Purchaser in accordance with the Purchase Agreement, shall be paid from
the proceeds of the Bonds.
Section 13. Interest Rate Hedges
and Other Arrangements. For the
purpose of achieving the optimal
available debt structure for the

October 9, 2002
Bonds, the Director of Finance may,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, enter into one or
more agreements in anticipation of,
in connection with or subsequent to
the issuance of the Bonds for an
interest rate swap, an interest rate
cap or other arrangements to lower
the effective interest rate on the
obligations of the City or to hedge
the exposure of the City against
fluctuations in prevailing interest
rates or to optimize the City’s cash
flow, provided, however, that: (i)
the counterparty to any such agreement or arrangement shall have a
rating of at least “A” by either
Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., or
Standard & Poor’s Corporation; (ii)
no such agreement or arrangement
shall purport to entitle the counterparty or provider to payment by the
City from any source other than the
sources of payment for the Bonds as
described in this Ordinance; (iii) the
terms of the agreements or arrangements shall have been determined
by the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, to be justified by the corresponding benefit to the City and
to be commercially reasonable based
on then current market conditions.
Section 14. Prevailing Rates of
Wages. As provided in Revised Code
Section 165.031, all wages paid to
laborers and mechanics employed on
a Project funded from the Economic Development Account of the Project Fund shall be paid at not less
than the prevailing rates of wages
for laborers and mechanics for each
class of work called for by the Project, which wages shall be determined
in
accordance
with
the
requirements of Chapter 4115 of the
Ohio Revised Code, for determination of prevailing wage rates; provided that the requirements of this
Section shall not apply where the
federal government or any of its
agencies furnished or furnishes by
loan or grant all or any part of the
funds used or to be used in connection with the Project and prescribed
or prescribes predetermined minimum wages to be paid to such laborers and mechanics; and provided further that, if a nonpublic user beneficiary undertakes, as a part of the
Project, construction to be performed by its regular bargaining
unit employees who are covered by
a collective bargaining agreement
that was in existence prior to the
date of adoption of this Ordinance,
the rate of pay provided under the
applicable
collective
bargaining
agreement may be paid to such
employees. If and to the extent
required by Revised Code Section
176.05, all wages paid to laborers
and mechanics employed on a Project
funded
from
the
Housing
Account of the Project Fund shall
be paid at not less than the residential prevailing rate of wages for
laborers and mechanics for each
class of work called for by the Project, which wages shall be determined as provided in Section 176.05.
Section 15. Certifications of Community Improvement Corporation.
Prior to delivery of the Bonds, the
Core City Fund program shall be

research facilities development within
the City. Each individual Project

to make them legal, valid, and binding special obligations of the City
have been performed and have been

is
applicable
to
the
issuance of the Bonds.

to said transfer based upon and pursuant to a cooperation agreement
signed September 15, 2002, a copy of

By Council Members Jones and
White.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Senate to reject HB 274,
which would allow citizens the right
to carry concealed weapons with the
proper permit.
Whereas, HB 274 would authorize
the carrying of concealed firearms
by citizens in the State of Ohio that
have a firearm permit; and
Whereas, HB 274 has been passed
out of the Ohio House of Representatives, and is now in the Ohio Senate for further review and discussion; and
Whereas, HB 274 is a reflection on
the most recent trend of states passing
such
laws
on
concealed
weapons; and
Whereas, there are approximately
thirty-three states that have the
right to carry concealed weapons;
and
Whereas,
carrying
concealed
weapons can increase the likeli-

The City Record
hood of violent crimes by firearms,
which can pose a threat to the
health and safety of many communities; and
Whereas, the violent crime rate
had increased 17.8% in the State of
Florida between 1987 and 1992,
which has a carrying concealed
weapons law; and
Whereas, in every year from 1987
and 1992, according to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report, Florida has had
the highest rate of violent crime in
the nation; and
Whereas, in the State of Michigan,
which has a concealed weapons law
since July 1, 2001, the state police
estimated that the number of concealed weapons will increase from
51,954
to
approximately
125,000,
based on trends in other states with
similar laws; and
Whereas, according to the analysis by the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, violent crime actually
rose in 12 of the 29 states, which liberalized their carrying concealed
weapons laws from 1992 to 1997; and
Whereas, in the State of Utah during 2001, concealed carry permits
were issued to some individuals
wanted on an outstanding warrant;
and
Whereas, this Council believes
that carrying concealed weapons
creates an armed society at risk,
which could endanger the lives of
citizens throughout various communities; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
strongly urges the Ohio Senate to
reject HB 274, which would allow
citizens the right to carry concealed
weapons with the proper permit.

Res. No. 1992-02.
By Council Member Lewis.
An emergency resolution objecting to the transfer of ownership of
a C1 Liquor Permit to 1054 East 71st
Street, 1st Floor Front.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Department of Liquor
Control of an application for the
transfer of ownership of a C1 Liquor
Permit from 1054 Corp., DBA Quick
Stop, 1054 East 71st Street, 1st Floor
Front, Cleveland, Ohio 44103 Permanent
Number
6548559
to
Donya
Kareem, Inc., DBA Quick Stop, 1054
East 71st Street, 1st Floor Front,
Cleveland, Ohio 44103, Permanent
Number 2260087; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of
notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby record its objection to the transfer of ownership of a C1 Liquor Permit from 1054 Corp., DBA Quick
Stop, 1054 East 71st Street, 1st Floor
Front, Cleveland, Ohio 44103 Permanent

Res. No. 1993-02.
By Council Members O’Malley,
Jackson, Pierce-Scott, Jones, Reed,
Lewis, Gordon and Johnson.
An emergency resolution calling
upon the Campbell administration to
investigate any banks and lending
institutions that refuse to lend to
residents of the City of Cleveland
and urging the administration to
cease doing business, financial or
otherwise, with such institutions if
said institutions fail to provide
loans to City residents based solely
upon the existence of the City’s antipredatory lending ordinance.
Whereas, on April 22, 2002, Cleveland City Council passed Ordinance
No. 737-02, predatory lending legislation that regulates lending for
home purchases and renovations by
prohibiting predatory loans as defined in the ordinance; and
Whereas, Ordinance No. 737-02 recognizes that predatory lenders are
thriving in Cleveland because many
citizens from Cleveland’s neighborhoods are unable to access legitimate financing for home purchases
and renovations; and
Whereas, many senior citizens
and homeowners in Cleveland are
targeted by unethical home improvement contractors, mortgage brokers,
mortgage lenders and finance companies engaging in predatory lending practices that result in foreclosure and/or stripping the home of
equity; and
Whereas, predatory lenders charge
exorbitant fees and interest rates
and are persuading citizens to incur
mortgage debt in excess of their
needs
or
ability
to
pay,
often
through fraudulent means; and
Whereas, it is the intent and purpose of Ordinance No. 737-02 to protect the citizens of Cleveland and its
neighborhoods from lending practices which strip hard earned equity from city residents and contribute
to the problem of vacant and abandoned houses by making loans that
families cannot afford to repay; and
Whereas, it is also the intention
of Ordinance No. 737-02 to further
protect the citizens of Cleveland by:
(1) collecting and making available
to the public information necessary
for city residents to protect themselves against predatory lending
practices; (2) preventing the lenders
engaged in predatory lending and
those persons providing referrals
and services to those lenders from
enjoying the privilege of doing business with the City of Cleveland; and
(3) preventing predatory lenders
and those persons providing referrals and services to those lenders
from taking advantage of city programs designed to encourage home
ownership and home repair; and
Whereas, it has come to this Council’s attention that, because of the
existence of Ordinance No. 737-02,
residents of the City of Cleveland
have been refused home mortgages,
refinancing of home mortgages, and
various other loans; and
Whereas, it is incumbent upon
this administration to protect its cit-

2221

17
izens by investigating whether any
bank or other financial institution
refuses to comply with Ordinance
No. 737-02 by refusing to make loans
to Cleveland residents; and
Whereas, any financial institution
that effectively redlines Cleveland
citizens in such manner should not
be able to do business with the City
of Cleveland, and the administration
should immediately cease making
deposits and investments, and doing
any financial business with such
entities; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby calls upon the Campbell administration to investigate any banks
and lending institutions that refuse
to lend to residents of the City of
Cleveland and urges the administration to cease doing business,
financial or otherwise, with such
institutions if said institutions fail
to provide loans to City residents
based solely upon the existence of
the City’s anti-predatory lending
ordinance.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of

it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

less than the charge calculated pursuant to that division on October 1,

hours distributed, except that the
computation shall exclude the cost
of PASNY power and the amount, of
PASNY power allocable to kilowatt
hours distributed, and shall exclude
the costs of all purchase power from
a specific source or sources purchased by the Division for distribution to ratepayers pursuant to Section 523.048. The incremental charge
calculated herein shall be adjusted

power charge during such month as
herein provided.
Be it further resolved that all
other provisions of said Resolution
No. 79-00, adopted February 16, 2000,
not expressly amended hereby shall
remain unchanged and in full force

An emergency resolution discouraging the Northeast Ohio Regional
Sewer District from approving proposed rate increases for the City of
Cleveland that result in an annual
compounded increase of 7.7% in
years
2003-2006
and
urging
the
Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District to consider lower and reasonable rate increases.

the
Northeast
Ohio
Regional
Sewer
District
(“NEORSD”)
is
considering
rate
increases for all of its users in an
effort to achieve rate equalization
and compliance with unfunded federal mandates; and
Whereas,
the
proposed
rate
increase for residents of the City of
Cleveland is 8.5% in year 2003, 7.9%
in year 2004, 7.3% in 2005, and 7.2%
in 2006; and
Whereas, if this proposed rate
increase is approved, City of Cleveland residents who currently pay a
rate of $21.10 per mcf for NEORSD
sewer services will pay a rate of
$28.40 per mcf for NEORSD sewer
services in the year 2006; and
Whereas,
this
proposed
rate
increase exceeds the rate of inflation and places an unreasonable burden on the citizens of the City of
Cleveland; and

about the adverse impact this rate
increase will have on the citizens of
the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, this Council is opposed
to this proposed rate increase and
encourages NEORSD to consider
lower and reasonable rate increases;
