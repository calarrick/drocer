and the “system may well be allowing some innocent defendants to be
executed”; and
Whereas, the NAACP and other
civil rights organizations throughout the State of Ohio have called for
a moratorium on the death penalty
until a fair system is in place; and
Whereas,
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment without parole is now
available to courts and juries in the
State of Ohio as an alternative to
the imposition of the death penalty;
and
Whereas, Ohio Supreme Court Justice Paul Pfeifer, a sponsor of the
1981 State of Ohio death penalty
law, now states that he is personally “moving closer to opposing the
death penalty and that an independent panel should review the cases
of the 203 death row inmates”; and
Whereas, the advent of DNA testing has already caused an increase
in exoneration of condemned persons and those convicted of murder;
and
Whereas, all major religious bodies declared that the capital punishment system needs review and
the United States Catholic Bishops
expressed
a
“concern
about
inequitable use and an imperfect legal
system that has condemned innocent
people”; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby calls upon the General Assembly
of the State of Ohio to enact legislation which results in a moratorium on executions and signing of
death penalty warrants in the State
of Ohio, with such moratorium lasting until the General Assembly
determines that the legal, moral,
racial, economic and ethical problems surrounding the death penalty
are fully resolved and can certify
that the system is legal, just and
humane.

copies of this resolution to all members of the General Assembly of the
State of Ohio.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency

By Councilman Coats.
An emergency resolution supporting the National League of Cities
and the Alliance of Local Organizations Against Preemption (ALOAP)
in their opposition to the FCC’s ruling on cable modem services, and
urging that the Director of Law join
these parties in opposing the FCC’s
ruling, which would have the effect
of denying the City franchise fees
from the revenues received by Adelphia for its cable modem service in
the City.
Whereas, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a
Declaratory Ruling on March 15,
2002 (GN Docket No. 00-185, and CS
Docket No. 02-52), in which the FCC
reclassified cable modem service as
an information service, such that
cities would no longer be able to
require cable companies to pay franchise fees on the revenues such companies receive from the provision of
cable modem services; and
Whereas,
Adelphia
Cleveland’s
franchise with the City of Cleveland
for the provision of cable television
and related services over its cable
system in the City requires Adelphia
to offer cable modem service for
high speed access to the Internet to
its subscribers in all parts of the
City by April 2003, and to pay franchise fees on the revenues Adelphia
receives from the sale of such services; and

The City Record
Whereas, Adelphia Cleveland has
declared its refusal to pay any franchise fees on cable modem revenues;
and
Whereas, the National League of
Cities,
the
U.S.
Conference
of
Mayors, the National Association of
Telecommunications Officers and Advisors (NATOA), the International
Municipal Lawyers Association and
other organizations have formed the
Alliance
of
Local
Organizations
Against Preemption (ALOAP) to
fight against the FCC’s ruling on
cable
modem
services,
and
the
Alliance filed a petition recently at
the U.S. District Court of Appeals in
Washington, D.C., asking for a
review of the FCC ruling; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has the obligation and desire to protect consumers in the City in the
provision of all services offered by
the City’s franchisee Adelphia Cleveland in the City through its use of
the public right-of-way, and its franchise requires Adelphia to pay fees
on revenues from all services, including cable modem services; now
therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council expresses it full support of the Alliance of Local Organizations Against
Preemption (ALOAP) and urges the
City’s Director of Law to join in the
effort of ALOAP in opposing the
FCC’s ruling.
Section 2. That upon its passage
by City Council the Clerk of Council shall provide copies of this Resolution to the following: Mayor Campbell, the Director of Law, the FCC,
and Adelphia Cleveland.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

An emergency resolution opposing Adelphia Cleveland’s refusal to
pay
franchise fees on revenues it
derives from offering cable modem
service in the City, and urging the
Director of Law to take all actions
necessary to enforce the provisions
of the City’s franchise with Adelphia that require it to pay franchise
fees on revenues from cable modem
service.
Whereas,
Adelphia
Cleveland’s
cable franchise with the City of
Cleveland requires Adelphia to offer
cable modem service for high speed
access to the Internet to subscribers
in all parts of the City by April 2003,
and to pay franchise fees on revenues from such services to the City;
and
Whereas, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a
Ruling on March 15, 2002 declaring
that cable modem service is an
interstate information service and
not a cable service, and seeking

1222

June 5, 2002
comments on the issue of whether
the FCC should preclude state and
local governments from regulating
cable
modem
service,
including
access and franchise requirements
and the payment of franchise fees
on revenues from cable modem service, and
Whereas, Adelphia sent a letter to
City Council on April 22, 2002 declaring its intention to immediately and
unilaterally cease collection and
payment of franchise fees on cable
modem services currently offered
and hereafter offered in the City;
and
Whereas, the action of the FCC on
March 15, 2002 included a Notice of
Proposed Rulemaking, in which the
FCC is seeking comments on its
declared policy, which means that
the FCC’s Ruling is not final and is
subject to modification or reversal,
making Adelphia’s precipitous action premature; and
Whereas,
Adelphia’s
Franchise
requires Adelphia to pay fees on
revenues from all services, including cable modem services, and the
definition of gross revenue in Adelphia’s Franchise, on which Adelphia
has agreed to pay 5% in franchise
fees, includes consideration in any
form from the operation by Adelphia
of its System, and the offering of
any services over its System, such
that even if the FCC ultimately does
affirm its currently declared position that cable modem service is not
a cable service, Adelphia has a contractual obligation through at least
September 15, 2006, to pay franchise
fees on cable modem service; and
Whereas, any withholding of franchise fees on cable modem service
must be considered a violation of
the franchise terms; and
Whereas, Council has asked Adelphia to reverse its policy, but Adelphia has refused; now therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
strongly objects to Adelphia’s unilateral and precipitous action declaring its refusal to pay franchise fees
on revenues from cable modem services it is beginning to offer to consumers in the City.
Section 2. That this Council urges
the Law Director of the City to take
all action necessary to enforce the
City’s
franchise
with
Adelphia
Cleveland, and to require Adelphia
to meet its obligation to pay franchise fees on revenues from cable
modem services, regardless of the
FCC’s ultimate decision.
Section 3. That upon its passage
by City Council the Clerk of Council shall provide copies of this Resolution to the following: Mayor Campbell, the Director of Law, and Adelphia Cleveland.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Res. No. 1162-02.
By Councilman Jones.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Senate to table H.B. 274,
which will allow citizens the right
to carry concealed firearms, and
H.B. 303 that would strike down all
local ordinances that restrict guns,
until a thorough study has been
done to determine if citizens and
neighborhood communities will become safer if such a law is enacted.
Whereas, H.B. 274 would allow
Ohio residents to legally carry a
concealed firearm, upon meeting
specific requirements and passing a
criminal background check as required by the State of Ohio; and
Whereas, H.B. 303 is a preemption
bill that would strike down all local
city ordinances that restrict firearms, including local laws against
semiautomatic assault weapons; and
Whereas, such laws allowing the
right to carry concealed firearms
would force the police and other law
enforcement authorities to allow
thousands of people to carry hidden
handguns on the street and into public places, thus putting police officers and the public at potential risk;
and
Whereas, the right to carry concealed firearms is part of an emerging trend throughout the country as
more states are passing legislation
allowing citizens to legally carry
such firearms; and
Whereas, thirty-three states have
already enacted such laws allowing
citizens the right to carry concealed
firearms; and
Whereas, there are concerns that
the right to carry concealed firearms may threaten the safety of citizens as well as neighborhood communities; and
Whereas, there are concerns about
the effectiveness of monitoring and
enforcement of this law in order to
ensure citizen safety by law enforcement authorities should it be approved by the state; and
Whereas, there is a need to do further research to determine if such
laws allowing citizens to carry concealed firearms do not threaten the
safety of the general public, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
strongly urges the Ohio Senate to
table H.B. 274 and H.B. 304, until
empirical research has been done to
determine if such laws allowing citizens to carry concealed firearms
does not create a threat to the safety of the general public.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
the leaders of the Ohio Senate.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
