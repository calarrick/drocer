FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 153-02.
By Councilman Brady.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio General Assembly to adopt
“Ohio Care,” a publicly funded, notfor-profit health insurance program.
Whereas, by passage of numerous
resolutions and ordinances and by
its efforts to keep St. Michael Hospital operational, this Council of the
City of Cleveland has stated that
every person residing or employed
in Ohio is entitled, as a matter of
right, to accessible, affordable and
quality health care; and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
that there is a growing crisis in
health care in the State of Ohio manifested by massive layoffs, a steep
increase in premiums, co-payments
and deductibles, and the closing of
many health care facilities serving
low-to-middle income residents; and
Whereas, insured persons now
commonly experience unacceptable
and
sometimes
life-threatening
delays in obtaining approval for
needed health care services by private, for-profit health insurers; and
Whereas, it is estimated that the
complexity and redundant bureaucracy arising from the existence of
multiple, for-profit insurance plans,
each with its own distinct program
of coverage and benefits, its own
costly administrative and executive
structure, and its own system of processing managed care approvals,
and payments of benefits and/or
reimbursements, wastes up to 30%
of premiums paid for medical coverage by Ohio employers and private citizens, resources which otherwise could be used to provide
benefits; and
Whereas, the bureaucratic structure and its inefficiencies distract
health care providers from providing efficient and effective medical
services to patients and places a
drain on the financial resources of
Ohio taxpayers; and
Whereas, this Council contends
that a single-payer, publicly-funded,
not-for-profit health plan will: eliminate the redundant bureaucracy
caused by numerous insurers; greatly reduce administrative costs associated with providing medical care;
free-up
additional
financial
resources; allow medical providers to
focus their efforts on providing
quality care; and reduce the cost of
health care coverage for Ohio residents and employers; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public health; now therefore,

14
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges the Ohio
General Assembly to commit to
enact “Ohio Care,” a comprehensive,
publicly funded, not-for-profit health
insurance program covering: (a) all
residents of the State of Ohio as
well as all dependents of Ohio residents, whether residing within the
state or elsewhere; and (b) all persons employed in the state, regardless of residence within or outside
of the state, as well as their dependents.
Section 2. That this Council urges
the prompt passage of “Ohio Care”
so that upon its effective date:
i. Health insurance will be provided to all persons employed in the
state and their dependents by or
through their non-federal public and
private
employers,
including
all
health insurance previously provided by the State government to its
employees, thereby relieving Ohio
employers of the cost and administrative burden of providing health
insurance coverage; and
ii. Every person will be covered
by one uniform program of health
insurance benefits, including prescription drug coverage, dental care,
vision care, long-term care and coverage for mental illness on full parity with coverages for all other
types of illnesses; and
iii. An Ohio Care Commission will
be
created,
as
an
independent
agency of state government, to
implement and administer the Ohio
Care program; and
iv. The Ohio Care benefit program
will be designed and maintained so
as to guarantee health care services
of excellent quality, timely delivered and accessible to all; full support for ongoing medical research,
medical education and training; full
choice of providers; and access to
comprehensive, preventive and longterm care; and
v. All federal funds allocated for
health care purposes by Medicare,
Medicaid, Veterans Administration,
and other programs will be paid to
Ohio Care, after obtaining the necessary waivers from the federal government; and
vi. Any person who while covered
by Ohio Care requires health care
services anywhere in the world will
be entitled to Ohio Care benefits to
pay for such services to the extent
payment has not otherwise been provided; and
vii. Any resident displaced from
employment by the private health
insurance industry in this state as
a direct result of the enactment of
Ohio Care will be eligible to receive,
at state expense, retraining and temporary financial assistance to facilitate reemployment without significant loss of income, and will receive
preference for hiring for employment by the Ohio Care Commission
in any position for which the displaced resident is qualified; and
viii. Ohio Care will be funded by
utilizing federal, state and local
monies that currently are used to
fund existing Ohio health care programs, and any additional funding
mechanism deemed necessary to
ensure that Ohio Care is fully funded with adequate reserves.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to forward
a copy of this resolution to the
members of the Cleveland area del-

An emergency resolution urging
the
United
States
Congress
to
review and modify federal tax laws
applicable to large multi-million dollar corporations.
Whereas, the recent collapse of
Enron Corporation has illustrated a
number of loopholes and inequities
that exist in our legal system that
have served to benefit corporate
giants in America; and
Whereas, it has been reported that
Enron has paid no federal corporate
income taxes in four of the last five
years, and instead received $382 million in tax refunds; and
Whereas, the hard working citizens of Cleveland and throughout
the country dutifully pay federal
income tax to support our country’s
defense, building and maintenance
of our infrastructure and social programs; and
Whereas, this Council finds such
legal loopholes appalling as they

Congress
consider
such measures as to close these tax

would tighten such tax laws.

copy of this resolution to Senators
