FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTION READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 645-02.
By Councilmen Cimperman, Westbrook, Sweeney, Reed and O’Malley.
An emergency resolution urging
the Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development to take certain actions
regarding the Asset Control Area
program and the proposed ACD
demonstration program.
Whereas, the Asset Control Area
(ACA)
program
legislation
was
passed in 1998 by Congress to protect community development interests in the disposition of foreclosed
FHA-insured
single-family
homes
and has permitted local governments and experienced non-profit
real estate developers to gain control of HUD’s inventory of foreclosed properties, generating the
productive redevelopment and lasting homeownership of these homes;
and
Whereas, Cleveland’s Asset Control Area program provides a comprehensive community development
solution to the problem of abandoned FHA-insured foreclosures that
have for decades acted as a blighting influence in Cleveland neighborhoods; and
Whereas, currently 100% of this
distressed inventory in specified
Cleveland tracts is purchased by the
Cleveland Housing Network (CHN)
in partnership with its 22 affiliated
community development corporations
and the properties are being redeveloped through CHN’s homeownership programs; and
Whereas, CHN has successfully
met every provision of its ACA contract with HUD, with HUD’s oversight including ongoing site visits,
receipt of quarterly reports detailing
on each ACA property purchased by
CHN rehabilitation cost, sales price,
verified buyer income information,

and other information pertinent to
CHN’s contract; and
Whereas, since Cleveland’s ACA
contract was established in July
2000, CHN has taken title to 203
homes,
has
already
successfully
redeveloped 99 homes, and has generated $17 million of new investments in Cleveland’s neighborhoods;
and
Whereas, on February 25, 2002, the
HUD Inspector General released a
nationwide audit of the ACA program
siting
numerous
problems
with the program and recommended
that HUD terminate the ACA program; and
Whereas, in response to this audit,
HUD has imposed a moratorium on
the ACA program, and CHN’s ACA
contract expired on March 31, 2002;
and
Whereas, on February 5, 2002,
HUD published a Notice of FHA Accelerated Claim Disposition (ACD)
Demonstration in the Federal Register, whereby HUD proposes to sell
its interest in troubled FHA-insured
loans to for-profit bidders who will
then step into HUD’s shoes to control the foreclosure, property management, and ultimate resale of
these homes; and
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland believes that this ACD
program
will
have
a
blighting
influence on inner-city markets, and,
therefore, contends that ACD demonstration must exclude Revitalization
Areas in general and Cleveland’s
Revitalization Areas in particular;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public safety, welfare and
health; now therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland urges the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to exempt Cleveland and its
ACA contractors that can demonstrate both capacity and compliance
with the provisions of its ACA contract from the recently imposed
moratorium on the ACA program.
Unduly hampering the operations of
these successful contracts, such as
the one in Cleveland, will cause
unnecessary losses to HUD and its
high-performing
ACA
contractors
alike, as well as causing needless
blight in urban neighborhoods by
delaying the productive redevelopment and lasting homeownership of
vacant properties.
Section 2. That this Council urges
HUD to adopt the recommendations
made last year by HUD in partnership with national community development intermediaries, local governments and ACA contractors that
would strengthen the performance
and effective oversight of the ACA
program.
Section 3. That this Council urges
HUD to protect vulnerable inner-city
neighborhoods such as Cleveland
from the ACD pilot demonstration
since properties located in areas
with negligible or negative profit
margins will be abandoned or sold
to the highest bidder without regard
to the destabilizing consequences to
inner-city neighborhoods.
Section 4. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to transmit
a copy of this resolution to the U.S.
Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development
and
the
Executive
Director of Cleveland Housing Network, Inc.

hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

The City Record
Res. No. 610-02.
By Councilmen Cimperman and
Jones.
An emergency resolution renewing Council’s opposition to the transportation of high level nuclear
waste through Ohio and the storage
of such hazardous waste at a site in
Yucca Mountain, Nevada.
Whereas, pursuant to Resolution
No. 145-2000, adopted on January 31,
2000, this Council of the City of
Cleveland unanimously declared its
opposition to the proposal of the
Department of Energy to consolidate
77,000
tons
of
high
level
nuclear waste fuel within Yucca
Mountain, located approximately 100
miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada; and
Whereas, this Council stated its
opposition to the possible transportation of the nuclear
waste by
trucks and rail through Ohio to the
Yucca Mountain site since, at the
time that Resolution No. 145-2000
was adopted, it was estimated that
nine casks a day containing radioactive waste would travel through
Ohio weekly, with a route through
Cleveland approximately 90% of the
time; and
Whereas, Resolution No. 145-2000
called on the Department of Energy
to examine alternative methods for
the disposal of the lethal material
to avoid jeopardizing the safety and
welfare of the citizens of Cleveland
and Northeast Ohio; and
Whereas, the federal government
is continuing with its plan to transport high level nuclear waste to
Yucca Mountain and, as such, the
waste will pass through 43 states
within a mile of 50 million Americans putting them at risk for exposure to potential high levels of
radiation due to terrorist attacks,
sabotage, or inevitable accidents;
and
Whereas,
high
level
nuclear
wastes will likely move through
Ohio on I-90, I-480, the Ohio Turnpike, I-70 and major rail lines
through major Ohio urban and farmland areas; and
Whereas,
between
35,000
and
100,000 shipments will be required
during the 25 year emplacement
phase of Yucca Mountain, and most
of these shipments would be routed
through the most heavily populated
areas of major U.S. cities; and
Whereas, according to the DOE’s
own data, between 70 and 310 accidents
and
over
1,000
incidents
would occur during a program of
moving nuclear waste by truck and
the DOE estimates that a shipping
accident with highly radioactive
waste would impact public health
and safety within a 50 mile radius;
and
Whereas, a person standing one
yard away from an unshielded, 10
year
old
fuel
assembly
would
receive a lethal dose of radioactivity in less than three minutes, and
further, the high level nuclear waste
containers that will hold this waste
during shipment have been tested
only in computer simulations and
have never been physically tested
for ability to withstand an accident;
and
Whereas, the transportation of
high level nuclear waste will likely
significantly decrease the property
values of properties along the targeted transportation route; and
Whereas, there is a train accident
in the United States approximately
every 90 minutes and a train carrying hazardous materials runs off the
tracks, spills some of its load and

709

25
forces an evacuation about once
every two weeks; and
Whereas, Department of Energy
data indicates that the Yucca Mountain site will fail to contain nuclear
waste and radioactive gases will be
released and radioactive waste will
be washed into the ground water a
short time after the first containers
fail; and
Whereas,
in
1992,
Congress
exempted the Yucca Mountain site
from the EPA standard and instead
enacted a special standard applicable only to that site; and
Whereas, Yucca Mountain is in a
very active earthquake zone and
there have been 621 earthquakes
greater than 2.5 on the Richter
Scale within a 50 mile radius of
Yucca Mountain since 1976, thus
exceeding current Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations for
allowing licensure as a nuclear
reactor with on-site waste storage;
and
Whereas, this Council renews its
objection to the Department of Energy proposal to transport nuclear
waste and restates its position that
alternative
methods
of
disposal
must be examined; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public safety, welfare and
health; now therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland renews its objection to the transportation to and
storage of high level nuclear waste
at the Yucca Mountain, Nevada and
urges the Secretary of the Department of Energy to declare the site
unsuitable for development of a
nuclear repository now or in the
future, to terminate all work at the
site, and to inform Congress of the
actions being taken.
Section 2. That this Council urges
Congress, the Department of energy
and the state of Ohio to insure adequate national, state and local assistance and appropriations to fund
emergency management activities
for state and local jurisdictions
through which nuclear waste will be
transported well before the first
nuclear waste shipment will take
place and until all shipments cease.
Section 3. That this Council urges
the Department of Energy and the
state of Ohio to diversify our state’s
and nation’s energy portfolio by
investing in and fully utilizing energy efficiency and promoting alternative technologies such as wind,
solar, biomass, low-impact hydro
and geothermal, combined with a
movement toward distributed generation and fuel cells to improve electricity reliability and energy independence.
Section 4. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to transmit
a copy of this resolution to President Bush, Governor Taft, Senators
Voinovich and DeWine, U.S. Representatives
Kucinich
and
Tubbs
Jones, and the Earth Day Coalition.
Section 5. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted April 1, 2002.
Effective April 8, 2002.

Res. No. 611-02.
By Councilmen Jackson, Cimperman, Jones, Cintron, Scott and Westbrook.
An emergency resolution supporting the passage of Issue 10 for the
Cleveland-Cuyahoga
County
Port
Authority on the May 7, 2002 ballot.
Whereas, the Cleveland-Cuyahoga
County Port Authority has a renewal levy on the May 7, 2002 ballot
known as Issue 10 that is vital to
the
city,
county
and
regional
economies; and
Whereas, the Cleveland-Cuyahoga
County Port Authority was established to create and retain jobs in
Northeast Ohio, is an integral part
of the Port of Cleveland, and has
turned the industrial lakefront into
a job producing asset and has done
so admirably since 1968; and
Whereas, the Port of Cleveland
provides vital low cost transportation
to
the
automotive,
steel,
machinery, raw materials, chemicals, metal processing and other
manufacturing and energy related
industries; and
Whereas, according to credible
independent research, the Port of
Cleveland is crucial to 10,000 maritime and related jobs in the area,
$350
million
in
annual
family
income, $200 million in tax income
for schools and communities, and
17,000 jobs in trade zones; and
Whereas, revenue from Issue 10
will be used to upgrade port maritime facilities, protect local jobs,
help Cleveland and the Greater
Cleveland region to compete worldwide, provide capacity for future
growth in cargo and vessel calls,
and allow the Port to use current
transportation technology to protect
the region’s future economic competitiveness; and
Whereas, Issue 10 is the County’s
smallest levy, will not increase
taxes, and asks the average homeowner to continue a monthly investment of just 37 cents per month; and
Whereas, Issue 10 has earned the
endorsement of Mayor Jane Campbell, the AFL-CIO, the UAW, the
Building
Trades
Council,
the
Greater Cleveland Growth Association and COSE, U.S. Representatives
Dennis Kucinich, Stephanie TubbsJones,
Sherrod
Brown,
Steven
LaTourette,
former
Congressman
Louis Stokes, and Councilman Joe
Cimperman in whose ward the Port
of Cleveland is located; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public safety, welfare and
health; now therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland determines that it
is in the best interest of the residents of the City of Cleveland and
those of Northeast Ohio to support
the passage of Issue 10, a renewal
of a 0.13 mill tax levy of the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority at the May 7, 2002 election.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Res. No. 612-02.
By Councilman Lewis.
An emergency resolution endorsing working with the County Auditor’s Office to seek refunds from the
State Tax Commissioner for homeowners who have paid the full tax
on property that is exempt pursuant
to the CRA Program.
Whereas, pursuant to Ordinance
No. 2831-86, passed February 9, 1987
as amended by Ordinance Nos. 117194, passed July 20, 1994, 959-99,
passed June 7, 1999 and 2095-99,
passed December 13, 1999, and Ordinance No. 1776-A-90, passed April 22,
1991, as amended by Ordinance Nos.
960-99, passed June 7, 1999, 2093-99,
passed December 13, 1999 and 134101, passed August 15, 2001, the City
of Cleveland has established a Community Reinvestment Area (CRA)
Program in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 3735.67
of the Ohio Revised Code; and
Whereas,
the
CRA
Program
allows the City of Cleveland to pursue redevelopment and revitalization of residential property by providing residential tax exemption for
new construction and remodeling of
existing structures; and
Whereas, in order to continue to
receive a tax exemption, a property
owner must maintain the property
and timely pay all taxes; and
Whereas,
pursuant
to
Section
3735.67(D) of the Ohio Revised Code,
“The tax exemption shall first apply
in the year the construction or
remodeling would first be taxable
but for this section;” and
Whereas, because of timing constraints, there is oftentimes a delay
in the delivery of the tax exemption
in the first year that the construction is taxable and this delay causes an undue financial burden on
new homeowners who have incurred
significant costs in the first year of
home construction; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
and the Cuyahoga County Auditor’s
Office have worked cooperatively to
advance the CRA Program and are
in agreement that the tax exemption
should be effective the first year
that the construction is taxable; and
Whereas, to that end, the City of
Cleveland and the Cuyahoga County Auditor’s Office will seek refunds
of exempted tax from the State Tax
Commissioner for homeowners who
have paid the full tax on property
that is exempt pursuant to the CRA
Program; and
Whereas the City of Cleveland and
the Cuyahoga County Auditor’s Office
will continue to work together to
ensure that the tax exemption properly applies when it should apply; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland endorses working
with the County Auditor’s Office to
seek refunds of exempted tax from
the State Tax Commissioner for
homeowners who have paid the full
tax on single family newly constructed property that is exempt
pursuant to the CRA Program and
that the Council urges the State Tax
Commissioner to grant such refunds
where appropriate.
Section 2. That the Clerk is directed to send a copy of this resolution
to the County Auditor and the State
Tax Commissioner.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency

710

April 10, 2002
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force

shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Res. No. 613-02.
By Councilman Westbrook.
An emergency resolution urging
the airlines to reconsider their plans
to stop paying commissions to travel agents.
Whereas, it has been announced
that Delta Airlines, American Airlines, Continental Airlines and Northwest Airlines have plans to stop paying commissions to travel agents; and
Whereas, the rest of the airline industry is expected to follow suit; and
Whereas, travel agents are paid
strictly on commission from various
tour and travel operations, including
airlines, hotels, car rental agencies
and cruise lines; and
Whereas,
air
travel
accounts
make up more than 65 percent of
most travel agencies’ business; and
Whereas, travel agents handle 80
percent of all airline tickets sold in
the United States; and
Whereas, zero base commissions
interfere with the ability of travel
agencies to fulfill their Computer
Reservations Systems (CRS) contract productivity obligations as
travel agents make more use of the
Internet to meet clients’ needs; and
Whereas, that this decision of the
airlines
also
impacts
consumers
because, without question, travel
agents will have to charge travelers
more in fees to make up for the lost
commissions; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the airlines to reconsider their plans
to stop paying commissions to travel agents.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
the CEOs of the major airlines.

hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives

immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
