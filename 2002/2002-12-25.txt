Res. No. 2475-02.
By Council Members Coats, Cintron, Cimperman, Brady, Conwell,
Westbrook, Johnson, Scott, Jackson,
Britt, Zone, White, O’Malley, Gordon
and Reed.
An
emergency
resolution
condemning the recent comments of
Senator Trent Lott relating to the
Presidential election of 1948 as such
comments appear to imply support
for racial segregation; encouraging
the United States Senate to elect a
Senator to the position of Senate
Majority Leader who is committed
to racial equality; encouraging Senator Michael DeWine and Senator
George Voinovich to oppose the election of Senator Trent Lott as Senate
Majority Leader; and encouraging
the United States Senate to censure
Senator Trent Lott for his recent
comments.
Whereas, Senator Trent Lott, Senate Majority Leader, recently commented on Strom Thurmond’s candidacy for President in 1948 and
stated the following: “When Strom
Thurmond ran for President, we
voted for him. We’re proud of it.
And if the rest of the country had
followed our lead, we wouldn’t have

The City Record
had all these problems over all
these years”; and
Whereas, such comment has been
repeatedly reported in the media;
and
Whereas, Strom Thurmond ran as
the nominee of the States’ Rights
Party with an avowed goal of preserving racial segregation; and
Whereas, this is at least the second time that Senator Lott has made
comments of this nature; and
Whereas, Senator Lott has a long
history of opposing the rights of
African-Americans as he opposed
the integration of the University of
Mississippi, the integration of Sigma
Nu fraternity, the establishment of
the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday,
and the expansion of the Civil
Rights Act; and
Whereas, Senator Lott’s history
includes being a popular speaker for
the white supremacist organization
Council of Conservative Citizens;
and
Whereas, a growing chorus of
democratically minded groups, including the Cleveland AFL-CIO Federation of Labor and the Cleveland
Plain Dealer, have called for the
removal of Senator Lott as Senate
Majority Leader; and
Whereas, Senator Lott has served
as Senate Majority Leader and is
being considered for Senate Majority Leader when Congress convenes
in January; and
Whereas, this Council is concerned about Senator Lott’s remarks
and disturbed by the fact that Senator Lott may be elected to the highest position of leadership within the
Senate; and
Whereas, it is the opinion of this
Council that the leader of the Senate should be an individual with
unquestioned commitment to racial
equality; and
Whereas, censure is a formal condemnation by the Senate of one of
its own Members and is used when
a Member engages in behavior considered
to
be
inappropriate
or
demeaning to the Senate; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council condemns the recent comments of Senator Lott relating to the Presidential
election of 1948 as such comments
appear to imply support for racial
segregation.
Section
2.
That
this
Council
encourages the United States Senate
to elect a Senator to the position of
Senate Majority Leader who is clearly committed to racial equality.
Section 3. That this Council encourages Senator Michael DeWine
and Senator George Voinovich to
oppose the election of Senator Trent
Lott as Senate Majority Leader.
Section
4.
That
this
Council
encourages the United State Senate
to censure Senator Lott for his
recent comments relating to the
Presidential election of 1948 as such
comments appear to imply support
for racial segregation.
Section 5. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to U. S. Senator Trent Lott, U.S. Senator Michael
DeWine, and U.S. Senator George
Voinovich.

An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Economic Development to enter into agreements
with various property owners to provide tax increment financing to partially finance certain improvements
as part of the Lower Euclid Avenue
Commercial and Residential District
redevelopment project and to provide for service payments in lieu of
taxes,
and
to
declare
certain
improvements to real property to be
a public purpose.
Whereas, by Ordinance No. 8702000, passed May 14, 2001, this Council designated the Euclid/Prospect
II Community Development Plan
Area (“Area”) and approved the Euclid/Prospect
II
Community
Development Plan (“Plan”); and
Whereas,
pursuant
to
Section
5709.41 of the Ohio Revised Code,
improvements to real property within the Area and consistent with the
Plan, may be declared to be a public purpose where fee title to such
real property was, at one time, held
by the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, pursuant to the authority of Ordinance No. 2246-02, passed
November 25, 2002, the City acquired
fee title to certain real property
within the Area, which is more particularly described in the documents
set forth in the file described in Section 1 of this ordinance (the “Real

Whereas,
pursuant

such improvements so declared to be

from real property taxation; and
Whereas,
pursuant

Section
5709.42 of the Ohio Revised Code,
the owners of such improvements

are or will be located if the ordinance declaring improvements to a
parcel to be a public purpose specifies that service payments in lieu of
taxes provided for in Section 5709.42
of the Ohio Revised Code shall be
paid to the school district in which
the parcel is located in the amount

payable to the school district if the
improvements had not been exempted from taxation; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure in that
the same provides for the immediate
preservation of the public peace,
safety, property, and welfare, and
for the further reason that designation of the Area and approval of the
Plan will stimulate the creation and
preservation of job opportunities

Ord. No. 2369-02.
By Council Member Jackson (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing a supplement to Lease-Purchase
Agreement relating to the acquisition by lease-purchase of the Cleveland Stadium; approving a Supplemental Trust Agreement and the
issuance of Certificates of Participation to pay costs of refunding outstanding certificates of participation; authorizing a swaption and
related master agreement; authorizing agreements for the sale of the
refunding certificates of participation; and authorizing and approving
related matters.
Whereas, pursuant to Ordinance
No. 305-96 passed by the Council on
March 8, 1996, and for the purpose
of acquiring by lease-purchase the
Cleveland Stadium, the City signed

2820

December 25, 2002
and
delivered
a
Lease-Purchase
Agreement dated as of June 1, 1997
(as amended and supplemented by
the First Supplemental Lease-Purchase Agreement dated as of September 15, 1999, the Existing Facility Lease) between the ClevelandCuyahoga County Port Authority
(the Authority), as lessor, and the
City, as lessee, and approved a
Trust Agreement dated as of June
1, 1997 (as amended and supplemented by the First Supplemental
Trust Agreement dated as of September 15, 1999, the Existing Trust
Agreement), between the Authority
and U.S. Bank National Association,
as trustee (the Trustee), pursuant to
which the Trustee signed and delivered $139,345,000 Certificates of Participation, Series 1997 (Cleveland
Stadium Project) (the 1997 Certificates) and $20,545,051.60 Certificates
of Participation, Series 1999 (Cleveland Stadium Project) (the 1999 Certificates), each such series of Certificates evidencing proportionate
interests in Base Rent (as defined
in the Facility Lease) to be paid by
the City pursuant to the Facility
Lease;
Whereas,
under
the
Existing
Trust Agreement, Additional Certificates (as defined in the Existing
Trust Agreement) may, with the
approval of the City, be issued to
pay the cost of refunding outstanding Certificates;
Whereas, because the 1997 Certificates maturing on or after November 15, 2010 are not subject to
optional redemption until on and
after November 15, 2007, an advance
refunding of the 1997 Certificates
under current market conditions
would not result in savings to the
City, but the City may obtain savings at this time by entering into an
agreement (the Swaption) with a
financial
institution
(the
Swap
Counterparty) having terms that
provide for an upfront payment to
the City by the Swap Counterparty
in consideration of the City’s giving
the Swap Counterparty the option to
make effective on a future date an
interest rate exchange transaction
with the City in which the City will
make payments to the Swap Counterparty at a fixed rate and the
Swap Counterparty will make payments to the City at a variable rate,
in each case, calculated in reference
to an amount equal to the principal
amount outstanding, from time to
time, of tax-exempt Additional Certificates
(the
Refunding
Certificates) to be issued to refund the
1997 Certificates maturing on or
after the date of exercise of the
option granted by the Swaption (the
Refunded 1997 Certificates);
Whereas, this Council finds and
determines that the present value of
the Base Rent payments to be made
by the City with respect to the Cleveland Stadium, taking into account
the upfront payment described above,
will be reduced by the refinancing of
the Refunded 1997 Certificates under
the arrangement described above
and that it is necessary and in the
best interest of the City to enter into
the Swaption and refinance the
Refunded 1997 Certificates, thereby
reducing the financing costs of the
Cleveland Stadium;
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department and provid-

December 25, 2002
ing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that the entering into
the Swaption and the Swap Agreements and authorizing issuance of
the Refunding Certificates, the signing of the Supplemental Lease and
the approval of the Supplemental
Trust
Agreement,
effective
upon
exercise by the Swap Counterparty
of its option under the Swaption, is
needed to enable the City to take
advantage of current favorable market
conditions
to
refinance
the
Refunded 1997 Certificates and thereby reduce the financing costs of the
Cleveland Stadium; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of

relaxation and entertainment, and
the signing and delivery of the

the method and procedure by which
the variable rate of interest to be
borne by the Refunding Certificates
shall be determined as provided in
the Supplemental Trust Agreement,
whether by auction, by reference to
a market index, by a remarketing
agent or otherwise; provided that no
Refunding Certificates shall bear
interest at a rate in excess of sixteen
percent
(16%)
per
year.
Notwithstanding that limitation, a
Refunding Certificate held by a
provider of a Credit Support Instrument may bear interest at a rate not

Credit
Support
Instrument.

not permit the Holders to tender
their variable rate Refunding Certificates for purchase by the City. If
the Director of Finance designates
the Refunding Certificates as variable rate Certificates, and if the
Holders of the Refunding Certificates are to be entitled to tender
those Certificates for purchase, then
the Director of Finance shall also
designate in the Letter of Representation,
the
tender
agent
or
agents and the remarketing agent
or agents, which designations shall
be based on the determination of the
Director of Finance that the parties
so designated possess the requisite
resources and experience to provide
the services required of them and
that the terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide
such services are fair and commercially reasonable.
(d) Credit Support and Other Instruments. The Director of Finance
is authorized to enter into agreements in connection with the delivery of the Refunding Certificates,
and from time to time thereafter so
long as the Refunding Certificates
are outstanding, with providers of
Credit Support Instruments, tender
agents (which may be the Trustee),
remarketing agents (which may be
any of the Original Purchasers) and
others as may be determined by the

2822

December 25, 2002
Director of Finance to be necessary
or appropriate to provide for the
method of determining the variable
interest rates, permitting holders
the right of tender and providing for
payment of the purchase price of, or
debt service on, the variable rate
Refunding Certificates. In the event
the variable rate Refunding Certificates are issued as auction rate
obligations, the Director of Finance
is authorized to enter into agreements with auction agents and others, or to cause the Trustee to enter
into those agreements, based on his
determination that the parties so
designated possess the requisite
resources and experience to provide
the services required of them and
that the terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide
such services are fair and commercially reasonable.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of
the
Refunding
Certificates,
and
regardless of whether the Refunding Certificates bear interest at
variable or fixed rates, is authorized
to contract for a Credit Support
Instrument, and to pay the costs of
it from proceeds of the Refunding
Certificates, if he determines that
the Credit Support Instrument will
result in a savings in the cost of the
financing to the City.

be payable under and in accordance
with the Facility Lease, shall be an
amount
sufficient
to
cover
the
amount of Swap Interest Payments
and principal of and interest component on the outstanding Certificates of any series that are due and
payable during that Initial Term or
Renewal Term, and such Base Rent
shall be specified or determined in
an exhibit to the Facility Lease; provided, however, that the City’s payment of Base Rent and Additional

any taxes or other moneys to the
payments due thereunder.

of

Director of Law, between the City
and the Trustee, with terms not
inconsistent with this Ordinance and

to provide information as may be
required in support of those applications for the purpose. The cost of

City and as shall be approved by
Director of Finance. The approval of
those completions and changes, and
the determination that those completions
and
changes
are
not
adverse to the City, shall be conclusively evidenced by that signing.
The Director of Finance is authorized to contract for a Credit Support Instrument to secure or guarantee the payment by the City of
amounts owed by the City to the
Swap Counterparty under the Swap
Agreements. The cost of that Credit Support Instrument may be paid
by the Swap Counterparty or from
the proceeds of the Refunding Certificates or other funds lawfully
available for the purpose.
This Council finds that by engaging
in
interest
rate
hedging
arrangements, from time to time, the
City can, in effect, convert interest
on obligations of the City from a
fixed rate to a floating rate, or from
a floating rate to a fixed rate, and
thereby may reduce its financing
costs by optimizing the relative
amounts of fixed and floating rate
obligations from time to time and
minimizing the risk of variations in
its financing costs. To permit the
City to have the flexibility to undertake interest rate swap, swaption,
rate cap, rate collar and other hedging transactions from time to time,
in addition to the Swaption and the
Swap Agreements, and to establish
the procedures for approving those
transactions, this Council authorizes
the execution and delivery of one or
more hedge agreements (each, a
“Hedge Agreement”) and any related agreements necessary for the
consummation of the transactions
contemplated by each Hedge Agreement.
Upon the determination by the
Director of Finance that it will be
to the financial advantage of the
City, and in the best interests of the
City, that a hedging arrangement be
undertaken by the City with respect
to Base Rent, in addition to the
Swaption and the Swap Agreements,
the Director of Finance may authorize one or more interest rate hedge
transactions in accordance with the
applicable Hedge Agreement; provided that (a) the maximum aggregate notional amount of interest
rate swap or other hedging transactions outstanding at any one time,
net of offsetting interest rate swap
or other hedging transactions, shall
not exceed such amount as will
result in a lowering of the ratings
assigned to the Certificates by the
rating agencies, as is evidenced by
written correspondence from the rating agencies or policies published in
writing by the rating agencies, (b)
the counterparty shall be rated at
the time of signing the Hedge
Agreements not lower than A+ or
A1 by at least one Rating Service or
its obligations under the Hedge
Agreement shall be guaranteed or
insured by an entity rated at the
time of signing the Hedge Agreement not lower than A+ or A1 by
at least one Rating Service, and (c)

2823

45
the term of each hedging transaction shall not exceed 30 years. The
approval of each hedge transaction
by the Director of Finance shall be
conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery of the applicable
Hedge Agreement by the Director of
Finance.
The City’s obligation to pay any
amounts due under the Swaption,
the Swap Agreements and any other
Hedge Agreement related to the
Facility Lease is Subject to Appropriation and Certification as provided in the Facility Lease, and nothing in the Swaption, the Swap
Agreements or any other Hedge
Agreement constitutes a pledge by
the Lessee, or an obligation of the
Lessee, of any taxes or other moneys to the payments due thereunder.
Section 7. Tax Covenants. The
Director of Finance, as the fiscal
officer, or any other officer having
responsibility
for
executing
the
Facility Lease, is, alone or in conjunction with any of the foregoing
or with any other officer or employee of the City, authorized and directed (a) to cooperate with the Original Purchaser and the Trustee by
making, on behalf of the City, such
covenants and representations in the
Facility Lease as are appropriate
and necessary so that (a) the Facility Lease and the Refunding Certificates will not (i) constitute private activity bonds, arbitrage bonds
or hedge bonds under Sections 141,
148 or 149 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”) or (ii) be treated other than
as obligations to which Section
103(a) of the Code applies, and (b)
the interest components of the Lease
and on the Refunding Certificates
will not be treated as an item of tax
preference under Section 57 of the
Code. The City hereby covenants it
will take or cause to be taken such
actions that may be required of it
for the interest components of the
Lease and on the Refunding Certificates to be and remain excluded
from
gross
income
for
federal
income tax purposes and that it will
not take or authorize to be taken
any actions that would adversely
affect that exclusion.
The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer of
the City having responsibility for
execution of the Facility Lease is
hereby authorized (a) to make or
effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or
waiver on behalf of the City with
respect to the Facility Lease and the
Refunding Certificates as the City is
permitted to or required to make or
give under the federal income tax
laws, including, without limitation
thereto, any of the elections provided for in Section 148(f)(4)(C) of the
Code or available under Section 148
of the Code, for the purpose of
assuring, enhancing or protecting
favorable tax treatment or status of
the Lease and the Refunding Certificates or the interest components
thereof or assisting compliance with
requirements
for
that
purpose,
reducing the burden or expense of
such
compliance,
reducing
the
rebate amount or payments or penalties, or making payments of special
amounts in lieu of making computations to determine, or paying,
excess earnings as rebate, or obviating those amounts or payments, as

46
determined by that officer, which
action shall be in writing and
signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf
of the City, as may be appropriate
to assure the exclusion of interest
from gross income and the intended
tax status of the interest components of the Lease and on the
Refunding Certificates, and (c) to
give one or more appropriate certificates of the City, for inclusion in
the transcript for the Refunding
Certificates, setting forth the reasonable expectations of the City
regarding the amount and use of all
the proceeds from the sale of the
Refunding Certificates, the facts,
circumstances
and
estimates
on
which they are based, and other
facts and circumstances relevant to
the tax treatment of the interest
component of and the tax status of
the Refunding Certificates. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provisions of this ordinance to the
contrary, if the Director of Finance
determines prior to the execution
and delivery of the Purchase Agreement and Letter of Representations
that it is necessary and appropriate
and in the best interests of the City
for the interest components of the
Base Rent to be included in gross
income for federal income tax purposes, the City shall not be bound
by the covenants of this Section 7.
Each covenant made in this Section with respect to the Refunding
Certificates
is
also
made
with
respect to all issues any portion of
the principal of or interest on which
is paid from proceeds of the Refunding Certificates (and, if different,
the original issue and any refunding issues in a series of refundings),
to the extent such compliance is necessary to assure exclusion of interest on the Refunding Certificates
from
gross
income
for
federal
income tax purposes, and the officers identified above are authorized
to take actions with respect to those
issues as they are authorized in this
Section to take with respect to the
Refunding Certificates.
Section 8. Financial Advisor. The
Director of Finance may obtain the
services of one or more Financial
Advisors, from time to time, to
assist him in making any of the
determinations
required
by
this
Ordinance to be determined by the
Director of Finance or in valuing
the Swap Agreements or Hedge
Agreements.
The
Director
of
Finance may rely on the written
advice of any Financial Advisor.
Any Financial Advisor employed
under the authority of this ordinance shall be disinterested in the
Swaption transaction and independent of the counterparty and any
other party interested in the Swaption transaction.
Section 9. Validity. It is found and
determined, and is hereby represented and recited, that the provisions of Sections 28, 29, 32, 33
(including the provisions of Section
33 with respect to readings on three
separate days or dispensing with
such readings by a two-thirds vote
of all members of the Council), 36,
37, 48 and all other applicable provisions of the City’s Charter and the

The City Record
rules of this Council have been fully
complied with and this ordinance
was passed in conformity therewith.
Section 10. Severability. Each section of this ordinance and each subdivision or paragraph of any section
is hereby declared to be independent
and the finding or holding of any
section or any subdivision or paragraph of any section to be invalid
or void shall not be deemed or held
to affect the validity of any other
section, subdivision or paragraph of
this ordinance.
Section 11. Compliance with Open
Meeting Law. It is hereby found and
determined that all formal actions
of this Council concerning and relating to the passage of this ordinance
were taken in an open meeting of
this Council, and that all deliberations of this Council and of any of
its committees that resulted in those
formal actions were in meetings
open to the public, in compliance
with all legal requirements including the Charter of the City and any
applicable
provisions
of
Section
121.22 Ohio Revised Code.
Section 12. Effective Date. This
ordinance constitutes an emergency
measure providing for the usual
operation of a municipal department
and providing for the immediate
preservation of the public peace,
property, health or safety in that the
signing and delivery of the Swaption, and the authorization of the
Swap Agreements, the Supplemental
Lease,
the
Supplemental
Trust
Agreement, the Purchase Agreement
and the issuance of the Refunding
Certificates, all as authorized by
this ordinance, is needed to enable
the City to take advantage of current favorable market conditions to
refinance the Refunded 1997 Certificates
(taking
into
account
the
upfront payment under the Swaption) and thereby reduce the financing costs of the Cleveland Stadium
and,
provided
this
Ordinance
receives the affirmative vote of twothirds of all members elected to
Council, it shall take effect and be
in force immediately upon its passage and approval by the Mayor;
otherwise, it shall take effect and
be in force from and after the earliest date allowed by law.
Passed December 16, 2002.
Effective December 20, 2002.

Ord. No. 2370-02.
By Council Member Jackson (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the issuance of Parking Facilities Refunding Revenue Bonds for
the purpose of refunding certain outstanding bonds; authorizing a swaption and related swap agreements;
authorizing agreements for the sale
of the refunding bonds and for their
security;
and
authorizing
and
approving related matters.
Whereas, Ordinance No. 328-92,
passed by the Council on February
24,
1992,
authorized
the
City’s
$71,000,000 Parking Facilities Improvement Revenue Bonds, Series
1992, dated as of October 15, 1992
(the Series 1992 Bonds), for the purpose of providing funds for acquiring, constructing, improving, rehabilitating
and
equipping
certain

2824

December 25, 2002
parking facilities of the City (the
1992 Project);
Whereas, the Series 1992 Bonds
were refunded by $81,105,000 Parking Facilities Refunding Revenue
Bonds, Series 1996, dated as of September 1, 1996 (the Series 1996
Bonds), authorized by Ordinance No.
1023-96, passed by the Council on
June 18, 1996, under an advance
refunding
structure
within
the
meaning of federal tax laws applicable to tax-exempt municipal securities;
Whereas, the Series 1996 Bonds
may not be refinanced by another
advance refunding structure of taxexempt refunding obligations of the
City, but the Series 1996 Bonds
maturing on or after September 15,
2010 may be refinanced by a current
refunding structure of tax-exempt
refunding obligations of the City
beginning on the 90th day prior to
September 15, 2006, when those
Series 1996 Bonds may first be
called for optional redemption;
Whereas, the City may obtain debt
service savings with respect to the
Series 1996 Bonds prior to 2006 by
entering into an agreement (the
Swaption) with a financial institution (the Swap Counterparty) having terms that provide for an
upfront payment to the City by the
Swap Counterparty in consideration
of the City’s giving the Swap Counterparty the option to make effective at a future date an interest rate
exchange transaction with the City
in which the City will make payments to the Swap Counterparty at
a fixed rate and the Swap Counterparty will make payments to the
City at a variable rate, in each case
calculated in reference to an amount
equal to the principal amount outstanding, from time to time, of taxexempt refunding obligations (the
Refunding Bonds) to be issued by
the City to refund the Series 1996
Bonds maturing on and after the
later of the date of exercise of the
option granted by the Swaption or
September 15, 2010 (the Refunded
1996 Bonds).
Whereas, this Council finds and
determines that the present value of
the debt service payments to be
made by the City with respect to the
1992 Project, taking into account the
upfront payment described above,
will be reduced by the refinancing
of the Refunded Bonds under the
arrangement described above and
that it is necessary and in the best
interests of the City to refinance the
Refunded 1996 Bonds, to call for
optional redemption the Refunded
1996 Bonds, and to issue the Refunding Bonds to provide funds, together with any other funds available to
the City for that purpose, to refund
the Refunded 1996 Bonds, thereby
reducing the financing costs of the
1992 Project;
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department and providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that the entering into
the Swaption and the Swap Agreements (described below), and authorizing issuance of the Refunding
Bonds upon exercise by the Swap
Counterparty of its option under the
Swaption is needed to enable the
City to take advantage of current
favorable market conditions to refi-

December 25, 2002
nance the Refunded 1996 Bonds and
thereby reduce the financing costs
of the 1992 Project; now, therefore,

Section 2. Determinations by Council. This Council finds and determines as follows:
(a) Public Purpose. It was necessary for the City to acquire, construct, improve, rehabilitate and
equip the municipal parking facilities comprising the 1992 Project; the
1992 Project and the issuance of the
Series 1992 Bonds to pay costs of the
1992 Project, and the delivery of the
Swaption,
the
issuance
of
the
Refunding Bonds and any payments
under the Swap Agreements to refinance the Refunded 1996 Bonds,
served or serves a proper public
municipal
purpose
by
providing
needed parking facilities to the people of the City, alleviating traffic
congestion on the streets of the City,
thereby facilitating the movement of
traffic, the movement of police and
fire vehicles in the City for the safety and welfare of its citizens, and
the cleaning of the streets for the
health, safety and welfare of its citizens. The facilities comprising the
1992 Project are located in designated urban renewal areas of the
City, and the City’s completion of
the municipal facilities constituting
the 1992 Project in those urban
renewal areas, and the issuance of
the Series 1992 Bonds to pay costs
of the 1992 Project, the delivery of
the Swaption, the issuance of the
Refunding Bonds and any payments
under the Swap Agreements to refinance the Refunded 1996 Bonds,
were and will be undertaken for the
elimination of conditions of blight
determined to exist in those areas
and to prevent the reoccurrence of
such conditions of blight. The 1992
Project advances the economic welfare of the City by increasing and
promoting commerce by providing
parking facilities for surrounding
businesses and other commercial
enterprises, and the 1992 Project creates and preserves jobs and employ-

48
ment opportunities in the City and
improves the economic welfare of
the City by maintaining and improving access to the City by the commuting public.
(b) Swaption. It is necessary,
proper and in the best interests of
the City to enter into the Swaption
and the Swap Agreements, based on
a notional amount equal to the principal amount of the Refunding
Bonds and taking into account the
upfront payment by the Swap Counterparty to the City, in order to
obtain present value debt service
savings with respect to the Series
1996 Bonds. The Director of Finance
shall negotiate the terms of the
Swaption with a financial institution satisfying the credit criteria in
this Ordinance for a Swap Counterparty and offering an upfront payment to the City in an amount that,
in the written opinion of a Financial Advisor, is fair value for the
Swaption, given the credit, terms
and conditions offered by the City
to the Swap Counterparty. The
Director of Finance shall determine
the terms and conditions of the
Swaption, including without limitation, the time or times and procedures for the exercise by the Swap
Counterparty of its option under the
Swaption, whether the obligations of
the City under the Swap Agreements
shall be secured by a Credit Support
Instrument, and the variable rate to
be paid by the Swap Counterparty
to the City under the Swap Agreements in the event of the exercise
of the option, which may be based
on a percentage of The Bond Market Association Swap Index or USDLIBOR-BBA or other index.
(c) Issuance of Refunding Bonds.
It is necessary, proper and in the
best interest of the City to, and the
City shall, in the event of the exercise by the Swap Counterparty of its
option under the Swaption, issue the
Refunding Bonds in the maximum
aggregate
principal
amount
of
$80,000,000 for the purpose of refinancing the Refunded 1996 Bonds.
The aggregate principal amount of
Refunding Bonds to be issued shall
be the amount determined in the
Certificate of Award by the Director
of Finance to be the aggregate principal amount of Refunding Bonds
that are required to be issued, taking into account any other funds
available to the City for the purpose, in order to refund the Refunded 1996 Bonds, to establish any
reserves required under the Indenture, to pay costs of any Credit Support Instruments, to pay expenses
relating to the refunding or the
issuance of the Refunding Bonds
and otherwise to effect the purpose
for which the Refunding Bonds are
to be issued.
(d) Pledged Revenues. Bond Service Charges on the Refunding
Bonds and Swap Interest Payments
shall be payable from the Parking
Revenues and may be payable also
from the Additional Pledged Revenues to the extent provided in the
Second Supplemental Indenture and
the Swap Agreements. Bond Service
Charges on the Refunding Bonds and
Swap Interest Payments may be
secured by a pledge of those Revenues and may be Parity Obligations
or Limited Parity Obligations as
defined in the Existing Indenture.
(e) Refunding of Refunded 1996
Bonds. It is necessary and in the

The City Record
best interest of the City to refund
the Refunded 1996 Bonds and to
redeem by optional redemption, on
the first redemption date following
the
issuance
of
the
Refunding
Bonds, those Refunded 1996 Bonds
maturing after that date. The Director of Finance is authorized to give
written notice to the Trustee of that
call for redemption, and the Refunded 1996 Bonds shall be redeemed in
accordance with the Existing Indenture and the Escrow Agreement.
(f) Swap Termination Payment.
Notwithstanding the limitation set
forth in subdivision (c) of this Section, the maximum aggregate principal amount of Refunding Bonds
may be increased to include the
amount of any Swap Termination
Payment and related incremental
costs of any reserves required under
the Indenture, any Credit Support
Instruments, and costs of issuance
in the event that that Director of
Finance determines it is to the
financial advantage of the City and
in the City’s best interests to terminate the Swap Agreements.
Section 3. Terms and Provisions of
the Refunding Bonds.
The Refunding Bonds shall be
issued only in registered form, substantially in the form set forth in
the Indenture. The Refunding Bonds
shall contain on the face thereof a
statement to the effect that the
Refunding Bonds, as to both principal and interest, are not a general
obligation of the City but are
payable solely from the revenues
pledged to their payment under the
Indenture.
The Refunding Bonds: shall be
dated the date of their initial delivery, or such other date as may be
established in the Certificate of
Award; shall bear interest from
their date or the most recent date to
which interest has been paid or duly
provided for, and that interest shall
be payable on the first Business
Day of each month or as otherwise
provided for in the Indenture; shall
mature on the dates and in the
respective principal amounts set
forth in the Certificate of Award
provided that the final maturity
shall be not later than 30 years from
date of their original delivery, as is
determined in the Certificate of
Award; shall be subject to mandatory and optional redemption on the
terms and conditions set forth in the
Certificate of Award and the Indenture; and shall be signed by the
Mayor and the Director of Finance,
provided that one or both of such
signatures may be a facsimile, and
shall bear the seal of the City or a
facsimile thereof. Pursuant to Section 83 of the City’s Charter, the
Director of Law shall prepare the
Refunding Bonds and shall endorse
thereon his approval of the form and
correctness by his manual or facsimile signature.
The Refunding Bonds may be
issued as obligations bearing interest at fixed or variable interest
rates. In the event that the Director
of Finance determines that the
City’s best interests will be served
by causing the Refunding Bonds to
be obligations bearing interest at
variable interest rates, then the
Director of Finance is authorized to
so specify in the Certificate of
Award. If the Director of Finance so
determines, then the method and pro-

2826

December 25, 2002
cedure by which the variable rate of
interest to be borne by the Refunding Bonds shall be determined as
provided in the Second Supplemental
Indenture, whether by auction, by
reference to a market index, by a
remarketing agent or otherwise; provided that no Refunding Bonds shall
bear interest at a rate in excess of
sixteen percent (16%) per year.
Notwithstanding
that
limitation,
Refunding Bonds held by a provider
of a Credit Support Instrument may
bear interest at a rate not in excess
of twenty-five percent (25%) per
year as provided in the agreement
with the provider of the Credit Support Instrument. The Director of
Finance may determine that the
terms of variable rate Refunding
Bonds may or may not permit the
Holders to tender their variable rate
Refunding Bonds for purchase by
the City. If the Director of Finance
designates the Refunding Bonds as
variable rate bonds, and if the Holders of the Refunding Bonds are to
be entitled to tender those Refunding Bonds for purchase, then the
Director of Finance shall also designate in the Certificate of Award
for those variable rate Refunding
Bonds, the tender agent or agents
and
the
remarketing
agent
or
agents, which designations shall be
based on the determination of the
Director of Finance that the parties
so designated possess the requisite
resources and experience to provide
the services required of them and
that the terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide
such services are fair and commercially reasonable.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into agreements in connection with the delivery of the
Refunding Bonds, and from time to
time thereafter so long as the Refunding Bonds are outstanding, with
providers of Credit Support Instruments, tender agents (which may be
the Trustee), remarketing agents
(which may be any of the Original
Purchasers) and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the method of determining the variable interest rates,
permitting holders the right of tender
and providing for payment of the purchase price of, or debt service on, the
variable rate Refunding Bonds. In the
event the Refunding Bonds are issued
as auction rate obligations, the Director of Finance is authorized to enter
into agreements with auction agents
and others, or to cause the Trustee to
enter into those agreements, based on
the determination by the Director of
Finance that the parties so designated possess the requisite resources and
experience to provide the services
required of them and that the terms
on which the designated parties have
agreed to provide such services are
fair and commercially reasonable.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of
the Refunding Bonds, and regardless
of whether the Refunding Bonds bear
interest at variable or fixed rates, is
authorized to contract for a Credit
Support Instrument, and to pay the
costs of it from proceeds of the
Refunding Bonds, if he determines
that the Credit Support Instrument
will result in a savings in the cost
of the financing to the City.
The Refunding Bonds shall be
issued originally to a Depository (as

December 25, 2002
defined in the Indenture) for use in
a book entry system and, if and as
long as a book entry system is utilized, (i) the Refunding Bonds shall
be issued in the form of a single registered Refunding Bond representing
each maturity and registered in the
name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository; (ii) the beneficial owners in
book entry form shall have no right
to receive Refunding Bonds in the
form of physical securities or certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its participants; and (iv) the
Bonds as such shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for
transfer to another Depository or to
another nominee of a Depository,
without further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Refunding Bonds for use in
a book entry system, the Director of
Finance and Trustee may attempt to
establish
a
securities
depository/book entry relationship
with another qualified Depository. If
the Director of Finance and Trustee
do not or are unable to do so, the
Director of Finance and Trustee,
after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the
then
Depository
and
any
other
arrangements
deemed
necessary,
shall permit withdrawal of the
Refunding Bonds from the Depository, and authenticate and deliver
registered Refunding Bond certificates to the assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost
and expense (including any costs of
printing), if the event is not the
result of City action or inaction, of
those
persons
requesting
such
issuance.
The
Mayor,
the
Director
of
Finance, the Director of Parks,
Recreation and Properties, or any
one of them, are authorized and
directed to the extent necessary or
required to enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with the book entry system
for the Refunding Bonds, after determining (as evidenced by their signing) that the signing thereof will
not endanger the funds or securities
of the City under the Indenture.
Section 4. Sale of the Refunding
Bonds. The Series 1996 Bonds are
awarded and sold to the Original
Purchaser in accordance with the
Purchase Agreement and at the Purchase Price, as shall be determined
in the Certificate of Award. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign the Certificate of Award selling the Refunding Bonds to the
Original Purchaser at the Purchase
Price established therein in accordance with this Ordinance, and to
evidence the further terms of that
sale by completing, signing and
delivering the Purchase Agreement,

not inconsistent with this Ordinance
and as may be approved by the
Director of Finance, all of which
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Purchase Agree-

The City Record
ment by the Director of Finance.
Having due regard to the best
interests of the City there shall be

Second Supplemental Indenture, consistent with the provisions of this
Ordinance, (a) the date of the
Refunding Bonds, (b) the final
aggregate principal amount of the
Refunding Bonds, (c) the principal
maturity
or
maturities
of
the
Refunding Bonds, the dates on
which principal shall be payable,
whether by mandatory sinking fund
redemption or at stated maturity,
(d) the dates and prices upon and
at which any Refunding Bonds shall
be subject to optional redemption,
(e) the interest rate or rates and, if
the Refunding Bonds bear interest
at variable rates, the method of
determining those variable rates,
and the dates on which interest is
to be paid, (f) the Purchase Price
of the Refunding Bonds, and (g)
any other matters as provided in
this Ordinance.
It is hereby determined by this
Council
that
the
terms
of
the
Refunding Bonds and the procedures for their sale and the determination of the price to be paid for
them, all as established in accordance with this Ordinance, the Purchase Agreement and the Indenture,

all actions necessary to effect due
signing, authentication and delivery
of the Refunding Bonds under the
terms of this Ordinance, the Purchase Agreement and the Indenture.
The
Mayor,
the
Director
of
Finance and other City officials as
deemed appropriate, each are authorized, on behalf of the City and in
their official capacities, to prepare

document relating to the issuance of
the Refunding Bonds. The distribution and use of that disclosure document by the Original Purchaser is
hereby authorized and approved.
The Director of Finance is authorized to contract for services for the
production and distribution of the
disclosure document, including by
printed and electronic means.
If and to the extent required by
SEC Rule 15c2-12, those officers and
each of them are authorized, on
behalf of the City and in their official capacities, to certify or otherwise represent, that the disclosure
document is a “deemed final” official statement (except for permitted
omissions) by the City as of its date
for purposes of that Rule or is a
final official statement for purposes
of that Rule. Those officers each are
further authorized to use and distribute, or authorize the use and distribution of, the disclosure document
and any supplements thereto in connection with the original issuance of
the Refunding Bonds as may, in
their judgment, be necessary or
appropriate. Those officers each are
further authorized to sign and deliver, on behalf of the City and in their
official capacities, the disclosure

connection with the accuracy of it
and any amendment thereto as may,

or appropriate.
If and to the extent required by
SEC Rule 15c2-12, for the benefit of
the holders and beneficial owners
from time to time of the Refunding
Bonds, the City may agree to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of SEC
Rule 15c2-12. In order to describe
and specify certain terms of the
City’s continuing disclosure agreement for that purpose, and thereby
to
implement
that
agreement,
including provisions for enforcement, amendment and termination,
the Mayor and the Director of
Finance are authorized to prepare,
or cause to be prepared, and to sign
and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of the City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate,
which shall constitute the continuing disclosure agreement made by
the City for the benefit of the holders and beneficial owners of the
Refunding
Bonds
in
accordance
with SEC Rule 15c2-12. The performance of that Agreement shall be
subject to the availability of funds
and their annual appropriation to
meet
costs
the
City
would
be
required to incur to perform it. The
Director of Finance is further authorized to establish procedures in
order to ensure compliance by the
City with its continuing disclosure
agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices.
If in the judgment of the Director
of Finance the filing of applications
for a rating on the Refunding Bonds
by one or more Rating Services is
necessary or desirable for marketing
purposes,
the
Director
of
Finance is authorized to prepare
and submit those applications, to
provide such information as may be
required in support of them and to
provide further for the payment of
the cost of such a rating from proceeds of the Refunding Bonds to the
extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose.

and shall be used for the purpose
for which those Bonds are issued as

Revenues and other money and
funds as described in the Indenture
shall be deposited in, and disbursed
from, those Funds, accounts therein
and Accounts as provided in the
Indenture.
Section 8. Covenants of the City.
The City, by issuance of the Refunding Bonds and any additional Bonds,
covenants and agrees with the holders of the Refunding Bonds to perform its covenants and agreements
set forth in the Indenture.
Section 9. Refunding of the Refunded 1996 Bonds. The Mayor, the
Director of Finance and the Director of Parks, Recreation and Properties or any two of them are authorized to sign and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of the City, the
Escrow Agreement, between the
City and the Escrow Trustee in a
form approved by the Director of
Law and by the officers signing the
Escrow Agreement, not inconsistent
with this Ordinance and not adverse
to the City which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the Escrow Agreement by those officers. The Director of Finance shall
provide for the payment of the services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant
to the Escrow Agreement from proceeds of the Refunding Bonds to the
extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose. Upon the issuance

The City Record

of
the
Refunding
Bonds, the Trustee and the City are
authorized to disburse from the
Funds established and maintained
under the Existing Indenture such
amounts of moneys as are in excess
of the balances required by the
Indenture to then be maintained in
those Funds.
Section 10. Tax Covenants of City.
The City covenants that it will
use, and will restrict the use and
investment of, the proceeds of the
Refunding Bonds in such manner
and to such extent as may be necessary so that (a) the Refunding
Bonds will not (i) constitute private
activity bonds, arbitrage bonds or
hedge bonds under Section 141, 148
or 149 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the Code), or
(ii) be treated other than as bonds
to which Section 103 of the Code
applies, and (b) the interest thereon will not be treated as an item of
tax preference under Section 57 of
the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required of
it for the interest on the Refunding
Bonds to be and to remain excluded
from
gross
income
for
federal
income tax purposes, (b) it will not
take or authorize to be taken any
actions that would adversely affect
that exclusion and (c) it, or persons
acting for it, will, among other acts
of compliance, (i) apply the proceeds
of the Refunding Bonds to the governmental purposes of the borrowing, (ii) restrict the yield on investment property, (iii) make timely and
adequate payments to the federal
government, (iv) maintain books
and records and make calculations
and reports and (v) refrain from certain uses of those proceeds and, as
applicable, of property financed with
such proceeds, all in such manner
and to the extent necessary to
assure such exclusion of that interest under the Code.
The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer of
the City having responsibility for
issuance of the Refunding Bonds is
hereby authorized (a) to make or
effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or
waiver on behalf of the City with
respect to the Refunding Bonds as
the City is permitted or required to
make or give under the federal
income tax laws, including, without
limitation thereto, any of the elections
provided
for
in
Section
148(f)(4)(C) of the Code or available under Section 148 of the Code,
for the purpose of assuring, enhancing or protecting favorable tax
treatment or status of the Refunding Bonds or interest thereon or
assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose, reducing the
burden or expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or
payments of penalties, or making
payments of special amounts in lieu
of making computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as
rebate, or obviating those amounts
or payments, as determined by that
officer, which action shall be in
writing and signed by the officer,
(b) to take any and all other
actions, make or obtain calculations,
make payments, and make or give
reports, covenants and certifications
of and on behalf of the City, as may
be appropriate to assure the exclu-

2828

December 25, 2002
sion of interest from gross income
and the intended tax status of the
Refunding Bonds, and (c) to give
one or more appropriate certificates
of the City, for inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Refunding Bonds, setting forth the reasonable expectations of the City regarding the amount and use of all the
proceeds of the Refunding Bonds,
the facts, circumstances and estimates on which they are based, and
other facts and circumstances relevant to the tax treatment of the
interest on and the tax status of the
Refunding Bonds.
Each covenant made in this Section with respect to the Refunding
Bonds is also made with respect to
all issues any portion of the debt
service on which is paid from proceeds of the Refunding Bonds (and,
if different, the original issue and
any refunding issues in a series of
refundings), to the extent such compliance is necessary to assure exclusion of interest on the Refunding
Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes, and the officers identified above are authorized
to take actions with respect to those
issues as they are authorized in this
Section to take with respect to the
Refunding Bonds.
Section 11. Indenture and Other
Documents. To secure the payment
of the Bond Service Charges on the
Refunding Bonds as the same shall
become due and payable and the
performance by the City of its obligations provided for in this Ordinance, the Mayor, the Director of
Finance and the Director of Parks,
Recreation and Properties, or any
two of them, are authorized and
directed, for and in the name of the
City and on its behalf, to sign and
deliver to the Trustee the Second
Supplemental Indenture, approved
as to form and correctness by the
Director of Law, with terms not
inconsistent with this Ordinance and
the Certificate of Award as may be
approved by the officers signing the
Supplemental Indenture on behalf of
the City, all of which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing
and delivery of that Supplemental
Indenture by those officers.
The
Mayor,
the
Director
of
Finance, the Director of Parks,
Recreation
and
Properties,
the
Director of Law, the Clerk of Council and such other officers of the
City as may be appropriate are
authorized to furnish, execute and
deliver such documents, certifications and instruments as may be
necessary or appropriate to issue
the Refunding Bonds and to consummate the transactions contemplated herein, and in the Swaption,
the Swap Agreements, the Indenture, the Escrow Agreement and the
Purchase Agreement. The Clerk of
Council or other appropriate official
of the City shall furnish the Original Purchasers a true transcript of
proceedings certified by the Clerk or
other official, of all proceedings had
with reference to the issuance of the
Refunding Bonds along with such
information for the records as is
necessary to determine the regularity and validity of the issuance of
the Refunding Bonds.
Section 12. Swaption and Swap
Agreements.
The
Director
of
Finance is authorized to sign the
Swaption and the Swap Agreements

December 25, 2002
in the forms now on file with the
Clerk of Council in the file referenced in Section 1 after approval
thereof as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law. The forms
of Swaption and Swap Agreements
are approved with such completions
and changes therein as are not
inconsistent with this Ordinance and
are not substantially adverse to the
City and as shall be approved by
Director of Finance. The approval of
those completions and changes, and
the determination that those completions
and
changes
are
not
adverse to the City, shall be conclusively evidenced by that signing.
The Director of Finance is authorized to contract for a Credit Support Instrument to secure or guarantee the payment by the City of
amounts owed by the City to the
Swap Counterparty under the Swap
Agreements. The cost of that Credit Support Instrument may be paid
by the Swap Counterparty or from
the
proceeds
of
the
Refunding
Bonds or other funds lawfully available for the purpose.
Section 13. Other Hedge Agreements. This Council finds that by
engaging in interest rate hedging
arrangements, from time to time, the
City can, in effect, convert interest
on all or a portion of the Bonds
under the Indenture from a fixed
rate to a floating rate, or from a
floating rate to a fixed rate, and
thereby may reduce its cost of borrowing by optimizing the relative
amounts of fixed and floating rate
obligations from time to time and
minimizing the risk of variations in
its debt service costs. To permit the
City to have the flexibility to undertake interest rate swap, swaption,
rate cap, rate collar and other hedging transactions from time to time,
in addition to the Swaption and the
Swap Agreements, and to establish
the procedures for approving those
transactions, this Council authorizes
the execution and delivery of one or
more hedge agreements (each, a
“Hedge Agreement”) and any related
agreements necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by each Hedge Agreement.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance that it is to the
financial advantage of the City and
in the City’s best interests that a
hedging arrangement be undertaken
by the City with respect to any
Bonds issued and Outstanding under
the Indenture, in addition to the
Swaption and the Swap Agreements,
the Director of Finance may authorize one or more interest rate hedge
transactions in accordance with the
applicable Hedge Agreement; provided that (a) the maximum aggregate notional amount of interest
rate swap or other hedging transactions outstanding at any one time,
net of offsetting interest rate swap
or other hedging transactions, shall
not exceed such amount as will
result in a lowering of the ratings
assigned to the Bonds by the rating
agencies, as is evidenced by written
correspondence
from
the
rating
agencies or policies published in
writing by the Rating Services, (b)
the counterparty shall be rated at
the time of signing the Hedge
Agreement not lower than A+ or A1
by at least one rating agency or its
obligations under the Hedge Agree-

The City Record
ment shall be guaranteed or insured
by an entity rated at the time of
signing the Hedge Agreement not
lower than A+ or A1 by at least one
Rating Service, and (c) the term of
each interest rate swap transaction
shall not exceed 30 years. The
approval of each interest rate hedge
transaction
by
the
Director
of
Finance shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery
of the applicable Hedge Agreement
by the Director of Finance.
Section 14. Security for Swap
Agreements and Other Hedge Agreements. The City’s obligations to
make Swap Interest Payments under
the Swap Agreements and similar
payments of interest or interest
equivalent under any Hedge Agreement shall be payable from the
Parking Revenues and may be
payable also from the Additional
Pledged Revenues. Those payments
may be secured by a pledge of those
Revenues on a parity with the
pledge of those Revenues to the payment of Bond Service Charges on
the Refunding Bonds, and may be
Limited Parity Obligations or Parity Obligations as defined in the
Existing Indenture, all as determined by the Director of Finance
and set forth in the Swaption, Swap
Agreements or other Hedge Agreements. Any Swap Termination Payment shall be payable from the
Parking Revenues and may be
payable also from the Additional
Pledged Revenues or any other
available moneys of the City permitted by law to be used for the purpose of making those payments as
approved by the Director of Finance
and set forth in the Swaption or
Swap Agreements or Hedge Agreements.
The obligation of the City to make
payments under the Swaption, the
Swap Agreements or any Hedge
Agreement does not and shall not
represent or constitute a general
obligation, debt, bonded indebtedness
or a pledge of the faith and credit
of the City, the State of Ohio or any
other political subdivision thereof.
Nothing herein gives the Swap Counterparty or any party to any Hedge
Agreement the right to have excises,
ad valorem or other taxes levied by
the City or the State of Ohio or by
the taxing authority of any other
political subdivision for the payment
of any amounts due under the Swaption, the Swap Agreements or any
Hedge Agreement.
Section 15. Financial Advisors.
The Director of Finance may obtain
the services of one or more Financial Advisors, from time to time, to
assist him in making any of the
determinations
required
by
this
Ordinance to be determined by the
Director of Finance or to value the
Swap Agreements or other Hedge
Agreements.
The
Director
of
Finance may rely on the written
advice of any Financial Advisor so
retained. Any Financial Advisor
employed under the authority of this
ordinance shall be disinterested in
the Swaption transaction and be
independent of the counterparty and
any other party interested in the
Swaption transaction.
Section 16. Severability. Each section of this ordinance and each sub-

2829

51
division or paragraph of any section
is declared to be independent and
the finding or holding of any section or any subdivision or paragraph
of any section to be invalid or void
shall not be deemed or held to affect
the validity of any other section,
subdivision or paragraph of this
ordinance.
Section 17. Validity. This Council
determines that all acts and conditions necessary to be done or performed by the City or to have been
met precedent to and in the issuing
of the Refunding Bonds and the
signing and delivery of the Swaption and the Swap Agreements in
order to make them legal, valid and
binding special obligations of the
City have been performed and have
been met, or will at the time of
delivery of the Refunding Bonds or
the Swaption and the Swap Documents, as the case may be, have
been performed and have been met,
in regular and due form as required
by law; and that no statutory or constitutional limitation of indebtedness or taxation will have been
exceeded in the issuance of the
Refunding Bonds and the signing
and delivery of the Swaption and
the Swap Agreements. It is further
found and determined, and is hereby represented and recited, that the
provisions of Sections 28, 29, 32, 33
(including the provisions of Section
33 with respect to readings on three
separate days or dispensing with
such readings by a two-thirds vote
of all members of the Council), 36,
37, 48 and all other applicable provisions of the City’s Charter and the
rules of this Council have been fully
complied with and this ordinance
was passed in conformity therewith.
Section 18. Compliance with Open
Meeting Law. This Council finds
and determines that all formal
actions of this Council concerning
and relating to the passage of this
ordinance were taken in an open
meeting of this Council and that all
deliberations of this Council and of
any committees that resulted in
those formal actions were in meetings open to the public in compliance with the law.
Section 19. Effective Date. This
ordinance constitutes an emergency
measure providing for the usual
operation of a municipal department
and providing for the immediate
preservation of the public peace,
property, health or safety in that the
delivery of the Swaption and Swap
Agreements and the issuance of the
Refunding Bonds authorized by this
ordinance is needed to enable the
City to take advantage of current
favorable market conditions to refinance the Refunded 1996 Bonds
(taking into account the upfront
payment under the Swaption) and
thereby reduce the financing costs
of the 1992 Project and, provided
this ordinance receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all members elected to Council, it shall take
effect and be in force immediately
upon its passage and approval by
the Mayor; otherwise, it shall take
effect and be in force from and after
the earliest date allowed by law.
Passed December 16, 2002.
Effective December 20, 2002.
