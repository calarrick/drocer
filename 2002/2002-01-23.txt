Res. No. 91-02.
By
Councilmen
Lewis,
Coats,
Jones, Reed, Scott, White and Zone.
An emergency resolution opposing
House Bill 386 which provides that
the state shall be the sole regulator
of loans and other forms of credit
and preempt any regulation by a
municipality that directly or indirectly regulates the granting, collection or servicing of loans or other
forms of credit.
Whereas, pending House Bill 386
provides that the state shall be the
sole regulator of loans and other
forms of credit; and
Whereas, pending House Bill 386
further provides that any ordinance,
resolution,
regulation
or
other
action by a municipal corporation to
regulate the origination, granting,
servicing or collection of loans or
other forms of credit is in conflict
with the Revised Code and with the
uniform operation throughout the
state of lending and other credit
provisions and is preempted; and
Whereas, said House Bill 386
would
effectively
take
away
a
municipality’s right to Home Rule
governance; and
Whereas, said House Bill 386
would preempt the City of Cleveland’s pending anti predatory lending ordinance; and
Whereas, pending House Bill 386
would limit a municipality’s ability
to protect its citizens from predatory lenders and diminishes local
authority over unscrupulous business practices; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council vehemently
opposes
House
Bill
386
which provides that the state shall
be the sole regulator of loans and
other forms of credit and which preemts any regulation by a municipality that directly or indirectly regulates the granting, collection or
servicing of loans or other forms of
credit.
