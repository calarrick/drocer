An emergency resolution urging
the Cleveland Board of Education
and the Board of the Cleveland
Regional
Transit
Authority
to
enforce their policies relative to the
prohibition of mobile phone use by
their drivers while operating buses
Whereas, hundreds of children in
this City are transported to and
from school every day of the school
year by school bus and by buses
operated by the Cleveland Regional
Transit Authority; and
Whereas, the safety of those children while riding those buses is of
the utmost importance and should
be paramount to those who drive
those children to and from school;
and
Whereas, this Council believes
that the operation of a school bus

using a telephone may cause the
operator to maintain less than full
time and attention to the operation

vehicle; and
Whereas,
both

An emergency resolution calling
upon the President of the United
States and the appropriate members
of the United States government to
normalize U.S. relations with Cuba,
including those related to trade,
travel, culture, sports and academic
exchange.
Whereas, the 40 year old embargo
of Cuba is a relic of a bygone era
and an obstacle to peaceful international cooperation; and
Whereas, the policy of denying
Americans the right to freely travel
to Cuba has been an embarrassment

June 12, 2002
and an affront to the democratic
principles of our country; and
Whereas, former President Jimmy
Carter and Mayor Jane Campbell in
their recent visits to Cuba have
called for an end to the embargo
and the restrictions on travel; and
Whereas, polls show that the overwhelming majority of Americans
support a fundamental change in
these policies, as do the major religious denominations and unions, the
United States Chamber of Commerce, the American Farm Bureau,
the Council on Foreign Relations,
the State of Illinois and the State of
Texas, and the City of Pittsburgh,
as well as the majority of the members of both Houses of Congress;
and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
has recently received an invitation
from the City Council of Havana to
send a delegation to Cuba; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby calls upon the President of the
United States and the appropriate
members of the United States government to normalize U.S. relations
with Cuba, including those related
to trade, travel, culture, sports and
academic exchange.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit

of the United States George W.
Bush, Secretary of State Colin Powell, Senator George Voinovich, Senator Mike DeWine, Congresswoman
Stephanie Tubbs Jones and Congressman Dennis Kucinich.
Section 3. That this resolution is

best father that one can be.
Whereas, Sunday, June 16, 2002 is
Father’s Day, and all over the United States of America fathers are
honored on that day; and
Whereas, along with accepting
the honors duly given each father
on Father’s Day, all fathers in
America should take a pledge to be
the best type of father that one can

The City Record
be, and to meet all of the responsibilities of being a father; and
Whereas, this Council wants to
both honor all fathers and to urge
fathers to take a pledge to do what
is right and best for their families;
now therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council honors all fathers on June 16, 2002 and
all year long.
Section 2. That this Council urges
all fathers in America to take the
following pledge:
1. I will work to be the best father
I can be. Fathering is a daily mission, and there are no substitutes
for good fathers. Since I have not
been taught to be a father, in order
to make my “on the job” training
easier, I will study, listen, observe
and learn from my mistakes.
2. I will openly display love and
caring for my wife and children. I
will listen to my wife and children.
I will hug and kiss my children
often. I will be supportive of the
mother of my children and send
quality time with my children.
3. I will teach by example. I will
try to introduce myself and my family to something new and developmental each week. I will help my
children with their homework and
encourage them to be involved in
extracurricular activities.
4. I will read to or with my children as often as possible. I will provide opportunities for my children to
develop creatively in the arts: music,
dance, drama, literature, and visual
arts. I will challenge my children to
do their best.
5. I will encourage and organize
frequent family activities for the
home and away from home. I will
try to make life a positive adventure and make my children aware of
their extended family.
6. I will never be intoxicated or
“high” in the presence of my children, nor will I use language unbecoming for an intelligent and serious father.
7. I will be nonviolent in my relationship with my wife and children.
As a father, my role will be to stimulate and encourage my children
rather than carry the “big stick.”
8. I will maintain a home that is
culturally in tune with the best of
my ancestral culture. This will be
done, in part, be developing a
library, record/disc, video and visual art collection that reflects the
developmental aspects of my ancestors. There will be order and predictability in our home.
9. I will teach my children to be
responsible, disciplined, fair and
honest. I will teach them the value
of hard work and fruitful production. I will teach them the importance of family, community, politics,
and economics.
10. As a father, I will attempt to
provide my family with an atmosphere of love and security to aid
them in their development into sane,
loving, productive, spiritual, hardworking, creative Americans who
realize they have a responsibility to
do well and help the less fortunate
of this world. I will teach my children to be activists and to think for
themselves.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,

These motions shall have precedence in the order indicated. The

for the previous question, shall be
put to a vote without debate; the
motion to fix the hour of adjournment shall be debatable only as to
the time of such adjournment; and
all other motions shall be debatable.
Rule 33. The Previous Question.
The motion for the previous question shall require a majority vote of
all members elected to Council; shall
be considered only once; may be
renewed after intervening business;
shall take precedence over all debatable questions and shall be in order
to prevent amendment of undebatable questions. When the previous
question is moved and seconded by
one other member, it shall be put as
follows: “Shall the main question be
now put?” There shall be no further
amendment or debate but pending
amendments shall be put in their
order before the main question. If
the question, “Shall the main question be now put?” be decided in the
negative, the main question remains
before the Council.
Rule 34. Motion to Lay on the
Table. The motion to lay on the
table shall dispose finally of the legislation against which it is invoked
but a motion to lay a pending
amendment to an ordinance or resolution on the table shall not carry
the ordinance or resolution with it.
A motion to lay on the table shall
require a majority vote of all members elected to Council.
Rule 35. Motion to Postpone to a
Day Certain. A motion to postpone to
a day certain shall require a majority vote of the members present;
shall be subject to reconsideration;
may be renewed after intervening
business; shall be debatable as to the
propriety of the postponement but
not upon the merits of the legislation; and may be amended by changing the date. Upon the arrival of the
date to which postponed the legislation shall be considered in the regular order of business of that day.

V. MOTIONS
Rule 31. Purpose and Form. Motions shall be used only to expedite
the orderly transaction at the business of Council and shall not be
substituted for resolutions or ordinances. The form of all motions
shall be “I move that” followed by
the substance of the motion. No sec-

Rule 36. Motion to Postpone Indefinitely. The motion to postpone
indefinitely shall have the same
effect as motion to lay on the table,
and shall require a majority vote of
all members elected to Council.

not be reconsidered; shall be debatable and shall open the legislation

1294

June 12, 2002
to debate; may be renewed after
intervening business and may not
be amended or laid on the table, and
shall be subject to previous question.
Rule 37. Reconsideration. After
the decision of any question, any
member who voted with the majority may move a reconsideration of
any action at the same or the next
succeeding meeting, provided, however, that a resolution authorizing
or relating to any contract may be
reconsidered at any time before the
final execution thereof. A motion to
reconsider shall require a majority
vote of all the members elected to
Council. After a motion for reconsideration has once been acted upon,
no other motion for a reconsideration thereof shall be made without
unanimous consent of the members
present.
VI. ORDINANCES AND
RESOLUTIONS
Note: “The adoption of a resolution is the proper procedure for an
informal enactment providing for
the disposition of a particular item
of business, while the passage of an
ordinance is the proper procedure
for the enactment of a regulation of
a general or permanent nature.” (19
R.C. L. 895; 46 C.J. 519; 29 O.A. 386).
Rule 38. Introduction. Ordinances

ward shall be introduced in Council
in the name of the member of Council from such ward except with that
member’s written permission prior
to such introduction, and when the
member’s name shall be followed by
the
words
“By
departmental
request”, which shall be deemed not
to imply agreement with the purpose of such legislation by reason
of such sponsorship. Ordinances submitted by the initiative shall have
endorsed thereon “Submitted by Initiative Petition”.

may be given to the preparation of
legislation,

suspension of the rules unless furnished sufficient copies of such legislation to provide each member of
Council therewith, together with a
like number of copies of a statement
by the Director of the requesting
department setting forth the reasons
requiring
the
immediate
action
thereon. A request for legislation for
passage on introduction under suspension of the rules at the last meeting prior to the Summer recess of
Council or at the final annual meeting of Council shall not be accepted
by the Clerk of Council unless the
required
statement
bears
the
approval of the President of Council. To the extent that circumstances
permit all such legislation shall be
considered informally by at least
one committee of Council, to which
such legislation would otherwise be
referred.
Rule 39. Form of Ordinances. The
enacting clause of all ordinances
shall be “Be it ordained by the

of Cleveland.” All ordinances before

form, with two additional copies, on
the forms to be provided by the City
Clerk. No ordinance or resolution or
section thereof shall be revised or
amended unless the new ordinance
or resolution contains the entire
ordinance or resolution, or section
revised or amended, and the original ordinance, resolution, section, or
sections so amended shall be repealed.
Rule 40. Emergency Ordinances. If
any emergency ordinance or resolution fails to receive a two-thirds
affirmative vote of all members
elected to Council, such measure
shall cease to be before the Council
as an emergency measure and shall
have the standing that a measure
would have had if it had not been
read as an emergency measure.
Rule 41. Reference to Committee.
All ordinances and resolutions shall
be read by title on the day when
introduced, unless such reading is
dispensed with by a two-thirds vote;
and unless otherwise ordered by the
Council shall be referred by the presiding officer to the appropriate
committee or committees, which reference shall be announced forthwith
by the Clerk. The committee or committees to which the legislation is
so referred shall, after due consideration and at least one public hearing, propose any amendments with
recommendations for approval or
disapproval. When so reported, such
ordinance or resolution shall, unless
otherwise ordered, be read a second
time and laid over until the next
meeting of the Council, when the
same shall be read a third time and
a vote taken thereon. The Council
shall act upon no ordinance or resolution except a resolution of condolence or one of an extreme emergency nature, until it has been
referred to and reported upon by a
committee or committees of Council.
Rule 41-1. Re-reference to Committee.
Any
pending
legislation
may, by a vote of a majority of the
members elected to Council or by
declaration of the Council President
without objection, be referred to any

The City Record

31

committee
to
which
previously
referred under these rules, or to any
appropriate committee designated in
the
motion
to
re-refer.
When
referred back to the Council, such
legislation shall have the same
standing as it had at the time when
re-referred.

ties which has not been referred to
a committee of Council, shall be
passed under suspension of the rules
unless a copy of such ordinance
shall have been placed on the desk
of each member prior to the passage
of such ordinance under suspension
of Rule 43.

Rule 42. Reference to More Than
One Committee. Whenever any pending matter is referred to more than
one committee for consideration and
report, said committee may consider
the same in joint session as a joint
committee, if the chairs of the committees concerned consent thereto.
The chair of the committee first
named shall preside at such joint
sessions, and each member of the
joint committee shall have one vote
for each committee of which he/she
is a member composing the joint
committee. A majority of the members of each of the separate committees shall constitute a quorum of
such committee and the vote shall
be taken by roll call of each of the
separate
committees
constituting
the joint committee. Its report shall
be made in the same manner and
under the same rules as reports are
made by standing committees.

Rule 44. Appropriation Ordinances.
Ordinances making appropriations
shall be confined to the subject of
appropriation. No money shall be
appropriated except by ordinance.
All ordinances for fixing a tax rate,
the appropriation of money, the
issuance of bonds, the transfer of
money to any fund, or the payment
of claims; and all resolutions and
ordinances whereby the city shall
become liable for the payment of
any money, shall be referred without debate to the finance committee
for consideration and report; unless
this requirement shall be suspended
by two-thirds of all the members
elected. The vote of each suspension
shall be taken by yeas and nays and
entered on the record.

Rule 42-1. Relieving Committees.
Any committee to which an ordinance
or
resolution
has
been
referred under Rule 41 or re-referred
under Rule 41-1, may be relieved of
further consideration of such legislation by a motion duly made and
adopted by a two-thirds vote of all
members elected to Council or by
the chair of the committee to which
the legislation has been referred
with the consent of the Council
President.
Rule 43. Three Readings. No ordinance or resolution shall be passed
until it has been read on three separate days; unless the reading on
three separate days has been dispensed with by a two-thirds vote of
all members elected to Council. The
final reading shall be in full unless
a written or printed copy of the
measure shall have been furnished
to each member of the Council prior
to such reading. Copies of all first
reading ordinances and resolutions
to be introduced for passage and
adoption under suspension of the
rules and without reading on three
separate days shall be placed on the
members’ desks within the Council
Chambers prior to a vote being
taken on the ordinance or resolution. When it is desired to suspend
this and rule 41 in order to permit
the passage of legislation upon
introduction the question on the
motion for such suspension shall be
as follows: “Shall the Charter and
statutory provisions and rule 43
requiring reading on three separate
days and rule 41 requiring reference
to committees be dispensed with and
Ordinance No. ... (Resolution No. ...)
be placed on final passage?” If twothirds of all the members elected to
Council vote aye, the Charter, statutory and rule requirements requiring reading on three separate days
and reference to committees shall be
suspended. As an exception to the
foregoing, resolutions of condolence
and congratulatory resolutions shall
be read by title only and adopted
viva voce or by rising vote.
Rule 43-1. Copies Required for Suspension of Rule 43. No ordinance of
a general nature or imposing penal-

Rule 45. Substitute Legislation.
Legislation dealing with the same
subject matter may be substituted
for any pending ordinance or resolution by a majority vote of all the
members elected to Council, upon
the recommendation of any committee to which such legislation has
been referred. Substitute legislation
shall be subject to all the provisions
of the Charter and rules applying to
ordinances on first reading, and the
legislation for which such substitute
is offered shall be laid upon the
table as a final disposition thereof.
Before accepting for introduction
any
substitute
legislation,
the
author of the original legislation
shall be given notice thereof by the
Clerk of Council.
Rule 46. Ordinances Fixing Fines
and Penalties. All ordinances imposing fines, penalties, forfeiture or
imprisonment shall be referred to
the Committee on Legislation, and
the Director of Law shall be asked
to give an opinion thereon.
Rule 47. Amendments. It shall be
in order to amend an ordinance at
any time when not in the hands of
a committee; but if amended after
its second reading, it shall again be
read as the second reading thereof,
and laid over for further and final
action. A majority vote of all the
members elected to Council shall be
necessary for the adoption of an
amendment to any legislation pending before the Council.
Rule 48. Adoption. All ordinances
and resolutions shall require for
passage or adoption a majority vote
of all the members elected. The vote
on their adoption shall be taken by
yeas and nays and entered on the
records of the meeting except as
otherwise provided in these rules.
Rule 49. Signing Ordinances and
Resolutions. All ordinances passed
and resolutions adopted by Council
shall be signed by the President and

the Clerk.

ordinance or resolution or part

The City Record

or resolution to the Council with
objections, pursuant to Section 37 of
the Charter, the Council shall after
the expiration of not less than one
week following the meeting at
which such vetoed ordinance or resolution is returned, proceed to reconsider the same. After the adoption
of the motion so to reconsider, the
question shall be stated as follows:
“Shall Ordinance No. (Resolution
No.) be passed (or adopted) notwithstanding the veto of the Mayor?
Those voting aye vote to override
the Mayor’s veto. Those voting nay
vote to sustain the Mayor’s veto.” If
two-thirds of all the members elected to Council vote aye, such ordinance or resolution vetoed by the
Mayor shall take effect without the
Mayor’s signature.

An emergency resolution calling
for a moratorium on the imposition
of the death penalty in the State of
Ohio until a fair and impartial
review of the application of the
death penalty is conducted.
Whereas, the death penalty is an
irreversible act of punishment carried out by the State; and
Whereas, the American Bar Association and an array of other organizations and institutions reviewed
the death penalty and called for a
moratorium on its enforcement;
and
Whereas, United States Supreme
Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor
joined with numerous prominent
judicial authorities in noting that
serious questions “are being raised
about the death penalty in view of
the fact that 90 death row inmates
have been exonerated since 1973”
and the “system may well be allowing some innocent defendants to be
executed”; and
Whereas, the NAACP and other
civil rights organizations throughout the State of Ohio have called
for a moratorium on the death
penalty until a fair system is in
place; and
Whereas,
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment without parole is now
available to courts and juries in the
State of Ohio as an alternative to
the imposition of the death penalty;
and
Whereas,
Ohio
Supreme
Court
Justice Paul Pfeifer, a sponsor of
the 1981 State of Ohio death penalty law, now states that he is personally “moving closer to opposing
the death penalty and that an independent panel should review the
cases
of
the
203
death
row
inmates”; and
Whereas, the advent of DNA testing has already caused an increase
in exoneration of condemned persons and those convicted of murder;
and
Whereas, all major religious bodies declared that the capital punishment system needs review and
the United States Catholic Bishops
expressed
a
“concern
about
inequitable use and an imperfect legal
system that has condemned innocent
people”; and

Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the

now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of

Section 1. That this Council hereby calls upon the General Assembly
of the State of Ohio to enact legislation which results in a moratorium on executions and signing of
death penalty warrants in the State
of Ohio, with such moratorium lasting until the General Assembly

Res. No. 1160-02.
By Council Member Coats.
An emergency resolution supporting the National League of Cities
and the Alliance of Local Organizations Against Preemption (ALOAP)
in their opposition to the FCC’s ruling on cable modem services, and
urging that the Director of Law join
these parties in opposing the FCC’s
ruling, which would have the effect
of denying the City franchise fees
from the revenues received by Adelphia for its cable modem service in
the City.
Whereas, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a
Declaratory Ruling on March 15,
2002 (GN Docket No. 00-185, and CS
Docket No. 02-52), in which the FCC
reclassified cable modem service as
an information service, such that
cities would no longer be able to
require cable companies to pay franchise fees on the revenues such companies receive from the provision of
cable modem services; and
Whereas,
Adelphia
Cleveland’s
franchise with the City of Cleveland
for the provision of cable television
and related services over its cable
system in the City requires Adelphia
to offer cable modem service for
high speed access to the Internet to
its subscribers in all parts of the
City by April 2003, and to pay franchise fees on the revenues Adelphia
receives from the sale of such services; and
Whereas, Adelphia Cleveland has
declared its refusal to pay any franchise fees on cable modem revenues;
and
Whereas, the National League of
Cities,
the
U.S.
Conference
of
Mayors, the National Association of
Telecommunications Officers and Advisors (NATOA), the International
Municipal Lawyers Association and
other organizations have formed the
Alliance
of
Local
Organizations
Against Preemption (ALOAP) to
fight against the FCC’s ruling on
cable
modem
services,
and
the
Alliance filed a petition recently at
the U.S. District Court of Appeals in
Washington, D.C., asking for a
review of the FCC ruling; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has the obligation and desire to protect consumers in the City in the
provision of all services offered by
the City’s franchisee Adelphia Cleveland in the City through its use of
the public right-of-way, and its franchise requires Adelphia to pay fees
on revenues from all services, including cable modem services; now
therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council expresses it full support of the Alliance of Local Organizations Against
Preemption (ALOAP) and urges the
City’s Director of Law to join in the
effort of ALOAP in opposing the
FCC’s ruling.
Section 2. That upon its passage
by City Council the Clerk of Council shall provide copies of this Resolution to the following: Mayor Campbell, the Director of Law, the FCC,
and Adelphia Cleveland.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

An emergency resolution opposing Adelphia Cleveland’s refusal to
pay
franchise fees on revenues it
derives from offering cable modem
service in the City, and urging the
Director of Law to take all actions
necessary to enforce the provisions
of the City’s franchise with Adelphia that require it to pay franchise
fees on revenues from cable modem
service.
Whereas,
Adelphia
Cleveland’s
cable franchise with the City of
Cleveland requires Adelphia to offer
cable modem service for high speed
access to the Internet to subscribers
in all parts of the City by April 2003,
and to pay franchise fees on revenues from such services to the City;
and
Whereas, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a
Ruling on March 15, 2002 declaring
that cable modem service is an
interstate information service and
not a cable service, and seeking
comments on the issue of whether
the FCC should preclude state and
local governments from regulating
cable
modem
service,
including
access and franchise requirements
and the payment of franchise fees
on revenues from cable modem service, and
Whereas, Adelphia sent a letter to
City Council on April 22, 2002 declaring its intention to immediately and
unilaterally cease collection and
payment of franchise fees on cable
modem services currently offered
and hereafter offered in the City;
and
Whereas, the action of the FCC on
March 15, 2002 included a Notice of
Proposed Rulemaking, in which the
FCC is seeking comments on its
declared policy, which means that
the FCC’s Ruling is not final and is
subject to modification or reversal,
making Adelphia’s precipitous action premature; and
Whereas,
Adelphia’s
Franchise
requires Adelphia to pay fees on
revenues from all services, including cable modem services, and the
definition of gross revenue in Adelphia’s Franchise, on which Adelphia
has agreed to pay 5% in franchise
fees, includes consideration in any
form from the operation by Adelphia
of its System, and the offering of
any services over its System, such
that even if the FCC ultimately does
affirm its currently declared position that cable modem service is not
a cable service, Adelphia has a contractual obligation through at least
September 15, 2006, to pay franchise
fees on cable modem service; and
Whereas, any withholding of franchise fees on cable modem service
must be considered a violation of
the franchise terms; and
Whereas, Council has asked Adelphia to reverse its policy, but Adelphia has refused; now therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
strongly objects to Adelphia’s uni-

1306

June 12, 2002
lateral and precipitous action declaring its refusal to pay franchise fees
on revenues from cable modem services it is beginning to offer to consumers in the City.
Section 2. That this Council urges
the Law Director of the City to take
all action necessary to enforce the
City’s
franchise
with
Adelphia
Cleveland, and to require Adelphia
to meet its obligation to pay franchise fees on revenues from cable
modem services, regardless of the
FCC’s ultimate decision.
Section 3. That upon its passage
by City Council the Clerk of Council shall provide copies of this Resolution to the following: Mayor Campbell, the Director of Law, and Adelphia Cleveland.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

By Council Member Jones.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Senate to table H.B. 274,
which will allow citizens the right
to carry concealed firearms, and
H.B. 303 that would strike down all
local ordinances that restrict guns,
until a thorough study has been
done to determine if citizens and
neighborhood communities will become safer if such a law is enacted.
Whereas, H.B. 274 would allow
Ohio residents to legally carry a
concealed firearm, upon meeting
specific requirements and passing a
criminal background check as required by the State of Ohio; and
Whereas, H.B. 303 is a preemption
bill that would strike down all
local city ordinances that restrict
firearms,
including
local
laws
against
semiautomatic
assault
weapons; and
Whereas, such laws allowing the
right to carry concealed firearms
would force the police and other law
enforcement authorities to allow
thousands of people to carry hidden
handguns on the street and into public places, thus putting police officers and the public at potential risk;
and
Whereas, the right to carry concealed firearms is part of an emerging trend throughout the country as
more states are passing legislation
allowing citizens to legally carry
such firearms; and
Whereas, thirty-three states have
already enacted such laws allowing
citizens the right to carry concealed
firearms; and
Whereas, there are concerns that
the right to carry concealed firearms may threaten the safety of citizens as well as neighborhood communities; and
Whereas, there are concerns about
the effectiveness of monitoring and
enforcement of this law in order to
ensure citizen safety by law enforcement authorities should it be approved by the state; and

June 12, 2002
Whereas, there is a need to do further research to determine if such
laws allowing citizens to carry concealed firearms do not threaten the
safety of the general public, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
strongly urges the Ohio Senate to
table H.B. 274 and H.B. 304, until
empirical research has been done to
determine if such laws allowing citizens to carry concealed firearms
does not create a threat to the safety of the general public.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
the leaders of the Ohio Senate.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

Ord. No. 536-01.
By Council Member Brady.
An emergency ordinance to enact
new
Sections
603A.01
through
603A.18 and Section 603A.99 of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, to define “exotic animal,”
to prohibit the keeping of an exotic
animal unless its owner obtains a
personal possession permit, to promote the safe handling of exotic animals, and to enact regulations and
prohibitions pertaining to exotic
animals.
Whereas, exotic animals are by
their very nature wild and potentially dangerous; and
Whereas, for the reasons set forth
in Section 603A.01 hereof, there are
rational and compelling governmental purposes in regulating exotic animals; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
hereby supplemented by enacting
new
Sections
603A.01
through
603A.18 and 603A.99 thereof to read,
respectively, as follows:
Chapter 603A
EXOTIC ANIMALS
Section 603A.01 Findings
It is hereby found that the animals listed in Section 603A.02, “Exotic Animal Defined”, are by their
very nature wild and potentially
dangerous. Exotic animals do not
thrive in the care of untrained individuals or in substandard captive
environments. Exotic animals are
generally unsuitable as household
pets.
Exotic
animals
are
often
acquired without the owner being
fully cognizant of the animal’s

potential for dangerousness, or of
its proper and humane care. It is
further found that exotic animals
have sometimes escaped in residential neighborhoods and constituted a
threat to the safety, health and welfare of the general public. In consideration of the interests of exotic
animal owners, the community at
large, and the animals themselves,
it is hereby found that exotic animals, where permitted, should be
regulated. In view of these interests,
it is further found that persons that
currently own exotic animals should
be permitted to obtain personal possession permits for the animals if
they are in compliance with the
requirements of this chapter, but
that no exotic animals other than
those already lawfully kept in the
City should be permitted.
Documents that this Council considered in the adoption of this legislation are contained in File No.
536-01-A are hereby made a part of
the legislative record of this ordinance.

Ord. No. 901-02.
By Councilmen Westbrook and Jackson (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Port Control to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with Continental Airlines, Inc. for the creation of the Director’s Advisory Council at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport; and to amend Section 37 of Ordinance No. 469-02, passed April 1, 2002, regarding compensation
for various classifications.
Whereas, the City has undertaken the major public improvement of the expansion of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport; and
Whereas, Continental Airlines, Inc. (“Continental”) has participated in the management of similar expansion
projects at various other airports across the country; and
Whereas, Continental Airlines, Inc. has a unique and critical interest in the success of the expansion program;
and
Whereas, Continental has offered to make its experience and expertise in similar airport projects available to
the City through participation in the management of the expansion program projects at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport; and
Whereas, the City has determined that Continental’s participation in the management of the airport expansion
under the direction of the Director of Port Control will be beneficial to the success of such program; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of Port Control is hereby authorized to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with Continental Airlines, Inc. regarding the creation of the Director’s Advisory Council at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport in substantially the following form:
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN
CONTINENTAL AIRLINES, INC. AND THE CITY OF CLEVELAND
IN REGARDS TO CREATION OF
THE DIRECTOR’S ADVISORY COUNCIL
AT CLEVELAND HOPKINS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
This Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) outlines the agreement between the City of Cleveland (“City”)
and Continental Airlines, Inc. (“CAL”) regarding creation of a Director’s Advisory Council (“DAC”) at Cleveland
Hopkins International Airport (“Airport”).
The Airport is owned and operated by the City through the Department of Port Control (“DPC”), a department
of the City. CAL operates a system hub at the Airport and maintains rights to operate at the Airport under various agreements. In order to promote the timely delivery of several critical expansion projects at the Airport,
City and CAL desire to jointly establish a DAC that will participate in managing on behalf of the City the current Airport Expansion Program, the construction of which commenced in 2001.
A. PURPOSE
The DAC is to be created for the sole purpose of participating in the management of all aspects of the Airport Expansion Program projects, including the New Runway (Phase 1 and Phase 2) and the Critical Non-Runway projects that are described in the 2000 CIP and MII project definitions and listed on Exhibit A hereto (“Program”). The DAC will not have contracting authority, but will advise the City on appropriate courses of action
in regard to contracting as well as managing the Program. The City, through DPC, will retain final decisionmaking authority and will retain signature authority, including but not limited to authority to enter into or modify contracts related to the Program. The DAC will report to and take direction from the Deputy Director of Port
Control (“Deputy Director”). Nothing in this Agreement is intended to limit the Deputy Director from communicating directly with, and providing direction to, the DAC and the Program’s consultants and contractors.
The DAC will undertake to act as the liaison between all consultants, contractors, and vendors performing services related to the Program and the City as it relates to the day to day management of the Program from the
owner’s perspective. The City has previously retained a Program Management Team (“PMT”) to provide additional required staffing and expertise on this large construction program. The activities of the PMT will be coordinated by, and the PMT construction and project managers and all other PMT support staff will report to, the
DAC Project Director who has been given responsibility for the particular project or contract in issue. The PMT
Program Manager will report to the Deputy Director through the City’s Administrator of Engineering and Planning (“AEP”) with a copy of any such report being delivered concurrently to the appropriate DAC Project Director to the extent the subject matter involves a contract or project within the purview of such Project Director,
or issues related to the scope or value of the PMT contract.
It is the intent of the parties to this MOU that the organizational structure of the PMT will be reviewed and
realigned as necessary to maximize efficiencies in light of the DAC. The Deputy Director will advise all consultants, contractors, and vendors (including, without limitation, the PMT) that the Project Directors and other
Members of the DAC are acting as his/her designee in regard to the day-to-day management of their respective
services and/or contracts and that such consultants, contractors, and vendors performing services related to the
Program are to report to the DAC Project Director who has been given responsibility for a particular project or
contract for purposes of direction, project management decisions, progress reporting, and all other issues related
to completion of their respective contracts/services. (Nothing in the foregoing sentence is intended to modify the
scope of the PMT’s responsibilities or to change the reporting relationship between the PMT and other contractors or vendors.) Each member of the DAC will have specific areas of responsibility as defined in Exhibit B
and as modified from time to time by the Deputy Director.

1326

B. Scope
The DAC will be comprised of a maximum of six individuals, three of which will be selected by the City and
appointed by the Director of Port Control (and may be either City employees or independent contractors), and
three of which will be employees of CAL. Members of the DAC will, in general, be dedicated full-time to management of the Program. Inasmuch as the individuals will have no other responsibilities beyond the Program,
the members provided by the City will not be permanent positions at the Airport; provided that nothing herein
shall be deemed to prevent the City from hiring such persons for other positions at the Airport upon completion
of their services on the DAC. Each DAC member’s position is intended to be in place for the duration of the Program if necessary, after which the DAC will be dissolved. The contemplated organizational structure of the DAC
is as set forth in Exhibit B attached hereto. The DAC term may be modified in the future as deemed beneficial
by the City and CAL. The DAC will cause periodic reports to be made and presented to the Deputy Director by
the PMT, including, (1) the Monthly Report and the Quarterly Report, which are intended to be summary level
reports on the overall status of the project identifying significant accomplishments and potential problems occurring on the Program, (2) a Master Program Schedule, which will include a statement of any schedule slippage
or gain since the last reports, (3) a cost report by project budget identifying original budget, current approved
budget, committed costs, anticipated cost to complete, total anticipated cost, and variance, (4) a Work Force Compliance Report summarizing statistics related to all applicable work force compliance goals, including M/FBE,
OEO, and City Residency goals, and identifying current dollar amount and percentage by contract that has been
performed by certified M/FBE firms and City residents, and (5) an Issues and Concerns Report, which will identify all issues and concerns requiring attention of City senior management to avoid cost delays or cost overruns.
Each member of the DAC will have responsibility for managing a particular scope of the Program in accordance with the provisions of Section A above. Scope may be identified as (individual or multiple) projects, contractors, areas of expertise, etc. Each member of the DAC will consult with the Deputy Director to determine the
best course of action related to his or her area of responsibility as well as the overall Program.
The City and CAL agree to cooperate with each other in the formation, staffing, and continuing operation of
the DAC. The City or CAL may request replacement of any DAC member if it can reasonably demonstrate the
individual is not able to perform his/her responsibilities in a professional, competent manner and the City and
CAL agree to give due consideration to any such request. Further, the City maintains the right to dissolve the
DAC if, in its sole judgment, the DAC is not providing a meaningful benefit to the Program. CAL maintains the
right to terminate its involvement, and remove its employees from the DAC if, in its sole judgment, the City is
not acting in compliance with the intent of the management authority defined in this document. Both parties
agree to meet and make good faith efforts to resolve problems for at least thirty days prior to taking any action
that would affect the operating structure of the DAC. In the event either party terminates or modifies its involvement in the DAC, all authorized costs incurred by either party, through the date of termination, will be fully
reimbursed in accordance with the procedure set forth below.
It is understood that the scope of responsibility of the DAC is limited to the Program as defined in Exhibit A
and that the DAC will be dissolved when all of the projects comprising the Program are substantially completed, (which is expected to occur by approximately December 31, 2004) unless the Deputy Director determines that
it is necessary to retain the services of one or more members of the DAC for a longer period to assist in the
close out of the contracts. It is further understood that the Program includes only projects which relate to the
airfield generally and not to the exclusive use areas or leased premises of CAL or any other airline operating
at the Airport and that the DAC is expressly prohibited from advising the Deputy Director with respect to any
such exclusive use areas or leased premises.
C. DAC Related Costs
All costs of the DAC, including salaries, benefits and normal and usual expenses of the DAC employees will
be included in the Program cost, and paid from Program funds. The reimbursable salary and benefits of the CAL
employees will be the salary and benefits normally paid to such employees by CAL, provided that, without the
Deputy Director’s written consent, the reimbursement to CAL for salary shall not exceed $150,000 and the reimbursement to CAL for benefits shall not exceed .5 times the lesser of actual salary or $150,000. The salary and
benefits of the DAC members designated by the City will be determined by the City. CAL will pay its employees directly and submit costs for reimbursement from Program funds. The cost of any furniture, equipment or
supplies purchased by CAL (with the approval of the Deputy Director) for use by members of the DAC shall be
promptly reimbursed by the City out of Program funds and, upon such reimbursement, shall become the property of the City. The City will either pay its employees directly and submit costs for reimbursement from Program
funds or will cause its designees who are independent contractors to be paid directly from Program funds. The
City and CAL may submit expenses monthly, along with documentation sufficient to evidence such expenses, for
reimbursement. Each reimbursement request shall be submitted to the Deputy Director not more often than once
per month, and the City shall use best efforts to cause reimbursement to be made within 30 days of submittal.
D. General
It is acknowledged by the City and CAL that the intent of the creation of the DAC is to be benefit the Program generally by making available to the City CAL’s construction experience in order to enhance the City’s performance of the owner’s rights and responsibilities with respect to the Program and specifically by implementing procedures designed to (1) assess and resolve problems affecting the Program and its implementation productively, (2) cause timely and accurate reporting concerning the Program, and (3) facilitate the completion of
the Program on time and within budget. However, in this regard, it is noted that although the DAC shall participate in managing the day-to-day operations of the Program as herein specified, neither the DAC nor the individuals designated by the City or CAL shall have the ability to amend the express terms of any contract relating to the Program (and all such amendatory power is retained by the City as the owner of the Program).

June 12, 2002

Notwithstanding anything herein or in the various agreements to which CAL and the City are a party, the City
and CAL agree that neither any individual appointed by them to serve on the DAC nor the City or CAL shall be
liable to the other party directly or with respect to claims asserted by third parties for actions or inactions of
the DAC or any individual member thereof acting in good faith and within the scope of such member’s duties;
provided, that nothing herein shall limit the liability, if any, that the City or CAL each may have to the other
under the various agreements between them or under law in respect of the Program if such liability would have
arisen absent the involvement of the DAC. The City agrees to use reasonable efforts to cause CAL to be listed
as an additional insured under the City’s Program contracts. CAL agrees to provide for its employees who serve
on the DAC the normal insurance coverage which it provides for all of its employees, including, without limitation, automobile and general liability insurance and workers compensation insurance, and that, to the extent that
third party claims are asserted against the City arising out of acts of the CAL employees which are covered by
such automobile or general liability insurance, the City may assert a claim against CAL to be collected out of
said insurance notwithstanding the mutual waivers of liability set forth in this paragraph. CAL further agrees
that its employees who are members of the DAC shall act in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Nothing herein shall be construed to create a waiver of any immunities that the City may otherwise have
under state, federal, or common law.
The City and CAL agree that there are no third party beneficiaries of this agreement and that nothing herein provided, nor any actions taken by the DAC in connection with this agreement or the Program, shall limit the
duties that any third party, including without limitation the PMT, may have in connection with the Program.
Nothing herein shall be construed to create a joint venture or an employer-employee relationship between a party
and the DAC members furnished by the other party.
[The balance of this page intentionally left blank]
The parties hereby evidence their agreement with, and intent to be bound by, the terms of this MOU by signature below. This MOU shall be binding upon the parties upon approval by Cleveland City Council and the Board
of Directors of CAL (unless such requirement is waived in writing by the President of CAL).

Project Director:
Each Project Director (“PD”) will be assigned a specific number of discrete projects. Under direction of the
DPC Administrator of Engineering and Planning (“AEP”) or the DPC Chief Engineer (“CE”) as determined by
the Deputy Director, this person will provide direction to the PMT staff on the management of those projects.
The PD will have construction management experience with a college degree in engineering, construction management, or similar training.
Contract Administrator:
It is important that the overall contract administration be consistent and that all contracts be monitored from
an administrative standpoint for compliance with contract terms and conditions. The contract administrator (“CA”),
under the direction of the AEP, will support the ongoing review of all issues regarding general conditions, terms
of the contract and interpretation of the intent of the contract language. The CA will serve as administrative
liaison with City staff responsible for legislation, finances, procurement, Office of Equal Opportunity compliance,
and project communications. The CA will also be responsible for processing change orders and subsidiary agreements. The CA will have a background in construction contract administration and a college degree in a related field.
Financial Manager:
The financial manager (“FM”) shall be under the direction of the AEP, and will be responsible for cost control on each project within the Program. All projects will be set up with a separate approved project budget. The
FM will track all project costs including anticipated cost so that accurate financial reporting is performed. The
FM will work with all team members to collect cost data and manage the preparation of all required financial
reports. The FM will have cost management experience and the capability to track and manage multiple project
accounts. The FM should have a college degree in finance and proven work performance.
Office:
The DAC will have offices located at the airport in the engineering office complex currently in place. One or
two administrative assistants provided by the Program will support the DAC.
FIELD DIRECTIVES AND CHANGE ORDERS;
Field Directives:
It is the Program policy that the Deputy Director must first approve all work that changes the approved scope
prior to committing any additional costs. However, on a project of the magnitude of the Program, certain conditions will arise during construction that require immediate decision in order to avoid or mitigate significant additional costs as well as schedule slippage. Upon approval of the CE, the PD is authorized to issue field directives
if in his or her opinion immediate direction is required. The field directive will instruct the contractor that they
are authorized to commit up to $10,000 against the field directive prior to the execution of a change order. Separate filed directives may be issued to address different construction conditions; provided, that, at such time as
a change order to the contract is required, no further field directives in respect of such contract may be issued
until such a change order is executed.
