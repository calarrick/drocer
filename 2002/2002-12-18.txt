An emergency resolution encouraging the Campbell Administration

Whereas, this video camera technology can decrease the number of
incidents where a motorist drives
through a red stop light and thereby enhance public safety;
Whereas, a red stop light safety
camera system may also assist law
enforcement officials in identifying
individuals who distribute illegal
drugs and narcotics;
Whereas, a red stop light safety
camera system can greatly improve
the quality of life of residents in the
City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, this Council supports
and encourages the use of strategic
cost-effective initiatives that improve the quality of life of Cleveland residents; and
Whereas, this Council encourages
the
Campbell
Administration
to
review and study the feasibility of
implementing a red stop light safety camera system; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby encourages the Campbell Administration to review and study the

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 2475-02.
By Council Members Coats, Cintron, Cimperman, Brady, Conwell,
Westbrook, Johnson, Scott, Jackson,
Britt, Zone, White, O’Malley, Gordon
and Reed.
An
emergency
resolution
condemning the recent comments of
Senator Trent Lott relating to the
Presidential election of 1948 as such
comments appear to imply support
for racial segregation; encouraging
the United States Senate to elect a
Senator to the position of Senate
Majority Leader who is committed
to racial equality; encouraging Senator Michael DeWine and Senator
George Voinovich to oppose the election of Senator Trent Lott as Senate
Majority Leader; and encouraging
the United States Senate to censure
Senator Trent Lott for his recent
comments.
Whereas, Senator Trent Lott, Senate Majority Leader, recently commented on Strom Thurmond’s candidacy for President in 1948 and
stated the following: “When Strom
Thurmond ran for President, we
voted for him. We’re proud of it.
And if the rest of the country had
followed our lead, we wouldn’t have
had all these problems over all
these years”; and
Whereas, such comment has been
repeatedly reported in the media;
and
Whereas, Strom Thurmond ran as
the nominee of the States’ Rights
Party with an avowed goal of preserving racial segregation; and
Whereas, this is at least the second time that Senator Lott has made
comments of this nature; and
Whereas, Senator Lott has a long
history of opposing the rights of
African-Americans as he opposed
the integration of the University of
Mississippi, the integration of Sigma
Nu fraternity, the establishment of
the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday,
and the expansion of the Civil
Rights Act; and
Whereas, Senator Lott’s history
includes being a popular speaker for
the white supremacist organization
Council of Conservative Citizens;
and
Whereas, a growing chorus of
democratically minded groups, including the Cleveland AFL-CIO Federation of Labor and the Cleveland
Plain Dealer, have called for the
removal of Senator Lott as Senate
Majority Leader; and
Whereas, Senator Lott has served
as Senate Majority Leader and is
being considered for Senate Majority Leader when Congress convenes
in January; and
Whereas, this Council is concerned about Senator Lott’s remarks
and disturbed by the fact that Senator Lott may be elected to the highest position of leadership within the
Senate; and
Whereas, it is the opinion of this
Council that the leader of the Senate should be an individual with
unquestioned commitment to racial
equality; and
Whereas, censure is a formal condemnation by the Senate of one of
its own Members and is used when
a Member engages in behavior considered
to
be
inappropriate
or
demeaning to the Senate; and

December 18, 2002
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

segregation.

oppose the election of Senator Trent
Lott as Senate Majority Leader.
Section
4.
That
this
Council
encourages the United State Senate
to censure Senator Lott for his
recent comments relating to the
Presidential election of 1948 as such
comments appear to imply support
for racial segregation.

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 2400-02.
By Council Members Cimperman,
Conwell, Scott and Zone.
An emergency resolution urging
the
Campbell
Administration
to
investigate the manner in which
funds provided to the Greater Cleveland YMCA by the City of Cleveland, during the last ten years, were
expended
to
determine
if
such
expenditures are consistent with
any contract between the City of
Cleveland and the Greater Cleveland
YMCA, with any ordinance authorizing funding for YMCA activities,
and with any applicable laws; and
requesting that if such investigation
reveals that funds provided to the
Greater Cleveland YMCA by the City
of Cleveland were expended in an
illegal or inappropriate manner, that
the Law Director take any and all
action that may be necessary to
recover such funds and protect the
interests of the City of Cleveland.
Whereas, the YMCA of Greater
Cleveland has announced plans to
close its Glenville and Near West
Side branches; and
Whereas, the YMCA of Greater
Cleveland has received funds from
the City of Cleveland; and

38
Whereas, such funds were provided in order to assist the Greater
Cleveland YMCA in its efforts to
provide social service programs and
recreational activities to the citizens
of the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, this Council wishes to
ensure that City of Cleveland funds
provided to the Greater Cleveland
YMCA were expended for the purposes intended; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby
requests
that
the
Campbell
Administration investigate the manner in which funds provided to the
Greater Cleveland YMCA by the City
of Cleveland, during the last ten
years, were expended to determine
if such expenditures are consistent
with any contract between the City
of Cleveland and the Greater Cleveland YMCA, with any ordinance
authorizing funding for YMCA activities, and with all applicable laws.
Section 2. That if such investigation reveals that funds provided to
the Greater Cleveland YMCA by the
City of Cleveland were expended in
an illegal and/or inappropriate manner, this Council requests that the
Law Director take any and all
action that may be necessary to
recover such funds and protect the
interests of the City of Cleveland.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted December 9, 2002.
Effective December 13, 2002.

Res. No. 2401-02.
By Council Members Sweeney and
Westbrook.
An emergency resolution strongly
condemning FOX 8 News for showing a photograph and broadcasting
the name of a rape and assault victim in its newscast this past week
and urging Fox 8 News to follow the
example of those news organizations that do not release the name
of rape victims.
Whereas, last week a woman was
assaulted and raped while walking
home from a bus stop on the City’s
west side; and
Whereas, this story was carried in
the local newspaper and on local
television newscasts; and
Whereas, in its newscast, Fox 8
News broadcast a photograph and
the name of the rape and assault
victim; and
Whereas, the use of the victim’s
name and image in relaying this terrible crime to the public is completely outside the bounds of good,
moral and professional journalism;
and
Whereas, the use of the victim’s
name and image in relaying this terrible crime to the public shows a
total lack of respect and compassion
for the woman who was raped; and

The City Record
Whereas, the use of the victim’s
name and image in relaying this terrible crime to the public serves only
to make the crime victim a victim
again, this time of overzealous and
sensationalist journalism; and
Whereas, Fox 8 News and all city
television stations should work to
aid in finding the perpetrator of the
crime instead of further victimizing
the crime victim; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby strongly condemns FOX 8 News
for
showing
a
photograph
and
broadcasting the name of a rape and
assault victim in its newscast this
past weekend and urges Fox 8 News
to follow the example of those news
organizations that do not release
the name of rape victims.
Section 2. That this Council commends the city’s other local news
media for their sensitivity and their
appropriate news coverage in this
instance.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to the General Manager of Fox 8 News.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted December 9, 2002.
Effective December 13, 2002.

Res. No. 2402-02.
By Council Member Brady.
An emergency resolution objecting to a New C1 Liquor Permit to
12417 Cooley Avenue.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Department of Liquor
Control of an application for a New
C1 Liquor Permit at Digat, LLC,
DBA B & D Deli, 12417 Cooley Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44111, Permanent Number 0534829; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with

2744

December 18, 2002
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of
notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby record its objection to a New C1
Liquor Permit at Digat, LLC, DBA
B & D Deli, 12417 Cooley Avenue,
Cleveland, Ohio 44111, Permanent
Number 0534829; and requests the
