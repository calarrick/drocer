borrower, (i) make the predatory
loan satisfy the requirements of this
Chapter, or (ii) change the terms of
the loan in a manner beneficial to
the borrower so that the loan will
no longer be considered a predatory
loan subject to the provisions of this
Chapter.
Examples of a bona fide
error include clerical, calculation,
computer malfunction and programming, and printing errors. An error
of legal judgment with respect to a
person’s
obligations
under
this
Chapter is not a bona fide error.
(2) Lending Without Home Loan
Counseling. No person or business
entity shall make, issue or arrange
any threshold or high cost loan, or
assist others in doing so, without
first receiving notice from a counselor employed by a housing counseling agency approved by the
Department of Housing and Urban
Development that the borrower has
received counseling on the advisability of the loan transaction and
the appropriateness of the loan for
the borrower based upon the information provided by borrower and
lender to the counselor at the time
counseling is provided to the borrower.
(3) Lending Without Due Regard
to Repayment. No person or business
entity shall make, issue or originate
any threshold or high cost loan if
that person or business entity does
not reasonably believe at the time
the loan is consummated that the
borrower or borrowers (when considered collectively in the case of
multiple borrowers) will be able to
make the scheduled payments to
repay the obligation based upon a
consideration of their current and
expected income, current obligations, employment status, and other
financial resources (other than the
borrower’s equity in the dwelling
which secures repayment of the
loan). A borrower shall be presumed
to be able to make the scheduled
payments to repay the obligation if,
at the time the loan is consummated, or at the time of the first rate
adjustment in the case of a lower
introductory interest rate (i) the
borrower’s scheduled monthly payments on the loan (including principal, interest, taxes, insurance and
assessments), combined with the
scheduled payments for all other
debt, do not exceed 50% of the borrower’s documented and verified
monthly gross income, and (ii) provided that the borrower has sufficient “residual income” as defined in
the guidelines established in 38
C.F.R. §36.4337(e) and VA form 266393
to
pay
essential
monthly
expenses after paying the scheduled
payments and any additional debt.
(4) Payments to Home Improve -

297

15
ment Contractors. A lender shall not
pay proceeds of a threshold or high
cost loan to any “home improvement
contractor”, as defined in division
(k) of Section 659.01, and a home
improvement contractor may not
receive the proceeds of a threshold
or high cost loan, other than (i) by
an instrument payable solely to the
borrower or borrowers, or (ii) at the
election of the borrower, through a
third-party escrow agent in accordance with terms established in a
written agreement signed by the
borrower and the home improvement
contractor prior to the disbursement;
provided
however
that
in
no
instance shall more than 25% of the
total proceeds of the threshold or
high cost loan be disbursed at the
time of closing.
(5) Incorporating Governmental
Financial Assistance Funds. All
persons shall be barred from promoting, utilizing, packaging, or in
any other way incorporating funds
from any of the programs administered by the City in combination
with any high cost or predatory
loan. Any contract, lease, grant or
other agreement entered into by the
City with any person or business
entity shall contain a provision
requiring that the person or business entity, in the administration of
governmental
housing
assistance
funds, abide by the provisions of
this division as though its administration of such funds was directly subject to the provisions of this
division.
(b) Activities of Certain Financial
Institutions Exempted.
(1) Division (a) of this section is
not applicable in the following circumstances:
A. With respect to a lender duly
licensed as may be required under
State law, solely because of the
presence
of
a
loan
provision

predatory as defined in division (j)
of Section 659.01; or
B. In the case of a loan made pursuant to the Ohio’s Mortgage Loan
Act, R.C. §1321.51 et. seq., solely

2. Divisions (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3),
and (a)(4) of this section are not
applicable with respect to a State
chartered bank, bank and trust company, savings bank, private bank or
national bank, a State or federally
chartered savings and loan association, a federally chartered savings
bank or a State or federally chartered credit union.
3. Divisions (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3)
and (a)(4) of this section shall

those financial institutions.
Section 659.03 Notice to Customers
of Home Improvement Loans
At least three (3) business days
prior to closing, every lender who
funds a home improvement loan
must furnish a notice along with

16
any home improvement loan for any
work to be performed on owneroccupied
residential
real
estate
located within the City of Cleveland.
Said notice shall be furnished as a
separate document, printed in 16
point font, with the signature line
at the top of the page, and shall be
in substantially the same form as
the following, as may be amended
from time to time by the Department of Consumer Affairs:
IMPORTANT NOTICE TO
CUSTOMERS OF HOME IMPROVEMENT CONTRACTORS
If you need a loan to pay for home
improvements:
BE CAREFUL. A lender will probably want to take a mortgage on
your house. You should not borrow
more than you can afford or more
than you need. The loan you are
being offered may be a threshold or
high cost loan. You may be eligible
for a different loan which charges
significantly less interest or fees. Be
very cautious about consolidating
your debt with a home mortgage.
Beware that if you default on this
loan you could lose your house! It is
now the law in Cleveland that before
you sign any threshold or high cost
home loan you must receive housing
counseling assistance.
For the name, address and phone
number of a housing counseling or
legal services agency in your neighborhood, turn this notice over to see
the list of agencies printed on the
reverse side.

Res. No. 308-02.
By Councilmen Cimperman, Rybka
and Scott.
An emergency resolution urging
the Army Corps of Engineers to
facilitate the use of the Confined
Disposal Facility north of Burke
Lakefront Airport, known as Dike
10B, for the deposition of private
dredgings from the Harbor and
Cuyahoga River.
Whereas, Dike 10B, an active Confined
Disposal
Facility
(“CDF”)
located north of Burke Lakefront
Airport in Cleveland, was built by
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
for the disposal of dredging material from the Cuyahoga River and the
Port of Cleveland, to replace the
Army Corps’ CDF site known as
Dike 14 at Gordon Park in the City,
which Site was completed by the
Army Corps in 1999, and the City of
Cleveland entered into a Local Cooperation Agreement with the Army
Corps to facilitate the construction
of Dike 10B; and
Whereas, Dike 10B was intended
by the Army Corps and the City to
accept both Federal sources of
dredging material from the shipping
channels of Lake Erie and Cuyahoga River at Cleveland, and nonFederal dredgings from the Cuyahoga River and Lake Erie shoreline
in our area; and this Council has
become
concerned
about
the
approval process relative to allowing the disposal of non-Federal
materials in Dike 10B; and
Whereas,
the
Port
Authority
asserts that it has several pending
applications for disposal of materials in either Dike 14 or Dike 10B,
and that it is its preference that
these materials be placed at Dike
10B, and not in Dike 14, but that
because the Army Corps’ process to
accept applications for non-Federal
dredging material at Dike 10B may
take up to one year, the Port asserts
that it will seek approval to deposit
these materials in Dike 14; and
Whereas,
the
disposal
of
additional materials in Dike 14 is not
desirable because the Dike 14 Site
has for many years been eagerly
anticipated for public access and
park use, the Ohio Department of
Natural Resources has initiated a
public planning process for the Site,
and the public was promised that
Dike 14 would be closed to more
dredge disposal after Dike 10B
opened in 1999; and
Whereas, it is therefore critical
that the Army Corps address the
City’s concerns to expedite the processing of and acceptance of nonFederal dredge and other environmentally
acceptable
material
at
Dike 10B, now therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Army Corps of Engineers to
meet with City and Port officials,
and to promptly create an expedited
process for the acceptance of nonFederal dredgings and other environmentally acceptable materials at
Dike 10B.
Section 2. That this Council urges
the Mayor to take any action necessary to seek Army Corps action
and agreement to the City’s desires
to protect Dike 14, and to open Dike
10B as agreed upon and as the Army
Corps planned on in the creation of
Dike 10B.

By Councilmen Scott, Rybka and

An emergency resolution urging
the State of Ohio to restrict any Submerged Lands Lease granted to the
Port Authority for its activities on
the Confined Disposal Facility north
of Gordon Park, known as Dike 14,
to prohibit disposal of dredging or
other material.
Whereas, the Cleveland-Cuyahoga
County Port Authority has the current responsibility to maintain Dike
14, a former Confined Disposal
Facility (“CDF”) located north of
Gordon Park in Cleveland, that was
built by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers for the disposal of dredging material from the Cuyahoga
River and the Port of Cleveland
until the Army Corps’ project was
completed in 1999 and maintenance
responsibility was turned over to
the Port Authority under a Local
Cooperation Agreement; and
Whereas, Dike 14 belongs to the
City of Cleveland as the land-side
owner of property, and said site is
intended to become part of the Lakefront State Park, and toward that
end, the State of Ohio Department of
Natural
Resources
(ODNR)
has
hired a consultant and issued a
notice to proceed with a public planning process for the future public
use of Dike 14 as a park; and
Whereas, the Port Authority has
applied to the ODNR for a Submerged Lands Lease, in order to
legally accomplish its responsibility
to maintain the Dike’s perimeter
wall and related maintenance obligations, but said application also
seeks for the Port the ability to use
the site for other purposes, Such as
the Port’s proposed deposition of at
least 100,000 cubic yards of privately generated dredge and other fill
material on natural areas within the
site; and
Whereas, this Council has previously recognized by Resolution that
Dike 14 has diverse coastal wildlife
habitats which have ecological, educational and social value that warrant protection, and the wetlands,
mudflats, grasslands, shrub lands
and woodlands of Dike 14 function
as exceptional migratory bird stopover habitats, attracting tens of
thousands of birds each year, with
over 268 species of birds documented at the site; and thus Dike 14 is
already
a
dynamic,
year-round
nature area and has the potential,

321

39
under the aegis of the State, to provide exceptional educational, recreational and economic benefits to
Cleveland’s neighborhoods, to Cleveland’s 122 schools and 77,000 school
children, and to Northeast Ohio’s
residents and visitors of all ages;
and
Whereas, in response to a request
by Council, ODNR is holding a public hearing on the application on
January 31, 2002, at the Coast Guard
Club, from 6-9 p.m.; now therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the State of Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) to restrict
any Submerged Lands Lease that
may be granted to the Cleveland Cuyahoga County Port Authority to
the
maintenance
responsibilities
required of the Port under its Local
Cooperation Agreement with the
Army Corps of Engineers, and to
prohibit the Port from any and all
dredge or other material disposal
uses of Dike 14 until the ODNR’s
public planning process can be completed and alternatives to the disposal of private dredgings at Dike
14 may be fully considered.
Section 2. That this Council urges
the Mayor to take any action necessary to assert the City’s rights to
and on the Dike 14 site in order to
protect the site’s natural areas from
destruction pending the completion
of the public planning process for
Dike 14 to determine the best use of
the land for State park purposes.
Section 3. That this Council urges
ODNR to conduct flora and fauna
surveys and other studies necessary
to determine the status of Dike 14
and appropriate uses of the property.
Section 4. That this Council urges
the Mayor to refrain from issuing
any permits to the Port Authority or
anyone acting on its behalf for the
disposal of dredgings or any filling
and grading of Dike 14 until at least
the completion of studies and planning needed to protect the natural
state of the Dike and to protect the
site for public use.
Section 5. That this Council urges
the Port Authority, the Mayor and
ODNR, to arrange for the leasing of
the property known as Dike 14 to
ODNR for eventual inclusion of the
land in the Lakefront State Park.
Section 6. That upon its passage
by City Council the Clerk of Council shall provide copies of this Resolution to the following: Mayor
Campbell, Samuel W. Speck, Director, Ohio Department of Natural
Resources, Scott Zody, Deputy Director, Real Estate & Land Management, Ohio Department of Natural
Resources, the Director of the Port
Authority, the Board members of the
Port Authority, the Cuyahoga County Commissioners, and the Army
Corps of Engineers.
Section 7. That this resolution is
hereby declared an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
members elected to Council, it shall
take effect and be in force immediately upon its adoption and approval
by the Mayor; otherwise it shall take
effect and be in force from and after
the earliest period allowed by law.
