domestically produced steel could be
used to assist in the rebuilding of

legacy cost relief for the domestic

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 191-02.
By Councilmen Cintron, Brady and
Jones.
An emergency resolution urging
the prompt passage of Ohio House
Bill 290 and Ohio Senate Bill 127, the
Ohio Prescription Drug Fair Pricing
Act.
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland has supported, by passage of numerous resolutions, the
right to affordable, accessible health
care and the ability to secure prescription medication at reasonable
prices; and
Whereas, it is estimated that one

drug coverage; and
Whereas, prescription drug prices
are rising twice as fast as the rate
of inflation; and
Whereas,
individual
Americans
pay 30% to 70% more than Canadians and Mexicans for the same prescriptions and about twice what the
federal government pays for the
same drugs under the Federal Supply Schedule; and
Whereas, U.S. prescription drug
spending rose nearly 17% in 1999,
some $99.6 billion, and it is predicted that spending on pharmaceuticals
will increase about 12.6% annually
until 2010; and
Whereas,
the
pharmaceutical
industry
is
the
most
profitable
industry in the world, making profits of 18.3% compared to an average
profit of 5% for other industries;

Ohio Senate Bill 127, the Prescription Drug Fair Pricing Act, would

177

23
provide a prescription drug card to
all Ohioans who do not have prescription
drug
coverage
or
are
grossly underinsured, giving the
State the authority to negotiate substantial rebates from drug companies and discounts from drug retailers and to pass those discounts to
program participants, with the State
paying administrative and other
costs out of the negotiated rebates,
thus incurring no cost to taxpayers;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation

health; now therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

hereby declared to be an emergency
measure arid, provided it receives
