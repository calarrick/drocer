Ord. No. 1371-02.
By Council Members Coats and
Jackson (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the issuance and sale of Waterworks Revenue Bonds of the City
for the purpose of paying costs of
improvements to the Waterworks
System and refunding Outstanding
Revenue Bonds of the City issued
for that purpose, those Revenue
Bonds to be in an aggregate principal
amount
not

exceed
$235,000,000 with respect to Bonds
for Improvements and in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed
$50,000,000 with respect to Refunding Bonds; authorizing Supplemental Indentures to Supplement the
Amended and Restated Trust Indenture securing Outstanding Waterworks Revenue Bonds of the City;
authorizing the defeasance of Outstanding Revenue Bonds; authorizing related matters; and declaring
an emergency.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
Ohio, a municipal corporation and
political subdivision in and of the
State of Ohio, is authorized under
Article XVIII of the Constitution of
the State and the Charter of the
City, among other things: (a) to own
and
operate
the
public
utility
referred to as the Waterworks System; (b) to make, from time to time,
improvements to the Waterworks
System; (c) to borrow money for the
purpose of paying costs of those
improvements and refunding outstanding bonds issued for that purpose; and (d) to issue additional
bonds secured by a pledge of and
lien on the Net Revenues of the
Waterworks System on a parity
with Bonds outstanding under the
Indenture, as defined and described
below; and
Whereas, by Ordinance No. 1103-A77 passed July 25, 1977, this Council
authorized an Indenture of Mortgage dated as of November 1, 1977
(the “Original Indenture”) to secure
waterworks improvement revenue
bonds issued by the City, from time
to time, and ten Series of bonds
were issued under the Original
Indenture, of which five Series are
currently outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $662,995,000
as of July 1, 2002; and
Whereas, the Original Indenture
was amended and restated effective
October 5, 2001 as provided in the
Amended and Restated Indenture
between the City and National City
Bank, as Trustee (the “Indenture”)
under authority of Ordinance No.
2011-95 passed by the Council of the
City on April 1, 1996 and with the
consent of the owners of 66-2/3% of
the Bonds then Outstanding under
the Original Indenture; and
Whereas, Section 2.02 of the Indenture permits the City to issue additional Bonds on a parity with the
Outstanding Bonds under the conditions set forth in the Indenture; and
Whereas, this Council has determined that it is necessary to issue,
sell and deliver additional Bonds
under the Indenture in order to
finance the costs of improvements to

The City Record
the Waterworks System and to
refund certain Outstanding Bonds in
order to reduce the total principal
and interest payable on the Outstanding Bonds; and
Whereas, this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of public property, health and safety, and for the further reason that
this Ordinance is required to be
immediately effective to permit the
issuance and sale of the 2002 Bonds
to fund contracts for the improvement of, and to obtain debt service
savings for the benefit of, the
Waterworks System and thereby
provide for the usual daily operation

Section 2. Authorization of the
2002 Bonds. This Council finds and
determines it is necessary and proper and in the best interest of the
City to issue the 2002 Bonds for the
purpose of paying costs of improvements to the Waterworks System
and refunding the Refunded Bonds.
The 2002 Bonds may be issued in
one or more Series. The principal
amount of each Series of 2002 Bonds
is to be the amount set forth in the
Certificate of Award authorized in
Section 3. The aggregate principal
amount of 2002 Bonds of all Series
issued for the purpose of paying
costs of improvements shall not
exceed $235,000,000. The aggregate
principal amount of 2002 Bonds
issued for the purpose of refunding
the
Refunded
Bonds
shall
not
exceed $50,000,000 and shall be the
amount determined by the Director
of Finance, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
necessary to refund the Refunded
Bonds and to obtain aggregate net
present value debt service savings
with respect to the Refunded Bonds
of not less than three percent (3%).
The proceeds from the sale of each
Series of 2002 Bonds shall be allocated, deposited and applied as provided in Section 4 of this Ordinance.
The 2002 Bonds may be issued in
one or more separate Series, each
bearing a distinctive designation,
provided that the 2002 Bonds of each
Series satisfy the requirements of
this Ordinance. Separate Series of
2002 Bonds may be issued at the
same or different times. The 2002
Bonds of each Series shall be designated as provided in the applicable Certificate of Award. A separate
Certificate of Award and a separate
Supplemental
Indenture
may
be
delivered for each Series.
In the event that the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, determines that the City’s best interests
will be served by causing a Series
of 2002 Bonds to be obligations bearing interest at variable interest
rates, then the Director of Finance
is authorized to so specify in the
Certificate of Award for that Series.
If the Director of Finance so deter-

12
mines, then the method and procedure by which the variable rate of
interest to be borne by the 2002
Bonds of that Series shall be determined as provided in the applicable
Supplemental Indenture, whether by
auction, by reference to a market
index, by a remarketing agent or
otherwise; provided that no Series of
2002 Bonds shall bear interest at a
rate in excess of sixteen percent
(16%) per year. Notwithstanding
that limitation, a Series of 2002
Bonds held by a provider of a Credit Support Instrument may bear
interest at a rate not in excess of
twenty-five percent (25%) per year
as provided in the agreement with
the provider of the Credit Support
Instrument. The Director of Finance
may determine that the terms of a
variable rate Series of 2002 Bonds
may or may not permit the Holders
to tender their variable rate 2002
Bonds for purchase by the City. If
the Director of Finance designates
any Series of 2002 Bonds as variable
rate 2002 Bonds, and if the Holders
of that Series of 2002 Bonds are to
be entitled to tender those 2002
Bonds for purchase, then the Director of Finance shall also designate
in the Certificate of Award for those
variable rate 2002 Bonds, the tender
agent or agents and the remarketing agent or agents, which designations shall be based on the determination of the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the parties
so designated possess the requisite
resources and experience to provide
the services required of them and
that the terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide
such services are fair and commercially reasonable. The Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements in connection with the
delivery of the 2002 Bonds, and from
time to time thereafter so long as
the 2002 Bonds are outstanding,
with providers of Credit Support
Instruments, tender agents (which
may be the Trustee), remarketing
agents (which may be any of the
Original Purchasers) and others as
may be determined by the Director
of Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the method of
determining the variable interest
rates, permitting holders the right
of tender and providing for payment
of the purchase price of, or debt service on, the variable rate 2002
Bonds. In the event the variable rate
2002 Bonds are issued as auction
rate obligations, the Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements with auction agents and
others, or to cause the Trustee to
enter into those agreements, based
on the written advice of a Financial
Advisor that the parties so designated
possess
the
requisite
resources and experience to provide
the services required of them and
that the terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide
such services are fair and commercially reasonable.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of
any Series of 2002 Bonds, and
regardless of whether that Series of
2002 Bonds bears interest at variable or fixed rates, is authorized to
contract for a Credit Support Instru-

The City Record
ment, and to pay the costs of it from
proceeds of the 2002 Bonds, if he
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the Credit Support Instrument will
result in a savings in the cost of the
financing to the City.
The Refunded Bonds shall be designated by the Director of Finance
in the Certificate of Award and
shall consist of those Outstanding
Bonds that can be refunded (and
thereby deemed no
longer Outstanding for purposes of the Indenture) with the proceeds of the 2002
Bonds, the refunding of which Outstanding Bonds will enable the City,
in the judgment of the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to
obtain net present value debt service savings with respect to the
Bonds so refunded. The Refunded
Bonds shall be called for redemption or retired on the date or dates
specified
in
the
Certificate
of
Award. The redemption dates so
specified shall be the dates required
under the Code for compliance with
Section 149(d) of the Code and other
applicable federal tax laws. The
Director of Finance shall notify
each City Council Member when an
option for refinancing is exercised
and shall explain why the option
was
exercised
and
the
benefit
derived from exercising the option.
Section 3. Sale of 2002 Bonds. The
2002 Bonds shall be sold to the Original Purchasers pursuant to one or
more Bond Purchase Agreements
substantially in the form of the
Bond Purchase Agreement now on
file with the Clerk in the File referenced in Section 1 with such
changes not inconsistent with the
Indenture or this Ordinance and not
substantially adverse to the City as
may be approved by the officer signing the Bond Purchase Agreement
on behalf of the City. The approval
of any changes by that officer and
the determination by that officer
that the change is not substantially
adverse to the City shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing and
delivery
of
the
Bond
Purchase
Agreement by that officer. The
Director of Finance shall sign and
deliver the Certificate of Award and
Bond Purchase Agreement for the
2002 Bonds of each Series, one or
more of which shall specify and set
forth the following details with
respect to the 2002 Bonds:
(a)
the
aggregate
principal
amount; provided that amount shall
not exceed $235,000,000 with respect
to
2002
Bonds
issued
to
fund
improvements to the Waterworks
System or $50,000,000 with respect to
2002 Bonds issued to refund the
Refunded Bonds, assuming that the
2002 Bonds are to be initially
offered to the public at a price at
least equal to their aggregate principal amount, but, if any of the 2002
Bonds are to be initially offered to
the public at an original issue discount, the maximum aggregate principal amount of 2002 Bonds shall be
increased over that amount by an
amount equal to the aggregate original issue discount net of the aggregate original issue premium;
(b) the date or dates of the 2002
Bonds;

1744

July 31, 2002
(c) the purchase price to be paid
to the City by the Original Purchasers, which amount shall be not
less than: (i) 97% of the amount
determined by subtracting from the
aggregate principal amount of the
2002 Bonds any aggregate original
issue discount net of any aggregate
original issue premium with respect
to the 2002 Bonds, plus (ii) any
accrued interest on the 2002 Bonds
from their date to the date of their
delivery to the Original Purchasers;
(d) whether any 2002 Bonds are
subject to optional redemption prior
to maturity, the earliest optional
redemption
date
for
those
2002
Bonds subject to prior redemption,
which shall be not later than ten
years from the first interest payment date of the applicable Series,
and the applicable redemption price,
which shall be not greater than
102%
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed;
(e) the dates on which principal
of the 2002 Bonds is to be paid,
which shall be not later than January 1, 2033, with an identification of
whether the payment is due by stated maturity or by mandatory sinking fund redemption of 2002 Bonds
of a particular maturity;
(f) the interest rates to be borne
by 2002 Bonds bearing interest at a
fixed rate, which shall not exceed
seven percent (7%) as to 2002 Bonds
of any maturity, and the method by
which the interest rate is to be
determined for 2002 Bonds bearing
interest at variable rates, consistent
with Section 2. The 2002 Bonds of
the same Series and same maturity
may bear interest at different interest rates;
(g) the particular Outstanding
Bonds or portions thereof to be
Refunded Bonds;
(h) any deposit required to be
made to the Debt Service Reserve
Fund; and
(i) the title and Series designation
for the Bonds.
It is determined that the terms of
the 2002 Bonds as so determined
within the limitations set forth in
this Ordinance and as so specified
and set forth in the Certificate of
Award will be in the best interest
of the City and consistent with all
legal requirements.
Section 4. Application of Proceeds
of 2002 Bonds. The proceeds of the
sale of the 2002 Bonds shall be
deposited as follows:
(a) to the Trustee, for deposit to
the credit of the Interest Account in
the Debt Service Fund, the amount,

2002 Bonds.
Provision shall be made in the
Supplemental Indentures for the
application of any amounts held in
the funds and accounts established

Bonds as a result of the Refunded
Bonds no longer being Outstanding,
or any amounts that otherwise are
in excess of the required balances.

the funds established under the
Indenture or Supplemental Indentures.

the
Mayor,
Director
of
Finance and Director of Public Utilities, or any two of them, are authorized and directed, in the name and
on behalf of the City, to sign and
deliver to the Trustee, in trust for
the Original Purchasers and subsequent holders of the 2002 Bonds, one
or more Supplemental Indentures,
approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, not inconsistent with this Ordinance, the Certificate of Award and the Indenture
and not substantially adverse to the
City as may be approved by the officers signing the same on behalf of
the City. The determination by those
officers that a Supplemental Indenture is not substantially adverse to
the City shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery
of that Supplemental Indenture by
those officers.
In order to cause the proceeds of
the 2002 Bonds and any funds of the
City deposited in an Escrow Fund
to be invested as permitted under
Section 9.02 of the Indenture so that
the Refunded Bonds are deemed
paid and discharged, and in order to
cause the amount to be deposited to
be dedicated and applied to the payment of the principal of and interest and any redemption premium on
the Refunded Bonds as and when
due, to and including the applicable
redemption date, the Mayor, Director
of Finance and Director of Public
Utilities, or any two of them, are
authorized and directed, in the name
and on behalf of the City, to sign
and deliver one or more Escrow
Agreements between the City and
the
Trustee
as
Escrow
Agent,
approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, providing
for the establishment of an Escrow
Fund as a trust fund in the custody
of the Trustee and the investment,
dedication and application of the
moneys deposited in the accounts
therein and further providing for
the payment of the fees and expenses of the Trustee for the perfor-

1745

13
mance of its duties as Escrow
Agent.
Each
Escrow
Agreement
shall provide for the redemption of
the applicable Refunded Bonds subject to redemption in accordance
with the Certificate of Award and
shall provide irrevocable instruction
to
the
Trustee
to
effect
such
redemption in accordance with the
Indenture. The Mayor, Director of
Finance and the Director of Public
Utilities, or any two of them, are
authorized, in the name and on
behalf of the City, to sign and deliver agreements, approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, with one or more institutions,
including agreements to enable the
City to more efficiently structure an
Escrow Fund, and thereby maximize
debt service savings and minimize
negative arbitrage. The Director of
Finance is authorized and directed
to take such other actions as may
be
necessary
or
appropriate
to
accomplish the refunding of the
Refunded Bonds, including without
limitation, the retention of a firm of
independent certified public accountants to verify that the securities to
be in an Escrow Fund are of such
maturities or redemption dates, and
interest payment dates, and bear
such interest, as will be sufficient,
together with any available moneys
in an Escrow Fund, for the payment
of debt service on the Refunded
Bonds.
Section 7. Rebate Fund. There is
hereby established and ordered to be
maintained one or more separate
accounts (except when invested as
provided in the Indenture) within
the Rebate Fund held in the custody
of the Trustee under the Indenture.
The Rebate Fund is not pledged to
the payment of debt service and is
free and clear of any pledge or lien
given under the Indenture as security for the 2002 Bonds or the Outstanding
Bonds.
Calculations
of
excess earnings that may be due
and payable to the federal government pursuant to the Code and
deposits to those accounts of the
Rebate Fund shall be made as provided in the applicable Supplemental Indenture.
Section 8. Defeasance of Outstanding Bonds. In the event that
any Outstanding Bonds are to be
defeased, the Defeased Bonds shall
be designated by the City in the
Defeasance Agreement and shall
consist of Outstanding Bonds the
defeasance of which will enable the
City, in the judgment of the officer
or officers signing the Defeasance
Agreement, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to
improve the debt service coverage
ratio of the Water System (being
the ratio of Net Revenues to Annual Debt Service Requirements, as
defined
in
the
Indenture).
The
Director of Finance is authorized to
deposit into the Defeasance Fund,
from moneys transferred to the
Defeasance Fund from Fund No. 52001 of the Water Division, an
amount not to exceed $30,000,000,
with the actual amount to be determined by the Director of Finance in
consultation with the Director of
Public Utilities. In order to cause
the moneys deposited into the Defea-

14
sance Fund to be invested as
required under Section 9.02 of the
Indenture so that the Defeased
Bonds are deemed paid and discharged, and in order to cause the
amounts so deposited to be dedicated and applied solely to the payment of the principal of and interest and any redemption premium on
the Defeased Bonds, as and when
due at maturity or upon prior
redemption, the Mayor, Director of
Finance and Director of Public Utilities, or any two of them, are authorized and directed, in the name and
on behalf of the City, to sign and
deliver a Defeasance Agreement
approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, providing
for the establishment of the Defeasance Fund as a trust fund in the
custody of the Trustee and the
investment, dedication and application of the moneys deposited therein and further providing for the payment to the Trustee of fees and
expenses for its performance of its
duties under the Defeasance Agreement.
The
officers
signing
the
Defeasance Agreement on behalf of
the City shall determine that the
Defeasance Agreement satisfies the
requirements of this Section, and
that determination shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the Defeasance Agreement by those
officers. The Mayor, Director of
Finance and Director of Public Utilities, or any two of them, are authorized, in the name and on behalf of
the City, to sign and deliver agreements, approved as to form and correctness by the Director of Law,
with
one
or
more
institutions,
including agreements which will
enable the City to more efficiently
structure the Defeasance Fund, and
thereby maximize debt service savings and minimize negative arbitrage. The Director of Finance is
authorized and directed to take such
other actions as may be necessary
or appropriate to accomplish the
defeasance of the Defeased Bonds,
including without limitation, the
retention of a firm of independent
certified public accountants to verify that the securities to be deposited in the Defeasance Fund are of
such maturities or redemption dates,
and interest payment dates, and
bear such interest, as will be sufficient, together with any available
moneys in the Defeasance Fund, for
the payment of debt service on the
Defeased Bonds.
Section 9. Interest Hedge Agreements. This Council finds that by
engaging in interest hedge transactions, from time to time, the City
can, in effect, convert interest on all
or a portion of the 2002 Bonds from
a fixed rate to a floating rate, or
from a floating rate to a fixed rate,
and thereby may reduce its cost of
borrowing by optimizing the relative amounts of fixed and floating
rate obligations and minimizing the
risk of variations in its debt service
costs. To permit the City to have the
flexibility to undertake interest rate
swap, swaption, rate cap, rate collar
and
other
hedging
transactions,
from time to time, and to establish
the procedures for approving those
transactions, this Council authorizes
the execution and delivery of one or

The City Record
more hedge agreements (each, a
“Hedge Agreement”) and any related agreements necessary for the
consummation of the transactions
contemplated by each Hedge Agreement.
Upon the written recommendation
of a Financial Advisor to the Director of Finance that an interest rate
hedge transaction be undertaken by
the City, the Director of Finance
may authorize one or more interest
rate hedge transactions in accordance with the applicable Hedge
Agreement; provided that (a) the
maximum
aggregate
notional
amount of interest rate hedge transactions outstanding at any one time,
net of offsetting interest rate hedge
transactions, shall not exceed such
amount as will result in a lowering
of the ratings assigned to the Bonds
by the rating agencies, as is evidenced by written correspondence
from the rating agencies or policies
published in writing by the rating
agencies, and (b) the term of each
interest rate swap transaction shall
not exceed 30 years. The approval
of each interest rate hedge transaction by the Director of Finance shall
be conclusively evidenced by the
signing and delivery of the applicable Hedge Agreement by the Director of Finance.
The City’s payment obligations
under each Hedge Agreement shall
be payable from the Net Revenues
of the Waterworks System and may
be secured by a pledge of the Net
Revenues on a parity with the
pledge given under the Indenture
to secure Bonds, subject to the
requirements of Article XI of the
Indenture with respect to Parity
Obligations. The obligation of the
City to make payments under a
Hedge Agreement does not and
shall not represent or constitute a
general obligation, debt, bonded
indebtedness or a pledge of the
faith and credit of the City. Nothing shall give any party to a
Hedge Agreement the right to have
excises, ad valorem or other taxes
levied by the City or the State for
the payment of any amounts due
under a Hedge Agreement.
Section 10. Covenants of the City.
The City, by issuance of the 2002
Bonds, covenants and agrees with
the Holders of the 2002 Bonds, that:
(a) The City will use the proceeds
of the 2002 Bonds to pay costs of
improvements to the Waterworks
System, to refinance any Refunded
Bonds, to fund any required deposit
to the Debt Service Reserve Fund, if
and to the extent set forth in the
Certificate of Award, to pay interest
on the 2002 Bonds during construction of the improvements financed
by the 2002 Bonds, and to pay costs
relating to the issuance of the 2002
Bonds.
(b) The Clerk, or other appropriate officer of the City, will furnish
to the Original Purchasers and to
the Trustee a true transcript of proceedings, certified by the Clerk or
other officer, of all proceedings had
with reference to the issuance of the
2002 Bonds, together with information from the City’s records as is
necessary to determine the regularity and validity of the issuance of
the 2002 Bonds.

1746

July 31, 2002
(c) The City will, at any and all
times, cause to be done all such further acts and things and cause to be
signed and delivered all further
instruments as may be necessary to
carry out the purpose of the 2002
Bonds and this Ordinance or as may
be required by Section 13, Article
XVIII of the Constitution of Ohio or
the Charter of the City or the Indenture or the applicable Supplemental
Indenture and will comply with all
requirements of law applicable to
the Waterworks System and the
operation thereof.
(d) The City will observe and perform all its agreements and obligations provided for in the 2002 Bonds,
this Ordinance, the Indenture and
each Supplemental Indenture. All of
the obligations under this Ordinance
and the Indenture and each Supplemental Indenture are hereby established
as
duties
specifically
enjoined by law and resulting from
an office, trust or station upon the
City within the meaning of Section
2731.01, Ohio Revised Code.
(e) The City will use, and will
restrict the use and investment of,
the proceeds of the 2002 Bonds in
such manner and to such extent as
may be necessary so that (a) the
2002 Bonds will not (i) constitute
private activity bonds, arbitrage
bonds or hedge bonds under Sections
141, 148 or 149 of the Code or (ii) be
treated other than as bonds to which
Section 103(a) of the Code applies,
and (b) the interest thereon will not
be treated as an item of tax preference under Section 57 of the Code.
(f) The City covenants that (a) it
will take or cause to be taken such
actions that may be required of it
for the interest on the 2002 Bonds to
be and to remain excluded from
gross income for federal income tax
purposes, (b) it will not take or
authorize to be taken any actions
that would adversely affect that
exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting for it, will, among other acts of
compliance, (i) apply the proceeds
of the 2002 Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing,
(ii) restrict the yield on investment
property acquired with those proceeds, (iii) make timely rebate payments to the federal government,
(iv) maintain books and records and
make calculations and reports, and
(v) refrain from certain uses of proceeds, and, as applicable, of property financed with such proceeds, all
in such manner and to the extent
necessary to assure such exclusion
of that interest under the Code.
Each covenant made in this section with respect to the 2002 Bonds
is also made with respect to all
issues for which any portion of the
debt service is paid from proceeds
of the 2002 Bonds (and, if different,
the original issue and any refunding issues in a series of refundings),
to the extent such compliance is necessary to assure exclusion of interest on the 2002 Bonds from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, and the Director of Finance,
or any other officer having responsibility with respect to the 2002
Bonds, is authorized to take such
actions with respect to those issues
as they are authorized in this section to take with respect to the 2002
Bonds.

July 31, 2002
The
Mayor,
the
Director
of
Finance or any other officer of the
City having responsibility for the
issuance of the 2002 Bonds is authorized (a) to make or effect any election, selection, designation, choice,
consent, approval or waiver on
behalf of the City with respect to
the 2002 Bonds as the City is permitted or required to make or give
under the federal income tax laws,
including, without limitation, any of
the elections available under Section
148 of the Code, for the purpose of
assuring, enhancing or protecting
the favorable tax treatment or status of the 2002 Bonds or interest
thereon
or
assisting
compliance
with requirements for that purpose,
reducing the burden or expense of
compliance,
reducing
the
rebate
amount or payments or penalties, or
making
payments
of
special
amounts in lieu of making computations to determine, or paying,
excess earnings as rebate, or obviating those amount or payments, as
determined by that officer, (b) to
take any and all other actions, make
or obtain calculations, make payments, and make or give reports,
covenants and certifications of and
on behalf of the City, as may be
appropriate to assure the exclusion
of interest from gross income and
the intended tax status of the 2002
