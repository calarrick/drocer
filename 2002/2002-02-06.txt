make a written contract with said
Jim Petro, Auditor of State to conduct a performance audit of the

By Councilman Dolan.
An emergency ordinance to amend
Sections 611.01 and 611.02 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio,
1976, as amended by Ordinance No.
90-96, passed March 18, 1996, relating
to gambling.
Whereas, Ohio law and the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland permit schemes of chance,
including instant bingo tickets, pulltab tickets and break open tickets,
to be conducted by charitable organizations that have a 501(c)(3) permit from the Internal Revenue Service; and
Whereas, instant bingo tickets,
pull-tab tickets and break open tickets are often illegally sold by organizations and entities that are not
considered charitable organizations
by the Internal Revenue Service;
and
Whereas, this Council finds that
the illegal sale of instant bingo tickets, pull-tab tickets and break open
tickets are diverting money from
charitable organizations and that
requiring such sales to occur on
premises owned by a charitable
organization will limit the illegal
sale of instant bingo tickets, pulltab tickets and break open tickets;
and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the peace, property, health or
safety in that it is necessary to prohibit schemes of chance by organizations that are not charitable organizations; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Sections 611.01 and

90-96, passed March 18, 1996, are

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 191-02.
By Councilmen Cintron, Brady and
Jones.
An emergency resolution urging the
prompt passage of Ohio House Bill
290 and Ohio Senate Bill 127, the Ohio
Prescription Drug Fair Pricing Act.
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland has supported, by passage of numerous resolutions, the
right to affordable, accessible health
care and the ability to secure prescription medication at reasonable
prices; and
Whereas, it is estimated that one
of four Americans, including 2.2 million Ohioans, have no prescription
drug coverage; and
Whereas, prescription drug prices
are rising twice as fast as the rate
of inflation; and
Whereas,
individual
Americans
pay 30% to 70% more than Canadians and Mexicans for the same prescriptions and about twice what the
federal government pays for the
same drugs under the Federal Supply Schedule; and
Whereas, U.S. prescription drug
spending rose nearly 17% in 1999,
some $99.6 billion, and it is predicted that spending on pharmaceuticals
will increase about 12.6% annually
until 2010; and
Whereas, the pharmaceutical industry is the most profitable industry in the world, making profits of
18.3% compared to an average profit of 5% for other industries; and
Whereas, Ohio House Bill 290 and
Ohio Senate Bill 127, the Prescription
Drug Fair Pricing Act, would provide a prescription drug card to all
Ohioans who do not have prescription drug coverage or are grossly
underinsured, giving the State the
authority to negotiate substantial
rebates from drug companies and
discounts from drug retailers and to
pass those discounts to program participants, with the State paying
administrative and other costs out of
the negotiated rebates, thus incurring no cost to taxpayers; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public safety, welfare and
health; now therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland supports the Prescription Drug Fair Pricing Act and
urges the prompt passage of Ohio
House Bill 290 and Ohio Senate Bill
127.

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
____________
Res. No. 153-02.
By Councilman Brady.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio General Assembly to adopt
“Ohio Care,” a publicly funded, notfor-profit health insurance program.
Whereas, by passage of numerous
resolutions and ordinances and by
its efforts to keep St. Michael Hospital operational, this Council of the
City of Cleveland has stated that
every person residing or employed
in Ohio is entitled, as a matter of
right, to accessible, affordable and
quality health care; and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
that there is a growing crisis in
health care in the State of Ohio manifested by massive layoffs, a steep
increase in premiums, co-payments
and deductibles, and the closing of
many health care facilities serving
low-to-middle income residents; and
Whereas, insured persons now
commonly experience unacceptable
and
sometimes
life-threatening
delays in obtaining approval for
needed health care services by private, for-profit health insurers; and
Whereas, it is estimated that the
complexity and redundant bureaucracy arising from the existence of
multiple, for-profit insurance plans,
each with its own distinct program
of coverage and benefits, its own
costly administrative and executive
structure, and its own system of processing managed care approvals,
and payments of benefits and/or
reimbursements, wastes up to 30%
of premiums paid for medical coverage by Ohio employers and private citizens, resources which otherwise could be used to provide
benefits; and
Whereas, the bureaucratic structure and its inefficiencies distract
health care providers from providing efficient and effective medical
services to patients and places a
drain on the financial resources of
Ohio taxpayers; and
Whereas, this Council contends
that a single-payer, publicly-funded, not-for-profit health plan will:
eliminate the redundant bureaucracy caused by numerous insurers; greatly reduce administrative
costs associated with providing
medical care; free-up additional
financial resources; allow medical
providers to focus their efforts on
providing quality care; and reduce
the cost of health care coverage
for Ohio residents and employers;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public health; now therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges the Ohio
General Assembly to commit to
enact “Ohio Care,” a comprehensive,
publicly funded, not-for-profit health
insurance program covering: (a) all
residents of the State of Ohio as
well as all dependents of Ohio residents, whether residing within the
state or elsewhere; and (b) all persons employed in the state, regardless of residence within or outside
of the state, as well as their dependents.

134

February 6, 2002
Section 2. That this Council urges
the prompt passage of “Ohio Care”
so that upon its effective date:
i. Health insurance will be provided to all persons employed in the
state and their dependents by or
through their non-federal public and
private
employers,
including
all
health insurance previously provided by the State government to its
employees, thereby relieving Ohio
employers of the cost and administrative burden of providing health
insurance coverage; and
ii. Every person will be covered
by one uniform program of health
insurance benefits, including prescription drug coverage, dental care,
vision care, long-term care and coverage for mental illness on full parity with coverages for all other
types of illnesses; and
iii. An Ohio Care Commission will
be
created,
as
an
independent
agency of state government, to
implement and administer the Ohio
Care program; and
iv. The Ohio Care benefit program
will be designed and maintained so
as to guarantee health care services
of excellent quality, timely delivered and accessible to all; full support for ongoing medical research,
medical education and training; full
choice of providers; and access to
comprehensive, preventive and longterm care; and
v. All federal funds allocated for
health care purposes by Medicare,
Medicaid, Veterans Administration,
and other programs will be paid to
Ohio Care, after obtaining the necessary waivers from the federal government; and
vi. Any person who while covered
by Ohio Care requires health care
services anywhere in the world will
be entitled to Ohio Care benefits to
pay for such services to the extent
payment has not otherwise been provided; and
vii. Any resident displaced from
employment by the private health
insurance industry in this state as
a direct result of the enactment of
Ohio
Care
will
be
eligible
to
receive, at state expense, retraining
and temporary financial assistance
to facilitate reemployment without
significant loss of income, and will
receive preference for hiring for
employment by the Ohio Care Commission in any position for which
the displaced resident is qualified;
and
viii. Ohio Care will be funded by
utilizing federal, state and local
monies that currently are used to
fund existing Ohio health care programs, and any additional funding
mechanism deemed necessary to
ensure that Ohio Care is fully funded with adequate reserves.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to forward a
copy of this resolution to the members of the Cleveland area delegation of the Ohio General Assembly.

An emergency resolution urging
the
United
States
Congress
to
review and modify federal tax laws
applicable to large multi-million dollar corporations.
Whereas, the recent collapse of
Enron Corporation has illustrated a
number of loopholes and inequities
that exist in our legal system that
have served to benefit corporate
giants in America; and
Whereas, it has been reported that
Enron has paid no federal corporate
income taxes in four of the last five
years, and instead received $382 million in tax refunds; and
Whereas, the hard working citizens of Cleveland and throughout
the country dutifully pay federal
income tax to support our country’s
defense, building and maintenance
of our infrastructure and social programs; and

28
Whereas, this Council finds such
legal loopholes appalling as they
require ordinary, hard working citizens to subsidize corporate tycoons
who seek to shirk their civic responsibility; and
Whereas, this Council urges Congress to examine existing laws that
permit such practices to occur and
requests
that
Congress
consider
such measures as to close these tax
loopholes; and

health; now therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

City of Cleveland urges the U.S. Congress to examine the existing tax
laws for the purpose of identifying
loopholes that allow large multi-million dollar corporations to forego
paying federal corporate income
taxes and to enact laws that would
tighten such tax laws.

copy of this resolution to Senators
Voinovich and DeWine and Representatives
