By Council Members Coats, Jackson, Conwell and Pierce-Scott.
An emergency resolution urging
the federal government to provide
adequate funding to regional political subdivisions and local governments to enable these entities to
comply with the combined sewer
overflow mandates established by
the federal government.
Whereas, the federal government
and the United States Environmental Protection Agency have enacted
laws and regulations that mandate
regional political subdivisions and
local governments to address combined sewer overflow issues;
Whereas, this mandate is not coupled with funding necessary to ensure compliance with the combined
sewer overflow requirements established by the federal government; and
Whereas, many regional political
subdivisions and local governments
are struggling to provide basic services in this challenging economic
time; and
Whereas, many regional political
subdivisions and local governments
are forced to consider utility rate
increases in order to fund the federal government’s combined sewer
overflow mandates; and
Whereas, proposed utility rate
increases, in many instances, exceed
the rate of inflation; and
Whereas, such rate increases, if
approved, would place an unreasonable burden on consumers of utility
services; and
Whereas, it is the opinion of this
Council that the federal government
should provide funding necessary
for regional political subdivisions
and local governments to comply
with the combined sewer overflow
mandates established by the federal
government; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the federal government to provide

Whereas,
the

Ohio
Regional Sewer District (“NEORSD”)
is commencing a $1.2 billion improvement to the storm water management
system in Cuyahoga County; and
Whereas, the NEORSD has proposed to significantly raise the
sewer rates of the citizens of Cleveland in order to pay for this
improvement; and
Whereas,
in
the
absence
of
increased federal funding under the
Clean Water Act to defray a portion
of the cost of these improvements,
the sewer ratepayers least able to
pay increased sewer use costs will
be asked to pay a significant rate
increase; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
President Bush, the U.S. Senate and

is considering rate increases for all

The City Record
in year 2004, 7.3% in 2005, and 7.2%
in 2006; and
Whereas, if this proposed rate
