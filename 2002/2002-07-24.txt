Article XVIII of the Constitution of

referred to as the Waterworks System; (b) to make, from time to time,
improvements to the Waterworks
System; (c) to borrow money for the

finance the costs of improvements to
the Waterworks System and to
refund certain Outstanding Bonds in
order to reduce the total principal
and interest payable on the Outstanding Bonds; and
Whereas, this Ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the immediate preservation of public
property, health and safety, and for
the further reason that this Ordinance
is required to be immediately effective to permit the issuance and sale
of the 2002 Bonds to fund contracts
for the improvement of, and to obtain
debt service savings for the benefit
of, the Waterworks System and thereby provide for the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now,

Section 2. Authorization of the
2002 Bonds. This Council finds and
determines it is necessary and proper and in the best interest of the
City to issue the 2002 Bonds for the
purpose of paying costs of improvements to the Waterworks System
and refunding the Refunded Bonds.
The 2002 Bonds may be issued in
one or more Series. The principal
amount of each Series of 2002 Bonds
is to be the amount set forth in the
Certificate of Award authorized in
Section 3. The aggregate principal
amount of 2002 Bonds of all Series
issued for the purpose of paying
costs of improvements shall not
exceed $235,000,000. The aggregate
principal amount of 2002 Bonds
issued for the purpose of refunding
the
Refunded
Bonds
shall
not
exceed $50,000,000 and shall be the
amount determined by the Director
of Finance, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
necessary to refund the Refunded
Bonds and to obtain aggregate net
present value debt service savings
with respect to the Refunded Bonds
of not less than three percent (3%).
The proceeds from the sale of each
Series of 2002 Bonds shall be allocated, deposited and applied as provided in Section 4 of this Ordinance.
The 2002 Bonds may be issued in
one or more separate Series, each
bearing a distinctive designation,

1609

5
provided that the 2002 Bonds of each
Series satisfy the requirements of
this Ordinance. Separate Series of
2002 Bonds may be issued at the
same or different times. The 2002
Bonds of each Series shall be designated as provided in the applicable Certificate of Award. A separate
Certificate of Award and a separate
Supplemental
Indenture
may
be
delivered for each Series.
In the event that the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, determines that the City’s best interests
will be served by causing a Series
of 2002 Bonds to be obligations
bearing interest at variable interest
rates, then the Director of Finance
is authorized to so specify in the
Certificate of Award for that Series.
If the Director of Finance so determines, then the method and procedure by which the variable rate of
interest to be borne by the 2002
Bonds of that Series shall be determined as provided in the applicable
Supplemental Indenture, whether by
auction, by reference to a market
index, by a remarketing agent or
otherwise; provided that no Series
of 2002 Bonds shall bear interest at
a rate in excess of sixteen percent
(16%) per year. Notwithstanding
that limitation, a Series of 2002
Bonds held by a provider of a Credit Support Instrument may bear
interest at a rate not in excess of
twenty-five percent (25%) per year
as provided in the agreement with
the provider of the Credit Support
Instrument. The Director of Finance
may determine that the terms of a
variable rate Series of 2002 Bonds
may or may not permit the Holders
to tender their variable rate 2002
Bonds for purchase by the City. If
the Director of Finance designates
any Series of 2002 Bonds as variable
rate 2002 Bonds, and if the Holders
of that Series of 2002 Bonds are to
be entitled to tender those 2002
Bonds for purchase, then the Director of Finance shall also designate
in the Certificate of Award for
those variable rate 2002 Bonds, the
tender agent or agents and the
remarketing agent or agents, which
designations shall be based on the
determination of the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience
to
provide
the
services
required of them and that the terms
on which the designated parties
have agreed to provide such services are fair and commercially reasonable. The Director of Finance is
authorized to enter into agreements
in connection with the delivery of
the 2002 Bonds, and from time to
time thereafter so long as the 2002
Bonds
are
outstanding,
with
providers of Credit Support Instruments, tender agents (which may be
the Trustee), remarketing agents
(which may be any of the Original
Purchasers) and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the method of
determining the variable interest
rates, permitting holders the right
of tender and providing for payment
of the purchase price of, or debt service on, the variable rate 2002
Bonds. In the event the variable
rate 2002 Bonds are issued as auc-

6
tion rate obligations, the Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements with auction agents and
others, or to cause the Trustee to
enter into those agreements, based
on the written advice of a Financial
Advisor that the parties so designated
possess
the
requisite
resources and experience to provide
the services required of them and
that the terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide such services are fair and commercially reasonable.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of
any Series of 2002 Bonds, and
regardless of whether that Series of
2002 Bonds bears interest at variable or fixed rates, is authorized to
contract for a Credit Support Instrument, and to pay the costs of it from
proceeds of the 2002 Bonds, if he
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the Credit Support Instrument will
result in a savings in the cost of the
financing to the City.
The Refunded Bonds shall be designated by the Director of Finance
in the Certificate of Award and
shall consist of those Outstanding
Bonds that can be refunded (and
thereby deemed no longer Outstanding for purposes of the Indenture)
with the proceeds of the 2002 Bonds,
the refunding of which Outstanding
Bonds will enable the City, in the
judgment of the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, to obtain net present value debt service savings with
respect to the Bonds so refunded.
The Refunded Bonds shall be called
for redemption or retired on the date
or dates specified in the Certificate
of Award. The redemption dates so
specified shall be the dates required
under the Code for compliance with
Section 149(d) of the Code and other
applicable federal tax laws. The
Director of Finance shall notify
each City Council Member when an
option for refinancing is exercised
and shall explain why the option
was
exercised
and
the
benefit
derived from exercising the option.
Section 3. Sale of 2002 Bonds. The
2002 Bonds shall be sold to the
Original Purchasers pursuant to
one or more Bond Purchase Agreements substantially in the form of
the Bond Purchase Agreement now
on file with the Clerk in the File
referenced in Section 1 with such
changes not inconsistent with the
Indenture or this Ordinance and not
substantially adverse to the City as
may be approved by the officer
signing the Bond Purchase Agreement on behalf of the City. The
approval of any changes by that
officer and the determination by
that officer that the change is not
substantially adverse to the City
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing and delivery of the
Bond Purchase Agreement by that
officer. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver the Certificate of Award and Bond Purchase
Agreement for the 2002 Bonds of
each Series, one or more of which
shall specify and set forth the following details with respect to the
2002 Bonds:
(a)

to
2002
Bonds
issued
to
fund
improvements to the Waterworks
System or $50,000,000 with respect to
2002 Bonds issued to refund the
Refunded Bonds, assuming that the
2002 Bonds are to be initially
offered to the public at a price at
least equal to their aggregate principal amount, but, if any of the 2002
Bonds are to be initially offered to
the public at an original issue discount, the maximum aggregate principal amount of 2002 Bonds shall be
increased over that amount by an
amount equal to the aggregate original issue discount net of the aggregate original issue premium;
(b) the date or dates of the 2002
Bonds;
(c) the purchase price to be paid
to the City by the Original Purchasers, which amount shall be not
less than: (i) 97% of the amount
determined by subtracting from the
aggregate principal amount of the
2002 Bonds any aggregate original
issue discount net of any aggregate
original issue premium with respect
to the 2002 Bonds, plus (ii) any
accrued interest on the 2002 Bonds
from their date to the date of their
delivery to the Original Purchasers;
(d) whether any 2002 Bonds are
subject to optional redemption prior
to maturity, the earliest optional
redemption
date
for
those
2002
Bonds subject to prior redemption,
which shall be not later than ten
years from the first interest payment date of the applicable Series,
and the applicable redemption price,
which shall be not greater than
102%
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed;
(e) the dates on which principal
of the 2002 Bonds is to be paid,
which shall be not later than January 1, 2033, with an identification of
whether the payment is due by stated maturity or by mandatory sinking fund redemption of 2002 Bonds
of a particular maturity;
(f) the interest rates to be borne
by 2002 Bonds bearing interest at a
fixed rate, which shall not exceed
seven percent (7%) as to 2002 Bonds
of any maturity, and the method by
which the interest rate is to be
determined for 2002 Bonds bearing
interest at variable rates, consistent
with Section 2. The 2002 Bonds of
the same Series and same maturity
may bear interest at different interest rates;
(g) the particular Outstanding
Bonds or portions thereof to be
Refunded Bonds;
(h) any deposit required to be
made to the Debt Service Reserve
Fund; and
(i) the title and Series designation
for the Bonds.
It is determined that the terms of
the 2002 Bonds as so determined
within the limitations set forth in
this Ordinance and as so specified
and set forth in the Certificate of
Award will be in the best interest
of the City and consistent with all
legal requirements.
Section 4. Application of Proceeds

sale of the 2002 Bonds shall be
deposited as follows:
(a) to the Trustee, for deposit to
the credit of the Interest Account in

Bonds.
Calculations
of
excess earnings that may be due
and payable to the federal government pursuant to the Code and
deposits to those accounts of the
Rebate Fund shall be made as provided in the applicable Supplemental Indenture.
Section 8. Defeasance of Outstanding Bonds. In the event that
any Outstanding Bonds are to be
defeased, the Defeased Bonds shall
be designated by the City in the
Defeasance Agreement and shall
consist of Outstanding Bonds the
defeasance of which will enable the
City, in the judgment of the officer
or officers signing the Defeasance
Agreement, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to
improve the debt service coverage
ratio of the Water System (being
the ratio of Net Revenues to Annu-

1611

7
al Debt Service Requirements, as
defined
in
the
Indenture).
The
Director of Finance is authorized to
deposit into the Defeasance Fund,
from moneys transferred to the
Defeasance Fund from Fund No. 52001 of the Water Division, an
amount not to exceed $30,000,000,

approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, providing

expenses for its performance of its
duties under the Defeasance Agreement.
The
officers
signing
the
Defeasance Agreement on behalf of
the City shall determine that the
Defeasance Agreement satisfies the
requirements of this Section, and
that determination shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the Defeasance Agreement by those
officers. The Mayor, Director of
Finance and Director of Public Utilities, or any two of them, are authorized, in the name and on behalf of
the City, to sign and deliver agreements, approved as to form and correctness by the Director of Law,
with
one
or
more
institutions,
including agreements which will
enable the City to more efficiently
structure the Defeasance Fund, and
thereby maximize debt service savings and minimize negative arbitrage. The Director of Finance is
authorized and directed to take such
other actions as may be necessary
or appropriate to accomplish the
defeasance of the Defeased Bonds,
including without limitation, the
retention of a firm of independent
certified public accountants to verify that the securities to be deposited in the Defeasance Fund are of
such maturities or redemption dates,
and interest payment dates, and
bear such interest, as will be sufficient, together with any available
moneys in the Defeasance Fund, for
the payment of debt service on the
Defeased Bonds.
Section 9. Interest Hedge Agreements. This Council finds that by
engaging in interest hedge transactions, from time to time, the City
can, in effect, convert interest on all
or a portion of the 2002 Bonds from
a fixed rate to a floating rate, or
from a floating rate to a fixed rate,
and thereby may reduce its cost of
borrowing by optimizing the rela-

8
tive amounts of fixed and floating
rate obligations and minimizing the
risk of variations in its debt service
costs. To permit the City to have the
flexibility to undertake interest rate
swap, swaption, rate cap, rate collar
and
other
hedging
transactions,
from time to time, and to establish
the procedures for approving those
transactions, this Council authorizes
the execution and delivery of one or
more hedge agreements (each, a
“Hedge Agreement”) and any related agreements necessary for the
consummation of the transactions
contemplated by each Hedge Agreement.
Upon the written recommendation
of a Financial Advisor to the Director of Finance that an interest rate
hedge transaction be undertaken by
the City, the Director of Finance
may authorize one or more interest
rate hedge transactions in accordance with the applicable Hedge
Agreement; provided that (a) the
maximum
aggregate
notional
amount of interest rate hedge transactions outstanding at any one time,
net of offsetting interest rate hedge
transactions, shall not exceed such
amount as will result in a lowering
of the ratings assigned to the Bonds
by the rating agencies, as is evidenced by written correspondence
from the rating agencies or policies
published in writing by the rating
agencies, and (b) the term of each
interest rate swap transaction shall
not exceed 30 years. The approval
of each interest rate hedge transaction by the Director of Finance shall
be conclusively evidenced by the
signing and delivery of the applicable Hedge Agreement by the Director of Finance.
The City’s payment obligations
under each Hedge Agreement shall
be payable from the Net Revenues
of the Waterworks System and may
be secured by a pledge of the Net
Revenues on a parity with the
pledge given under the Indenture to
secure Bonds, subject to the requirements of Article XI of the Indenture
with respect to Parity Obligations.
The obligation of the City to make
payments under a Hedge Agreement
does not and shall not represent or
constitute a general obligation, debt,
bonded indebtedness or a pledge of
the faith and credit of the City.
Nothing shall give any party to a
Hedge Agreement the right to have
excises, ad valorem or other taxes
levied by the City or the State for
the payment of any amounts due
under a Hedge Agreement .
Section 10. Covenants of the City.
The City, by issuance of the 2002
Bonds, covenants and agrees with
the Holders of the 2002 Bonds, that:
(a) The City will use the proceeds
of the 2002 Bonds to pay costs of
improvements to the Waterworks
System, to refinance any Refunded
Bonds, to fund any required deposit
to the Debt Service Reserve Fund, if
and to the extent set forth in the
Certificate of Award, to pay interest
on the 2002 Bonds during construction of the improvements financed
by the 2002 Bonds, and to pay costs
relating to the issuance of the 2002
Bonds.
(b) The Clerk, or other appropriate officer of the City, will furnish
to the Original Purchasers and to
the Trustee a true transcript of pro-

The City Record
ceedings, certified by the Clerk or
other officer, of all proceedings had
with reference to the issuance of the
2002 Bonds, together with information from the City’s records as is
necessary to determine the regularity and validity of the issuance of
the 2002 Bonds.
(c) The City will, at any and all
times, cause to be done all such further acts and things and cause to be
signed and delivered all further
instruments as may be necessary to
carry out the purpose of the 2002
Bonds and this Ordinance or as may
be required by Section 13, Article
XVIII of the Constitution of Ohio or
the Charter of the City or the Indenture or the applicable Supplemental
Indenture and will comply with all
requirements of law applicable to
the Waterworks System and the
operation thereof.
(d) The City will observe and perform all its agreements and obligations provided for in the 2002 Bonds,
this Ordinance, the Indenture and
each Supplemental Indenture. All of
the obligations under this Ordinance
and the Indenture and each Supplemental Indenture are hereby established
as
duties
specifically
enjoined by law and resulting from
an office, trust or station upon the
City within the meaning of Section
2731.01, Ohio Revised Code.
(e) The City will use, and will
restrict the use and investment of,
the proceeds of the 2002 Bonds in
such manner and to such extent as
may be necessary so that (a) the
2002 Bonds will not (i) constitute
private activity bonds, arbitrage
bonds or hedge bonds under Sections
141, 148 or 149 of the Code or (ii) be
treated other than as bonds to which

from the curb edge of the roadway.
(b) Installation; Removal. Newspaper dispensing devices shall be
anchored to the sidewalk by a
method approved by the Director of
Public Service and shall not be

sides of the device.
(e) Within six (6) months after
the effective date of this division,
the City Planning Commission shall
create a special district for newspaper dispensing devices on Public

thereon. The Commissioner’s resolution effecting the creation of such
district shall specify the design or
designs of newspaper dispensing
devices within the district and the
locations within the district upon
which newspaper dispensing devices
may be located, notwithstanding
any other provisions of this section
to the contrary. In determining the
specific locations of newspaper dispensing devices within the district,
the City Planning Commission shall
apply standards that are no more
restrictive, and may be less restrictive, than the provisions of division
(a) of this section. For six (6)
months after the effective date of
this division, the provisions of this
section shall apply to all newspaper
dispensing devices on Public Square.
For purposes of this division, “Public Square” means the four (4) quadrants of Public Square and the sidewalks on either side of the roadways that bound and that intersect
said quadrants.
(f) (1) Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in division
(a)(2)B., (a)(6)B., (c)(1), (c)(2) or
(c)(7) of this section, newspaper
dispensing devices may be installed,
placed,
and
maintained
directly
adjacent to and flush against that
side of a public bus shelter which
is perpendicular to the curb edge of
the roadway and furthest forward in
the direction of traffic on the street
(the “downstream side”); provided,
however, that if more than one
owner desires to install a device at
any one public bus shelter, only multiple-dispensing-device
modular
units may be installed, placed, and
maintained at such location. No modular unit shall be installed unless
and until the City Planning Commission has approved the design
thereof. Where more than one newspaper dispensing device is located
in the vicinity of the downstream
side of a public bus shelter as of
January 1, 1991, said devices may be
moved adjacent to the downstream
side of the shelter until such time
as the City Planning Commission
approves the design of a modular
unit
for
that
location.
Owners
installing modular units shall be
responsible for their maintenance
and shall purchase such units on
terms and conditions upon which
said owners mutually agree. Newspaper dispensing devices or modular
units
installed
and
maintained
directly adjacent to the downstream

1617

13
side or public bus shelters may be
placed so that the front of the
device is perpendicular to or at an
angle to the roadway; so long as
such device or modular unit is
placed adjacent to the downstream
side of the shelter.
(2) If a bus company presents to
the City Planning Commission a bus
shelter design which incorporates
newspaper dispensing devices or a
modular frame therefor into the bus
shelter, and if the City Planning
Commission approves said design,
the following shall not apply to any
newspaper dispensing device which
is incorporated into any such bus
shelter or inserted into any such
modular frame, provided that the
bus shelter is installed pursuant to
a permit duly issued by the City:
A. the weight requirements contained in division (d)(2) of Section
680.03;
B. the distance requirements contained
in
divisions
(a)(2)B.,
(a)(6)B., and (a)(12) of this section;

in
divisions
(c)(1),
(c)(2),and (c)(7) of this section.

section, if a newspaper dispensing
device is in place on a concrete pad
at a public bus stop or public bus
shelter in a One-, Two-, or MultiFamily District as of January 1,
1991, and if said device would otherwise not be permitted to remain at
such location because the concrete
pad is of insufficient size to accommodate the placement of such device
in accordance with the provisions of
divisions (a)(2)A. or (a)(2)B. of
this section, said device may remain
at the location it occupied as of January 1, 1991 until such time as the
concrete pad underlying such public
stop or public bus shelter is extended by the bus company and the pad
is of sufficient size to accommodate
the placement of such device. Any
newspaper dispensing device that is
permitted to remain at a public bus
stop or public bus shelter as a result
of the provisions of this division
shall be removed by its owner if a
public bus company installs a shelter on the concrete pad underlying
a public bus stop or enlarges an
existing shelter unless:
(1) the bus company enlarges the
concrete pad underlying the public
bus stop or bus shelter sufficiently
to accommodate placement of the
device in accordance with division
(a)(2)A. or (a)(2)B. of this section;
or
(2) the owner of the device
extends the bus company’s concrete
pad sufficiently to accommodate
placement of the device in accordance with division (a)(2)A. or
(a)(2)B. of this section. In the event
that the owner installs such an
extension:
A. the owner shall be responsible
for maintaining the extension of the
concrete pad; and
B. if the owner removes the
device, the owner shall promptly:
1. remove the extension of the concrete pad and restore the property
underlying said extension to its con-

14
dition prior to the installation of the
extension; or
2. transfer its interest in the
extension of the concrete pad to
another owner on terms and conditions upon which the two owners
mutually agree; or
3. transfer its interest in the
extension of the concrete pad to the
public bus company on terms and
conditions upon which the owner
and the public bus company mutually agree;
provided that the Directors of
Public Service and City Planning
may, in their sole discretion, permit
such concrete pad to remain in
place, absent a transfer of interest
pursuant to paragraph (2)B.2. or
(2)B.3. of this division, upon such
terms and conditions as said Directors mutually agree.
(h) Subject to the provisions of
the following sentences in this division and notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in divisions (a)(6) or (a)(12) of this section, if a newspaper dispensing
device is in place on a concrete pad
at a public bus stop or public bus
shelter outside of the Central Business District as of January 1, 1991,
and if such device would otherwise
not be permitted to remain in the
vicinity because a relocation of said
device in order to comply with the
distance requirements of this section
would result in the placement of
said device at a prohibited location,
said device may remain at the location it occupied as of January 1,
1991. Any newspaper dispensing
device that is permitted to remain
at a public bus stop or public bus
shelter as a result of the provisions
of this division shall be removed by
its owner if a public bus company
installs a shelter on the concrete
pad underlying a public bus stop or
enlarges an existing shelter unless:
(1) the bus company enlarges the
concrete pad underlying the public
bus stop or bus shelter sufficiently
to accommodate placement of the
device in accordance with division
(a)(2)A. or (a)(2)B. of this section;
or
(2) the owner of the device
extends the bus company’s concrete
pad sufficiently to accommodate
placement of the device in accordance with division (a)(2)A. or
(a)(2)B. of this section. In the event
that the owners installs such an
extension:
A. the owner shall be responsible
for maintaining the extension of the
concrete pad; and
B. if the owner removes the
device, the owner shall promptly:
1. remove the extension of the concrete pad and restore the property
underlying said extension to its condition prior to the installation of the
extension; or
2. transfer its interest in the
extension of the concrete pad to
another owner on terms and conditions upon which the two owners
mutually agree; or
3. transfer its interest in the
extension of the concrete pad to the
public bus company on terms conditions upon which the owners and
the public bus company mutually
agree; provided that the Directors of
Public Service and City Planning
may, in their sole discretion, permit

place, absent a transfer of interest
pursuant to paragraph (2)B.2. or
(2)B.3. of this division, upon such
terms and conditions as said Directors mutually agree.

and at least six inches (6") forward of a bus company sign which
is located on a utility pole as of
January 1, 1991, but that would not
be permitted to remain at such
location because of the requirements of division (a)(8) of this section, may remain at such location
until such time as the bus sign is
moved so as to allow sufficient
space for the newspaper dispensing
device to be located forward of the
sign without violating any provision of this section; and, other than
on Euclid Avenue, any newspaper
dispensing device that is in place
more than eight feet (8') back of
a bus company sign at a public bus
stop as of January 1, 1991 may

By Council Member Reed.
An emergency resolution urging
the Cleveland Board of Education
and the Board of the Cleveland
Regional
Transit
Authority
to
enforce their policies relative to
the prohibition of mobile phone use
by their drivers while operating
buses
Whereas, hundreds of children in
this City are transported to and
from school every day of the school
year by school bus and by buses
operated by the Cleveland Regional
Transit Authority; and
Whereas, the safety of those children while riding those buses is of
the utmost importance and should
be paramount to those who drive
those children to and from school;
and
Whereas, this Council believes
that the operation of a school bus
or bus owned by the Cleveland
Regional Transit Authority while
using a telephone may cause the
operator to maintain less than full
time and attention to the operation
of such vehicle, thus endangering
the school children riding in said
vehicle; and
Whereas,
both
the
Cleveland
Board of Education and the RTA
have policies prohibiting the use of
mobile telephones by drivers while
operating buses; and
Whereas, it is the intention of this
Council to investigate the possible
use of mobile telephones by drivers
while operating school buses or
buses owned by the RTA; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the Cleveland Board of
Education and the Board of the
Cleveland Regional Transit Authority to enforce their policies relative
to the prohibition of mobile phone
use by their drivers while operating
buses.

July 24, 2002
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to all members of the Cleveland Board of Education and the Board of the Cleveland Regional Transit Authority.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted July 17, 2002.
Effective July 23, 2002.

Res. No. 1431-02.
By Council Member Brady.
An emergency resolution objecting to the issuance of a New C1
Liquor Permit to 3945 West 130th
Street.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Department of Liquor
Control of an application for the
issuance of a New C1 Liquor Permit
to Yunes Oil & Sons, Inc., 3945 West
130th Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44111,
Permanent Number 9867628.
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
