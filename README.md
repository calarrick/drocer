Cleveland City Council's records are available as PDFs from 1996-present. 

As PDFs, there's many things that you cannot to do with them: 
search in multiple files at one time; easily extract data from them for further analysis; browse legislation by a particular topic; and more. 

In short, PDFs make it very difficult for programmers, journalists, researchers to use the data inside them.
