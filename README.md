City Council's records are available as PDFs from 1996-present. 

As PDFs, there's many things that you cannot to do with them: 
can't search in multiple files at one time; cannot easily extract data from them for further analysis. 

In short, PDFs make it very difficult for programmers or archivists to use the PDFs text. 

Our goals: 
Liberating Cleveland City Council's Legislative Records.
