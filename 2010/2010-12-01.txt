An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Public Utilities to
enter
into
an
agreement
with
American Municipal Power, Inc. for
the purchase of energy under a longterm purchase available to American
Municipal
Power
from
Morgan
Stanley Capital Group, Inc.
Whereas, the City owns and operates an electric utility system for the
sale of electric power and associated
energy for the benefit of its citizens
and taxpayers; and
Whereas, in order to satisfy the
electric energy requirements of its
electric utility system, the City has
heretofore purchased economical and
reliable electric capacity and energy
from American Municipal Power, Inc.
(“AMP”), of which the City is a
Member, or has heretofore purchased
electricity arranged by AMP; and
Whereas, the City, acting individually and, along with other municipalities which own and operate electric
utility systems, jointly through AMP,
endeavors to arrange for reliable, reasonably priced supplies of electric
capacity and energy for ultimate
delivery to its customers; and
Whereas, AMP and the City have
entered into a Master Services
Agreement (“MSA”), AMP Contract
No. C-11-2005-4520 pursuant to which
sets forth general terms and conditions under which, among other
things, AMP may sell and the City
may purchase electric capacity and
energy and other services through
Schedules to the MSA; and
Whereas, AMP and the City, as a
participant, also entered into a power
sales contract (AMP Contract No. C-72007-5752-R) regarding the American
Municipal Power Generating Station

8
Project (“AMPGS Project”) dated as
of November 1, 2007 (“AMPGS PSC”),
which was terminated as a coal fired
project by the AMPGS participants
and the AMP Board of Trustees on
November 24, 2009; and
Whereas, the AMPGS participants
and the AMP Board of Trustees determined to investigate the replacement
of the AMPGS coal project with,
among other possibilities, a natural
gas combined cycle project and power
purchases from the softened wholesale market and to present modifications to the AMPGS PSC as well as
other arrangements, to the AMPGS
participants therein to reflect those
changes; and
Whereas, as a part of those effects
the AMPGS participants and the AMP
Board of Trustees directed AMP to
secure a 100 MW block of purchased
energy for the period January 1, 2015
through December 31, 2020, on a “take
and pay” basis at favorable cost,
through arrangements with MSCGI,
for resale to Municipality and other
AMPGS participants and, potentially
other AMP members; and
Whereas, in furtherance thereof
AMP has negotiated an agreement
(“Purchased Energy Agreement”)
with Morgan Stanley Capital Group,
Inc. (“MSCGI”) for the purchase by
AMP of firm energy for resale to the
City and other AMP members who are
participants in the AMPGS Project or,
to the extent not fully subscribed to
AMPGS participants, also to other
AMP members, at favorable rates,
terms and conditions; and
Whereas, the City desires to replace
a portion of the energy that would
have been available from AMPGS,
had it been completed as a coal fired
project, from the Purchased Energy
Agreement through the AMPGS
Replacement Energy Schedule for
delivery to AMP at the AD Hub at
$62.95/MWh (“Basic Energy Charge”)
and then resold to the Municipality;
and
Whereas, AMP and MSCGI have
included provisions in the Purchased
Energy Agreement that contemplate
that AMP and MSCGI may negotiate
and agree to amendments thereto for
AMP, to prepay MSCGI, in a discounted lump sum (the “Prepayment”), all
or a portion of the remaining Contract
Price for energy to be purchased
under
the
Purchased
Energy
Agreement; and
Whereas, AMP intends to issue
bonds to finance the Prepayment if
and when the Prepayment is negotiated and executed; and
Whereas, any such Prepayment
will permit AMP to sell to the City
firm energy, derived from the amended Purchased Energy Agreement at a
price less than the Basic Energy
Charge (the “Discounted Energy
Charge”) to the City; and
Whereas, AMP has advised the
City, and the City acknowledges, that
there can be no assurance that circumstances will permit, or that AMP
and MSCGI can agree on the terms of,
any such Prepayment, such that the
City is entering into this Energy
Schedule based on the contract price
and the other terms contained in the
AMPGS
Replacement
Energy
Schedule and not on the prospect that
AMP may be able to sell firm energy
at a lower Discounted Energy
Charge;
Whereas, the City previously determined that it could beneficially utilize a portion of such energy and executed the AMPGS PSC with AMP for a
share of the power and energy from
AMPGS; and

The City Record
Whereas, the City desires to obtain
the benefit of the Discounted Energy
Charge and consents to the issuance
of bonds by AMP on its behalf to
effect the Prepayment; and
Whereas, the AMPGS Replacement
Energy Schedule allows the City
option to establish a reserve, through
AMP, to be applied to any liability it
may have, under the AMPGS PSC; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section
1.

the
AMPGS
Replacement
Energy
Schedule
between the City and AMP, including
Appendices is substantially in the

to arrange for the Prepayment and to
issue bonds therefore on behalf of the

CHAPTER 3167
FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT
Section 3167.01 General Provisions
(a) Statutory Authorization. Article
XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities
the legal authority to adopt land use
and control measures for promoting
the health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens.
(b) Findings of Fact. The City of
Cleveland has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss
of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the
tax base. Additionally, structures
that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from
flood damage also contribute to the
flood loss. In order to minimize the
threat of such damages and to
achieve the purposes hereinafter set
forth, these regulations are adopted.
(c) Statement of Purpose. It is the
purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to:
(1) Protect human life and health;
(2) Minimize expenditure of public
money for costly flood control projects;
(3) Minimize the need for rescue
and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at
the expense of the general public;
(4) Minimize prolonged business
interruptions;
(5) Minimize damage to public
facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and
sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;
(6) Help maintain a stable tax base
by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood
hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
(7) Ensure that those who occupy
the areas of special flood hazard
assume
responsibility
for
their
actions;
(8) Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
(9) Ensure that the flood storage
and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
(10) Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values of the floodplain;
(11) Prevent floodplain uses that
are either hazardous or environmentally incompatible; and
(12) Meet community participation
requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(d) Methods of Reducing Flood
Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and provisions for:
(1) Restricting or prohibiting uses
which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water hazards,
or which result in damaging increases in flood heights or velocities;
(2) Requiring that uses vulnerable
to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against
flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
(3) Controlling the alteration of
natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers,
which help accommodate or channel
flood waters;
(4) Controlling filling, grading,
dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase
flood damage; and,

(5) Preventing or regulating the
construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters
or which may increase flood hazards
in other areas.
Lands
to
Which
These
(e)
Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of Cleveland as identified in division (f) of this section,
including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the City
of Cleveland.
(f) Basis for Establishing the areas
of Special Flood Hazard. For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and / or maps are adopted:
(1)
Flood
Insurance
Study
County,
Ohio
and
Cuyahoga
Incorporated
Areas
and
Flood
Rate
map
Cuyahoga
Insurance
County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
both effective December 3, 2010.
(2) Other studies and / or maps,
which may be relied upon for establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year floodplain, floodways or delineation of
other areas of special flood hazard.
(3) Any hydrologic and hydraulic
engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in
the State of Ohio which has been
approved by the City of Cleveland as
required by division (c) of Section
3167.04, Subdivisions and Large Scale
Developments.
Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and / or studies are hereby adopted by reference and declared
to be a part of these regulations. Such
maps and/or studies are on file at 601
Lakeside Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio
44114.
(g)
Abrogation
and
Greater
Restrictions. In the event of a conflict
between these regulations and any
other ordinance, the more restrictive
shall be followed. These regulations
shall not impair any deed restriction
covenant or easement but the land
subject to such interests shall also be
governed by the regulations.
(h) Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions shall be:
(1)
Considered
as
minimum
requirements;
(2) Liberally construed in favor of
the governing body; and,
(3) Deemed neither to limit nor
repeal any other powers granted
under state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in
conflict with a state or Federal law,
such state or Federal law shall take
precedence over these regulations.
(i) Warning and Disclaimer of
Liability. The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is
considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on scientific
and
engineering
considerations.
Larger floods can and will occur on
rare occasions. Flood heights may be
increased by man-made or natural
causes. These regulations do not
imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on
the part of the City of Cleveland, any
officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management
Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
(j) Severability. Should any section
or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision
shall not affect the validity of the reg-

1902

December 1, 2010
ulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part so declared to
be unconstitutional or invalid.

Maps), and the water surface elevations of the base flood.
(p) Flood Protection Elevation.
The Flood Protection Elevation, or
FPE, is the base flood elevation plus
two (2) feet of freeboard. In areas
where no base flood elevations exist
from any authoritative source, the
flood protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations
determined
and/or
approved by the floodplain administrator.
(q) Floodway. A floodway is the
channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas
that have been reserved in order to
pass the base flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through
a hydraulic and hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative
increase in the water surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no
more than a designated height. In no
case shall the designated height be
more than one foot at any point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by any of the following:
Moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and
projectile impacts, and moderate to
high erosion forces.
(r) Freeboard. A factor of safety
usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends
to compensate for the many unknown
factors that could contribute to flood
heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and
floodway conditions, such as wave
action, obstructed bridge openings,
debris and ice jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
(s) Historic structure. Any structure that is:

The City Record
(1) Listed individually in the
National Register of Historic Places
(a listing maintained by the U.S.
Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of
the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listings on the
National Register;
(2) Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a
registered historic district; or
(3) Individually listed on the State
of Ohio’s inventory of historic places
maintained by the Ohio Historic
Preservation Office.
(t) Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis. An analysis performed by a professional engineer,
registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA,
used to determine flood elevations
and/or floodway boundaries.
(u) Letter of Map Change (LOMC).
A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective Flood
Rate
Maps,
Flood
Insurance
Boundary and Floodway Maps, and
Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are
broken down into the following categories:
(1) Letter of Map Amendment
(LOMA). A revision based on technical data showing that a property was
incorrectly included in a designated
special flood hazard area. A LOMA
amends the current effective Flood
Insurance Rate Map and establishes
that a specific property is not located
in a special flood hazard area.
(2)
Letter
of
Map
Revision
(LOMR). A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade
changes, shows changes to flood
zones, flood elevations, floodplain
and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One common type of
LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination
concerning whether a structure or
parcel has been elevated by fill above
the base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood
hazard area.
(3) Conditional Letter of Map
Revision (CLOMR). A formal review
and comment by FEMA as to whether
a proposed project complies with the
minimum National Flood Insurance
Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does not amend or
revise effective Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway
Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
(v) Lowest floor. The lowest floor
of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) of a structure. This
definition excludes an “enclosure
below the lowest floor” which is an
unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an
area other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in
accordance
with
the
applicable
design requirements specified in
these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
(w) Manufactured home. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent
chassis and is designed for use with
or without a permanent foundation
when connected to the required utilities. The term “manufactured home”
does not include a “recreational vehicle”. For the purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes
manufactured homes and mobile
homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of
the Ohio Revised Code.

1903

15
(x) Manufactured home park. As
specified in the Ohio Administrative
Code 3701-27-01, a manufactured home
park means any tract of land upon
which three or more manufactured
homes, used for habitation are
parked, either free of charge or for
revenue purposes, and includes any
roadway, building, structure, vehicle,
or enclosure used or intended for use
as part of the facilities of the park. A
tract of land that is subdivided and
the individual lots are not for rent or
rented, but are for sale or sold for the
purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes
are parked thereon, if the roadways
are dedicated to the local government
authority.
(y) National Flood Insurance
Program (NFIP). The NFIP is a
Federal program enabling property
owners in participating communities
to purchase insurance protection
against losses from flooding. This
insurance is designed to provide an
insurance alternative to disaster
assistance to meet the escalating
costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is
based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will
adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future
flood risks to all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal
government will make flood insurance available within the community
as a financial protection against
flood loss.
(z) New construction. Structures
for which the “start of construction”
commenced on or after the initial
effective date of the City of Cleveland
Flood Insurance Rate Map, August 1,
1978, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
(aa) Person. Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation, partnership, association, or any
other entity, including state and local
governments
and
agencies.
An
agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any
governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any
board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community college district, technical college district, or state community college. “Agency” does not include the
general assembly, the controlling
board, the adjutant general’s department, or any court.
(bb) Recreational vehicle. A vehicle which is (1) built on a single chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when
measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be selfpropelled or permanently towable by
a light duty truck, and (4) designed
primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living
quarters for recreational, camping,
travel, or seasonal use.
(cc)
Registered
Professional
Architect. A person registered to
engage in the practice of architecture
under the provisions of sections
4703.01 to 4703.19 of the Revised Code.
(dd)
Registered
Professional
Engineer. A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter
4733 of the Revised Code.
(ee)
Registered
Professional
Surveyor. A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter
4733 of the Revised Code.
(ff) Special Flood Hazard Area.
Also known as “Areas of Special

16
Flood Hazard”, it is the land in the
floodplain subject to a one percent or
greater chance of flooding in any
given year. Special flood hazard
areas are designated by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency on
Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A,
AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special
flood hazard areas may also refer to
areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal state or local
sources of data including but not limited to historical flood information
reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood
prone soils associated with a watercourse.
(gg) Start of construction. The date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means
either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a
site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on
a foundation. Permanent construction
does not include land preparation,
such as clearing, grading, and filling;
nor does it include the installation of
streets and/or walkways; nor does it
include excavation for a basement,
footings, piers, or foundations or the
erection of temporary forms; nor does
it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as
garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction
means the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor, or other structural part
of a building, whether or not that
alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
(hh) Structure. A walled and roofed
building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
(ii) Substantial Damage. Damage
of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the
structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent
of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
(jj) Substantial Improvement. Any
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market
value of the structure before the
“start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures,
which have incurred “substantial
damage”, regardless of the actual
repair work performed. The term does
not, however, include:
(1) Any improvement to a structure
that is considered “new construction,”
(2) Any project for improvement of
a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary,
or safety code specifications which
have been identified prior to the
application for a development permit
by the local code enforcement official
and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions;
or
(3) Any alteration of a “historic
structure,” provided that the alteration would not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure”.
(kk) Variance. A grant of relief
from the standards of these regula-

The City Record
tions consistent with the variance
conditions herein.
(ll) Violation. The failure of a
structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.

division (f) of Section 3167.01 accurately represent flooding conditions
so appropriate floodplain management criteria are based on current
data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
(1) Requirement to Submit New
Technical Data
A. For all development proposals
that impact floodway delineations or
base flood elevations, the community
shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted
to FEMA within six months of the
date such information becomes available. These development proposals
include:
1. Floodway encroachments that
increase or decrease base flood elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
2. Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures where
the applicant desires to remove the
site from the special flood hazard
area;
3. Alteration of watercourses that
result in a relocation or elimination of
the special flood hazard area, including the placement of culverts; and
4. Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the establishment of base flood elevations in
accordance with division (c) of
Section 3167.04.
B. It is the responsibility of the
applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with division
(j)(1) of Section 3167.03 prepared in a
format required for a Conditional
Letter of Map Revision or Letter of
Map Revision, and submitted to
FEMA. Submittal and processing fees
for these map revisions shall be the
responsibility of the applicant.
C. The Floodplain Administrator
shall require a Conditional Letter of
Map Revision prior to the issuance of
a floodplain development permit for:
1. Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood elevation; and
2. Proposed development which
increases the base flood elevation by
more than one foot in areas where
FEMA has provided base flood elevations but no floodway.
D. Floodplain development permits
issued
by
the
Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned
upon the applicant obtaining a Letter
of Map Revision from FEMA for any
development proposal subject to division (j)(1)A. of Section 3167.03.
(2) Right to Submit New Technical
Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the
information shown on an effective
map that does not impact floodplain
or floodway delineations or base
flood elevations, such as labeling or
planimetric details. Such a submission shall include appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City of
Cleveland and may be submitted at
any time.
(3) Annexation / Detachment. Upon
occurrence,
the
Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in

1905

17
writing whenever the boundaries of
the City of Cleveland have been modified by annexation or the community
has assumed authority over an area,
or no longer has authority to adopt
and enforce floodplain management
regulations for a particular area. In
order that the City of Cleveland’s
Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately
represent the City of Cleveland
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the City of
Cleveland suitable for reproduction,
clearly showing the new corporate
limits or the new area for which the
City of Clevelandhas assumed or
relinquished floodplain management
regulatory authority.
(k) Data Use and Flood Map
Interpretation. The following guidelines shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data
showing areas of special flood hazard:
(1) In areas where FEMA has not
identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood
hazard areas where base flood elevation and floodway data have not been
identified,
the
Floodplain
Administrator shall review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard
data available from a federal, state,
or other source.
(2) Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take
precedence over base flood elevations
and floodway boundaries by any
other source that reflect a reduced
floodway width and/or lower base
flood elevations. Other sources of
data, showing increased base flood
elevations and/or larger floodway
areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably
by
the
Floodplain
used
Administrator.
When
Preliminary
Flood
(3)
Insurance Rate Maps and / or Flood
Insurance Study have been provided
by FEMA:
A. Upon the issuance of a Letter of
Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data
shall be used and replace all previously existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of
administering these regulations.
B. Prior to the issuance of a Letter
of Final Determination by FEMA, the
use of preliminary flood hazard data
shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway
areas exist or where the preliminary
base flood elevations or floodway
area exceed the base flood elevations
and/or floodway widths in existing
flood hazard data provided from
FEMA. Such preliminary data may be
subject to change and / or appeal to
FEMA.
(4) The Floodplain Administrator
shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the
flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the
determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section 3167.05,
Appeals and Variances.
(5) Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard
and field elevations disagree, the
base flood elevations or flood protection elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table,
established high water marks, etc.)
shall prevail.
(l)
Substantial
Damage
Determinations. Damages to structures may result from a variety of
causes including flood, tornado, wind,
heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a

18
damage
event,
the
Floodplain
Administrator shall:
(1) Determine whether damaged
structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
(2) Conduct substantial damage
determinations for damaged structures located in special flood hazard
areas; and
(3) Make reasonable attempt to
notify owners of substantially damaged structures of the need to obtain
a floodplain development permit prior
to repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
Additionally,
the
Floodplain
Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process. These measures
include issuing press releases, public
service announcements, and other
public information materials related
to the floodplain development permits
and repair of damaged structures;
coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist
with substantial damage determinations; providing owners of damaged
structures materials and other information related to the proper repair of
damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of
substantially damaged structures
with Increased Cost of Compliance
insurance claims.

(3) Alterations of a Watercourse.
For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any
change occurs within its banks. The
extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
“bankfull stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based
on methods presented in Chapter 7 of
the USDA Forest Service General
Technical Report RM-245, Stream
Reference
Sites:
An
Channel
Illustrated Guide to Field Technique
or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed
developments that alter a watercourse, the following standards

Administrator’s decision. Such appeal
shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain
Administrator.
Upon
receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said
notice and all pertinent information
on
which
the
Floodplain
Administrator’s decision was made to
the Appeals Board.
Upon receipt of the notice of appeal,
the Appeals Board shall fix a reasonable time for the appeal, give notice
in writing to parties in interest, and
decide the appeal within a reasonable
time after it is submitted.
(d) Variances. Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship may
file an application for a variance. The
Appeals Board shall have the power
to authorize, in specific cases, such
variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with
Federal regulations, as will not be
contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot
or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
(1) Application for a Variance.
A. Any owner, or agent thereof, of
property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for
a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon
receipt of the variance shall transmit
it to the Appeals Board.
B. Such application at a minimum
shall contain the following information: Name, address, and telephone
number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel
map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of
the variance sought; and reason for
the variance request.
C. All application for a variance
shall be accompanied by a Variance
Application Fee set in accordance
with Section 329.05.
(2) Notice for Public Hearing. The
Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty
(30) days after the receipt of an application for a variance from the
Floodplain Administrator. Prior to
the hearing, a notice of such hearing
shall be given in one (1) or more
newspapers of general circulation in
the community at least ten (10) days
before the date of the hearing.
(3) Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the
Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance applications, the
Appeals Board shall consider and
make findings of fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of these
regulations and the following factors:
A. The danger that materials may
be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
B. The danger to life and property
due to flooding or erosion damage.
C. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
D. The importance of the services
provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
E. The availability of alternative
locations for the proposed use that are
not subject to flooding or erosion
damage.
F. The necessity to the facility of a
waterfront location, where applicable.
G. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development.

20
H. The relationship of the proposed
use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for
that area.
I. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles.
J. The expected heights, velocity,
duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the
effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site.
K. The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets
and bridges.
Variances shall only be issued
upon:
L. A showing of good and sufficient
cause.
M. A determination that failure to
grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of
meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an
exceptional hardship to the applicant.
N. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that
which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety;
extraordinary public expense, nuisances, fraud on or victimization of
the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
O. A determination that the structure or other development is protected
by methods to minimize flood damages.
P. A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
Upon consideration of the above
factors and the purposes of these regulations, the Appeals Board may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as it deems necessary
to further the purposes of these regulations.
(4) Other Conditions for Variances
A. Variances shall not be issued
within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during
the base flood discharge would result.
B. Generally, variances may be
issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected
on a lot of one-half acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots
with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing
items in division (d)(3) of Section
3167.05 have been fully considered. As
the lot size increases beyond one-half
acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance
increases.
C. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the
increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
(e) Procedure at Hearings
(1) All testimony shall be given
under oath.
(2) A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except confidential deliberations of the Board, but
including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
(3) The applicant shall proceed
first to present evidence and testimony in support of the appeal or variance.

evidence or testimony in opposition to
the appeal or variance.
(5) All witnesses shall be subject to
cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
(6) Evidence that is not admitted
may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
(7) The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of
issuance and service shall be collected in advance.
(8) The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its decision.
The decision may be announced at the
conclusion of the hearing and thereafter issued in writing or the decision
may be issued in writing within a reasonable time after the hearing.
(f) Appeal to the Court. Those
aggrieved by the decision of the
Appeals Board may appeal such decision to the Cuyahoga County Court of
Common Pleas, as provided in
Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised
Code.

Section 131.07 Special Event Permits
For purposes of this Chapter, “special event” means a preplanned event or series of events of less than a week’s duration, sponsored by a public or private person or entity, which is: (1) located wholly or partially on property which is
owned or maintained by the City of Cleveland; or (2) located on any other property and requires for its successful execution, the provision and coordination of municipal services to a degree significantly over and above that which the City
of Cleveland routinely provides under ordinary everyday circumstances.
City buildings, parks and all other real estate under control of the Director which have been constructed or maintained
for the benefit of the public shall be for the use of the public in general under the Charter and ordinances of the City of
Cleveland. To that end, no person or entity shall be given any special or exclusive privilege to use any public property
under the control of the Director without first obtaining a permit under this section. Additionally, the Director shall
ensure that proper coordination occurs among necessary city departments to facilitate the use of city streets for special
event activities including parades, marathons, foot races/bike-a-thons, and all other events requiring closure of a rightof-way.
All closures of city streets in conjunction with a special event shall be approved by the Police Traffic Commissioner,
Commissioner of Streets, and Manager of Special Events, and Marketing.
(a) The Director may establish rules and regulations for the use of public property under his control. Such rules and
regulations shall become effective ten days after publication in the City Record and shall be enforced as ordinances of
the City.
(b) The Director may place reasonable time restrictions on the issuance of special event permits, including without
limitation a prior notice requirement, first-come, first-served scheduling, limitations on frequency of use, and limitation
of permits to normal operating hours for the city property. The Director’s prior notice requirement may not exceed five
days for special event permits not subject to the requirements of Section 131.08.
(c) The Director may place reasonable place restrictions on the issuance of special event permits, which restrictions
may consider the historic use of the property, recreational use policies adopted in the director’s rules and regulations,
the size of the property and the degree to which the special event would interfere with the historic use and adopted recreational use policies for the property.
(d) The Director may deny or revoke a special event permit whenever he finds:
(1) the applicant person or entity has previously violated the provisions of a special event permit or has submitted
materially false or incomplete information on any special event permit application; or
(2) the special event would unreasonably interfere with the movement of or service capability of police vehicles, firefighting equipment or ambulance service; or
(3) the special event would unreasonably interfere with the historic recreational use and the adopted recreational use
policies for a neighborhood park; or
(4) the special event would unreasonably interfere with another special event for which a permit has been issued.
The Director may charge a permit application fee, subject to approval of Board of Control, in an amount not to exceed
the Director’s cost in administering such application.

Tenant’s Association Budget Committee, with notice going to the Chairperson of the Public Parks, Recreation and
Property Committee and the Councilmember representing the ward containing the West Side Market of the date, time,
and location of each meeting:
(1) By November 1st of each year, the Director shall prepare and submit for review to the Budget Committee of the
Tenant’s Association, a schedule of expenses for the ensuing year (the “Director’s Schedule”). The Director shall have
the discretion to increase the total amount of expenses in the Director’s Schedule (the “Schedule Amount”) so that the
Schedule Amount is not greater than the previous year’s Schedule Amount plus ten percent (10%) plus a percentage
equal to the percentage increase in wages negotiated by the City with its union employees.
In the event that the Schedule Amount exceeds the amount referred to in the preceding sentence, the excess amount
may serve as the basis for the calculations set forth herein only with the prior approval of the Budget Committee, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The decision of the Budget Committee as to any such excess amount shall
be made within twenty-five (25) days after submittal of the Director’s Schedule to the Budget Committee. If the Budget
Committee has failed to act at the expiration of this twenty-five (25) day period, the Schedule Amount shall be deemed
approved as submitted.
In the event that the Schedule Amount for the ensuing year is less than the previous year’s Schedule Amount, the
Schedule Amount which shall serve as the basis for calculation of Rent for the ensuing year shall be the Schedule
Amount as submitted for review to the Budget Committee plus thirty percent (30%) of the difference between the previous year’s Schedule Amount and the Schedule Amount submitted for review to the Budget Committee for the ensuing
year.
(2) By December 1st of each year, the Director shall make available to Tenant the calculation of Rent for the ensuing
year, based on the formula set forth herein.
(3) Tenant shall be assigned an occupancy factor which shall be determined by multiplying the total amount of occupied square footage, as evidenced the market Plan, times a location factor times a use factor.
A. The location factor shall be:
1. 1.8 for stands located in the Market House; or
2. 1.2 for stands located outside the Market House.

1916

The City Record

B. The use factor associated with the designated Use Category as defined in the Market Rates shall be:
1. 1.6 for “fast food” or “specialty” stands;
2. 1.0 for “traditional” stands;
3. 0.5 for “grocery” stands; or
4. 0.3 for “restaurant” stands.
(4) The occupancy factors for all stands upon the Market Grounds shall be added together. The result of that addition
shall be “Total Occupancy Factor.” The Total Occupancy Factor shall be multiplied by five percent (5%) to reflect average vacancy rates from year to year. This calculation shall result in the “Vacancy Factor.”
(5) The aggregate of all revenue to be derived under the ensuing year from rental or Storage Lockers shall be deducted from the Schedule Amount. The result of this calculation shall be the “Adjusted Schedule Amount.”
(6) The Adjusted Schedule Amount shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is Tenant’s occupancy
factor and the denominator of which is the Total Occupancy factor minus the Vacancy Factor. This calculation shall
result in the “Annual Rent,” which shall then be divided by twelve (12) to determine the Rent due on the first (1st) day
of each month.
(7) A fee for energy consumption for the outdoor heating system will be assessed to each Tenant of the Arcade. A fee
for maintenance and repair services for the refrigerated display cases will be assessed to each Tenant of the Market
House. Such payments are deemed part of the rental obligation.
(b) The Director may rent such spaces or parts or grant the right to use the same for a period not to exceed one year.
He may make such provision for renewal or extension of the rental right or grant as he may deem advisable from time
to time for additional periods not exceeding one year each, upon notification to Council, providing that the option or
right of renewal shall be exercisable only by the Director and not by the grantee. The Director is authorized to provide
in the renting or granting of rights to the use of such part or space that the rental right or grant shall not be transferred
or assigned by the grantee thereof to any other person without the consent, in writing, of the Director. Such right or
grant may be revoked by the Director upon conviction of the grantee of violation of law or ordinances relating to
weights and measures. Provisions shall be made by the Director for the payment of such rental at such regular times

The issuance of a permit for the use of Municipal property under the supervision and control of the Department of
Public Works or the use of such equipment or property, both real and personal, shall be secured by a deposit, in an

or reimbursement for estimated costs of repair, replacement or return of secured property to its condition prior to use by
the permittee, except where by reason of the nature of the project to be undertaken, the respective commissioner or manager of the division affected, with the approval of the Director of Public Works, has determined that it is impractical or
unnecessary to require a deposit.

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

By Council Member Sweeney (by
departmental request).
An emergency resolution requesting the County Auditor to make
advances during the year 2011 under
Section 321.34 of the Revised Code.
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That under Section 321.34
of the Revised Code, the County
Auditor is requested to draw, and the
County Treasurer is requested to pay,
on draft or drafts made payable to the

any money that may be in the County

Res. No. 1576-10.
By Council Member Sweeney.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio State Senate to put up for a
vote and pass House Bill 75 that creates an income tax refund “check-off”
contribution for the benefit of the
Ohio Historical Society.
Whereas,
the
Ohio
Historical
Society (OHS) has been working for
more than five years on legislation
that would create an income tax
refund check-off contribution for OHS
(House Bill 75) that would be used to
help support local history-related
organizations and projects; and
Whereas, House Bill 75 passed the
House
with
flying
colors
last
December by a bipartisan 95-1 vote,
and has since been unanimously
approved by a Senate committee; and
Whereas,
the
Ohio
Historical
Society needs the Ohio Senate to put
HB 75 up for a vote, but now the
Senate appears ready to call it quits
on the 128th General Assembly – to
not convene at all in the “lame duck”
session where unfinished business
such as HB 75 would otherwise be
passed; and
Whereas, if the Ohio Senate does
not pass HB 75 now it will die; and
Whereas, HB 75 co-sponsor Rep.
Kathleen Chandler is term-limited
and her main co-sponsor was defeated
– so neither of them will be back next
year; and
Whereas, given the dire state budget situation, passing HB 75 is one
way the Senate can help demonstrate
their support for history without costing the state anything; and

46
Whereas, HB 75 will be used to support the work of local history-related
organizations and projects through a
competitive matching grants program; and
Whereas, while the Senate Ways
and
Means
and
Economic
Development Committee added an
amendment to HB 75 in the spring
that would also add a tax check-off
for the Ohio chapter of the American
Red Cross, OHS does not have a position on the Red Cross tax check-off,
and the Senate has the option to strip
that out of the bill if it so chooses; and
Whereas, OHS wants HB 75 to finally pass and move on to Governor
Strickland by the end of this year; and
Whereas, passage of HB 75 would
benefit
Cleveland
City
Council
Archives
along
with
all
Ohio
Archivists; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Urging the Ohio State
Senate to put up for a vote and pass
House Bill 75 that creates an income
tax refund “check-off” contribution
for the benefit of the Ohio Historical
Society.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit certified copies of this resolution to the
Ohio State Senate, Martin Hauserman,
Chief City Archivist, and Todd
Kleismit, Ohio Historical Society,
Director of Government Relations.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
