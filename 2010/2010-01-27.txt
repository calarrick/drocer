FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES REFERRED
Ord. No. 87-10.
By Council Members Kelley and
Sweeney (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance to amend
the title and Section 1 of Ordinance
No. 695-09, passed June 8, 2009, relating to the purchase by requirement
contracts of labor and materials
needed to test, evaluate, repair, or
replace roofs and appurtenances, for
the Department of Public Utilities.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the title and Section 1 of Ordinance No. 695-09,
passed June 8, 2009, are amended to
read as follows:
An emergency ordinance authorizing the purchase by one or more
requirement contracts of labor and
materials needed to test, evaluate,
repair, or replace roofs and appurtenances, for the various divisions
of the Department of Public Utilities.
Section 1. That the Director of
Public Utilities is authorized to
make one or more written requirement contracts under the Charter
and the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, for the requirements for the period of one or
two years of the necessary items of
labor and materials needed to test,
evaluate, repair, or replace roofs
and appurtenances, in the approximate amount as purchased during
the preceding term, to be purchased
by the Commissioner of Purchases
and Supplies on a unit basis for the
various divisions of the Department
of Public Utilities. Bids shall be
taken in a manner that permits an
award to be made for all items as
a single contract, or by separate
contract for each or any combination of the items as the Board of
Control determines. Alternate bids
for a period less than the specified
term may be taken if desired by the
Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies until provision is made for the
requirements for the entire term.
The Director of Public Utilities is
authorized to enter into one or more
contracts with a term of two years
instead of one year when there is a
financial advantage to the City. For
purposes of this ordinance, a financial advantage shall be determined
by the Director of Public Utilities by
comparing the bids received for both
terms.
Section 2. That the title and Section 1 of Ordinance No. 695-09,
passed June 8, 2009, are repealed.

Whereas,
large
purchasers
of
goods and materials such as the
City of Cleveland can strengthen the
regional economy by procuring a
greater percentage of their purchases from local businesses; and
Whereas, purchasing local products will reduce the City of Cleveland’s carbon footprint by reducing
the distance that goods travel from
factories and farms to the city,
thereby decreasing the amount of
harmful emissions; and
Whereas, the Greater Cleveland
region has a vibrant manufacturing,
industrial, and food production history and we are continuing to
strengthen our local economy by
supporting local producers; and
Whereas, purchasing local goods
and materials will increase the City
of
Cleveland’s
self-reliance
and
resiliency, as well as acting as a
model for local purchasing policies
that support both local and regional business development and economic growth; and
Whereas, encouraging local businesses to follow sustainable practices will expedite their participation in high-growth sectors of the
economy such as renewable energy,
recycling,
green
building,
zero
waste and other sustainable businesses, which in turn will encourage
more graduates to remain in the
Greater Cleveland region and attract new talent to the region; now,
therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
