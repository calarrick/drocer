farm stand and sales will meet a

be conducted on the premises of an
agricultural use if limited to use on
the subject property and if stored in
a manner that controls odor, prevents infestation and minimizes runoff into waterways and onto adjacent properties.

of a barn or other structure routinely requiring such permit, except
that no Building Permit shall be
required for cages, coops, beehives

the Board of Control on the nomination of the Director of Port Control from a list of qualified consultants available for employment as
may be determined after a full and
complete canvass by the Director of

a
Pedestrian
Retail
Frontage.
(f) Criteria for Conditional Uses.
The City Planning Commission shall
approve a Conditional Use application if it determines that the application meets the following criteria.
(1) In the case of a proposed residential, institutional or non-retail
office use, one or more of the following conditions apply:
A. The subject building space was
designed specifically for the type of
use proposed and, as such, occupancy by an allowed use is an unreasonable expectation.
B. Denial of the application for
occupancy by a conditional use
would result in a long-term vacancy
of the subject property, as demonstrated by the applicant.
C. It has been determined that the
proposed use is needed in the immediate area and that suitable alternative locations are unavailable.
(2) In the case of a proposed off
street parking or loading area or
driveway, one or both of the following conditions apply.
A. The size, shape or layout of the
subject property does not permit
placement of the parking, loading or
driveway in a more suitable location.
B. It has been demonstrated by
the applicant that placement of the
parking, loading or driveway in an
allowed location would jeopardize
the continued occupancy of the subject property by uses suited to the
PRO District.

enclosed use that does not have an
entrance from the Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage, one or both of the
following conditions apply:
A. The proposed use will occupy

configuration of the interior space
or other factors related to the

the
Pedestrian
Retail
Street
Frontage will result in more suitable pedestrian access.
(4) In the case of a proposed use
with more than forty (40) feet of
frontage along the Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage, the subject space
was designed for use at such size
and the proposed use, in the determination of the City Planning Comwill
not
have
adverse
mission,
impacts on the functioning of nearby pedestrian-oriented retail uses.
(5) In the case of an interior side
yard more than four (4) feet in
width and located within forty (40)
of
a
Pedestrian

to the following regulations with
respect to maximum setbacks.
(1) Front Street Yard. No main
building on a lot abutting a Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage shall be
set back more than five (5) feet
from the Pedestrian Retail Street
Frontage unless the City Planning
Commission has approved establishment of a surface parking lot in
such location as a Conditional Use.
Such building features as entrances
and display windows may be set
back up to an additional five (5)
feet as long as these features occupy no more than fifty percent (50%)
of the building’s total frontage.
These setback regulations shall not
apply to portions of buildings above
the first-story level.
(2) Interior Side Yard. No portion
of an interior side yard located within forty (40) feet of a Pedestrian
Retail Street Frontage shall exceed
four (4) feet in width on the ground
floor level, unless the City Planning
Commission has approved a driveway or a residential side yard in
such location as a Conditional Use.
(3) Exceptions for Outdoor Cafes.
A building may be set back a maximum of fifteen (15) feet from the
Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage in
order to accommodate a permanent
outdoor cafe. If use of such cafe is
discontinued for a period of two (2)
years or more, the setback area
shall be landscaped or otherwise
improved in accordance with a plan
approved by the City Planning Commission.
(h) Window Areas. For any nonresidential building or storefront
facing a Pedestrian Retail Street
Frontage, not less than sixty percent (60%) of the front facade
between 2.5 and 7.5 feet in height
shall be composed of transparent
windows or doors. In addition, not
more
than
twenty-five
percent
(25%) of such window or door area
on a building or storefront shall be
covered with permanent signs.
(i) Parking. In recognition of the
expected greater use of public transit, bicycles and walking by customers and employees traveling to
PRO Districts, the minimum number
of
parking
spaces
otherwise
required by the Zoning Code shall

1614

October 13, 2010
be reduced by thirty-three percent
(33%) for retail business uses in the
districts.
The
Board
of
Zoning
Appeals may further reduce parking
requirements where it has been
demonstrated that additional parking is available in common or
shared parking facilities or in onstreet parking areas located within
a reasonable walking distance of
the use, given the nature of the use
and the district. The Board shall
also consider factors as the number
of bicycle racks available in proximity to a use. In making its determination, the Board shall be guided
by an up-to-date analysis of parking
supply and demand and other relevant factors submitted by or on
behalf of the applicant. The City
Planning Commission shall maintain a file of all such parking analyses submitted for properties in each
PRO District.
(j) Signs in the Public Street
Right-of-Way. An ordinance to map
a PRO District in a particular location may include permission to place
private signs in the public street
right-of-way under the regulations
of Chapter 512 of the Codified Ordinances. Such provision shall be
included in the PRO designation
only if it is determined, on the basis
of a survey and analysis conducted
by the City Planning Commission,
that the particular PRO District is
characterized by a preponderance of
restaurants and small independent
stores for which signs placed near
the street curb would provide useful
information to pedestrians seeking
goods
and
services
and
would
the
pedestrian-oriented
enhance
image of the district. Any PRO District designated for display of signs
in the street right-of-way shall be
shown on the Zoning Map as a
“PRO-S” District, with “S” noting the
presence of special sign provisions.
No sign permitted by these provisions shall be displayed without
design approval of the sign’s structure and permanent elements by the
City Planning Commission, or where
applicable, by the Landmarks Commission.
(k) Variances. The Board of Zoning Appeals may grant variances to
requirements of this section under
the applicable criteria stated in
Chapter 329 of this code.
(l) Appeals. Appeals from the
decision of the City Planning Commission to approve or disapprove
Conditional
Uses
in
Pedestrian
Retail Spaces shall be made to the
Board of Zoning Appeals.
