FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES REFERRED
Ord. No. 405-10.
By Council Members Mitchell and
Sweeney (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance to amend
Section 196.03 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976 as
enacted by Ordinance No. 878-09,
passed July 1, 2009, relating to parking occupancy tax imposed.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 196.03 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976 as enacted by Ordinance No. 878-09, passed July 1, 2009,
is amended to read as follows:
Section 196.03 Tax Imposed
(a) Purpose. An excise tax is
imposed by this chapter for the purpose of providing funds for the following:
(1) the payment of costs of permanent improvements, including costs
of acquiring, constructing, reconstructing, rehabilitating, remodeling, renovating, enlarging, improving, equipping or furnishing facilities by contract, lease, lease-purchase, or otherwise; and
(2) the elimination of deficits in
City funds and the payment of costs
of general municipal operations; and
(3) recreational, cultural and extracurricular programs of the Cleveland
Public Schools; and
(4) all other lawful purposes, including the payment of lease rentals,
lease-purchase amounts, debt charges,
deposits to reserves or other funds
or other obligations.
(b) Order of Application of the
Tax. The annual collections shall be
used to fund any lawful municipal
purposes, including payment of costs
of general municipal operations, permanent improvements, and the elimination of deficits in City funds, all
subject to provisions governing the
collection, investment and disbursement of collections from the tax contained in the proceedings for any
bonds, notes, leases, leasepurchase
agreements or other obligations issued or incurred for those purposes.
(c) Tax. An excise tax is imposed

upon the privilege of parking occupancy within the City. Such tax is
imposed upon the patron for each
transaction and shall be in the
amount of eight percent (8%) of the
parking fee charged for parking
occupancy. The tax herein imposed
is in addition to any other taxes
imposed by law on or relating to
transactions or the income or gross
receipts therefrom.
(d) Exemptions.
(1) The tax shall not apply to
transactions with respect to which:
A. the operator is the United
States government or a division or
department thereof; or
B. the patron is a resident of a
single-family home, multiple-family
dwelling unit, apartment, boarding
house, condominium, or mobile home
occupying parking space for the
purpose of parking onsite at that
place of residence or at an off-site
parking facility under contract to
provide parking for residents at that
place of residence, provided that the
resident utilizes such home, dwelling
unit, apartment, boarding house,
condominium, or mobile home for
living or sleeping purposes for at
least thirty (30) consecutive days; or
C. the patron is a licensed valet,
provided that the parking space
being occupied is made available
pursuant to a written contract with
the facility operator and is being
occupied in the ordinary course of
providing parking services to a
patron of the valet.
(2) No exemption from tax shall
be granted without a valid exemption certificate completed by the
party claiming to be exempt. The
exemption certificate shall be prescribed by the Commissioner and
include all information deemed necessary for the identification of the
parties to the transaction and the
authority from which an exemption
is claimed. A transaction shall be
presumed to be taxable in the
absence of a complete exemption
certificate executed at the time of
the transaction. The operator shall
remit the original exemption certificates with the remittance return in
which the exempt transaction is
reported and retain copies of all
exemption certificates on file for a
period of time consistent with this
chapter.
(e) Collection of Tax. An operator
is required to collect the tax at the
time of the transaction and to pay
the amount collected or amount that
should have been collected over to
the Commissioner as provided herein. The tax shall be paid and the
operator held liable, whether or not
such tax has been in fact collected
from the patron.
Section 2. That existing Section
196.03 of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976 as enacted by
Ordinance No. 878-09, passed July 1,
2009, is repealed.
Section 3. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

within the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, among the immediate
benefits of the new law is that
Cleveland residents who are uninsured will have the opportunity to
have health insurance and many
will no longer fear being dropped by
their health insurance companies
because of an illness or be prevented from having health insurance
because of a pre-existing health condition; and
Whereas, the new national Health
Care law will expand coverage to
an additional 32 million Americans;
and
Whereas, the uninsured will receive immediate access to coverage
through high-risk pools if they have
pre-existing conditions; and

March 31, 2010
Whereas, children can remain on
their parents’ health insurance plans
until they are 26 years of age; and
Whereas, small businesses can receive tax credits to purchase insurance for employees; and
Whereas, health insurance companies will be prohibited from refusing to sell policies and will be limited in their ability to set prices on
the basis of health status; and
Whereas, the prescription-drug coverage gap, known as the “doughnut
hole” will eventually be eliminated;
and
Whereas, this Council acknowledges the courage and hard work of
President Obama, the Congressional
Delegation of Northeast Ohio, and
other members of the U.S. Congress
in their support of the new national
health care legislation during a difficult, and at times, hostile pre-vote
period of debate; their leadership
allowed the law to be passed; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

TYPE:

WRITTEN EXAMINATION

This examination is designed to
measure your ability to succeed as
a firefighter in the City of Cleveland. If your score is sufficiently
high enough on the written test battery, you will be asked to complete
the physical ability test at a later
date. The weighting of these two
tests will be determined based on
results of the job analysis which is
currently being completed. The final
weights will be provided to candidates during the instruction period
at the start of the written testing.
If you receive a passing grade on
the combined examination, you will
be placed on the eligibility list for
Firefighter. Your examination grade
will be used in conjunction with any
residency credit and/or veterans’ preference credit to determine your rank
order position on the eligibility list.
Physical Abilities Examination
The test is designed to evaluate
physical ability to perform the
duties of a Firefighter. Applicants
invited to complete the physical
capability test will be notified of
their scheduled date, time, and location to take the test by U.S. mail
after the written examination. The
physical skills test contains events
which reflect physical activities
actually encountered on the job by
Cleveland Firefighters.
ADDITIONAL SELECTION
PROCEDURES
Applicants who receive a passing
grade on the combined examination
score and rank high enough on the
eligible list for Firefighter and receive Civil Service Certification will
be subject to the following examinations:
Drug Screening: Each applicant shall
undergo an examination for drug

usage. This examination may be in
the form of urinalysis. Any applicant whose results from the drug
screening examination are determined to be positive shall be removed from the eligibility list unless such results can be satisfactorily related to the advice of a recognized medical practitioner. Drug
screening may also be conducted
after appointment to the academy.
Background
Investigation:
Background investigation and evaluation
may include interviews with present
and previous employers. Neighbors
and family may be contacted as part
of the investigation. In addition, a
check of Local and State Police and
FBI records, both adult and juvenile, and Bureau of Motor Vehicle
records will be made. The background test also includes review of
sealed and expunged records. Unsatisfactory findings in one or more of
these areas may be cause for
removal from the Civil Service eligibility list. Conviction of a felony
is absolute grounds for removal
from the list. Any applicant convicted of a felony will be removed
from the eligible list and will receive
no
further
consideration.
There are also misdemeanor convictions that would result in the removal of an applicant from the eligibility list.
Psychological Evaluation: A psychological evaluation to determine the
applicant’s emotional suitability to
perform all aspects of the job will
be conducted. Each applicant may
be required to take several written
examinations. These, along with the
results of the background investigation, will be submitted to one or
more psychologist(s)/psychiatrist(s)
who will interview the candidates.
All records of the psychological and
background examinations will be
made available to the Civil Service
Commission. The Commission will
review such records and make the
final determination of each applicant’s suitability for removal from
the eligible list.
Medical Examination: Any appointment to the position of Firefighter
will be conditioned upon passing a
pre-employment medical examination conducted in accordance with

An emergency resolution supporting the United States U Visa program, which is a temporary visa

The City Record
authorizing non-U.S. citizen crime
victims who assist law enforcement
with crime investigations to remain
in this country up to four years and
urging the Cleveland Police Department to participate in the U Visa
program when practicable.
Whereas, in 2000, the U.S. Congress created the U Visa classification in the Victims of Trafficking
and Violence Prevention Act (the
“Act”), which allows foreign visitors
and other non-US citizens who are
victims of specified criminal activity, and who are needed to assist
government officials in the investigation or prosecution of such criminal activity, to legally remain in the
US for up to 4 years; and
Whereas, in passing the Act and
creating the U Visa program, it was
Congress’ intent to strengthen the
ability of local law enforcement
agencies to detect, investigate or
prosecute serious crimes committed
against non-US citizens by providing them with legal status in this
country when they assist local law
enforcement agencies; and
Whereas, by creating the U Visa
program, Congress also intended to
offer “protection to victims of offenses in keeping with the humanitarian
interests
of
the
United
States”; and
Whereas, information and assistance about serious crimes provided
to law enforcement by foreign crime
victims improves the safety and
overall quality of life of a city’s residents; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

Whereas, the land area requested
to be strip mined is located between

Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

recently
introduced
in
the
U.S.
House of Representatives.
Whereas, in the last 15 years,
more than 76,000 Americans have
been killed while walking or crossing the street; and
Whereas, by making walking and
biking a safer, more attractive
option, we will save time and money
as individuals, as communities, and
as a nation; and
Whereas, the United States could
save tens of billions of dollars every
year by investing in more walking
and bicycling; and
Whereas, with the high costs of
driving, mounting congestion, an

26
obesity epidemic, oil dependence
and environmental concerns, American need to have the healthy and
affordable choice to travel by foot
or bicycle for the shorter trips that
dominate our daily routines; and
Whereas, a quarter of all trips
taken in the United States are within a 20-minute walk; and
Whereas, H.R. 4722 would enable
communities to compete on merit for
targeted funds to complete active
transportation networks to enable
Americans to walk or bike safely
and conveniently; and

immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
