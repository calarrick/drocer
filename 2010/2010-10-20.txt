period of three years, with two oneyear options to renew, the first of

affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it

through refunding. The principal
amount of each Series of Refunding
Bonds is to be the amount set forth

The City Record
in the Certificate of Award authorized in Section 4 and determined by
the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, to be necessary (i) to
refund the Refunded Bonds to be
refunded by that Series, (ii) to fund
any deposit to the Debt Service
Reserve Fund required under the
Indenture or any special reserve
fund for that Series separate from
the Debt Service Reserve Fund, (iv)
to pay costs of any Credit Support
Instruments,
(v)
to
pay
any
amounts owed under Hedge Agreements, and (vi) to pay costs of issuing
the
Refunding
Bonds
and
refunding the Refunded Bonds. The
proceeds from the sale of each
Series of Refunding Bonds shall be
allocated, deposited and applied as
provided in Section 5.
The Refunding Bonds may be
issued in one or more separate
Series, each bearing a distinctive
provided
that
the
designation,
Refunding Bonds of each Series satisfy the requirements of this Ordinance. Separate Series of Refunding
Bonds may be issued at the same or
different
times.
The
Refunding
Bonds of each Series shall be designated as provided in the applicable Certificate of Award and shall
include in the designation reference
to the calendar year in which the
applicable Series is issued. A separate Certificate of Award and a separate Supplemental Indenture shall
be delivered for each Series.
Section 3. Variable Rate Refunding Bonds. In the event that a Series
of Refunding Bonds bear interest at
variable interest rates, then the
Director of Finance is authorized to
determine the method and procedure
by which the variable rate of interest to be borne by the Refunding
Bonds of that Series shall be determined, whether by reference to a
market index, by a remarketing
agent or otherwise; provided that no
variable rate Refunding Bonds may
bear interest at a rate in excess of
twenty-five percent (25%) per year
(including any Refunding Bonds
held by a provider of a Credit Support Instrument). The Director of
Finance may determine that the
terms of a variable rate Series of
Refunding Bonds may or may not
permit the holders to tender their
variable rate Refunding Bonds for
purchase by the City. The Director
of Finance shall also designate in
the Certificate of Award for those
variable rate Refunding Bonds (and
may designate others, from time to
time, in substitution therefor) the
tender agent or agents and the
remarketing agent or agents, which
designations shall be based on the
determination of the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed
to provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable. The Director of Finance is authorized to enter
into agreements in connection with
the delivery of each Series of variable rate Refunding Bonds, and
from time to time thereafter so long
as the variable rate Refunding
Bonds of that Series are outstanding, with providers of Credit Support
Instruments, tender agents (which
may be the Trustee), remarketing
agents (which may be any of the
Original Purchasers), purchasers of
tendered Refunding Bonds, and oth-

1633

9
ers as may be determined by the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, to be necessary or appropriate
to provide for (i) the method of
determining the variable interest
rates, (ii) the rights and procedures
for tender, (iii) liquidity or credit
support, (iv) repayment by the City
of any amounts drawn under the
Credit Support Instrument, (v) the
direct purchase of tendered Refunding Bonds, and (vi) other arrangements in the best interests of the
City. The Director of Finance is further authorized to terminate any
such agreements if the Director of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the City’s best interests
will be served by such termination.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized to enter into agreements,
from time to time so long as the
variable rate Refunding Bonds are
supplementing
or
outstanding,
amending the applicable Supplemental Indenture for a series of
Refunding Bonds as provided in Section 9. The Director of Finance is
authorized to pay any fees associated with agreements entered into
or terminated pursuant to this Section from proceeds of Refunding
Bonds, to the extent permitted by
the Indenture, and from the Net Revenues of the Utility.
Section 4. Award and Sale of
Refunding Bonds. The Director of
Finance shall sign and deliver a
Certificate of Award for the Refunding Bonds. In the event the Refunding Bonds are issued in more than
one Series, a separate Certificate of
Award shall be signed and delivered
for each separately delivered Series.
The sale of each Series of the
Refunding Bonds shall be awarded
to the Original Purchasers selected
by the Director of Finance, based on
an evaluation of the qualifications
of firms that have proposed to
underwrite the Refunding Bonds.
The Original Purchaser so selected
shall be identified in the Certificate
of Award. Each Certificate of Award
shall contain the final terms of the
applicable
Series
of
Refunding
Bonds determined by the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor and
consistent with this Ordinance and
the Indenture, including the following:
(a)
the
aggregate
principal
amount of Refunding Bonds issued;
(b) the purchase price to be paid
to the City by the Original Purchasers, which amount shall be not
less than: (i) 97% of the amount
determined by adding to the aggregate
principal
amount
of
the
Refunding Bonds any aggregate
original issue premium and subtracting from the amount any aggregate original issue discount, plus
(ii) any accrued interest on the
Refunding Bonds from their date to
the date of their delivery to the
Original Purchasers;
(c) whether any Refunding Bonds
are to be subject to redemption prior
to maturity, and, if so, the redemption date for those Refunding Bonds
subject to prior redemption and the
redemption price, which may be
determined as a percentage of the
principal amount redeemed or by a
formula intended to make the bondholder whole for the loss of the
investment resulting from the early
redemption or by other methodology;
(d) the dates on which and
amounts in which principal of the
Refunding Bonds is to be paid,

10
which shall be not later than thirty
(30) years from their respective
dates of issuance, with an identification of whether the payment is
due by stated maturity or by mandatory sinking fund redemption of
Refunding Bonds of a particular
maturity;
(e) the interest rates to be borne
by Refunding Bonds bearing interest at a fixed rate, the weighted
average of which shall not exceed
seven percent (7%) as to Refunding
Bonds of any Series that are TaxExempt Obligations or nine percent
(9%) as to Refunding Bonds of any
Series that are Taxable Obligations,
or the method by which the interest
rate is to be determined for Refunding Bonds bearing interest at variable rates, consistent with Section 3;
(f) the particular Outstanding
Revenue Bonds or portions thereof
to be Refunded Bonds, and the date
or dates on which the Refunded
Bonds shall be called for redemption
or otherwise retired;
(g) the title and Series designation for the Refunding Bonds;
(h) the amount, if any, and source
of any money to be deposited in the
Debt Service Reserve Fund in order
to cause the balance therein to
equal the Debt Service Reserve
Requirement, if and to the extent
required by the applicable Supplemental Indenture, and any determination as to whether there shall be
a special reserve fund for the
Refunding Bonds of any Series, separate from the Debt Service Reserve
Fund, and any determination as to
whether a Credit Support Instrument shall be provided in lieu of
cash in the Debt Service Reserve
Fund or such special reserve fund;
(i) the Paying Agent; and
(j) whether any Refunding Bonds
are to be secured by or payable from
any Credit Support Instruments.
It is determined that the terms of
the Refunding Bonds as so determined within the limitations set
forth in this Ordinance and as so
specified and set forth in the Certificate of Award will be in the best
interest of the City and consistent
with all legal requirements.
The Director of Finance may
enter into a Bond Purchase Agreement with the Original Purchasers
of each Series of Refunding Bonds
setting forth the conditions for
delivery of the Refunding Bonds
that are consistent with this Ordinance, the Certificate of Award, and
the Indenture and that are determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, to be customary
for water revenue bonds issued by
governmental
entities,
including,
without limitation, representations
as to the accuracy and completeness
of information contained in the Official Statement of the City described
in Section 14.

October 20, 2010
shall bear interest from the most
recent date to which interest has

premium and interest on the Refunding Bonds, the Mayor, Director of
Finance and Director of Public Utilities, or any two of them, are authorized to sign and deliver to the
Trustee, in trust for the Original
Purchasers and subsequent holders
of each Series of the Refunding
Bonds, a Supplemental Indenture,
approved as to form by the Director
of Law, not inconsistent with this
Ordinance, the Certificate of Award
and the Indenture and not substantially adverse to the City as may be
approved by the officers signing the
same on behalf of the City. The
determination by those officers that
a Supplemental Indenture is not substantially adverse to the City shall
be conclusively evidenced by the
signing and delivery of that Sup-

October 20, 2010
plemental Indenture by those officers. Subject to the Original Indenture as theretofore amended, any
Supplemental Indenture may contain
amendments to the Original Indenture, as theretofore amended, or
amend and restate the Original
Indenture, to permit the City to
obtain a Credit Support Instrument
or to permit increased flexibility for
the use of financial or credit structures and techniques determined by
the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, to be in the best interests
of the City.
In order to cause the proceeds of
each Series of Refunding Bonds and
any funds of the City deposited in
an Escrow Fund to be invested as
permitted under Section 9.02 of the
Indenture so that the Refunded
Bonds are deemed paid and discharged, and in order to cause the
amount to be deposited to be dedicated and applied to the payment of
the principal of and interest and
any redemption premium on the
Refunded Bonds as and when due,
to and including the applicable
redemption date, the Director of
Finance is authorized to sign and
deliver one or more Escrow Agreements between the City and the
Trustee as Escrow Agent, approved
as to form by the Director of Law,
providing for the establishment of
each Escrow Fund as a trust fund
in the custody of the Trustee and
for the investment, dedication and
application of the moneys deposited
in the accounts therein and further
providing for the payment of the
fees and expenses of the Trustee for
the performance of its duties as
Escrow Agent. Each Escrow Agreement shall provide for the redemption of the Refunded Bonds identified in the applicable Certificate of
Award to be called for redemption
prior to maturity and shall provide
irrevocable
instruction
to
the
Trustee to effect such redemption in
accordance with the Indenture. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
take such other actions as may be
necessary or appropriate to accomplish the refunding of Refunded
Bonds, including without limitation,
the retention of an independent public accounting firm to verify that
the securities to be in an Escrow
Fund are of such maturities or
redemption dates and interest payment dates, and bear such interest,
as will be sufficient, together with
any cash in an Escrow Fund, for the
payment of debt service on the
Refunded Bond to which the Escrow
Fund relates and to make any determinations required for the interest
on the Refunding Bonds to be
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes.
Section 8. Rebate Fund. There is
established and ordered to be maintained a separate account for each
Series of Refunding Bonds within
the Rebate Fund held in the custody
of the Trustee under the Indenture.
The Rebate Fund is not pledged to
the payment of debt service and is
free and clear of any pledge or lien
given under the Indenture as security for the Refunding Bonds or the
Outstanding Revenue Bonds. Calculations of excess earnings that may
be due and payable to the federal
government pursuant to the Code
and deposits to those accounts of
the Rebate Fund shall be made as
provided in the applicable Supplemental Indenture.
Section 9. Remarketing. In the
event that the Director of Finance

The City Record
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
it is advantageous to the City to
convert the interest on any Outstanding Revenue Bonds or Refunding Bonds to fixed interest rates for
a period of time or to maturity, or
to convert the interest on any Outstanding Revenue Bonds or Refunding Bonds to a different variable
rate period or mode, or to terminate
or take other actions with respect to
any existing Credit Support Instrument that will require a tender and
remarketing of any Outstanding
Revenue Bonds or Refunding Bonds
under the Indenture (such conversion or other actions and the tender
and remarketing being collectively
referred to in this Section as “remarketing”), the City shall undertake
the remarketing in accordance with
the Indenture. In connection with
any remarketing of Bonds, the
Director of Finance is authorized to
take such actions that she determines, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, will facilitate the remarketing of the Bonds
or otherwise be in the best interests
of the City, including without limitation, obtaining one or more Credit Support Instruments, terminating
any Credit Support Instrument, and
entering into agreements with one
or more purchasers for their direct
purchase of the remarketed Bonds
in lieu of a public offering of the
Bonds by a remarketing agent. In
the event the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
it is necessary to supplement or
amend the Supplemental Indenture
applicable to a Series of Bonds to be
remarketed in order to address current market conditions or to permit
the use of or to terminate a Credit
Support Instrument or otherwise
obtain
financing
arrangements
advantageous to the City, the Mayor,
the Director of Finance and the
Director of Public Utilities, or any
two of them, are authorized to sign
and deliver an amendment of that
Supplemental
Indenture,
or
an
amended and restated Supplemental
Indenture, approved as to form by
the Director of Law, subject to the
Original Indenture as theretofore
amended.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized to satisfy the Debt Service Reserve Requirement or any
special reserve fund requirement for
the Series of Bonds to be remarketed, by the deposit of a Credit Support Instrument in lieu of cash, as
permitted and more specifically provided in the Indenture, and to apply
cash released from the Debt Service
Reserve
Fund
or
such
special
reserve fund to the payment of costs
of remarketing or other purposes
permitted by applicable laws. To the
extent the costs of remarketing are
not paid from any cash released
from the Debt Service Reserve Fund
or such special reserve fund, those
costs shall be paid from funds of the
Water Division, which are appropriated for that purpose.
The Director of Finance and the
Director of Public Utilities are
authorized to prepare one or more
disclosure documents in connection
with any remarketing of Bonds
under the same terms and conditions
as set forth in Section 14 of this
Ordinance
with
respect
to
the
issuance of Refunding Bonds. The
Director of Finance, the Director of
Public Utilities or any other officer
of the City, as appropriate under the
Charter, is authorized to take such

1635

11
actions or cause to be taken such
actions as are necessary to maintain
the applicable tax status of such
Bonds and the covenants and authorizations in Section 12 of this Ordinance shall apply to such Bonds.
The Mayor, the Director of Finance,
the Director of Public Utilities and
other City officials, as appropriate
under the Charter, are authorized to
sign and deliver such instruments,
certificates and documents as are
necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions authorized by
this
Section.
The
Director
of
Finance, the Director of Public Utilities, the Director of Law and other
City officials, as appropriate under
the Charter, are authorized to make
necessary
arrangements
on
the
behalf of the City to establish the
date, location, procedure and conditions for the remarketing of any
Bonds and to take all actions necessary to effect the remarketing of
any Bonds under the terms of this
Ordinance and the Indenture. The
Clerk of Council or other appropriate official of the City shall furnish
the Trustee a true transcript of proceedings certified by the Clerk or
other official, of all proceedings had
with reference to the remarketing of
any Bonds along with such information for the records as is necessary to determine the validity of the
remarketing.
Section 10. Tender Offers. In connection with refinancing or restructuring any Outstanding Revenue
Bonds, the Director of Finance is
authorized to make a Tender Offer
for
those
Outstanding
Revenue
Bonds or any one or more maturities of the Outstanding Revenue
Bonds on such terms as the Director of Finance determines, in consultation with a Financial Advisor,
will result in debt service savings
to the City or the elimination or
modification of covenants that are
unduly restrictive or a more favorable debt service structure or more
favorable terms under Credit Support Instruments or other advantages to the City. The purchase
price for the purchase of any Outstanding Revenue Bonds tendered
for purchase in response to the Tender Offer shall be paid from proceeds of Refunding Bonds and any
other funds of the City available for
the
purpose.
The
Director
of
Finance is authorized to retain the
services of one or more firms to
serve as dealer manager, depository
and information agent in connection
with any Tender Offer and to pay
the fees and expenses of those firms
from proceeds of Refunding Bonds
or other funds of the City available
for the purpose; provided the Director of Finance determines that the
firms so retained possess the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required of them
and that the terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide such services are fair and commercially reasonable. The Director
of Finance is authorized to prepare
disclosure documents relating to the
terms and conditions of the Tender
Offer and containing information
about the City and the Waterworks
System and to authorize the use and
distribution of those disclosure documents.
Section 11. Authorization of Hedging
Arrangements.
This
Council
finds that by engaging in interest
rate hedging arrangements with
respect to Bonds the City may
reduce its cost of borrowing by optimizing the relative amounts of its

12
fixed and variable rate obligations
or minimizing the risk of variations
in its debt service costs or obtaining savings by confirming rates of
interest on Bonds in advance of
their issuance. To permit the City to
have the flexibility to undertake
with respect to Bonds interest rate
swap, swaption, rate cap, rate collar
and
other
hedging
transactions,
from time to time, and to establish
the procedures for approving those
transactions, this Council authorizes
the signing and delivery of one or
more agreements, including amendments or supplements to existing
agreements (each, a “Hedge Agreement”), and any related agreements
necessary for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by
each Hedge Agreement. The authorizations in this Section are supplemental to and not in derogation of
any authority provided by any other
ordinance of this Council concerning
hedging arrangements.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is to the financial advantage of the City and in the City’s
interests
that
a
hedging
best
arrangement be undertaken by the
City with respect to any Bonds
issued or to be issued under the
Indenture, the Director of Finance
may authorize one or more interest
rate hedge transactions in accordance with the applicable Hedge
Agreement; provided that (a) the
counterparty shall be rated at the
time of signing the Hedge Agreement not lower than A by at least
one rating agency or its obligations
under the Hedge Agreement shall be
guaranteed or insured by an entity
rated at the time of signing the
Hedge Agreement not lower than A
by at least one rating agency, with
such rating in either case determined without regard to a gradation
by numerical or plus or minus or
other modifier and (b) the term of
each hedge transaction shall not
exceed the final maturity of the
Bonds to which the hedge relates.
The Director of Finance shall
negotiate the terms of each Hedge
Agreement with a counterparty satisfying the credit criteria in this
Ordinance. The City shall receive a
written opinion of a Financial Advisor that the payments to be made
by the counterparty to the City, or
by the City to the counterparty,
shall be fair value for the Hedge
Agreement,
considering,
among
other things, the credit of the City
and the counterparty and the terms
and conditions of the Hedge Agreement. The Director of Finance shall
determine the terms and conditions
of the Hedge Agreement, including
without limitation, the rates to be
paid by the counterparty to the City
and by the City to the counterparty
under the Hedge Agreement, the
time or times and procedures for the
exercise by the counterparty or the
City, as the case may be, of any
option under the Hedge Agreement,
and whether the obligations of the
City under the Hedge Agreement
shall be secured by a Credit Support
Instrument. The approval of each
interest rate hedge transaction by
the Director of Finance shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing
and
delivery
of
the
applicable
Hedge Agreement by the Director of
Finance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to terminate any Hedge Agreements in whole or in part or any
Credit Support Instrument securing

The City Record
a Hedge Agreement if the Director
of Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the City’s best interests
will be served by such termination.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized to enter into amendments
or modifications of a Hedge Agreement or any Credit Support Instrument securing a Hedge Agreement
by
the
Director
of
determined
based
on
the
written
Finance,
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the City’s best interests will be
served by such amendment or modification.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from the Net Revenues of the Utility and may be payable also from
other funds permitted by law to be
used for the purpose, as identified
by the Director of Finance in the
Hedge Agreement. Those payments
may be secured by a pledge of Net
Revenues, to the extent permitted
by the Indenture, all as determined
by the Director of Finance and set
forth in the Hedge Agreement. The
obligation of the City to make payments under any Hedge Agreement
does not and shall not represent or
constitute a general obligation, debt,
bonded indebtedness or a pledge of
the faith and credit of the City or
the State of Ohio. Nothing gives any
party to any Hedge Agreement the
right to have excises, ad valorem or
other taxes levied by the City or the
State of Ohio for the payment of any
amounts due under any Hedge
Agreement.
Section 12. Covenants of the City.
The City, by issuance of each Series
of Refunding Bonds, covenants and
agrees with the Holders of that
Series of Refunding Bonds, that:
(a) The City will use the proceeds
of the Refunding Bonds for the purposes specified in Section 2.
(b) The Clerk, or other appropriate officer of the City, will furnish
to the Original Purchasers and to
the Trustee a true transcript of proceedings, certified by the Clerk or
other officer, of all proceedings had
with reference to the issuance of the
Refunding
Bonds,
together
with
information from the City’s records
as is necessary to determine the regularity and validity of the issuance
of the Refunding Bonds.
(c) The City will, at any and all
times, cause to be done all such further acts and things and cause to be
signed and delivered all further
instruments as may be necessary to
carry out the purpose of the Refunding Bonds and this Ordinance or as
may be required by Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio or the Charter of the City or the Indenture or
the applicable Supplemental Indenture and will comply with all
requirements of law applicable to
the Waterworks System and the
operation thereof.
(d) The City will observe and perform all its agreements and obligations provided for in the Refunding
Bonds, this Ordinance, the Indenture
and each Supplemental Indenture.
All of the obligations under this
Ordinance and the Indenture and
each Supplemental Indenture are
hereby established as duties specifically enjoined by law and resulting
from an office, trust or station upon
the City within the meaning of Section 2731.01, Ohio Revised Code.
(e) The City will use, and will
restrict the use and investment of,
the
proceeds
of
the
Refunding
Bonds that are issued as TaxExempt Obligations in such manner

1636

October 20, 2010
and to such extent as may be necessary so that (a) the Refunding
Bonds will not (i) constitute private
activity bonds, arbitrage bonds or
hedge bonds under Sections 141, 148
or 149 of the Code or (ii) be treated other than as bonds to which Section 103(a) of the Code applies, and
(b) the interest thereon will not be
treated as an item of tax preference
under Section 57 of the Code.
(f) The City covenants that (a) it
will take or cause to be taken such
actions that may be required of it
for the interest on the Refunding
Bonds that are issued as TaxExempt Obligations to be and to
remain excluded from gross income
for federal income tax purposes, (b)
it will not take or authorize to be
taken
any
actions
that
would
adversely affect that exclusion, and
(c) it, or persons acting for it, will,
among other acts of compliance, (i)
apply the proceeds of the Refunding
Bonds to the governmental purpose
of the borrowing, (ii) restrict the
yield
on
investment
property
acquired with those proceeds, (iii)

books and records and make calculations and reports, and (v) refrain
from certain uses of proceeds, and,
as applicable, of property financed
with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the extent necessary to
assure such exclusion of that interest under the Code.
Each covenant made in this section with respect to the Refunding
Bonds is also made with respect to
all issues for which any portion of
the debt service is paid from proceeds of the Refunding Bonds (and,
if different, the original issue and
any refunding issues in a Series of
refundings), to the extent such compliance is necessary to assure exclusion of interest on the Refunding
Bonds that are issued as TaxExempt
Obligations
from
gross
income for federal income tax purposes, and the Director of Finance,
or any other officer having responsibility with respect to the Refunding Bonds, is authorized to take
such actions with respect to those
issues as they are authorized in this
section to take with respect to the
Refunding Bonds.
The
Mayor,
the
Director
of
Finance or any other officer of the
City, as appropriate under the Charter, is authorized (a) to make or
effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent, approval or
waiver on behalf of the City with
respect to the Refunding Bonds as
the City is permitted or required to

limitation, any of the elections
available under Section 148 of the
Code, for the purpose of assuring,
enhancing or protecting the favorable tax treatment or status of the
Refunding Bonds that are issued as
Tax-Exempt Obligations or interest
thereon
or
assisting
compliance
with requirements for that purpose,
reducing the burden or expense of
compliance,
reducing
the
rebate
amount or payments or penalties, or
making
payments
of
special
amounts in lieu of making computations to determine, or paying,
excess earnings as rebate, or obviating those amount or payments, as
determined by that officer, (b) to
take any and all other actions, make
or obtain calculations, make payments, and make or give reports,
covenants and certifications of and
on behalf of the City, as may be

October 20, 2010
appropriate to assure the exclusion
of interest from gross income and
the intended tax status of the
Refunding Bonds that are issued as
Tax-Exempt Obligations, and (c) to
give one or more appropriate certificates of the City, for inclusion in
the transcript of proceedings for the
Refunding Bonds, setting forth the
reasonable expectations of the City
regarding the amount and use of all
proceeds
of
the
Refunding
the
Bonds, the facts, circumstances and
estimates on which they are based,
and other facts and circumstances
relevant to the tax treatment or status of the Refunding Bonds and
interest thereon.
If the Director of Finance determines, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, and so specifies in the Certificate of Award
that the best interests of the City
would be served by issuing a Series
of Refunding Bonds the interest on
which would not be excluded from
gross income for federal income tax
purposes,
then
the
tax-related
covenants in this Section shall not
apply to or be required to be made
with respect to the Refunding Bonds
of that Series.
Section

the Director of Finance, based on

those applications and to provide to
each such agency such information
as may be required for the purpose.
The Director of Finance is authorized to contract for one or more
Credit Support Instruments for any

City, or will stabilize interest rates
on those Bonds or will minimize the
risk of increased interest expense
on those Bonds. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to terminate any such contract if the
Director
of
Finance
determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the City’s
best interests will be served by such
termination. The cost of obtaining
each rating and the cost of obtaining or terminating each Credit Support
Instrument,
except
to
the

the name and on behalf of the City,
a continuing disclosure agreement
or certificate, which shall constitute
the continuing disclosure agreement

in
accordance
with
SEC
Rule
15c2-12. The performance of that
agreement shall be subject to the
availability of funds and their annual appropriation to meet costs the

Section 16. Lien of Pledge. The
Net Revenues of the Utility are subject to the lien of the pledge under
the Indenture without any physical
delivery of the Net Revenues or further act, and the lien of such pledge
is valid and binding against all parties having claims of any kind
against the City (irrespective of

without the necessity for separation
of delivery of the Net Revenues or

Section 17. Other Provisions for
Payment of Outstanding Revenue
Bonds. The City may, from time to
time, deposit funds in trust with the
Trustee under the Indenture or an
Escrow Agreement for the payment
of debt service requirements on any
Outstanding Revenue Bonds if, in
the judgment of the Director of
Finance and the Director of Public
Utilities,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, doing
so will improve the debt service coverage ratio of the Waterworks System (being the ratio of Net Revenues
to
Annual
Debt
Service
Requirements, as defined in the
Indenture). The Director of Finance
is authorized to make such deposits,
from time to time, from moneys in
the Additions and Improvements
Fund under the Indenture (Fund No.
52-300 of the Water Division) in
amounts that, in the aggregate, do
not exceed $50,000,000, with the actual amount of any deposit to be determined by the Director of Finance in
consultation with the Director of
Public Utilities. In order to cause
any amounts so deposited to be dedicated and applied solely to the payment of the principal of and interest and any redemption premium on
the designated Outstanding Revenue

14
Bonds, as and when due at maturity or upon prior redemption, the
Mayor, the Director of Finance and
the Director of Public Utilities, or
any two of them, are authorized, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
to sign and deliver one or more
Escrow Agreements approved as to
form and correctness by the Director of Law, providing for the establishment of an Escrow Fund as a
trust fund in the custody of the
Trustee and the investment, dedication and application of the moneys
deposited therein and further providing for the payment to the
Trustee of fees and expenses for its
performance of its duties under the
Escrow Agreement. The officers
signing the Escrow Agreement on
behalf of the City shall determine
that the agreement satisfies the
requirements of this Section, and
that determination shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the Escrow Agreement by those officers. The Mayor, the Director of
Finance and the Director of Public
Utilities, or any two of them, are
authorized, in the name and on
behalf of the City, to sign and deliver agreements, approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, with one or more institutions,
including agreements which will
enable the City to more efficiently
structure any escrow funds established pursuant to this Section, and
thereby maximize debt service savings and minimize negative arbitrage. The Director of Finance is
authorized and directed to take such
other actions as may be necessary
or appropriate to accomplish any
defeasance of the designated Outstanding Revenue Bonds to be paid
from any escrow fund, including
without limitation, the retention of
a firm of independent certified public accountants to verify that the
securities to be deposited in escrow
are of such maturities or redemption
dates, and interest payment dates,
and bear such interest, as will be
sufficient, together with any available moneys, for the payment of
debt service on the designated Outstanding Revenue Bonds.
Section 18. Authorization of Subordinated Refunding Notes. This
Council authorizes the City to issue
Subordinated Refunding Notes in

The principal amount of each series
of Subordinated Refunding Notes is
to be the amount set forth in the

the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, to be necessary (i) to
refund the Outstanding Subordinated Notes to be refunded, (ii) to fund
any deposit to any special reserve
fund, (iv) to pay costs of any Credit Support Instruments, (v) to pay
any amounts owed under any Hedge
Agreements relating to the Outstanding Subordinated Notes, and

Refunding
Notes
and
refunding the Outstanding Subordinated Notes. The proceeds from the
sale of each issue of Subordinated
Refunding Notes shall be allocated,
deposited and applied as provided in
the Certificate of Award.
The authorizations in this Ordinance with respect to Refunding
Bonds shall apply to the Subordinated Refunding Notes subject to
the following: (a) the principal of
the Subordinated Refunding Notes

The City Record
shall be payable from the proceeds
of a subsequent issue of Subordinated Refunding Notes or, subject to
satisfaction of the requirements in
the Indenture for the issuance of
additional Bonds, from the proceeds
of Bonds, (b) to the extent that the
principal of and interest on the Subordinated Refunding Notes is not
paid from the proceeds of a subsequent issue of Subordinated Refunding Notes or from the proceeds of
Bonds, the Subordinate Refunding
Notes shall be payable from and
secured by the Net Revenues of the
Waterworks System on deposit in
the Additions and Improvements
Fund established under the Indenture on a basis subordinate to the
Bonds under the Indenture, (c) the
Subordinated Refunding Notes shall
not constitute “Bonds” under the
Indenture, (d) the principal of the
Subordinated Refunding Notes may
not be accelerated if any Bonds are
outstanding under the Indenture
unless
those
outstanding
Bonds
have been accelerated, and (e) the
final maturity of the Subordinated
Refunding Notes shall be no later
than five years from the date of
issuance. The City covenants to do
all things necessary to effect the
issuance, sale and delivery, prior to
the maturity of the Outstanding Subordinated Notes, of an issue of Subordinated Refunding Notes or an
issue of Bonds, in either case in the
principal amount that is necessary,
together with any other moneys
available to the City for the purpose, to pay the debt service on the
Outstanding
Subordinated
Notes
when due at maturity.
The Director of Finance is authorized to sign and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of the City, the
Registrar Agreement between the
City and the Trustee, in its capacity as registrar and paying agent for
the Subordinated Refunding Notes
(the “Registrar”), in substantially
the form as the City and the Trustee
entered into with respect to the Outstanding Subordinated Notes. The
Registrar Agreement is approved,
together
with
any
changes
or
amendments that are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and not
substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the Registrar Agreement or amendments
thereto. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Registrar Agreement,
except to the extent paid or reimbursed by the Original Purchaser in
accordance with the Note Purchase
Agreement, from the proceeds of the
Subordinated Refunding Notes to the
extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose. No Subordinated
Refunding Notes shall be valid or
obligatory for any purpose or shall
be entitled to any security or benefit under this Ordinance unless and
until the certificate of authentication printed on the Subordinated
Refunding Note is signed by the
Registrar as authenticating agent.
Authentication
by
the
Registrar
shall be conclusive evidence that the
Subordinated Refunding Note so
authenticated has been duly issued,
signed and delivered under, and is
entitled to the security and benefit
of, this Ordinance. The certificate of
authentication may be signed by

1638

October 20, 2010
any authorized officer or employee
of the Registrar or by any other person acting as an agent of the Registrar and approved by the Director
of Finance on behalf of the City.
If determined by the Director of
Finance, based on the advice of a
Financial
Advisor,
that
it
will
enhance the marketability of the
Subordinated Refunding Notes, the
Director of Finance may sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, a security agreement
(the “Note Trust Agreement”) providing for covenants of the City in
addition to those contained in this
Ordinance, for the establishment of
a debt service reserve fund and
other funds or accounts for the security of the Subordinated Refunding
Notes, and other terms and conditions determined by the Director of
Finance to be necessary to sell the
Subordinated Refunding Notes and
that are not inconsistent with this
Ordinance or the Indenture. In that
event, the provisions in the Registrar Agreement may be incorporated
in the Note Trust Agreement and all
references to the Registrar Agreement shall mean instead the Note
Trust Agreement and all references
to the Registrar shall mean instead
the trustee under the Note Trust
Agreement. As appropriate under
the Charter, the Mayor, the Director
of Finance, the Director of Law, the
Director of Public Utilities, the
Clerk of Council and other appropriate officers of the City are, and
each of them is, authorized to sign,
acknowledge and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of the City,
such documents, certifications and
instruments in addition to the Registrar Agreement and any Note
Trust Agreement as may be necessary or appropriate to issue and sell
the Subordinated Refunding Notes
and to consummate the transactions
authorized by this Ordinance.
An account for the deposit of moneys to pay debt service on the Subordinated
Refunding
Notes
(the
“Subordinate
Lien
Debt
Service
Fund”) is established as a separate
deposit account in the custody of the
Trustee
in
the
Additions
and
Improvements Fund held by the City
in accordance with the Indenture.
There shall be deposited in the Subordinate Lien Debt Service Fund the
proceeds of Subordinated Refunding
Notes or Bonds issued to pay when
due the debt service on Outstanding
Subordinated Notes. To the extent
such proceeds are not sufficient for
the purpose, there shall be deposited in the Subordinate Lien Debt Service Fund from the Net Revenues of
the Waterworks System on deposit
in the Addition and Improvements
Fund moneys sufficient to timely
pay any debt service on the Subordinated Refunding Notes not paid
from such proceeds. Moneys on
deposit in the Subordinate Lien Debt
Service Fund may be invested by or
at the direction of the Director of
Finance in “Permitted Investments”
as defined in the Indenture.

of the determinations required by
this Ordinance to be determined by
the Director of Finance or to negotiate any Hedge Agreements. The
Director of Finance may rely on the
written advice of any Financial
Advisor so retained. The Director of

By Council Member K. Johnson.
An emergency resolution urging
the president of the New York Community Bank to reconsider closing
the Ohio Savings Bank branch located at the corner of Larchmere and
North Moreland Boulevards in the
Shaker Square neighborhood.
Whereas, New York Community
Bank has announced its intention to
close the Ohio Savings Bank branch
located at the corner of Larchmere
and North Moreland Boulevards just
off Shaker Square on December 10,
2010; and
Whereas, losing this bank branch
would be a major blow to the Shaker Square community, as closing it
will leave no Ohio Savings Bank
presence between Cleveland Heights
and East 9th Street in Cleveland;
and
Whereas, the Shaker Square community includes a large concentration of residential units as well as
merchants and nearly all rely on
this bank branch for their banking
needs and closing this branch will
cause unnecessary hardship on the
Shaker Square community; and
Whereas, in addition, closing this
bank branch means employees of
the branch would lose their jobs further eroding our economy and would
leave the beautiful corner building
vacant
implying
the
unwanted
image of urban blight; and

1643

Whereas, Ohio Savings Bank, is
currently owned by the “New York

Cleveland; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,

Development Areas and Priority
Conservation

indentified

Whereas,
the
State
of
Ohio,
through the Ohio Lake Erie Commission’s

local governments to improve planning for development and conservation; and
Whereas, Big Creek is an important part of the Cuyahoga River and
Lake
Erie
ecosystem,
providing
storm
water
management,
and
important recreational opportunities
and
wildlife
habitat,
including
Cleveland Metroparks resources; and
Whereas,
the
Cuyahoga
River
Community Planning Organization
developed the Big Creek Watershed
Plan – Balanced Growth and Watershed Stewardship that identifies priority areas for conservation and

watershed communities; and
Whereas, S, the Cuyahoga river
Community Planning Organization

Whereas, the Priority Development Areas and the Priority Con-

20
servation Areas identified in the Big
Creek Watershed Plan – Balanced
Growth and Watershed Stewardship
are to be used by State of Ohio
Agencies to guide State activities
and programs affecting these areas
and they will serve as the basis for
special incentives programs to be
directed to the Big Creek watershed
communities; and
Whereas, the designation of such
areas will assist the City of Cleveland to minimize future flooding,
erosion, and water quality problems,
threats
to
infrastructure,
and
reliance on costly engineered solutions to storm water problems; and
the
Cuyahoga
River
Whereas,
Community Planning Organization
is requested to assist the Friends of
Big Creek and seek endorsement of
this Balanced Growth Watershed
plan by the Ohio Lake Erie Commission in order to permit the local
governments in the watershed to

By Council Member Polensek.
An emergency resolution urging
the Department of Public Safety to
coordinate
with
the
Cleveland
Municipal School District to address
the crisis of absenteeism in Cleveland schools by increased enforcement of our City laws that require

The City Record
children of compulsory school age to
be in attendance at school and
impose parental duties.
Whereas, a month into this school
year, 16 percent of the 45,000-plus
students in Cleveland schools were
absent or late; and
Whereas, the absentee rates are
higher
at
Cleveland
high
even
schools, where 21.4 percent of students were absent at Collinwood
High School, 21 percent were absent
at East Tech High School with nearly 40 percent absent at one of four
independent small schools operating
within East Tech, and 18.5 percent
of students were absent from John
F. Kennedy High School with the
percentage increasing to 37 percent
including
those
tardy
or
when
absent; and
Whereas, this Council supports
the efforts of Cleveland Municipal
School District to raise attendance
through a new initiative called Target 11 that includes notifying and
contacting homes of absent students; and
Whereas, in addition to jeopardizing education, having large numbers
of unsupervised absent students
roaming the streets raises the crime
level in the community; and
Whereas, the Department of Public Safety in coordination with the
School District can help address this
crisis of absenteeism by increased
enforcement of our City laws that
children
of
compulsory
require
school age to be in attendance at
school and impose parental duties;
and
Whereas, Cleveland Codified Ordinance Section 605.141 (a) forbids
any child
between the ages of six and seventeen from being at any place
within the City other than in attendance at school between the hours
of 10:00 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. during
any school day, unless the child is
suspended or expelled, has written
proof from school excusing him, or
is accompanied by a parent, legal
guardian,
or
responsible
adult
selected by the parent or legal
guardian; and
Whereas, Sections 605.141(b) and
(g) impose a duty on parents and
legal guardians of school-age children to prohibit the child from
behaving contrary to division (a),
and if any person violates this duty,
her is guilty of negligently failing
to supervise a child of compulsory
school age, a misdemeanor of the
fourth degree for the first offense;
and
Whereas, Section 605.142 (a) and
(g) places a duty on each parent or
legal guardian of a child suspended
or expelled from school to personally supervise the child or arrange for
a responsible adult to supervise the
child, and prohibit the child from
being at any public place at the
time the child would have been in
school, except under specific listed
circumstances, and subjects them to
a misdemeanor of the second degree
for violating this duty; and
Whereas, stricter enforcement of
these City laws will deter excessive
absenteeism from school and juvenile crime during school hours; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the Department of Public
Safety to coordinate with the Cleve-

1644

October 20, 2010
land Municipal School District to
address the crisis of absenteeism in
schools
by
increasing
Cleveland
enforcement of our City laws that
children
of
compulsory
require
school age to be in attendance at
school and impose parental duties.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Director
Flask, Department of Public Safety,
