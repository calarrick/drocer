social services, employment and much
more;
Whereas, census data help determine how many seats each state
will have in the U.S. House of Representatives and often is used for
the redistricting of state legislatures, county and city councils and
voting districts;
Whereas, the 2010 Census creates
hundreds
of
thousands
of
jobs
across the nation;
Whereas, every Census Bureau
worker takes a lifetime oath to protect confidentiality, and the Census
Bureau ensures that the data identifying respondents or their household not be released or shared for
72 years;
Whereas, a united voice from business, government, community-based
and faith-based organizations, educators, media and others will allow
the 2010 Census message to reach a
broader audience, providing trusted
