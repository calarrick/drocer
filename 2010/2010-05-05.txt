____________
Res. No. 555-10
By Council Members Brancatelli,
Westbrook, Mitchell, Cleveland, Polensek, Sweeney, Kelley, Brady, Zone,
Conwell and Cummins.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio House of Representatives
to support and pass H.B. 323.
Whereas, the foreclosure crisis continues to result in thousands of foreclosure filing in the City of Cleveland; and

615

11
Whereas, banks and mortgage
companies fail to execute on the
decree for sale of the property; and
Whereas, the banks and foreclosure companies fail to assume title
per the legal decree of foreclosure;
and
Whereas, these “toxic title” properties become unmarketable — then
become a dangerous blight and are
harmful to the neighborhood health,
safety and welfare; and
Whereas, the Ohio General Assembly is considering H.B. 323 that will
provide assistance to local government to address bank “walkaways
and toxic titles”; and
Whereas, H.B. 323 provides a systematic judicial authority to remedy
the failure to execute a foreclosure
decree; and
Whereas, H.B. 323 provides for the
following remedies:
• requires a preliminary judicial
report or a commitment for an
owner’s fee policy of title insurance
to be filed along with the filing of
the complaint for foreclosure instead of 14 days after filing the complaint as under existing law;
• requires the plaintiff in a foreclosure action to file a motion requesting a default judgment under
specified circumstances and establishes that failure to file as required
results in dismissal of the action;
• permits a plaintiff requesting a
default judgment to also request a
transfer in lieu of sale and in lieu
of the right to a deficiency judgment under specified circumstances;
• prohibits the sale at a sheriff’s
auction of a foreclosed residential
property that constitutes a public
nuisance and prohibits the county
recorder from recording the deed for
such a property;
• requires a probable cause hearing to determine if a foreclosed
property could be a public nuisance
and specifies the basis upon which
a court could find probable cause;
• permits a plaintiff or other lien
holder to present information at the
probable cause hearing, to pledge to
abate the nuisance while the foreclosure action continues, or to purchase the property at auction and
abate the nuisance after gaining
title to the property;
• grants the court continuing
jurisdiction when it grants permission to abate a nuisance;
• permits specified interested parties to intervene in a foreclosure
action to bring a nuisance abatement action against the property;
• requires the plaintiff to file for
a writ of execution of a judgment
on a foreclosed residential property within 60 days after the clerk
files the judgment, and establishes
that failure to file is grounds for
the court deeming the property
abandoned unless good cause is
shown;
• generally prohibits a plaintiff
and other lien holders from withdrawing or seeking dismissal of a
petition for a writ of execution or an
order of sale unless for good cause;
• enables a court to deem foreclosed residential properties abandoned when the plaintiff does not
seek a writ of execution as required
or a property fails to sell at sheriff’s auction three times;

12
• provides for the transfer of
abandoned property to the board of
county commissioners for use pursuant to rules the commissioners
adopt;
• generally exempts a board of
county commissioners from liability
with respect to abandoned properties that are transferred to it;
• places additional duties on the
clerk of courts with respect to
notices, and requires clerk to collect
an additional fee of $20 for each
foreclosure filing;
• permits a plaintiff to make a
written bid on a property prior to
a sheriff’s sale and enables the
sheriff to open the auction at that
price;
• prohibits charging fees to a purchasing lien holder in a sheriff’s
sale prior to the time the purchase
price is due;
• establishes a procedure for the
court to confirm a sale at auction
by deeming the sale final if no
objections have been received;
• enables purchaser at sheriff’s
sale to submit the deed for recording upon payment of balance of
price
along
with
an
affidavit
promising to file, and establishes
that failure to so file may result in
contempt of court;
• establishes new procedures for
pricing residential properties at a
sheriff’s sale;
• expands the Public Nuisance
Law to include land, subsidized
housing, and any type of building —
not just buildings that contain residential units;
• excludes from the Public Nuisance Law buildings with three or
fewer residential units and that are
owner occupied unless the building
is undergoing foreclosure and is the
subject of a nuisance probable cause
hearing; and
• provides that properties foreclosed due to delinquent taxes that
are forfeited to a political subdivision, school district, or land bank are
free of taxes, assessment charges,
penalties, interest, costs, and subordinate liens; and
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio House of Representatives
to support and pass H.B. 323.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Governor
Ted Strickland, Speaker of the
House Armond Budish, Ohio House
Representative Dennis Murray, Ohio
House Representatives, for the City
of Cleveland, Barbra Boyd, Robin
Belcher, Sandra Williams, Michael
DeBose, Michael Skindell and Mike
Foley, and City of Cleveland Mayor
Frank Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted April 26, 2010.
Effective April 29, 2010.

The City Record
Res. No. 556-10.
By Council Members Cimperman,
Mitchell and Cummins.
An emergency resolution ´support ing President Obama’s Memorandum
for the Secretary of Health and
Human Services on the subject of
“Respecting the Rights of Hospital
Patients to Receive Visitors and to
Designate Surrogate Decision Makers for Medical Emergencies”; and
urging Governor Strickland to issue
a similar memorandum, and the
Ohio General Assembly to adopt a
Patients’ Bill of Rights to give each
patient the right to designate visitors who shall receive the same visitation privileges as the patient’s
immediate family members.
Whereas, on April 15, 2010, President Obama issued a Memorandum
for the Secretary of Health and
Human Services regarding the subject of “Respecting the Rights of
Hospital Patients to Receive Visitors and to Designate Surrogate
Decision Makers for Medical Emergencies”; and
Whereas, in the Memorandum,
President Obama addresses the problem of patients all across America
being denied the caring of a loved
one to comfort them and act as a
legal surrogate; and
Whereas, President Obama highlighted widows or widowers denied
the comfort of a good friend, members of religious orders unable to
choose someone other than an immediate family member to visit them
and make medical decisions, and
gay and lesbian Americans who are
often barred from the bedsides of
the partners with whom they may
have spent decades of their lives;
and
Whereas, for these Americans, the
failure to have their wishes respected concerning who may visit them
or make medical decisions on their
behalf has real consequences, both
in obtaining medical information,
and in senselessly denying patients
comfort of companionship; and
Whereas, President Obama acknowledged that many States, including
North Carolina, Delaware, Nebraska,
and Minnesota, have tried to end
these problems by amending or
adopting a Patients’ Bill of Rights
to give each patient at every hospital in the State “the right to designate visitors who shall receive the
same visitation privileges as the
patient’s immediate family members, regardless of whether the visitors are legally related to the
patient”; and
Whereas, President Obama stated
that his “Administration can expand
on these important steps to ensure
that patients can receive compassionate care and equal treatment
during their hospital stays”; and
Whereas, President Obama requested that the Secretary of Health
and Human Services take certain
steps, including but not limited to,
1) initiating rulemaking to ensure
that hospitals that participate in
Medicare or Medicaid respect the
rights of patients to designate visitors, and may not deny visitation
privileges on the basis of race, color,
national origin, religion, sex, sexual

attorney and health care proxies,
are respected, and 3) providing additional recommendations to the President within 180 days on actions the
Department of Health and Human
Services can take to address hospital visitation, medical decisionmaking, or other health care issues that
affect LGBT patients and their families; and
Whereas, patients in the State of
Ohio would benefit from a similar
memorandum being issued by Governor Ted Strickland; and
Whereas, patients in the State of
Ohio would benefit from the Ohio
General
Assembly
adopting
a
“Patients’ Bill of Rights” similar to
that of other states like North Carolina, to give each patient at every
hospital in the State “the right to
designate visitors who shall receive
the same visitation privileges as the
patient’s immediate family members, regardless of whether the visitors are legally related to the
patient”; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1.
That this Council supports President Obama’s Memorandum for the Secretary of Health and
Human Services on the subject of
“Respecting the Rights of Hospital
Patients to Receive Visitors and to
Designate Surrogate Decision Makers for Medical Emergencies”; and
urging Governor Strickland to issue
a similar memorandum, and the
Ohio General Assembly to adopt a
Patients’ Bill of Rights to give each
patient the right to designate visitors who shall receive the same visitation privileges as the patient’s
immediate family members.

certified copies of this resolution to
President
Obama,
Governor
Ted
Strickland, the 128th Ohio General
Assembly, Equality Ohio, The Lesbian

Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives

An emergency resolution úurging
the United States Congress to pass
H. B. 4812 and S. B. 3206 to provide

The City Record
$23 billion in funding to state and
local government to avoid the potential layoffs of more than 300,000 education jobs nationwide, including
over 500 teachers in the Cleveland
Municipal School District.
Whereas, Senator Tom Harkin (DIA), Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and of the Senate Appropriations
panel that funds education initiatives, introduced H. B. 4812 and S.
B. 3206, the Keep Our Educators
Working Act on April 14, 2010; and
Whereas, the bill will create a $23
billion Education Jobs Fund to help
keep teachers, principals, librarians
and other school personnel on the
job as states face crippling budget
shortfalls; and
Whereas, the bill will help avoid
a nationwide massive wave of layoffs in our schools and institutions
of higher learning that could weaken our economic recovery and cause
serious damage to our education
system; and
Whereas, the Keep Our Educators
Working Act will create an Education Jobs Fund modeled after the
State
Fiscal
Stabilization
Fund
(SFSF) that was established in the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (the ‘Recovery Act’); and
Whereas, the SFSF is currently
supporting more than 300,000 education jobs, such as teachers, principals,
librarians, and counselors, and is
widely credited with mitigating the
impact of the recent recession; however, even with the SFSF, schools
across the country have laid off
workers, and the job outlook is worse
for the 2010-2011 school year; and
Whereas, additional resources are
needed to help states and districts
avoid a “funding cliff” that would
result in even more layoffs; and
Whereas, the $23 billion included
in the Keep Our Educators Working
Act is roughly half of the amount
dedicated to state aid in the SFSF,
and is equal to the amount passed
by the House in its December 2009
jobs legislation; and
Whereas, funding could be used for:
• compensation and benefits and
other expenses necessary to retain
existing employees, and for the hiring of new employees, in order to
provide early childhood, elementary,
secondary, or postsecondary educational and related services; or
• on-the-job training activities for
education-related careers; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that passage is necessary to avoid
the potential layoffs of over 500
teachers in the Cleveland Municipal
School District that would devastate
the education of Cleveland’s children; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the United States Congress to pass
H. B. 4812 and S. B. 3206 to provide

matters.
Whereas, this Council desires to
issue bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed Eleven
Million Four Hundred Thousand Dollars ($11,400,000) (the “Series 2010
Bonds”) to finance the costs of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1; and
Whereas, the Series 2010 Bonds
shall be payable from and secured
by income tax revenues of the City
remaining after deposits required
under the General Bond Ordinance
(as defined in Section 2) are made
to the escrow agent for the City’s
general obligation bonds; and
Whereas, the American Recovery
and
Reinvestment
Act
of
2009
amended
the
Internal
Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Code”), to authorize new types of
obligations that may be issued on
or before January 1, 2011 by states
and political subdivisions that may
provide lower cost of financing for
public improvements, including taxable governmental bonds referred
to as “Build America Bonds” and
meeting the requirements of Section 54AA of the Code (“BABs”), of
which
one
type
is
subsidized
through
federal
tax
credits
to
investors in the bonds (“Tax Credit BABs”) and the other type is subsidized by a refundable credit paid
to the issuer of the bonds equal to
35% of the amount of interest paid
on the bonds (“Direct Payment
BABs”) and taxable governmental
bonds referred to as Recovery Zone
Economic Development Bonds and
meeting the requirements of Section 1400U-2 of the Code subsidized
by a refundable credit paid to the
issuer of the bonds equal to 45% of
the amount of the interest paid on
the bonds (“RZED Bonds”); and
Whereas, the United States Department of the Treasury made an
allocation to the City in the amount
of $16,590,000 for RZED Bonds, and
this Council by Ordinance No. 138409, passed October 5, 2009 designated the entire geographical territory

May 5, 2010
of the City as a Recovery Zone
under Section 1400U-1 of the Code;
and
Whereas, the Series 2010 Bonds
not issued as RZED Bonds may be
issued in whole or in part as Tax
Credit BABs or Direct Payment
BABs or as obligations to which Section 103 of the Code applies, the
interest on which is excluded from
gross income for federal income tax
purposes (“Tax-Exempt Bonds”); and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of this City, has certified to this Council that the estimated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be financed with
the proceeds of the Series 2010
Bonds is at least five (5) years, as
evidenced by the certificate contained in File No. 457-10-A; and
Whereas, the authorization for
issuance of the Series 2010 Bonds is
necessary to provide funds to pay
the
costs
of
certain
permanent
improvements described in Section 1
that are urgently needed for the
benefit of the City, and as a result,
this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the
immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety, and for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary to issue the Series 2010
Bonds in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed Eleven Million
Four Hundred Thousand Dollars
($11,400,000) for the purpose of providing funds to improve facilities
for the discharge of governmental
functions or for services otherwise

such other costs of the foregoing
permanent improvements that may

133.15(B) of the Ohio Revised Code
and as otherwise permitted by law.
Section 2. Authority, Security and

the Ohio Revised Code, the Charter
of the City, and this Ordinance for
the purpose stated in Section 1. The

from and secured by the income tax
revenues of the City on a basis subordinate to the security given to the
General Obligation Bonds of the

amended by Ordinance No. 1112-83
passed by the Council on May 6,

agent under the General Bond Ordinance the amount required for the
payment of debt service on the
City’s

be issued and secured under the
terms of the Trust Indenture dated

bonds, subject to certain restrictions. The Series 2008 Bonds, the
Series 2010 Bonds and any additional bonds issued under the Indenture
are collectively referred to in this
Ordinance as the “Bonds.”
Section 3. Pledge and Covenant to
Maintain Income Tax. So long as
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City pledges the
municipal income taxes of the City
and grants a lien thereon, subordinate to the lien granted in the General Bond Ordinance as security for
the General Obligation Bonds of the
City issued and outstanding under
the General Bond Ordinance, to the
full extent required to meet debt
charges
payable
on
the
Bonds
issued and outstanding, from time to
time, under the Indenture. The City
covenants to appropriate annually
sufficient amounts from the income
taxes to pay all debt charges on the
General Obligation Bonds, the Bonds
outstanding under the Indenture,
any Parity Obligations and the Unrestricted Income Tax Obligations
(each as defined in the Indenture).
The City further covenants that so
long as any Bonds are outstanding
under the Indenture, the City shall
not repeal or amend, or suffer the
repeal of, any ordinance for the levy
or collection of its income taxes in
any manner or to such extent that
the City would not be able to meet
its obligations to the holders of the
Bonds.
Section 4. Terms of the Series 2010
Bonds. The Series 2010 Bonds shall
be issued in fully registered form.
The Series 2010 Bonds may be

or exchangeable (except for transfer to another Depository or its nominee) without further action by the
City pursuant to the provisions of

619

15
the Indenture and the Second Supplement identified in Section 7. The
Series 2010 Bonds shall be designated “Public Facilities Improvement
Bonds, Series 2010” and may contain
such further designation as provided in the Certificate of Award identified below. The Series 2010 Bonds
shall be issued in one lot as fully
registered Series 2010 Bonds in
denominations of $5,000 or any
whole multiple thereof. The Series
2010 Bonds shall be numbered as
determined
by
the
Director
of

other date specified in the certificate of award providing for the
final terms of the Series 2010 Bonds
and the sale of the Series 2010
Bonds in accordance with this Ordinance (the “Certificate of Award”).
Notwithstanding and as an exception to Ordinance No. 1756-09, as may
be amended, the respective principal
amounts, if any, of the Series 2010
Bonds to be issued as Tax-Exempt
Bonds, Direct Payment BABs, Tax
Credit BABs and RZED Bonds shall
be determined by the Director of
Finance, based on the advice of a
financial advisor, in the Certificate
of Award, having due regard to the
best interest of and financial advantages to the City; provided that the
aggregate
principal
amount
of
Series 2010 Bonds issued as TaxExempt
Bonds,
Direct
Payment
BABs, Tax Credit BABs and RZED
Bonds; shall not exceed the amount
stated in Section 1. The Series 2010
Bonds shall bear interest from their
date until the principal amount is
paid at the rate or rates per year
specified
in
the
Certificate
of
Award, provided that the weighted
average of such rates (taking into
account the principal amount and
maturity of each Bond to which a
rate applies) shall not exceed six
percent (6%) per year if issued as
Tax-Exempt Bonds or eight percent
(8%) per year if issued as BABs or
RZED Bonds. Interest on the Series
2010 Bonds shall be payable semiannually on April 1 and October 1,
or such other dates specified in the
Certificate of Award (the “Interest
Payment Dates”).
The
Series
2010
Bonds
shall

amounts set forth in the Certificate
of Award, provided that (i) each
principal payment shall occur on an
Interest Payment Date, and (ii) the
final maturity date of the Series
2010 Bonds shall be no later than
December 31, 2019. The Series 2010
Bonds stated to mature in any year
may be issued as serial Series 2010
Bonds or as term Series 2010 Bonds
payable prior to stated maturity pursuant to sinking fund redemption
(the “Term Bonds”). The Director of
Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award whether any of
the Series 2010 Bonds shall be issued
as Term Bonds, any dates (the
“Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on
which the principal amount of the
Term Bonds shall be payable pursuant to mandatory sinking fund
installments rather than at stated
maturity and the amount of princi-

16
pal to be paid on each Mandatory
Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements”). If any of the Series 2010
Bonds are issued as Term Series
2010 Bonds, the Term Bonds shall be
redeemed pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements at a redemption price of
100 percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates. The aggregate of the moneys to be deposited
with the Trustee for payment of
principal of and interest on any
Term Bonds shall include amounts
sufficient to redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal
amount of Term Bonds payable on
those dates pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements (less the amount of any
credit as provided in the Indenture
and the Second Supplement).
The Series 2010 Bonds may be subject to redemption prior to maturity
by and at the option of the City, in
whole or in part on any date, in
whole multiples of $5,000, on the
redemption dates and at the redemption prices specified in the Certificate of Award, plus, in each case,
accrued interest to the redemption
date. Based on the written advice of
a financial advisor, the Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that it is in the
best interests of the City (i) for
some or all of the Series 2010 Bonds
not to be callable prior to their stated maturity, and (ii) for a premium
to be payable on the redemption of
any Series 2010 Bonds calculated in
a manner to make the bondholder
whole for the loss of the investment
or calculated as a percentage in
excess of 100% of the principal
amount redeemed.
If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the City
may have the option to purchase
any Bond which is redeemable by
optional redemption at a purchase
price not less than the redemption
price that would be payable if that
Bond were called for optional redemption on the date of the proposed purchase. That election shall
be exercised as provided in the Second Supplement.
If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the Series
2010 Bonds may be secured by a
Debt Service Reserve Fund to be
held by the Trustee under the
Indenture. The principal amount of
the Series 2010 Bonds may include
provision for funding the Debt Service Reserve Fund from the proceeds of the Bonds, subject to compliance with applicable federal tax
laws.

Dollars
($11,400,000)
(the

in a certificate providing for the

May 5, 2010
final terms of the Notes and the sale
of the Notes and signed by the
Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate of Award”). The Notes, if

year, and shall be payable on the
date or dates, as shall be determined
by the Director of Finance of the
City in the Note Certificate of
Award; shall be dated their date of
issuance; shall mature on the date
set forth in the Note Certificate of
Award; shall be subject to redemption by the City at any time prior
to maturity without penalty, unless
the Director of Finance, based on
the advice of a financial advisor,

interest of the City in order to

Notes, that the Notes not be redeemable prior to maturity or that
a premium be paid on their prior redemption; shall be designated “Public Facilities Improvement Bond
Anticipation Notes” or as otherwise
provided in the Note Certificate of
Award; shall be issued in such numbers and denominations as may be
requested by the Note Purchaser
(hereinafter defined); and shall be

(which may be in a book entry only
system). The provisions of Sections
9.98 to 9.983 of the Revised Code
shall apply to the Notes and pursuant to that authority and this
Ordinance, the Director of Finance
may determine in the Certificate of
Award, based on the written advice
of a financial advisor, that the
City’s best interests will be served
by causing all or a portion of the
Notes to be obligations bearing
interest at variable rates. If the
Director of Finance so determines,
then the Director of Finance shall
specify in the Certificate of Award
the method and procedure by which
the variable rate of interest to be
borne by the variable rate Notes
shall be determined; provided that
the variable rate Notes shall not
bear interest at a rate in excess of
twenty-five percent (25%) per year.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into agreements in
connection with the delivery of the
variable rate Notes, and from time
to time thereafter so long as the
variable rate Notes are outstanding,
with providers of Credit Support
Instruments (as defined in Section
11) and others as may be determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
financial advisor, to be necessary
or appropriate to provide for the
method of determining the variable
interest rates, permitting holders
the right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support for the payment of the variable rate Notes upon
tender for purchase or redemption,
and providing for the repayment by
the City of any amounts drawn
under the Credit Support Instrument. The Trustee shall be the
authenticating
agent,
registrar,
transfer agent and paying agent for
the Notes. The Notes shall be signed
by the officials of the City and in
the manner set forth in the Indenture. The Notes shall first be offered
for purchase to the Trustees of the
Sinking Fund and, if not purchased

Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased for
that Account, shall be sold at not
less than par and accrued interest
to one or more firms that have proposed to underwrite the Notes and
have been selected by the Director
of Finance based on an evaluation
of the qualifications of those firms
(the “Note Purchaser”) in the principal amount set forth in a certificate of award to be executed by the
Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate of Award”). The proceeds of
such sale shall be paid into the
proper fund or funds set forth in the
Note Certificate of Award and used
for the purpose for which the Notes
are being issued under the provisions of this Ordinance.

Ord. No. 458-10.
By Council Member Sweeney (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the issuance and sale of bonds in
the maximum principal amount of
$8,900,000 for the purpose of providing funds to improve municipal
parks and recreation facilities and
authorizing related matters.
Whereas, this Council desires to
issue bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed Eight Million Nine Hundred Thousand Dollars
($8,900,000) (the “Series 2010 Bonds”)
to finance the costs of certain permanent improvements described in
Section 1; and
Whereas, the Series 2010 Bonds
shall be payable from and secured
by income tax revenues of the City
remaining after deposits required
under the General Bond Ordinance
(as defined in Section 2) are made
to the escrow agent for the City’s
general obligation bonds; and
Whereas, the American Recovery
and
Reinvestment
Act
of
2009
amended the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), to
authorize new types of obligations
that may be issued on or before January 1, 2011 by states and political
subdivisions that may provide lower
cost of financing for public improvements, including taxable governmental bonds referred to as “Build
America Bonds” and meeting the
requirements of Section 54AA of the
Code (“BABs”), of which one type is
subsidized through federal tax credits to investors in the bonds (“Tax
Credit BABs”) and the other type is
subsidized by a refundable credit
paid to the issuer of the bonds equal
to 35% of the amount of interest
paid on the bonds (“Direct Payment
BABs”) and taxable governmental
bonds referred to as Recovery Zone
Economic Development Bonds and
meeting the requirements of Section
1400U-2 of the Code subsidized by a
refundable credit paid to the issuer
of the bonds equal to 45% of the
amount of the interest paid on the
bonds (“RZED Bonds”); and
Whereas, the United States Department of the Treasury made an
allocation to the City in the amount
of $16,590,000 for RZED Bonds, and
this Council by Ordinance No. 138409, passed October 5, 2009 designated the entire geographical territory
of the City as a Recovery Zone
under Section 1400U-1 of the Code;
and
Whereas, the Series 2010 Bonds
not issued as RZED Bonds may be
issued in whole or in part as Tax
Credit BABs or Direct Payment
BABs or as obligations to which Section 103 of the Code applies, the
interest on which is excluded from
gross income for federal income tax
purposes (“Tax-Exempt Bonds”); and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of this City, has certified to this Council that the estimated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be financed with

The City Record
the proceeds of the Series 2010
Bonds is at least five (5) years, as
evidenced by the certificate contained in File No. 458-10-A; and
Whereas, the authorization for
issuance of the Series 2010 Bonds is
necessary to provide funds to pay
the costs of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1
that are urgently needed for the
benefit of the City, and as a result,
this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the
immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety, and for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

from and secured by the income tax
revenues of the City on a basis subordinate to the security given to the
General Obligation Bonds of the
City (“General Obligation Bonds”)
under Ordinance No. 1749-80 passed

amended by Ordinance No. 1112-83
passed by the Council on May 6,
1983,

Series 2010 Bonds shall be payable
from income tax collections remaining after depositing with the escrow
agent under the General Bond Ordinance the amount required for the
payment of debt service on the
City’s
General
Obligation
Bonds
issued and outstanding, from time to

be issued and secured under the
terms of the Trust Indenture dated
as of April 1, 2008 (the “Indenture”)
between the City and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the
“Trustee”). The Indenture secures
five series of Subordinate Lien
Income Tax Bonds issued on May 1,
2008 (the “Series 2008 Bonds”) and
permits the issuance of additional
bonds, subject to certain restrictions. The Series 2008 Bonds, the
Series 2010 Bonds and any additional bonds issued under the Indenture
are collectively referred to in this
Ordinance as the “Bonds.”
Section 3. Pledge and Covenant to
Maintain Income Tax. So long as
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City pledges the
municipal income taxes of the City
and grants a lien thereon, subordinate to the lien granted in the General Bond Ordinance as security for
the General Obligation Bonds of the
City issued and outstanding under
the General Bond Ordinance, to the
full extent required to meet debt
charges
payable
on
the
Bonds
issued and outstanding, from time to
time, under the Indenture. The City
covenants to appropriate annually
sufficient amounts from the income
taxes to pay all debt charges on the
General Obligation Bonds, the Bonds
outstanding under the Indenture,
any Parity Obligations and the
Unrestricted Income Tax Obligations (each as defined in the Indenture). The City further covenants
that so long as any Bonds are outstanding under the Indenture, the
City shall not repeal or amend, or
suffer the repeal of, any ordinance
for the levy or collection of its
income taxes in any manner or to
such extent that the City would not
be able to meet its obligations to the
holders of the Bonds.
Section 4. Terms of the Series 2010
Bonds. The Series 2010 Bonds shall
be issued in fully registered form.
The Series 2010 Bonds may be
issued in one or more series or subseries. The Series 2010 Bonds initially shall be delivered only in
book-entry form, shall be registered
in the name of the Depository (as
defined in the Indenture) or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository, and shall not be transferable
or exchangeable (except for transfer to another Depository or its nominee) without further action by the
City pursuant to the provisions of
the Indenture and the Second Supplement identified in Section 7. The
Series 2010 Bonds shall be designated “Parks and Recreation Facilities Improvement Bonds, Series 2010”
and may contain such further designation as provided in the Certificate of Award identified below. The
Series 2010 Bonds shall be issued in
one lot as fully registered Series

20
2010 Bonds in denominations of
$5,000 or any whole multiple thereof. The Series 2010 Bonds shall be
numbered as determined by the
Director of Finance. The Series 2010
Bonds shall be signed by the officials of the City and in the manner
set forth in the Indenture.
The Series 2010 Bonds shall be
dated as of May 15, 2010, or such
other date specified in the certificate of award providing for the
final terms of the Series 2010 Bonds
and the sale of the Series 2010
Bonds in accordance with this Ordinance (the “Certificate of Award”).
Notwithstanding and as an exception to Ordinance No. 1756-09, as may
be amended, the respective principal
amounts, if any, of the Series 2010
Bonds to be issued as Tax-Exempt
Bonds, Direct Payment BABs, Tax
Credit BABs and RZED Bonds shall
be determined by the Director of
Finance, based on the advice of a
financial advisor, in the Certificate
of Award, having due regard to the
best interest of and financial advantages to the City; provided that the
aggregate
principal
amount
of
Series 2010 Bonds issued as TaxExempt
Bonds,
Direct
Payment
BABs, Tax Credit BABs and RZED
Bonds shall not exceed the amount
stated in Section 1. The Series 2010
Bonds shall bear interest from their
date until the principal amount is
paid at the rate or rates per year
specified
in
the
Certificate
of
Award, provided that the weighted
average of such rates (taking into
account the principal amount and
maturity of each Bond to which a
rate applies) shall not exceed six
percent (6%) per year if issued as
Tax-Exempt Bonds or eight percent
(8%) per year if issued as BABs or
RZED Bonds. Interest on the Series
2010 Bonds shall be payable semiannually on April 1 and October 1,
or such other dates specified in
the Certificate of Award (the “Interest Payment Dates”).
The
Series
2010
Bonds
shall
mature in the years and principal
amounts set forth in the Certificate
of Award, provided that (i) each
principal payment shall occur on an
Interest Payment Date, and (ii) the
final maturity date of the Series
2010 Bonds shall be no later than
December 31, 2031. The Series 2010
Bonds stated to mature in any year
may be issued as serial Series 2010
Bonds or as term Series 2010 Bonds
payable prior to stated maturity pursuant to sinking fund redemption
(the “Term Bonds”). The Director of
Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award whether any of
the Series 2010 Bonds shall be issued
as Term Bonds, any dates (the
“Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on
which the principal amount of the
Term Bonds shall be payable pursuant to mandatory sinking fund
installments rather than at stated
maturity and the amount of principal to be paid on each Mandatory
Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements”). If any of the Series 2010
Bonds are issued as Term Series
2010 Bonds, the Term Bonds shall be
redeemed pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements at a redemption price of
100 percent of the principal amount

The City Record
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates. The aggregate of the moneys to be deposited
with the Trustee for payment of
principal of and interest on any
Term Bonds shall include amounts
sufficient to redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal
amount of Term Bonds payable on
those dates pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements (less the amount of any
credit as provided in the Indenture
and the Second Supplement).
The Series 2010 Bonds may be subject to redemption prior to maturity
by and at the option of the City, in
whole or in part on any date, in
whole multiples of $5,000, on the
redemption dates and at the redemption prices specified in the Certificate of Award, plus, in each case,
accrued interest to the redemption
date. Based on the written advice of
a financial advisor, the Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that it is in the
best interests of the City (i) for
some or all of the Series 2010 Bonds
not to be callable prior to their stated maturity, and (ii) for a premium
to be payable on the redemption of
any Series 2010 Bonds calculated in
a manner to make the bondholder
whole for the loss of the investment
or calculated as a percentage in
excess of 100% of the principal
amount redeemed.
If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the City
may have the option to purchase
any Bond which is redeemable by
optional redemption at a purchase
price not less than the redemption
price that would be payable if that
Bond
were
called
for
optional
redemption on the date of the proposed purchase. That election shall
be exercised as provided in the Second Supplement.
If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the Series
2010 Bonds may be secured by a
Debt Service Reserve Fund to be
held by the Trustee under the Indenture. The principal amount of the
Series 2010 Bonds may include provision for funding the Debt Service
Reserve Fund from the proceeds of
the Bonds, subject to compliance
with applicable federal tax laws.
Section 5. Sale of Series 2010
Bonds. The Series 2010 Bonds shall
first be offered for purchase to the
Trustees of the Sinking Fund and,
if not purchased by them, shall be

2010 Bonds and have been selected

Eight Million Nine Hundred Thousand
Dollars
($8,900,000)
(the
“Notes”) upon the direction of the

set forth in the Note Certificate of
Award; shall be subject to redemption by the City at any time prior
to maturity without penalty, unless
the Director of Finance, based on

interest of the City in order to
enhance the marketability of the
Notes, that the Notes not be redeemable prior to maturity or that
a premium be paid on their prior
redemption;

be
designated
“Parks and Recreation Facilities

the Note Certificate of Award; shall
be issued in such numbers and

defined); and shall be issued in
fully registered form (which may be

provisions of Sections 9.98 to 9.983 of
the Revised Code shall apply to the
Notes and pursuant to that authority and this Ordinance, the Director
of Finance may determine in the
Certificate of Award, based on the
written advice of a financial advisor, that the City’s best interests
will be served by causing all or a
portion of the Notes to be obligations bearing interest at variable
rates. If the Director of Finance so
determines, then the Director of
Finance shall specify in the Certificate of Award the method and procedure by which the variable rate of
interest to be borne by the variable
rate Notes shall be determined; provided that the variable rate Notes
shall not bear interest at a rate in
excess of twenty-five percent (25%)
per year. The Director of Finance is
authorized to enter into agreements
in connection with the delivery of
the variable rate Notes, and from
time to time thereafter so long as
the variable rate Notes are outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support Instruments (as defined in
Section 11) and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a financial advisor, to be
necessary or appropriate to provide
for the method of determining the
variable interest rates, permitting
holders the right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support
for the payment of the variable rate
Notes upon tender for purchase or
redemption, and providing for the
repayment by the City of any
amounts drawn under the Credit
Support Instrument. The Trustee
shall be the authenticating agent,
registrar, transfer agent and paying
agent for the Notes. The Notes shall
be signed by the officials of the City
and in the manner set forth in the
Indenture. The Notes shall first be

the Treasury Investment Account
for purchase and, if not purchased
for that Account, shall be sold at not
less than par and accrued interest
to one or more firms that have proposed to underwrite the Notes and
have been selected by the Director
of Finance based on an evaluation
of the qualifications of those firms
(the “Note Purchaser”) in the prin-

625

21
cipal amount set forth in a certificate of award to be executed by the
Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate of Award”). The proceeds of
such sale shall be paid into the
proper fund or funds set forth in the
Note Certificate of Award and used
for the purpose for which the Notes
are being issued under the provisions of this Ordinance.
Section 9. Official Statement; Continuing Disclosure. If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a

authorized to prepare or cause to be
prepared on behalf of the City an
Official Statement with respect to
the Notes or the Series 2010 Bonds,

City that such disclosure document
is “deemed final” by the City within the meaning of Securities and
Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12

required for purposes of the SEC
Rule. In order to describe and specify certain terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Director of
Finance is authorized and directed
to prepare, or cause to be prepared,
and to sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the
continuing
disclosure
agreement
made by the City for the benefit of
the holders and beneficial owners of
the Notes or the Series 2010 Bonds,

the City would be required to incur
to perform it. The Director of

shall be payable from and secured

Act
of
2009
amended the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), to
authorize new types of obligations
that may be issued on or before January 1, 2011 by states and political
subdivisions that may provide lower
cost of financing for public improvements, including taxable governmental bonds referred to as “Build
America Bonds” and meeting the
requirements of Section 54AA of the
Code (“BABs”), of which one type is
subsidized through federal tax credits to investors in the bonds (“Tax
Credit BABs”) and the other type is
subsidized by a refundable credit
paid to the issuer of the bonds equal
to 35% of the amount of interest
paid on the bonds (“Direct Payment
BABs”) and taxable governmental

gross income for federal income tax
purposes (“Tax-Exempt Bonds”); and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of this City, has certified to this Council that the estimated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be financed with
the proceeds of the Series 2010
Bonds is at least five (5) years, as
evidenced by the certificate contained in File No. 459-10-A; and
Whereas, the authorization for

benefit of the City, and as a result,
this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the
immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety, and for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary to issue the Series 2010
Bonds in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed Eight Million
Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars
($8,700,000) for the purpose of providing funds to improve the municipal street system and related facilities, including streets, expressways,
roadways,
driveways,
retaining
walls,
underground

sidewalks and pedestrian walkways, by

and installing signs, signals, markings and other devices for traffic
control purposes, together with all
necessary and incidental appurtenances, and to pay any capitalized
interest and all expenses incurred in
connection with the issuance of the
securities, including all financing
costs within the meaning of Section
133.01(K) of the Revised Code and
such other costs of the foregoing
permanent improvements that may
be financed with the proceeds of
securities as permitted by Section
133.15(B) of the Ohio Revised Code
and as otherwise permitted by law.
Section 2. Authority, Security and
Source of Payment. The Series 2010
Bonds shall be issued pursuant to
the Ohio Constitution, Chapter 133 of
the Ohio Revised Code, the Charter
of the City, and this Ordinance for
the purpose stated in Section 1. The
Series 2010 Bonds shall be payable
from and secured by the income tax
revenues of the City on a basis subordinate to the security given to the
General Obligation Bonds of the
City (“General Obligation Bonds”)
under Ordinance No. 1749-80 passed
by the Council on October 8, 1980, as
amended by Ordinance No. 1112-83
passed by the Council on May 6,
1983,
and
Ordinance
No.
944-96,
passed by the Council on June 10,
1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so
amended and as the same may further be amended from time to time
in accordance with its provisions, is
referred to as the “General Bond
Ordinance”). The debt service on the
Series 2010 Bonds shall be payable
from income tax collections remaining after depositing with the escrow
agent under the General Bond Ordinance the amount required for the

24
payment of debt service on the
City’s
General
Obligation
Bonds
issued and outstanding, from time to
time, under the General Bond Ordinance. The Series 2010 Bonds shall
be issued and secured under the
terms of the Trust Indenture dated
as of April 1, 2008 (the “Indenture”)
between the City and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the
“Trustee”). The Indenture secures
five series of Subordinate Lien
Income Tax Bonds issued on May 1,
2008 (the “Series 2008 Bonds”) and
permits the issuance of additional
bonds, subject to certain restrictions. The Series 2008 Bonds, the
Series 2010 Bonds and any additional bonds issued under the Indenture
are collectively referred to in this
Ordinance as the “Bonds.”
Section 3. Pledge and Covenant to
Maintain Income Tax. So long as
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City pledges the
municipal income taxes of the City
and grants a lien thereon, subordinate to the lien granted in the General Bond Ordinance as security for
the General Obligation Bonds of the
City issued and outstanding under
the General Bond Ordinance, to the
full extent required to meet debt
charges payable on the Bonds issued
and outstanding, from time to time,
under the Indenture. The City covenants to appropriate annually sufficient amounts from the income taxes
to pay all debt charges on the General Obligation Bonds, the Bonds outstanding under the Indenture, any
Parity Obligations and the Unrestricted
Income
Tax
Obligations
(each as defined in the Indenture).
The City further covenants that so
long as any Bonds are outstanding
under the Indenture, the City shall
not repeal or amend, or suffer the
repeal of, any ordinance for the levy
or collection of its income taxes in
any manner or to such extent that
the City would not be able to meet
its obligations to the holders of the
Bonds.
Section 4. Terms of the Series 2010
Bonds. The Series 2010 Bonds shall
be issued in fully registered form.
The Series 2010 Bonds may be issued
in one or more series or subseries.
The Series 2010 Bonds initially shall
be delivered only in book-entry form,
shall be registered in the name of the
Depository (as defined in the Indenture) or its nominee, as registered
owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository, and shall not
be
transferable
or
exchangeable
(except for transfer to another Depository or its nominee) without further
action by the City pursuant to the
provisions of the Indenture and the
Second Supplement identified in Section 7. The Series 2010 Bonds shall be
designated “Bridges and Roadways
Improvement Bonds, Series 2010” and
may contain such further designation
as provided in the Certificate of
Award identified below. The Series
2010 Bonds shall be issued in one lot
as fully registered Series 2010 Bonds
in denominations of $5,000 or any
whole multiple thereof. The Series
2010 Bonds shall be numbered as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance. The Series 2010 Bonds shall
be signed by the officials of the City
and in the manner set forth in the
Indenture.

The City Record
The Series 2010 Bonds shall be
dated as of May 15, 2010, or such
other date specified in the certificate of award providing for the
final terms of the Series 2010 Bonds
and the sale of the Series 2010
Bonds in accordance with this Ordinance (the “Certificate of Award”).
Notwithstanding and as an exception to Ordinance No. 1756-09, as may
be amended, the respective principal
amounts, if any, of the Series 2010
Bonds to be issued as Tax-Exempt
Bonds, Direct Payment BABs, Tax
Credit BABs and RZED Bonds shall
be determined by the Director of
Finance, based on the advice of a
financial advisor, in the Certificate
of Award, having due regard to the
best interest of and financial advantages to the City; provided that the
aggregate
principal
amount
of
Series 2010 Bonds issued as TaxExempt
Bonds,
Direct
Payment
BABs, Tax Credit BABs and RZED
Bonds shall not exceed the amount
stated in Section 1. The Series 2010
Bonds shall bear interest from their
date until the principal amount is
paid at the rate or rates per year
specified
in
the
Certificate
of
Award, provided that the weighted
average of such rates (taking into
account the principal amount and
maturity of each Bond to which a
rate applies) shall not exceed six
percent (6%) per year if issued as
Tax-Exempt Bonds or eight percent
(8%) per year if issued as BABs or
RZED Bonds. Interest on the Series
2010 Bonds shall be payable semiannually on April 1 and October 1,
or such other dates specified in the
Certificate of Award (the “Interest
Payment Dates”).
The
Series
2010
Bonds
shall
mature in the years and principal
amounts set forth in the Certificate
of Award, provided that (i) each
principal payment shall occur on an
Interest Payment Date, and (ii) the
final maturity date of the Series
2010 Bonds shall be no later than
December 31, 2027. The Series 2010
Bonds stated to mature in any year
may be issued as serial Series 2010
Bonds or as term Series 2010 Bonds
payable prior to stated maturity pursuant to sinking fund redemption
(the “Term Bonds”). The Director of
Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award whether any of
the Series 2010 Bonds shall be issued
as Term Bonds, any dates (the
“Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on
which the principal amount of the
Term Bonds shall be payable pursuant to mandatory sinking fund
installments rather than at stated
maturity and the amount of principal to be paid on each Mandatory
Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements”). If any of the Series 2010
Bonds are issued as Term Series
2010 Bonds, the Term Bonds shall be
redeemed pursuant to the Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements at a redemption price
of 100 percent of the principal
amount
redeemed,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date, on
the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to be
deposited with the Trustee for payment of principal of and interest on
any
Term
Bonds
shall
include
amounts sufficient to redeem on the

628

May 5, 2010
Mandatory Redemption Dates the
principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided in
the Indenture and the Second Supplement).
The Series 2010 Bonds may be subject to redemption prior to maturity
by and at the option of the City, in
whole or in part on any date, in
whole multiples of $5,000, on the
redemption dates and at the redemption prices specified in the Certificate of Award, plus, in each case,
accrued interest to the redemption
date. Based on the written advice of
a financial advisor, the Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that it is in the
best interests of the City (i) for
some or all of the Series 2010 Bonds
not to be callable prior to their stated maturity, and (ii) for a premium
to be payable on the redemption of
any Series 2010 Bonds calculated in
a manner to make the bondholder
whole for the loss of the investment
or calculated as a percentage in
excess of 100% of the principal
amount redeemed.
If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the City
may have the option to purchase
any Bond which is redeemable by
optional redemption at a purchase
price not less than the redemption
price that would be payable if that
Bond
were
called
for
optional
redemption on the date of the proposed purchase. That election shall
be exercised as provided in the Second Supplement.
If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the Series
2010 Bonds may be secured by a
Debt Service Reserve Fund to be
held by the Trustee under the Indenture. The principal amount of the
Series 2010 Bonds may include provision for funding the Debt Service
Reserve Fund from the proceeds of
the Bonds, subject to compliance
with applicable federal tax laws.
Section 5. Sale of Series 2010
Bonds. The Series 2010 Bonds shall
first be offered for purchase to the
Trustees of the Sinking Fund and,
if not purchased by them, shall be
offered to the Treasury Investment
Account for purchase and, if not purchased for that Account, shall be
sold to one or more firms that have
proposed to underwrite the Series
2010 Bonds and have been selected

Law, setting forth the terms and
conditions on which the City agrees
to sell the Series 2010 Bonds and the
Original Purchaser agrees to buy
the Series 2010 Bonds on terms consistent with this Ordinance and the
Indenture, that are not substantially adverse to the City and that are
approved by the Director of Finance
on behalf of the City, all of which
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Bond Purchase
Agreement or amendments to the
Bond Purchase Agreement by the
Director of Finance. It is determined
that the terms of the Series 2010

and as may be provided in or pursuant to the Certificate of Award,

the City and in compliance with all

Section
8.
Bond
Anticipation

money in anticipation of the issuance of the Series 2010 Bonds for
the purpose set forth in Section 1,
notes of the City may be issued in
an aggregate principal amount not
to exceed Eight Million Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars ($8,700,000)
(the “Notes”) upon the direction of
the Director of Finance to be set
forth in a certificate providing for
the final terms of the Notes and the
sale of the Notes and signed by the
Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate of Award”). The Notes, if

of the City in the Note Certificate
of Award; shall be dated their date

redemption by the City at any time
prior to maturity without penalty,
unless the Director of Finance,
based on the advice of a financial

629

25
advisor, determines that it is in the
best interest of the City in order to
enhance the marketability of the
Notes,
that
the
Notes
not
be
redeemable prior to maturity or
that a premium be paid on their
prior redemption; shall be designated
“Bridges

Roadways
Improvement
Bond
Anticipation
Notes” or as otherwise provided in
the Note Certificate of Award; shall
be issued in such numbers and
denominations as may be requested by the Note Purchaser (hereinafter
defined);
and
shall
be
issued in fully registered form
(which may be in a book entry
only system). The provisions of
Sections 9.98 to 9.983 of the Revised
Code shall apply to the Notes and
pursuant to that authority and this
Ordinance, the Director of Finance
may determine in the Certificate of
Award, based on the written advice
of a financial advisor, that the
City’s best interests will be served
by causing all or a portion of the
Notes to be obligations bearing
interest at variable rates. If the
Director of Finance so determines,
then the Director of Finance shall
specify in the Certificate of Award
the method and procedure by which
the variable rate of interest to be
borne by the variable rate Notes
shall be determined; provided that
the variable rate Notes shall not
bear interest at a rate in excess of
twenty-five percent (25%) per year.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into agreements in
connection with the delivery of the
variable rate Notes, and from time
to time thereafter so long as the
variable rate Notes are outstanding, with providers of Credit Support Instruments (as defined in
Section 11) and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a financial advisor, to be
necessary or appropriate to provide
for the method of determining the
variable interest rates, permitting
holders the right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support
for the payment of the variable
rate Notes upon tender for purchase or redemption, and providing
for the repayment by the City of
any amounts drawn under the Credit Support Instrument. The Trustee
shall be the authenticating agent,
registrar, transfer agent and paying agent for the Notes. The Notes
shall be signed by the officials of
the City and in the manner set
forth in the Indenture. The Notes
shall first be offered for purchase
to the Trustees of the Sinking
Fund and, if not purchased by
them, shall be offered to the Treasury Investment Account for purchase and, if not purchased for that
Account, shall be sold at not less
than par and accrued interest to
one or more firms that have proposed to underwrite the Notes and
have been selected by the Director
of Finance based on an evaluation
of the qualifications of those firms
(the “Note Purchaser”) in the principal amount set forth in a certificate of award to be executed by the
Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate of Award”). The proceeds
of such sale shall be paid into the
proper fund or funds set forth in

26
the Note Certificate of Award and
used for the purpose for which the
Notes are being issued under the
provisions of this Ordinance.
Section 9. Official Statement; Continuing Disclosure. If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a
disclosure document (each, an “Official Statement”) is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
sale of the Notes or the Series 2010
Bonds, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare or cause to
be prepared on behalf of the City
an Official Statement with respect
to the Notes or the Series 2010
Bonds, as the case may be, and any
necessary supplements and to authorize the use and distribution of
each Official Statement and any
supplements.
The
Director
of
Finance is authorized to sign on
behalf of the City and in her official capacity each Official Statement and any supplements approved by her. The Director of
Finance is authorized to sign and
deliver on behalf of the City and
in her official capacity such certificates in connection with the
accuracy of each Official Statement
and any supplements as may, in
her judgment, be necessary or appropriate. The Director of Finance
is also authorized to determine and
certify on behalf of the City that
such
disclosure
document
is
“deemed final” by the City within
the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12
the “SEC Rule.”) The Director of
Finance is authorized to contract
for services for the production and
distribution
of
preliminary
and
final Official Statements, including
by printed and electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Notes or the Series 2010
Bonds, the City agrees, in accordance with, and as the only obligated person with respect to the
Notes and the Series 2010 Bonds
under the SEC Rule, to provide or
cause to be provided such financial
information and operating data and
notices, in such manner as may be
required for purposes of the SEC
Rule. In order to describe and specify certain terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Director of
Finance is authorized and directed
to prepare, or cause to be prepared,
and to sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the
continuing
disclosure
agreement
made by the City for the benefit of
the holders and beneficial owners of
the Notes or the Series 2010 Bonds,
as the case may be, in accordance
with the SEC Rule. The performance
of that agreement shall be subject
to the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to
establish procedures in order to
ensure compliance by the City with
its continuing disclosure agreement,
including the timely provision of
information and notices.
