Ord. No. 496-10.
By Council Member Sweeney (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Finance to enter
into an agreement with Sunpu-Opto
Semiconductor, Ltd., a Chinese company, relating to locating its assembly, distribution, customer service,
manufacturing, and research and
development facilities in Cleveland,
creating new jobs, and the purchase
by requirement contract of LED
bulbs, fluorescent tubes, streetlights
and traffic lights for the various
departments of City government for
a period of up to ten years.
Whereas, Sunpu-Opto Semiconductor, Ltd. (“Sunpu”), a Chinese company, is a manufacturer specializing
in LED lighting products, including
products for home, office, industrial,
street lighting, and traffic signal
uses; and
Whereas, Sunpu has proposed to
locate its assembly, distribution,
customer service, support center,
manufacturing, and research and development facilities in the City of
Cleveland, the first such facilities
owned by Sunpu in the United
States; and
Whereas, Sunpu anticipates that
Sunpu’s
facilities
will
generate
approximately 350 new jobs in the
City of Cleveland in the next five
years; and
Whereas, Sunpu has proposed to
supply the City’s requirements for
LED streetlights, LED fluorescent
tubes, LED bulbs, and LED traffic
lights meeting the City’s standards
(“LED products”) for use by the various municipal departments for a
period of up to ten years at or below
the price for all other comparable
LED products; and
Whereas, this Council determines
that the economic development benefits flowing to the City of Cleveland from the proposed facilities
located in the City by Sunpu, as well
as its pricing terms for the purchase
of LED products, are non-competitive, unique, and cannot be obtained
from any other source; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
an agreement with Sunpu-Opto Semiconductor, Ltd., relating to building
and constructing their first United
States facilities in the City of Cleveland and the furnishing of the City’s
requirements for LED products for
use by the various divisions of City
government for a period of up to 10
years at or below pricing for all
other LED comparable products, and
including the following milestones
and terms:
a. Sunpu shall work diligently
toward the location of its first
assembly and distribution facilities
and customer service and support
center for LED products in the United States to Cleveland within 18
months of the execution of the
agreement;

b. Sunpu shall work diligently
toward the location of its first manufacturing facility for LED products
in the United States to Cleveland
within 36 months of the execution of
the agreement;
c. Sunpu shall work diligently
toward the location of its first
research and development facility
in the United States within 60
months of the execution of the
agreement;
d. Sunpu shall work diligently
toward the creation of a minimum
of 350 new jobs at its facilities in
Cleveland within 60 months of the
execution of the agreement;
e. Sunpu shall supply Cleveland
with its requirements for LED products for use by the various divisions
of City government for a period of
up to 10 years at or below comparable LED pricing for all other LED
products as periodically determined
by the City’s Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies;
f. Provided that Sunpu complies
with its milestones and other representations under the agreement, the
City shall purchase its requirements
for LED products for a period of 10
years
commencing
when
Sunpu
begins assembly operations in the
City; and
g. Such other terms and provisions
as the Director of Law determines
necessary to protect and benefit the
City’s interests.
Section 2. That the costs of the
contract for the purchase of LED
products shall be charged against
the proper appropriation accounts
and the Director of Finance shall
certify the amount of the initial purchase,
which
purchase,
together
with all later purchases, shall be
made on order of the Commissioner
of Purchases and Supplies under a
requisition against the contract or
contracts certified by the Director of
Finance.
Section 3. That the Directors of
Finance and Public Utilities are
authorized
to
take
such
other
actions as may be necessary or
appropriate in connection with carrying out the terms of the agreement authorized in Section 1, including making purchases of Sunpu’s
LED streetlights and fluorescent
tubes to examine their applicability
to various City operations provided
that all such purchases do not exceed $50,000.
Section 4. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
