An emergency ordinance authorizing the purchase by requirement
contract of LED streetlights, LED

specified for a term of up to 10
years for the various departments of
City government.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Finance is authorized to make a
written requirement contract under
the Charter and the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, for
the requirements for a term of up to

of City government of the necessary
items of LED streetlights, LED fluorescent tube replacements, LED

and have completed LM 79 testing
to confirm the products’ conformance to City standards prior to
being furnished to the City; 2) have
completed LM 80 testing to confirm
the products’ conformance to City
standards within 24 months after
the first LED products are furnished
to the City; 3) are lead-free and

Certain Hazardous Substances in
Electrical and Electronic Equipment
Regulations
(“RoHS”);
4)
are
designed to fit the City’s existing

1285

than wiring reconfiguration, with
the exception of LED street lights
which shall be designed to fit the

without modification of the arms or
modification of the maintenance
processes and shall in other respects
meet the City’s street light specifications; 5) are, starting no later
than 18 months after execution of
the contract, assembled and distributed from the contractor’s facility
located in Cleveland and used to
supply the LED products to the City
under the contract throughout the
term; 6) are, starting no later than
36 months after execution of the
contract, manufactured at one or
more facilities located and maintained in Cleveland throughout the
remainder of the contract term; 7)
are assembled, distributed and manufactured at one or more of its

that
(a)
includes, by no later than 60 months
after execution of the contract, a
research and development function
within its Cleveland facility which
is maintained in Cleveland throughout the remainder of the contract
term, (b) employs within 60 months
after execution of the contract and
maintains in employment for the
remainder of the contract term a
minimum of 350 new jobs, and (c)
employs Cleveland residents as at
least 30% of the total number of
Ohio residents employed in the
workforce in each year of the contract; and 8) are warranted for full
replacement if the furnished products fail at any time during the
term to meet the contract specifications, to be purchased by the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies
on a unit basis for the various

The contract shall provide that

(b) with suppliers and subcontractors employed by the contractor in
the performance of its obligations to
supply LED products; 3) require its

Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, in contracts for goods
and services for contractor’s Cleveland facilities, increase the number

its own cost all suits or claims for
infringement of any patent, license,

product is at or below that of other
providers for a like product, as
determined annually by the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies, the City shall purchase that
LED product from the contractor
during the term of the contract; 4)
if any LED product is available at
a lower cost from another firm and
the contractor fails to meet that
lower cost, the City shall have the
right to purchase the lower-priced
product(s) from another supplier;
and 5) if the contractor cannot meet
the quantity or quality requirements
of the City for any LED product, the
City shall have the right to purchase that LED product from another supplier. The Director Finance

the evaluation of product pricing by
the Commissioner of Purchases and
Supplies and the City’s procurement
under the contract.
The contract shall further provide
that 1) the contractor is required to

actively
work
toward

any LED products that meet the
Standards, the City shall have the

Standards, but a like LED product
is available from another supplier at
a lower price, and the contractor
does not at least meet the lower
price, the City may purchase that
product meeting the Standards from
the other supplier; and 4) if the City
determines that a LED product
meeting the Standards is available
for purchase in the marketplace and

LED product, the City shall have the
right to purchase the LED product(s) meeting the Standards from
another supplier.
