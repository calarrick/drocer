An emergency resolution supporting United Food & Commercial
Workers Union, Local 880 members
and their families in their struggle
with Rite Aid, and urging Rite Aid to
delay its changes to healthcare, as
well as other changes, and return to
the bargaining table to resolve this
dispute in favor of affordable healthcare.
Whereas, Rite Aid has many unionized stores within the City of
Cleveland and those employees are
represented by United Food &
Commercial Workers Union, Local
880; and
Whereas, Rite Aid and Local 880
have had a long history of partnering
together; and
Whereas, as a result of that partnership the unionized employees
have received a living wage and
affordable healthcare; and
Whereas, over the three year term
of the last contract between Rite Aid
and Local 880, Rite Aid’s healthcare
costs have decreased slightly each
and every year; and
Whereas, Rite Aid has breached its
long term partnership with Local 880
and seeks to significantly increase
the cost of healthcare for its unionized workers and their families, such
that a substantial portion of those

14
workers will no longer be able to
afford healthcare coverage, thereby
increasing the public’s burden of providing healthcare to these individuals, even though Rite Aid is the third
largest drug store chain in the United
States; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
urges Rite Aid to delay implementing
its changes to healthcare and return
to the bargaining table to find a resolution to the current dispute that is
more equitable to the members represented by Local 880 within the greater
Cleveland area, so that those workers
and their families can continue to
obtain affordable healthcare, and so
that such costs are not otherwise
passed on to the public; and
Whereas, until such time as the dispute is resolved between Rite Aid and
Local 880—all Cleveland citizens are
urged, if they have prescriptions on
file at any Rite Aid, to transfer those
prescriptions to another vendor that
provides a living wage and affordable healthcare, such as Dave’s
Supermarkets, CVS and Giant Eagle;
and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
urges Cleveland citizens to participate in the National Day of Action on
December 15, 2010 in support of Rite
Aid workers represented by Local 880
and others around the country to urge
Rite Aid to provide affordable healthcare to all its employees; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports United Food & Commercial
Workers Union, Local 880 members

is hereby directed to transmit certified copies of this resolution to John

other regulations as shall be necessary to effectuate the purposes of
this chapter, including but not limited to, requirements as to the manner of display of prescription drug
prices and other information related

provisions of Section 651.02. The
Manager may grant an extension of
time for compliance with the section

compliance on or before the effective date would be impossible or create undue financial hardship in the
particular instance.

The Manager of Fair Housing and
Consumer Affairs is charged with

December 15, 2010

to further the purposes of this chapter.

provide for binding arbitration of
the dispute arising from the complaint. Any such arbitration that
results from a conciliation agreement may award appropriate relief,
including monetary relief.

owned or maintained by the City of Cleveland; or (2) located on any other property and requires for its successful execution, the provision and coordination of municipal services to a degree significantly over and above that which the City
of Cleveland routinely provides under ordinary everyday circumstances.
City buildings, parks and all other real estate under control of the Director which have been constructed or maintained
for the benefit of the public shall be for the use of the public in general under the Charter and ordinances of the City of
Cleveland. To that end, no person or entity shall be given any special or exclusive privilege to use any public property
under the control of the Director without first obtaining a permit under this section. Additionally, the Director shall
ensure that proper coordination occurs among necessary city departments to facilitate the use of city streets for special
event activities including parades, marathons, foot races/bike-a-thons, and all other events requiring closure of a rightof-way.
All closures of city streets in conjunction with a special event shall be approved by the Police Traffic Commissioner,

regulations shall become effective ten days after publication in the City Record and shall be enforced as ordinances of
the City.
(b) The Director may place reasonable time restrictions on the issuance of special event permits, including without
limitation a prior notice requirement, first-come, first-served scheduling, limitations on frequency of use, and limitation
of permits to normal operating hours for the city property. The Director’s prior notice requirement may not exceed five
days for special event permits not subject to the requirements of Section 131.08.
(c) The Director may place reasonable place restrictions on the issuance of special event permits, which restrictions
may consider the historic use of the property, recreational use policies adopted in the director’s rules and regulations,
the size of the property and the degree to which the special event would interfere with the historic use and adopted recreational use policies for the property.

(d) The Director may deny or revoke a special event permit whenever he finds:
(1) the applicant person or entity has previously violated the provisions of a special event permit or has submitted
materially false or incomplete information on any special event permit application; or
(2) the special event would unreasonably interfere with the movement of or service capability of police vehicles, firefighting equipment or ambulance service; or
(3) the special event would unreasonably interfere with the historic recreational use and the adopted recreational use
policies for a neighborhood park; or
(4) the special event would unreasonably interfere with another special event for which a permit has been issued.
The Director may charge a permit application fee, subject to approval of Board of Control, in an amount not to exceed
the Director’s cost in administering such application.
Section 131.08 Special Event Concession Agreement and Charges
Every person or entity sponsoring a special event involving sale of items, charging of admissions, or closure of more
than one-half linear mile of City streets shall comply with the following requirements:
(a) obtain a permit under Section 131.07, provided, however, that prior to the issuance of a permit to use City property
managed by a City department other than the Department of Public Works, the director of the affected department must
consent to the issuance of the permit;
(b) submit an application in a form approved by the director of the affected department or his designee within such
time period prior to the special event as may be established by the Director;
(c) if the special event is to be located wholly or partially on property which is owned, leased or maintained by the
City of Cleveland, pay property rent in scheduled amounts determined from time to time by the Board of Control; in setting rents, the Board of Control may consider without limitation the following considerations entitling the applicant to
a reduced or abated rent:
(1) the economic impact of the special event on the Greater Cleveland economy as reflected in sales taxes, transient
occupancy taxes, and admission taxes;
(2) the extent to which the special event will preserve the City’s recreational use immunity provided in RC 1533.181 on

Tenant’s Association Budget Committee, with notice going to the Chairperson of the Public Parks, Recreation and

and location of each meeting:
(1) By November 1st of each year, the Director shall prepare and submit for review to the Budget Committee of the
Tenant’s Association, a schedule of expenses for the ensuing year (the “Director’s Schedule”). The Director shall have
the discretion to increase the total amount of expenses in the Director’s Schedule (the “Schedule Amount”) so that the
Schedule Amount is not greater than the previous year’s Schedule Amount plus ten percent (10%) plus a percentage
equal to the percentage increase in wages negotiated by the City with its union employees.
In the event that the Schedule Amount exceeds the amount referred to in the preceding sentence, the excess amount
may serve as the basis for the calculations set forth herein only with the prior approval of the Budget Committee, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The decision of the Budget Committee as to any such excess amount shall
be made within twenty-five (25) days after submittal of the Director’s Schedule to the Budget Committee. If the Budget
Committee has failed to act at the expiration of this twenty-five (25) day period, the Schedule Amount shall be deemed
approved as submitted.
In the event that the Schedule Amount for the ensuing year is less than the previous year’s Schedule Amount, the
Schedule Amount which shall serve as the basis for calculation of Rent for the ensuing year shall be the Schedule
Amount as submitted for review to the Budget Committee plus thirty percent (30%) of the difference between the pre-

2048

vious year’s Schedule Amount and the Schedule Amount submitted for review to the Budget Committee for the ensuing
year.
(2) By December 1st of each year, the Director shall make available to Tenant the calculation of Rent for the ensuing
year, based on the formula set forth herein.
(3) Tenant shall be assigned an occupancy factor which shall be determined by multiplying the total amount of occupied square footage, as evidenced the market Plan, times a location factor times a use factor.
A. The location factor shall be:
1. 1.8 for stands located in the Market House; or
2. 1.2 for stands located outside the Market House.
B. The use factor associated with the designated Use Category as defined in the Market Rates shall be:
1. 1.6 for “fast food” or “specialty” stands;
2. 1.0 for “traditional” stands;
3. 0.5 for “grocery” stands; or
4. 0.3 for “restaurant” stands.
(4) The occupancy factors for all stands upon the Market Grounds shall be added together. The result of that addition
shall be “Total Occupancy Factor.” The Total Occupancy Factor shall be multiplied by five percent (5%) to reflect average vacancy rates from year to year. This calculation shall result in the “Vacancy Factor.”
(5) The aggregate of all revenue to be derived under the ensuing year from rental or Storage Lockers shall be deducted from the Schedule Amount. The result of this calculation shall be the “Adjusted Schedule Amount.”
(6) The Adjusted Schedule Amount shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is Tenant’s occupancy
factor and the denominator of which is the Total Occupancy factor minus the Vacancy Factor. This calculation shall
result in the “Annual Rent,” which shall then be divided by twelve (12) to determine the Rent due on the first (1st) day
of each month.
(7) A fee for energy consumption for the outdoor heating system will be assessed to each Tenant of the Arcade. A fee
for maintenance and repair services for the refrigerated display cases will be assessed to each Tenant of the Market
House. Such payments are deemed part of the rental obligation.
(b) The Director may rent such spaces or parts or grant the right to use the same for a period not to exceed one year.
He may make such provision for renewal or extension of the rental right or grant as he may deem advisable from time
to time for additional periods not exceeding one year each, upon notification to Council, providing that the option or
right of renewal shall be exercisable only by the Director and not by the grantee. The Director is authorized to provide
in the renting or granting of rights to the use of such part or space that the rental right or grant shall not be transferred
or assigned by the grantee thereof to any other person without the consent, in writing, of the Director. Such right or
grant may be revoked by the Director upon conviction of the grantee of violation of law or ordinances relating to
weights and measures. Provisions shall be made by the Director for the payment of such rental at such regular times

operated on any street or highway

The City Record
to stop the motor vehicle for the sole
purpose of determining whether a
violation of division (c) or (d) of
this section has been or is being
committed or for the sole purpose of
issuing a ticket, citation, or summons for a violation of division (c)
or (d) of this section or causing the
arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a violation of
division (c) or (d) of this section,
and absent another violation of law,

a physician licensed to practice in
this state under Chapter 4731. of the
Revised Code or a chiropractor
licensed to practice in this state
under Chapter 4734. of the Revised
Code that states that the child who
otherwise would be required to be
restrained under this section has a
physical impairment that makes use
of a child restraint system, booster
seat, or an occupant restraining
device impossible or impractical,
provided that the person operating
the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in accordance with any recommendations of
the physician or chiropractor as
noted on the affidavit.
(i) Nothing in this section shall be
construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age
of the child, but the production of a
valid birth certificate for a child
showing that the child was not of
an age to which this section applies
is a defense against any ticket, citation, or summons issued for violating this section.
(j) Whoever violates division (a),
(b), (c), or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided
that the failure of an operator of a
motor vehicle to secure more than
one child in a child restraint system,
booster seat, or occupant restraining
device as required by this section
that occurred at the same time, on
the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a single violation of this section:

By Council Members Kelley and

An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Public Utilities to
enter
into
an
agreement
with
American Municipal Power, Inc. for
the purchase of energy under a longterm purchase available to American
Municipal
Power
from
Morgan
Stanley Capital Group, Inc.
Whereas, the City owns and operates an electric utility system for the
sale of electric power and associated
energy for the benefit of its citizens
and taxpayers; and
Whereas, in order to satisfy the
electric energy requirements of its
electric utility system, the City has
heretofore purchased economical and
reliable electric capacity and energy
from American Municipal Power, Inc.
(“AMP”), of which the City is a
Member, or has heretofore purchased
electricity arranged by AMP; and

December 15, 2010
Whereas, the City, acting individually and, along with other municipalities which own and operate electric
utility systems, jointly through AMP,
endeavors to arrange for reliable, reasonably priced supplies of electric
capacity and energy for ultimate
delivery to its customers; and
Whereas, AMP and the City have
entered into a Master Services
Agreement (“MSA”), AMP Contract
No. C-11-2005-4520 pursuant to which
sets forth general terms and conditions under which, among other
things, AMP may sell and the City
may purchase electric capacity and
energy and other services through
Schedules to the MSA; and
Whereas, AMP and the City, as a
participant, also entered into a power
sales contract (AMP Contract No. C-72007-5752-R) regarding the American
Municipal Power Generating Station
Project (“AMPGS Project”) dated as
of November 1, 2007 (“AMPGS PSC”),
which was terminated as a coal fired
project by the AMPGS participants
and the AMP Board of Trustees on
November 24, 2009; and
Whereas, the AMPGS participants
and the AMP Board of Trustees determined to investigate the replacement
of the AMPGS coal project with,
among other possibilities, a natural
gas combined cycle project and power
purchases from the softened wholesale market and to present modifications to the AMPGS PSC as well as
other arrangements, to the AMPGS
participants therein to reflect those
changes; and
Whereas, as a part of those effects
the AMPGS participants and the AMP
Board of Trustees directed AMP to
secure a 100 MW block of purchased
energy for the period January 1, 2015
through December 31, 2020, on a “take
and pay” basis at favorable cost,
through arrangements with MSCGI,
for resale to Municipality and other
AMPGS participants and, potentially
other AMP members; and
Whereas, in furtherance thereof
AMP has negotiated an agreement
(“Purchased Energy Agreement”)
with Morgan Stanley Capital Group,
Inc. (“MSCGI”) for the purchase by
AMP of firm energy for resale to the
City and other AMP members who are
participants in the AMPGS Project or,
to the extent not fully subscribed to
AMPGS participants, also to other
AMP members, at favorable rates,
terms and conditions; and
Whereas, the City desires to replace
a portion of the energy that would
have been available from AMPGS,
had it been completed as a coal fired
project, from the Purchased Energy
Agreement through the AMPGS
Replacement Energy Schedule for
delivery to AMP at the AD Hub at
$62.95/MWh (“Basic Energy Charge”)
and then resold to the Municipality;
and
Whereas, AMP and MSCGI have
included provisions in the Purchased
Energy Agreement that contemplate
that AMP and MSCGI may negotiate
and agree to amendments thereto for
AMP, to prepay MSCGI, in a discounted lump sum (the “Prepayment”), all
or a portion of the remaining Contract
Price for energy to be purchased
under
the
Purchased
Energy
Agreement; and
Whereas, AMP intends to issue
bonds to finance the Prepayment if
and when the Prepayment is negotiated and executed; and
Whereas, any such Prepayment
will permit AMP to sell to the City
firm energy, derived from the amended Purchased Energy Agreement at a
price less than the Basic Energy

The City Record
Charge (the “Discounted Energy
Charge”) to the City; and
Whereas, AMP has advised the
City, and the City acknowledges, that
there can be no assurance that circumstances will permit, or that AMP
and MSCGI can agree on the terms of,
any such Prepayment, such that the
City is entering into this Energy
Schedule based on the contract price
and the other terms contained in the
Replacement
Energy
AMPGS
Schedule and not on the prospect that
AMP may be able to sell firm energy
at a lower Discounted Energy
Charge;
Whereas, the City previously determined that it could beneficially utilize a portion of such energy and executed the AMPGS PSC with AMP for a
share of the power and energy from
AMPGS; and
Whereas, the City desires to obtain
the benefit of the Discounted Energy
Charge and consents to the issuance
of bonds by AMP on its behalf to
effect the Prepayment; and
Whereas, the AMPGS Replacement
Energy Schedule allows the City
option to establish a reserve, through
AMP, to be applied to any liability it
may have, under the AMPGS PSC; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
the
AMPGS
Energy
Schedule
Replacement
between the City and AMP, including
Appendices is substantially in the

authorized to execute and deliver
such Schedule, with such changes as
the Director of Public Utilities may
approve as neither inconsistent with
this ordinance nor materially adverse
to the City, his or her execution of
such Schedule to be conclusive evidence of such approval.
Section 2. That the Director of
Public Utilities is authorized to execute the AMPGS Replacement Power
Schedule for an amount of up to 45000
kW, on a “take and pay” basis, and the
Municipality
elects
to
fund
$1.00/MWh under Section 10(I) of
said Schedule and take such other
actions as are necessary or desirable
by the Authorized Representatives in
connection therewith.
Section 3. That AMP is authorized
to arrange for the Prepayment and to
issue bonds therefore on behalf of the
City so long as AMP’s independent
financial advisor determines that the
same is reasonably expected to provide savings to the City.
Section 4. That it is found and determined that all formal actions of this
Council concerning and relating to
the passage of this ordinance that
were required by law were taken in
an open meeting of this Council and
that all deliberations of this Council
and of any committees that resulted

Cleveland Corporate Services, Inc., or
its designee, to provide for a ten-year,
sixty percent tax abatement for certain tangible real property improvements for the property located at 5777

of or who have pled guilty to a criminal offense which is unrelated to the
duties of the job opportunity.
Section 7. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure

523.049.
For

kilowatt hour. Beginning on January 1, 2012, such incremental charge

mils per kilowatt hour.
(d) At the end of each month, the
