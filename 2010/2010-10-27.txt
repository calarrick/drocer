An emergency resolution urging
the president of the New York Community Bank to reconsider closing
the Ohio Savings Bank branch located at the corner of Larchmere and
North Moreland Boulevards in the
Shaker Square neighborhood.
Whereas, New York Community
Bank has announced its intention to
close the Ohio Savings Bank branch
located at the corner of Larchmere
and North Moreland Boulevards just
off Shaker Square on December 10,
2010; and
Whereas, losing this bank branch
would be a major blow to the Shaker Square community, as closing it
will leave no Ohio Savings Bank
presence between Cleveland Heights
and East 9th Street in Cleveland;
and

The City Record
Whereas, the Shaker Square community includes a large concentration of residential units as well as
merchants and nearly all rely on
this bank branch for their banking
needs and closing this branch will
cause unnecessary hardship on the
Shaker Square community; and
Whereas, in addition, closing this
bank branch means employees of
the branch would lose their jobs further eroding our economy and would
leave the beautiful corner building
vacant
implying
the
unwanted
image of urban blight; and
Whereas, Ohio Savings Bank, is
currently owned by the “New York
Community Bank” out of Westbury
New York – an ironic name as this
“community bank” is choosing to
close a branch located in and a part
of one of the most unique and thriving communities in the City of

Whereas, S, the Cuyahoga river
Community Planning Organization
is seeking endorsement of this Big

Whereas, the Priority Development Areas and the Priority Conservation Areas identified in the Big
Creek Watershed Plan – Balanced
Growth and Watershed Stewardship
are to be used by State of Ohio
Agencies to guide State activities
and programs affecting these areas
and they will serve as the basis for
special incentives programs to be
directed to the Big Creek watershed
communities; and
Whereas, the designation of such
areas will assist the City of Cleveland to minimize future flooding,
erosion, and water quality problems,
to
infrastructure,
and
threats
reliance on costly engineered solutions to storm water problems; and
Whereas,
the

Res. No. 1371-10.
By Council Member Polensek.
An emergency resolution urging
the Department of Public Safety to
coordinate
with
the
Cleveland
Municipal School District to address
the crisis of absenteeism in Cleveland schools by increased enforcement of our City laws that require
children of compulsory school age to
be in attendance at school and
impose parental duties.
Whereas, a month into this school
year, 16 percent of the 45,000-plus
students in Cleveland schools were
absent or late; and
Whereas, the absentee rates are
even
higher
at
Cleveland
high
schools, where 21.4 percent of students were absent at Collinwood
High School, 21 percent were absent
at East Tech High School with nearly 40 percent absent at one of four
independent small schools operating
within East Tech, and 18.5 percent
of students were absent from John
F. Kennedy High School with the
percentage increasing to 37 percent
when
including
those
tardy
or
absent; and
Whereas, this Council supports
the efforts of Cleveland Municipal
School District to raise attendance
through a new initiative called Target 11 that includes notifying and
contacting homes of absent students; and
Whereas, in addition to jeopardizing education, having large numbers
of unsupervised absent students
roaming the streets raises the crime
level in the community; and
Whereas, the Department of Public Safety in coordination with the
School District can help address this
crisis of absenteeism by increased
enforcement of our City laws that
require
children
of
compulsory
school age to be in attendance at
school and impose parental duties;
and
Whereas, Cleveland Codified Ordinance Section 605.141 (a) forbids
any child
between the ages of six and seventeen from being at any place
within the City other than in attendance at school between the hours
of 10:00 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. during
any school day, unless the child is
suspended or expelled, has written
proof from school excusing him, or
is accompanied by a parent, legal
guardian,
or
responsible
adult
selected by the parent or legal
guardian; and
Whereas, Sections 605.141(b) and
(g) impose a duty on parents and
legal guardians of school-age children to prohibit the child from
behaving contrary to division (a),

The City Record
and if any person violates this duty,
her is guilty of negligently failing
to supervise a child of compulsory
school age, a misdemeanor of the
fourth degree for the first offense;
and
Whereas, Section 605.142 (a) and
(g) places a duty on each parent or
legal guardian of a child suspended
or expelled from school to personally supervise the child or arrange for
a responsible adult to supervise the
child, and prohibit the child from
being at any public place at the
time the child would have been in
school, except under specific listed
circumstances, and subjects them to
a misdemeanor of the second degree
for violating this duty; and
Whereas, stricter enforcement of
these City laws will deter excessive
absenteeism from school and juvenile crime during school hours; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the Department of Public
Safety to coordinate with the Cleveland Municipal School District to
address the crisis of absenteeism in
schools
by
increasing
Cleveland
enforcement of our City laws that
require
children
of
compulsory
school age to be in attendance at
school and impose parental duties.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Director
Flask, Department of Public Safety,
Eugene Sanders, CEO, Cleveland
Municipal
School
District,
and
Mayor Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
