of Public Safety to conduct the 2010
Port Security Grant; that the Director is authorized to file all papers
and execute all documents necessary to receive the funds under the

the summary for the grant contained in the file described below.
Section 2. That the summary for
the grant, File No. 813-10-A, made a
part of this ordinance as if fully

and shall not be changed without
additional legislative authority.
Section 3. That the Director of
Public Safety shall have the authority to extend the term of the grant

accounts
and

FIRST READING
ORDINANCE REFERRED
Ord. No. 889-10.
By Council Members Cleveland,
Mitchell and Sweeney (by departmental request).
An ordinance to amend Section
343.23 of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended
by Ordinance No. 1809-03, passed
December 1, 2003, relating to pedestrian retail overlay (PRO) districts.
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 343.23 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended by
Ordinance No. 1809-03, passed December 1, 2003, is amended to read as
follows:
Section 343.23 Pedestrian
Overlay (PRO) District

Retail

(a)
Purpose.
The
Pedestrian
Retail Overlay (PRO) District is
established to maintain the economic viability of older neighborhood
shopping districts by preserving the
pedestrian-oriented
character
of
those districts and to protect public
safety
by
minimizing
conflicts
between vehicles and pedestrians in
neighborhood shopping districts.
(b) Mapping. The PRO District is
an overlay district which shall be
mapped only in an area where at
least seventy five (75%) of the
underlying zoning is either Local
Retail or General Retail. In every
PRO District, any street frontage to
be considered a “Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage,” as defined in this
section, shall be marked on the Zoning Map, with either one or both
sides of a street designated as such.
(c) Applicability. The PRO District regulations shall apply only in
those portions of a PRO District in
which the underlying zoning is
either
Local
Retail
or
General
Retail. In the relevant portions of a
PRO District, the regulations of the
underlying zoning district shall govern except where in conflict with
the regulations of the PRO District,
in which case the regulations of the
PRO District shall govern.
(d) Definitions. As used in this
section, the following terms shall be
defined as stated below:
(1)
“Pedestrian
Retail
Street
Frontage” means that side or sides
of a public street frontage where
pedestrian-oriented retail shopping
activity exists or is expected to

exist and such street frontage is
specifically designated on the Zoning Map.
(2)
“Pedestrian
Retail
Space”
means that portion of a building or
property located at or closest to the
level of the public sidewalk and
within forty (40) feet of a Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage.
(3) “Open Sales Lot” means a property or portion of a property used
for the sale of merchandise stored
in outdoor, unenclosed locations.
(4) “Institutional Use” means, for
purposes of this section, a school,
day care center, place of worship,
place of assembly, hospital, nursing
home, residential treatment facility,
or similar use.
(5) “Non-Retail Office” means an
office use whose primary activity
does not involve service to customers or clients on the premises.
(e) Use Regulations. All uses permitted in the underlying retail zoning district shall be permitted in the
PRO District, except that the use of
Pedestrian Retail Spaces, as defined
in this section, shall be further limited as follows.
(1) Prohibited Uses. For Pedestrian Retail Spaces, as defined in this
section, the following uses shall be
prohibited:
A. open sales lots, as defined in
this section;
B. filling and service stations;
C. car washes;
D. a driveway or driveways providing the only vehicular access to
or from a drive-through facility.
(2) Conditional Uses. For Pedestrian Retail Spaces, as defined in
this section, the following uses shall
be permitted as Conditional Uses, as
approved by the City Planning Commission under the approval criteria
provided in this section:
A. off-street parking or loading
areas;
B. driveways extending across a
public sidewalk;
C. residential, institutional and
non-retail office uses, as defined
herein,
except
that
ground-floor
entrances and lobbies serving such
uses located on upper floors or in a
basement level shall be permitted
without the requirement for conditional approval;
D. any building-enclosed use that
does not have a public pedestrian
entrance from the Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage;
E. any use with more than forty
(40) feet of frontage along the
Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage;

1127

F. a building with an interior side
yard more than four (4) feet in
width and located within forty (40)
feet
of
a
Pedestrian
Retail
Frontage.
(f) Criteria for Conditional Uses.
The City Planning Commission shall
approve a Conditional Use application if it determines that the application meets the following criteria.
(1) In the case of a proposed residential, institutional or non-retail
office use, one or more of the following conditions apply:
A. The subject building space was
designed specifically for the type of
use proposed and, as such, occupancy by an allowed use is an unreasonable expectation.
B. Denial of the application for
occupancy by a conditional use
would result in a long-term vacancy
of the subject property, as demonstrated by the applicant.
C. It has been determined that the
proposed use is needed in the immediate area and that suitable alternative locations are unavailable.
(2) In the case of a proposed off
street parking or loading area or
driveway, one or both of the following conditions apply.
A. The size, shape or layout of the
subject property does not permit
placement of the parking, loading or
driveway in a more suitable location.
B. It has been demonstrated by
the applicant that placement of the
parking, loading or driveway in an
allowed location would jeopardize
the continued occupancy of the subject property by uses suited to the
PRO District.
(3) In the case of a building
enclosed use that does not have an
entrance from the Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage, one or both of the
following conditions apply:
A. The proposed use will occupy
an existing building that lacks such
pedestrian entrance, and the addition of a conforming pedestrian
entrance is made infeasible by the
configuration of the interior space
or other factors related to the
design and placement of the building.
B. Placement of the pedestrian
entrance in a location other than on
the
Pedestrian
Retail
Street
Frontage will result in more suitable pedestrian access.
(4) In the case of a proposed use
with more than forty (40) feet of
frontage along the Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage, the subject space

28
was designed for use at such size
and the proposed use, in the determination of the City Planning Commission,
will
not
have
adverse
impacts on the functioning of nearby pedestrian-oriented retail uses.
(5) In the case of an interior side
yard more than four (4) feet in
width and located within forty (40)
feet
of
a
Pedestrian
Retail
Frontage, the subject building will
be occupied by residential units
which require the greater side yard
area to allow for desirable levels of
light and air.
(g) Maximum Setbacks. Notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
the
underlying zoning district, properties in PRO Districts shall conform
to the following regulations with
respect to maximum setbacks.
(1) Front Street Yard. No main
building on a lot abutting a Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage shall be
set back more than five (5) feet
from the Pedestrian Retail Street
Frontage unless the City Planning
Commission has approved establishment of a surface parking lot in
such location as a Conditional Use.
Such building features as entrances
and display windows may be set
back up to an additional five (5)
feet as long as these features occupy no more than fifty percent (50%)
of the building’s total frontage.
These setback regulations shall not
apply to portions of buildings above
the first-story level.
(2) Interior Side Yard. No portion
of an interior side yard located within forty (40) feet of a Pedestrian
Retail Street Frontage shall exceed
four (4) feet in width on the ground
floor level, unless the City Planning
Commission has approved a driveway or a residential side yard in
such location as a Conditional Use.
(3) Exceptions for Outdoor Cafes.
A building may be set back a maximum of fifteen (15) feet from the
Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage in
order to accommodate a permanent
outdoor cafe. If use of such cafe is
discontinued for a period of two (2)
years or more, the setback area
shall be landscaped or otherwise
improved in accordance with a plan
approved by the City Planning Commission.
(h) Window Areas. For any nonresidential building or storefront
facing a Pedestrian Retail Street
Frontage, not less than sixty percent (60%) of the front facade
between 2.5 and 7.5 feet in height
shall be composed of transparent
windows or doors. In addition, not
more
than
twenty-five
percent
(25%) of such window or door area
on a building or storefront shall be
covered with permanent signs.
(i) Parking. In recognition of the
expected greater use of public transit, bicycles and walking by customers and employees traveling to
PRO Districts, the minimum number
of
parking
spaces
otherwise
required by the Zoning Code shall
be reduced by thirty-three percent
(33%) for retail business uses in the
districts.
The
Board
of
Zoning
Appeals may further reduce parking
requirements where it has been
demonstrated that additional parking is available in common or
shared parking facilities or in onstreet parking areas located within
a reasonable walking distance of
the use, given the nature of the use
and the district. The Board shall
also consider factors as the number
of bicycle racks available in proximity to a use. In making its determination, the Board shall be guided

The City Record
by an up-to-date analysis of parking
supply and demand and other relevant factors submitted by or on
behalf of the applicant. The City
Planning Commission shall maintain a file of all such parking analyses submitted for properties in each
PRO District.
(j) Signs in the Public Street
Right-of-Way. An ordinance to map
a PRO District in a particular location may include permission to place
private signs in the public street
right-of-way under the regulations
of Chapter 512 of the Codified Ordinances. Such provision shall be
included in the PRO designation
only if it is determined, on the basis
of a survey and analysis conducted
by the City Planning Commission,
that the particular PRO District is
characterized by a preponderance of
restaurants and small independent
stores for which signs placed near
the street curb would provide useful
information to pedestrians seeking
goods
and
services
and
would
enhance
the
pedestrian-oriented
image of the district. Any PRO District designated for display of signs
in the street right-of-way shall be
shown on the Zoning Map as a
“PRO-S” District, with “S” noting the
presence of special sign provisions.
No sign permitted by these provisions shall be displayed without
design approval of the sign’s structure and permanent elements by the
City Planning Commission, or where
applicable, by the Landmarks Commission.
(k) Variances. The Board of Zoning Appeals may grant variances to
requirements of this section under
the applicable criteria stated in
Chapter 329 of this code.
(l) Appeals. Appeals from the
decision of the City Planning Commission to approve or disapprove
Conditional
Uses
in
Pedestrian
Retail Spaces shall be made to the
Board of Zoning Appeals.
Section 2. That existing Section
343.23 of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended
by Ordinance No. 1809-03, passed
December 1, 2003, is repealed.
Section 3. That this ordinance
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Whereas, the Famicos Foundation
is submitting a Brownfield Revolving Loan Fund Program Application
to

and
Whereas, 1341 East Boulevard is
an approximately 0.27 acre property
located principally at 1341 East
Boulevard identified as Permanent
Parcel Number 107-23-031, in Ward 8
in the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, the Famicos Foundation
intends to remediate the property,
currently a vacant six-unit residential property, for continued use as a
six-unit residential property; and
Whereas, the City is committed to
working with the Famicos Foundation to pursue the remediation and

Whereas, the Brownfield Revolving Loan Fund loan or grant is vital
to making the completion of the
1341 East Boulevard redevelopment

Res. No. 938-10.
By Council Member Brady.
An emergency resolution objecting to the transfer of ownership of
a D1, D2, D3, D3A and D6 Liquor
Permit to 10510-12 Madison Avenue,
1st floor and basement.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Department of Liquor
Control of an application for the
transfer of ownership of a D1, D2,
D3, D3A and D6 Liquor Permit from
WB Holdings, Inc., 10510-12 Madison
Avenue, 1st floor and basement,

Number 9279409 to K & M Tavern,
LLC, 10510-12 Madison Avenue, 1st
floor and basement, Cleveland, Ohio
44102 Permanent Number 4423629;
and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
