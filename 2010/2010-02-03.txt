FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTION REFERRED
Res. No. 135-10.
By Council Members Polensek, J.
Johnson, Zone, Brady, Westbrook
and K. Johnson.
An emergency resolution urging
the State of Ohio, the City of Cleveland, and other government entities
to enter into discussions with the
Commissioners of the Cleveland
Metroparks
to
allow
Cleveland
Metroparks to acquire the publicly
owned land along Lake Erie currently owned by various governmental subdivisions, thereby creating a real regional “Emerald Necklace”.
Whereas, there is an estimated 650
acres of publicly owned property
along eight miles of Cleveland’s
lakefront, including Edgewater Park,
Whiskey Island, Wendy Park, Voinovich Park, Northcoast Harbor, East
55th Street Marina, Gordon Park,
Dike 14, Euclid Beach, Villa Angela
Beach, and Wildwood Park; and
Whereas, these public parks and
recreation areas are owned and
operated by several different public entities, including the State of
Ohio, the City of Cleveland, Cuyahoga County and the Port Authority; and
Whereas, none of these government entities has the available
funds to adequately manage, maintain and/or expand their park and
recreational facilities; and
Whereas, for example, the Cleveland Lakefront State Park System
comprises a large part of the abovementioned
lakefront
land
from
Edgewater Park to Wildwood operated by the State of Ohio; and
Whereas, for the past several
years, Ohio State government has

110

February 3, 2010
decreased funding for the state
parks; currently the extensive Cleveland Lakefront State Park System is
patrolled by only one park ranger
per shift and grass cutting and
basic maintenance are at a bare
minimum standards; and
Whereas, the Cleveland Metroparks System successfully manages
more than 22,000 acres of parkland
in greater Cuyahoga County, dubbed
the “Emerald Necklace”; and
Whereas, this Council believes that
discussions of regionalism should
include discussions of an expansion
by the Cleveland Metroparks System
of this stretch of publicly owned
land bordering Lake Erie that is not
included in the present “Emerald
Necklace” and that is presently operated by these varying governmental
subdivisions; and
Whereas, the Cleveland Metroparks System is committed solely to
developing, managing and improving public parkland, greenspace and
zoological facilities; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that the Cleveland Metroparks System is the perfect government entity that has proved itself capable of
developing and maintaining this
magnificent
stretch
of
publicly
owned lakefront land; and
Whereas, Cleveland Metroparks
should be allowed to acquire the
lakefront parks that would once and
for all create a regional Emerald
Necklace; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the State of Ohio, the City of Cleveland, and other government entities
to enter into discussions with the
Commissioners
of
the
Cleveland
Metroparks
to
allow
Cleveland
Metroparks to acquire the publicly
owned land along Lake Erie currently owned by various governmental subdivisions, thereby creating a real regional “Emerald Necklace”.

Johnson and Miller.
An emergency resolution supporting
Councilperson Polensek and the Collinwood community in their efforts to
keep Ginn Academy in its present
location at the former Margaret Spellacy School on East 162nd Street.
Whereas, the Cleveland Metropolitan School District’s (CMSD) Transformation Plan proposes to relocate
Ginn Academy from its present location at the former Margaret Spellacy School on East 162nd Street to
Glenville High School; and
Whereas, Councilperson Polensek
worked diligently with Coach Ted
Ginn, Sr. over the last three years
to find a permanent suitable location to house “Ted’s dream” of a
stand-alone, all boys, single gender
academy that places safety, security and academic excellence as its
core values; and

The City Record
Whereas, even as the City’s graduation rate has fallen to 54 percent,
Ginn Academy, now in its third
year, has grown in its present location to 300 students, and no one has
dropped out;
Whereas, of the 37 students in its
first senior class, 32 have already
passed Ohio’s mandatory graduation
exam; and
Whereas, “Ted’s dream” is working, so Ginn Academy needs to build
on its success in its present location
rather than be disrupted by moving
to a new neighborhood and building
to share with a new girls-only program; and
Whereas, CMSD has spent over 2
million in “warm, safe, and dry”
expenses and renovations since 2002
on the Margaret Spellacy School
building that is home to Ginn Academy; and
Whereas, CMSD spent $775,000 in
renovation costs to the Margaret
Spellacy School building to make it
the site of Ginn Academy last fall;
and
Whereas, abandoning Ginn Academy’s present location after spending
so much in renovation costs is a
waste of tax payers’ money and
state funds; and
Whereas, Councilperson Polensek
and the Collinwood community will
work to keep the successful Ginn
Academy continuing its progress at
its present location; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports Councilperson Polensek
and the Collinwood community in
their efforts to keep Ginn Academy
in its present location at the former
Margaret Spellacy School on East
162nd Street.
