“Energy Adjustment Charge”
(a) An additional incremental

costs may be applied to the rates
prescribed in Sections 523.02 to
523.065 C.O. and any other rate
schedule as may be adopted by the

(b) The incremental charge shall
be based on the fuel and purchase
power cost per kilowatt hour delivered
calculated
under
divisions
(c)(1) and (2) of this section.
(c)(1) The fuel and purchase
power cost per kilowatt hour sold to
residential ratepayers shall be determined by dividing the sum of the
cost of the kilowatt hours purchased
from the Power Authority of the
State of New York and the average
cost of kilowatt hours purchased
from other sources needed to supply
the residential customers by the
total kilowatt hours distributed to
residential customers. For the period ending December 31, 2011, the
incremental charge calculated herein shall be adjusted by subtracting
15 mils per kilowatt hour for residential customers who provide the
Division of Cleveland Public Power
with a certificate of reduction of
taxes obtained under the Homestead
Exemption provisions of Sections
323.151
through
323.157

kilowatt hour.

523.048 C.O., the fuel and purchase
power cost per kilowatt hour sold to
all ratepayers, other than residential
ratepayers,
during
the
twelve
months of the year, shall be determined by dividing the sum of the
total cost of coal, oil, gas and purchase power by the total kilowatt
hours distributed, except that the
computation shall exclude the cost
of PASNY power and the amount of
PASNY power allocable to kilowatt
hours distributed, and shall exclude
the costs of all purchase power and
kilowatt
hours
from
a
specific
source or sources purchased by the
Division for distribution to ratepayers
under
Sections
523.048
and

4
523.049 C.O. For the period ending
December 31, 2011, the incremental
charge calculated herein shall be
adjusted by subtracting 3.0 mils per
kilowatt hour. Beginning on January 1, 2012, such incremental charge
shall be adjusted by subtracting 15
mils per kilowatt hour.
(d) At the end of each month, the
Division of Cleveland Public Power
shall determine the excess fuel and
power charge during such month as
herein provided.
