By Council Member Sweeney (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the purchase by one or more
requirement contracts of Microsoft
licenses for the various divisions of
City government, for a period up to
three years, with three one-year
options to renew, the first and third
of which are exercised through additional legislative authority.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Finance is authorized to make one
or more written requirement contracts under the Charter and the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, for the requirements for

three one-year options to renew, of
the necessary items of Microsoft
licenses, in the approximate amount
as purchased during the preceding
term, to be purchased by the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies
on a unit basis for the various divisions of City government. The first
of the one-year options to renew
may not be exercised without additional legislative authority. If such
additional legislative authority is
granted and the first of the one-year
options to renew is exercised, then
the second of the one-year options to
renew may be exercisable at the
option of the Director of Finance,
without the necessity of obtaining
additional authority of this Council.
The third one-year option to renew
may not be exercised by the Director of Finance without additional
legislative authority. Bids shall be
taken in a manner that permits an
award to be made for all items as
a single contract, or by separate
contract for each or any combination of the items as the Board of
Control determines. Alternate bids
for a period less than the specified
term may be taken if desired by the
Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies until provision is made for the
requirements for the entire term.
Section 2. That the costs of the
contract
or

shall
be
charged against the proper appropriation accounts and the Director
of Finance shall certify the amount
of the initial purchase, which pur-

chase, together with all later purchases, shall be made on order of
the Commissioner of Purchases and
Supplies under a requisition against
the contract or contracts certified by
the Director of Finance. (Request
RQN 1511 RL 2010-34)
Section 3. That under Section
108(b) of the Charter, the purchases
authorized by this ordinance may be
made through cooperative agreements using state procedures. The
Director of Finance may sign all
documents with the State of Ohio or
any of its political subdivisions that
are necessary to make the purchases, and may enter into one or more
contracts with the vendors selected
through that cooperative process.
Section 4. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it

An emergency resolution supporting the Ohioans for Humane Farms
Ballot Initiative requiring that calves
used for veal, egg-laying hens and
breeding pigs on industrialized factory farms have enough room to turn
around and extend their limbs.
Whereas, animal welfare organizations and the media have illuminated the cruel and inhumane confinement of veal calves, egg-laying
hens and breeding pigs in tiny
cages and crates on factory farms;
and
Whereas, animal welfare charities,
veterinarians, family farmers, environmental organizations, health professionals and concerned citizens have
formed a coalition called Ohioans
for Humane Farms to start gathering 650,000 signatures to place this
initiative on the November 2010 ballot; and
Whereas, if passed, this initiative
will phase out the use of veal crates
for calves, battery
cages for egg laying hens, and
gestation crates for breeding pigs in
the State of Ohio; and
Whereas, if passed, this initiative
would prohibit the transport of sick
and injured animals to slaughter for
human consumption; and
Whereas, the extreme overcrowded conditions that have become the
norm in some sectors of animal
agribusiness cause immense suffering for the animals while polluting
the air, contaminating groundwater
and threatening human health; and
Whereas, young calves used for
veal are kept in tiny enclosures, pur-

921

25
posely confined so intensively that
they are not even able to turn
around or even lie down in comfortably; and
Whereas, the vast majority of egglaying hens are confined in barren
battery cages that are so small they
can barely move — each bird has
less space than a single sheet of
paper on which to live; and
Whereas, during their pregnancies,
the female breeding pigs are severely restricted in individual “gestation
crates” measuring just two feet
wide where they are unable to exercise or even turn around, and are
prone to developing crippling joint
disorders and lameness; and
Whereas, Florida, Arizona, Oregon, California and Michigan have
state laws that prohibit gestation
crates, and food producers and retailers, including Smithfield Foods,
Maple Leaf Foods, Wolfgang Puck,
Burger King, Carl’s Jr., Hardees,
Subway, and many more, are producing and/or retailing pork, veal,
and eggs without the use of gestation crates or battery cages; and
Whereas, Ohio environmental groups
have endorsed the measure because
Ohio factory farms continue to be
one of the leading causes of resource depletion and pollution in our
our state; and
Whereas, thousands of Ohio citizens — including Cleveland residents — are now volunteering their
time to collect signatures to put a
measure on the November 2010 ballot that would require that calves
used for veal, egg-laying hens, and
pigs used for breeding be given
enough room to turn around and
extend their limbs; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports
the
Ohioans
for
Humane
Farms Ballot Initiative requiring
that calves used for veal, egg-laying
hens and breeding pigs on industrialized factory farms have enough
room to turn around and extend
