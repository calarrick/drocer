Whereas, under Section 5709.88 of
the Revised Code, if a municipal corporation grants an exemption from
taxation, they shall create a Tax
Incentive Review Council (“TIRC”);
and
Whereas, one of the functions of
the TIRC is to annually review all
agreements
granting
exemptions
from property taxation and to make
recommendations to either continue,
modify, or cancel their agreements
based on various factors, including
fluctuations in the business cycle
unique to the owner’s business; and
Whereas, in compliance with Section 5709.88 of the Revised Code, the
City of Cleveland has created a
TIRC and the TIRC has made written recommendations on exemptions
to be approved by the legislative
authority; and
Whereas, under division (D) of
Section 5709.88 of the Revised Code,
once a legislative authority receives
written recommendations from a tax
incentive review council, that legislative authority has sixty days
after receiving the recommendations, to hold a meeting and vote to
accept, reject, or modify, all or any
portion of the recommendations; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the TIRC’s Year
2009 recommendations contained in
File No. 1321-10-A are approved.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all

and Taxation; for a period of one
year, with three one-year options to

Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
one or more contracts with Clark
Schaefer Hackett for professional
services necessary to complete an
independent
assessment
and

whether the 2010 financial statements fairly present the financial

things, and to complete two statements on Auditing Standards for the

for a period of one year, with three
one-year options to renew. The first

obtaining additional authority of
this Council. The second of the oneyear options to renew may not be
exercised without additional legislative authority. If such additional

be paid from funds appropriated for

2008, the Director of Finance entered
into Contract No. 68663 with Active
Network to provide development of
the City’s 311 Call Center initiative;
and
Whereas, Ordinance No. 341-08
requires further legislation before

a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of

regulations, the size of the property and the degree to which the special event would interfere with the historic
use and adopted recreational use policies for the property.
(d) The Director may deny or revoke a special event permit whenever he finds:

under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.

levels incurred during a special event by the City’s Department of Public Works;

other City departments at scheduled rates determined by the director of the affected department or his designee

“Section 337.25 Agricultural Uses
in Residential Districts
Agricultural uses in Residential
Districts shall be subject to the following regulations and the regulations of Sections 347.02 and 205.02
regarding the keeping of farm animals.
(a) Permitted Accessory Structures. In addition to fences, as regulated in paragraph (b) of this section, a permitted agricultural use
may be served by the following
accessory structures: sheds, greenhouses, coops, cages, beehives, hoophouses, cold frames, barns, rain barrels, composting, farm stands as regulated in paragraph (d) of this section, and similar structures not
exceeding
fifteen
(15)
feet
in
height.
(b) Fences. Fences for agricultural uses shall be permitted in accordance with the regulations applicable to fences in Residential Districts, except that the following regulations shall apply where an agricultural use is the principal use in
a Residential District.
(1) Front Yard and Other Street
Yard. A fence located in a required
front yard, side street yard or other
street yard, shall not exceed four
(4) feet in height and shall be
either ornamental or black or dark
green, vinyl-coated chain link.
(2) Other Locations. A fence located at or behind the setback line of
a required front yard or other street
yard shall not exceed six (6) feet in
height and shall be either ornamental or chain link. Any open lot area
between a fence and a street line
shall be planted with grass or other
vegetation.
(c) Setbacks for Structures. No
permitted accessory structures to an
agricultural use, other than fences
and farm stands, shall be located in
a required front yard or side street
yard area line or within eighteen
(18) inches of an interior side or
rear lot line.

32
(d) Farm Stands and Sale of Produce. The sale of produce and the
placement of farm stands shall be
permitted only in accordance with
the following regulations.
(1) Sale of Produce. Where such
sales have been permitted by the
Board of Zoning Appeals, agricultural products, plants, eggs and
honey grown or produced on a property or within 1,000 feet of the subject property may be sold on the
premises of an agricultural use in a
Residential District if the agricultural use is the only use of the subject property or occupies at least
seventy-five percent (75%) of the
property or at least 4,000 square
feet. In addition, foods prepared on
site or off site may be sold if the
principal ingredients are grown or
produced on the subject property or
within 1,000 feet of the subject property. No sales shall be made before
8 a.m. or after dusk. Food sales
shall be licensed by the Cleveland
Department of Public Health if such
licensing is required in the City’s
Codified Ordinances.
(2) Farm Stands. Where a farm
stand has been permitted by the
Board of Zoning Appeals, any such
farm stand located in a required
front yard area in a One-Family or
Two-Family
District
shall
be
removed from the front yard or
stored inside a building on the
premises during that time of the
year when the garden or farm is not
open for public use. Farm stands
shall not occupy more than two percent (2%) of the subject property’s
land area and, in One-Family and
Two-Family Districts, farm stands
also shall not exceed 200 square feet
in area on the subject property. A
farm stand shall be set back at least
eighteen (18) inches from any lot
line.
(3) Board of Zoning Appeals
Approval. No agricultural produce or
related products may be sold from
the property of an agricultural use
and no farm stand for the sale of
such products may be located on the
property unless the Board of Zoning
Appeals determines, after public
notice and pubic hearing, that the
farm stand and sales will meet a
community need without adversely
affecting the neighborhood. In making this determination, the Board
shall consider, among others, the following factors:
A. the nature of nearby uses of
land with respect to their sensitivity to the activity associated with
farm stand sales,
B. the proximity of the farm stand
to one-family and two-family houses,
C. traffic volumes on the street on
which the subject property is located,
D. the availability of off-street or
on-street parking to serve the farm
stand use,
E. the proximity of other farm
stands serving the immediate area,
and
F. the maintenance of a substantially unobstructed view in the set
back area which shall include a
clear view through the farm stand
above a height of three feet.
(e) Signs. Where an agricultural
use is the principal use in a Residential District or occupies at least
seventy-five percent (75%) of the
property or at least 4,000 square
feet, one sign shall be permitted on
each street frontage identifying the
agricultural use and listing hours of
operations for market sales and contact information. Such sign shall not

The City Record
exceed four (4) square feet in area
and,
if
freestanding,
shall
not
exceed three (3) feet in height and
shall be set back at least five (5)
feet from all property lines unless
the sign is placed on a permitted
farm stand. No signs shall be permitted for an agricultural use that
is an accessory use in a Residential
District.
(f) Composting. Composting may
be conducted on the premises of an
agricultural use if limited to use on
the subject property and if stored in
a manner that controls odor, prevents infestation and minimizes runoff into waterways and onto adjacent properties.
(g) Maintenance. Any land devoted to agricultural use shall be wellmaintained and shall be free of
excessively tall weeds or grass. All
accessory structures to an agricultural use shall also be well maintained.
(h) Building Permits. No Building
Permit or Certificate of Occupancy
shall be required for establishment
of an agricultural use. A Building
Permit shall be required for installation of a fence or for construction
of a barn or other structure routinely requiring such permit, except
that no Building Permit shall be
required for cages, coops, beehives
or similar structures that are not
permanently attached to the ground
or to another structure and do not
exceed thirty-two (32) square feet in
area nor eight (8) feet in height. No
farm stand shall be installed without issuance of a Building Permit.
The application for such Permit
shall include the name, address and
phone number of the operator of the
farm stand; the length, width and
height of the farm stand; a description of the type of produce to be
sold from the farm stand; and the
name of the property owner. If the
applicant is not the property owner,
the applicant shall include with the
Permit application a written statement
from
the
property
owner
authorizing the applicant to install
and operate the farm stand.
(i) Definitions. As used in this
section:
(1) “farm stand” means a temporary structure used for display or
sale of produce as described in division (d)(1) of this section and that
meets the requirements of this section.
(2) “subject property” refers to a
parcel of land or two or more adjacent parcels of land in agricultural
use.”.

An emergency resolution supporting State Senate Bill 273 which generally authorizes municipal corporations and other political subdivisions to enter into agreements to
perform services for one another.
Whereas, current law provides a
variety of specific statutes that
authorize political subdivisions such
as the City of Cleveland to contract
for certain services; and
Whereas, for example, the city
has entered into cooperation agreements with other municipalities to
share emergency medical services
and fire fighting services; and
Whereas, general authority also
exists under R.C. 307.15, which
authorizes intergovernmental agreements for exercising powers, performing functions or rendering services, as well as under R.C. Chapter
167, which authorizes political subdivisions to enter into agreements
creating regional councils of government to, inter alia, promote cooperative agreements among its members; and

political
subdivisions,
namely
municipal
corporations,

sewer
districts,
school
districts,
library districts, health districts,
park districts, soil and water conservation districts, water conservancy districts, or any other taxing district, to enter into agreements to
provide services to one another; and
Whereas, such general authority
given to these specified subdivisions
will advance cooperation between
municipalities and other political
subdivisions by causing the political
subdivisions to allocate and share
resources, and make political subdivisions more efficient by cutting
administrative costs; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports State Senate Bill 273 which
generally authorizes municipal corporations and other political subdivisions to enter into agreements to
