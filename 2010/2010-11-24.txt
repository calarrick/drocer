Section 2. Authorization of the
Refunding Bonds.
This Council authorizes the City to
issue the Refunding Bonds in one or
more Series for the purpose of refunding one or more Series of Outstanding
Revenue Bonds, or designated portions thereof, to obtain aggregate net
present value debt service savings of
at least three percent (3%), or to eliminate or modify covenants that are
unduly restrictive, or to obtain a more
favorable debt service structure or
more favorable terms under Credit
Support Instruments. With respect to
Outstanding Revenue Bonds that are
short-term or variable-rate obligations, this Council authorizes the City
to issue Refunding Bonds to refund
such Outstanding Revenue Bonds, or
designated portions thereof, for any
of the foregoing purposes or for the
purpose that the Director of Finance
has determined, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
such Outstanding Revenue Bonds are
subjecting the City to undesirably
high rates of interest or undesirable
fluctuations in rates of interest or
risks or expenses associated with
Credit Support Instruments that can
economically be avoided or mitigated
through refunding. The principal
amount of each Series of Refunding
Bonds is to be the amount set forth in
the Certificate of Award authorized
in Section 5 and determined by the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
to be necessary (i) to refund the
Refunded Bonds to be refunded by
that Series, (ii) to fund any deposit to
the Bond Service Reserve Fund
required under the Indenture or any
special reserve fund for that Series
separate from the Bond Service
Reserve Fund, (iv) to pay costs of any
Credit Support Instruments, (v) to
pay any amounts owed under Hedge
Agreements, and (vi) to pay costs of
issuing the Refunding Bonds and
refunding the Refunded Bonds. The
proceeds from the sale of each Series
of Refunding Bonds shall be allocated, deposited and applied as provided
in Section 6.
Separate series of Refunding Bonds
may be issued at the same or different
times. The Refunding Bonds of each
series shall be designated as provided
in the applicable Certificate of
Award. A separate Certificate of
Award and a separate Supplemental
Indenture may be delivered for each
series. Costs of issuance of the
Refunding Bonds and any required
deposit to the Bond Service Reserve
Fund attributable to the Refunding
Bonds shall, in each case, be included
in the costs funded from the proceeds
of
the
Refunding
Bonds.
The
Refunding Bonds shall constitute
Revenue Bonds for all purposes of the
Indenture.
This Council finds and determines
that the issuance of the Refunding
Bonds for the purpose provided in this
Ordinance serves a proper, public,
municipal purpose by reducing the
costs of air travel facilities serving
the people of the City of Cleveland,
thereby increasing and promoting
commerce by providing necessary
transportation for individuals and
commercial enterprises purchasing
and selling services and products in
northeastern Ohio, and creating and
preserving jobs and employment
opportunities in the City and improving the economic welfare of the City.

Section 3. Authorization of Hedging
Arrangements.
This Council finds that by engaging in interest rate hedging arrangements with respect to Revenue Bonds
the City may reduce its cost of borrowing by optimizing the relative
amounts of fixed and variable rate
obligations, or minimizing the risk of
variations in its debt service costs, or
obtaining savings by confirming
rates of interest on Revenue Bonds in
advance of their issuance. To permit
the City to have the flexibility to
undertake interest rate swap, swaption, rate cap, rate collar and other
hedging transactions, from time to
time, and to establish the procedures
for approving those transactions, this
Council authorizes the signing and
delivery of one or more agreements
(each, a “Hedge Agreement”) and any
related agreements necessary for the
consummation of the transactions
contemplated
by
each
Hedge
Agreement. The authorizations in
this Section 3 are supplemental to and
not in derogation of any authority
provided by any other ordinance of
this Council concerning hedging
arrangements.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
that it is to the financial advantage of
the City and in the City’s best interests that a hedging arrangement be
undertaken by the City with respect
to any Revenue Bonds issued or to be
issued under the Indenture, the
Director of Finance may authorize
one or more interest rate hedge transactions in accordance with the applicable Hedge Agreement; provided that
(a) the counterparty shall be rated at
the time of signing the Hedge
Agreement not lower than A by at
least one rating agency or its obligations under the Hedge Agreement
shall be guaranteed or insured by an
entity rated at the time of signing the
Hedge Agreement not lower than A
by at least one rating agency, and (b)
the term of each hedge transaction
shall not exceed the final maturity of
the Revenue Bonds to which the
hedge relates.
The Director of Finance shall negotiate the terms of each Hedge
Agreement with a counterparty satisfying the credit criteria in this
Ordinance. The City shall receive a
written opinion of a Financial
Advisor that the payments made or to
be made by the counterparty to the
City, or by the City to the counterparty, shall be fair value for the Hedge
Agreement, considering, among other
things, the credit of the City’s Airport
System, the credit of the counterparty
and the terms and conditions of the
Hedge Agreement. The Director of
Finance shall determine the terms
and
conditions
of
the
Hedge
Agreement, including without limitation, the time or times and procedures
for the exercise by the counterparty
or the City, as the case may be, of any
option under the Hedge Agreement,
whether the obligations of the City
under the Hedge Agreement shall be
secured
by
a
Credit
Support
Instrument, and the rates to be paid
by the counterparty to the City and by
the City to the counterparty under the
Hedge Agreement in the event of the
exercise of the option. The approval
of each interest rate hedge transaction by the Director of Finance shall
be conclusively evidenced by the
signing and delivery of the applicable
Hedge Agreement by the Director of
Finance.
The Director of Finance is authorized
to
terminate
any
Hedge

November 24, 2010
Agreements in whole or in part or any
Credit Support Instrument securing a
Hedge Agreement if the Director of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
that the City’s best interests will be
served by such termination. The
Director of Finance is further authorized to enter into amendments or
modifications of a Hedge Agreement
or any Credit Support Instrument
securing a Hedge Agreement determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the City’s best
interests will be served by such
amendment or modification.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from the Airport Revenues as defined
in the Indenture and may be payable
also from other funds permitted by
law to be used for the purpose, as
identified by the Director of Finance
in the Hedge Agreement. Those payments may be secured by a pledge of
Airport Revenues, to the extent permitted by the Indenture, all as determined by the Director of Finance and
set forth in the Hedge Agreement.
The obligation of the City to make
under
any
Hedge
payments
Agreement does not and shall not represent or constitute a general obligation, debt, bonded indebtedness or a
pledge of the faith and credit of the
City or the State of Ohio. Nothing
gives any party to any Hedge
Agreement the right to have excises,
ad valorem or other taxes levied by
the City or the State of Ohio for the
payment of any amounts due under
any Hedge Agreement.
Section 4. Terms of Refunding
Bonds.
The Refunding Bonds shall contain
the terms provided in or determined
pursuant to, the Indenture, this
Ordinance, the applicable Certificate
of
Award
and
the
applicable
Supplemental Indenture. Each series
of Refunding Bonds may be secured
by
a
separate
Supplemental
Indenture, or a single Supplemental
Indenture may secure more than one
series of Refunding Bonds.
(a) General. In the event that the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
determines that the City’s best interests will be served by causing a series
of Refunding Bonds to be obligations
bearing interest at variable interest
rates, then the Director of Finance is
authorized to so specify in the
Certificate of Award for that series. If
the Director of Finance so determines, then the method and procedure
by which the variable rate of interest
to be borne by the Refunding Bonds of
that series shall be determined as provided in the applicable Supplemental
Indenture, whether by reference to a
market index, by a remarketing
agent or otherwise, provided that no
series of variable rate Refunding
Bonds shall bear interest at a rate in
excess of twenty-five percent (25%)
per year (including any Refunding
Bonds held by a provider of a Credit
Support Instrument). The Director of
Finance may determine that the
terms of a variable rate series of
Refunding Bonds may or may not permit the holders to tender their variable rate Refunding Bonds for purchase by the City. If the Director of
Finance designates any series of
Refunding Bonds as variable rate
Refunding Bonds, and if the Holders
of that series of Refunding Bonds are
to be entitled to tender those
Refunding Bonds for purchase, then
the Director of Finance shall also designate
for
those
variable
rate

The City Record
Refunding Bonds (and may designate
others, from time to time, in substitution therefor), the tender agent or
agents (which may be the Trustee)
and the remarketing agent or agents
(which may be any of the Original
which
designations
Purchasers),
shall be based on the determination of
the Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
that the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed to
provide such services are fair and
commercially
reasonable.
The
Director of Finance is authorized to
enter into agreements with others in
connection with the delivery of the
Refunding Bonds, and from time to
time thereafter so long as the
Refunding Bonds are outstanding, as
may be determined by the Director of
Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for (i) the method of
determining the variable interest
rates, (ii) the rights and procedures
for tender, (iii) liquidity or credit support, (iv) repayment by the City of
any amounts drawn under the Credit
Support Instrument, (v) the direct
purchase of tendered Refunding
Bonds, and (vi) other arrangements
in the best interests of the City. The
Director of Finance is further authorized to terminate any such agreements if the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the City’s best interests will be served
by such termination. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to enter
into agreements, from time to time so
long as the variable rate Refunding
Bonds are outstanding, supplementing or amending the applicable
Supplemental Indenture for a series
of Refunding Bonds as provided in
Section 8. The Director of Finance is
authorized to pay any fees associated
with agreements entered into or terminated pursuant to this Section from
proceeds of Refunding Bonds, to the
extent permitted by the Indenture,
and from the Airport Revenues.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of any
series of Refunding Bonds, and
regardless of whether that series of
Refunding Bonds bears interest at
variable or fixed rates, is authorized
to contract for a Credit Support
Instrument, and to pay the costs of it
from proceeds of the Refunding
Bonds, if the Director determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the Credit
Support Instrument will result in a
savings in the cost of the financing to
the City.
(b) Form; Exchange and Transfer.
All Refunding Bonds shall be issued
in
fully
registered
form.
The
Refunding Bonds initially shall be
delivered only in book-entry form,
shall be registered in the name of the
Depository or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the
custody of the Depository, and shall
not be transferable or exchangeable
(except for transfer to another
Depository or its nominee) without
further action by the City pursuant to
the provisions of the Supplemental
Indenture. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in the Original
Indenture, no Refunding Bonds shall
be exchanged for or transferable into
a coupon Revenue Bond or Bonds
unless and until the Indenture shall
have been amended in accordance
with the terms thereof to permit such
exchanges or transfers. To the extent
that the Original Indenture (particu-

1839

11
larly, but without limitation, Section
2.05)
permits
fully
registered
Revenue Bonds to be exchanged for
or transferred into coupon Revenue
Bonds or Revenue Bonds payable to
bearer, then the Original Indenture is
amended to prohibit such exchanges
or transfers for the Refunding Bonds
unless and until the Indenture shall
have been further amended to permit
such exchanges or transfers.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository for
the Refunding Bonds of any series
for use in a book entry system, the
Director of Finance and the Trustee
may attempt to establish a securities
depository/book entry relationship
with another qualified Depository. If
the Director of Finance and the
Trustee do not or are unable to do so,
the Director of Finance and the
Trustee, after making provision for
notification of the beneficial owners
by the then Depository and any other
arrangements deemed necessary,
shall permit withdrawal of the
Refunding Bonds of any series from
the Depository, and authenticate and
deliver registered Bond certificates
to the assigns of the Depository or its
nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of action or
inaction of the City, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into any agreements
determined by the Director to be necessary in connection with the book
entry system for the Refunding
Bonds, after determining that those
agreements will not endanger the
funds or securities of the City under
the Indenture (as evidenced by the
Director’s signing of those agreements).

released from the Bond Service
Reserve Fund to the payment of costs
of remarketing the Revenue Bonds
for which the interest rate has been
converted from variable rates of
interest to fixed rates of interest. To

are not paid from any cash released
from the Bond Service Reserve Fund,
those costs shall be paid from Fund
Nos. 60 SF 001, 60 SF 104, 60 SF 105, 60
SF 106 and 60 SF 141 and/or passenger facility charges, as determined by

from gross income for federal income
tax purposes, and (b) in the case of

Bonds.
The City further covenants that (a)
it will take or cause to be taken such
actions that may be required of it for
the interest on the Tax-Exempt Bonds
to be and to remain excluded from
gross income for federal income tax
purposes, (b) it will not take or authorize to be taken any actions that
would adversely affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting for

1841

13

Tax-Exempt Bonds to the governmental purposes of the borrowing, (ii)
restrict the yield on investment property, (iii) make timely and adequate
payments to the federal government,
(iv) maintain books and records and
make calculations and reports, and
(v) refrain from certain uses of those

such manner and to the extent necessary to assure such exclusion of that
interest under the Code.
The Director of Finance, or any
other officer of the City having
responsibility for issuance of the TaxExempt Bonds, is hereby authorized
(a) to make or effect any election,
selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or waiver on behalf of

compliance with requirements for
that purpose, reducing the burden or
expense of such compliance, reducing
the rebate amount or payments of
penalties, or making payments of special amounts in lieu of making computations to determine, or paying,
excess earnings as rebate, or obviating those amounts or payments, as
determined by that officer, which
action shall be in writing and signed
by the officer, (b) to take any and all
other actions, make or obtain calculations, make payments, and make or
give reports, covenants and certifications of and on behalf of the City, as
may be appropriate to assure the
exclusion of interest from gross
income and the intended tax status of
the Tax-Exempt Bonds, and (c) to
give one or more appropriate certificates of the City, for inclusion in the
transcript of proceedings for the TaxExempt Bonds, setting forth the reasonable expectations of the City
regarding the amount and use of all
the proceeds of the Tax-Exempt
Bonds, the facts, circumstances and
estimates on which they are based,
and other facts and circumstances relevant to the tax treatment of the
interest on and the tax status of the
Tax-Exempt Bonds.
Each covenant made in this Section
with respect to the Tax-Exempt
Bonds is also made with respect to all
issues any portion of the debt service
on which is paid from proceeds of the
Tax-Exempt Bonds (and, if different,
the original issue and any refunding

respect to the Tax-Exempt Bonds.

usual daily operation of a municipal
department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. General obligation refunding bonds of the City
(“Refunding Bonds”) are authorized
to be issued for the purpose of refunding one or more series of the City’s
outstanding
general
obligation
bonds, or designated maturities thereof, issued to provide funds to pay
costs of Projects 1 through 19 and
identified in the Certificate of Award

November 24, 2010
authorized in Section 4 (“Refunded
Bonds”), including the payment of
any expenses relating to the refunding of the Refunded Bonds and the
issuance of the Refunding Bonds,
including any financing costs within
the meaning of Revised Code Section
133.01(K), provided the aggregate net
present value debt service savings
resulting from the refunding of the
Refunded Bonds is not less than three
percent (3%).
The aggregate principal amount of
Refunding Bonds to be issued shall be
in an amount determined by the
Director of Finance and set forth in
the Certificate of Award as the
amount required to be issued, taking
into account any original issue discount and/or original issue premium
on the sale of the Refunding Bonds, in
order to refund the Refunded Bonds
and pay any expenses relating to the
refunding of the Refunded Bonds and
the issuance of the Refunding Bonds.
The Refunding Bonds may be issued
in one or more separate series, each
bearing a distinctive designation,
provided that the Refunding Bonds of
each series satisfy the requirements
of this Ordinance and the aggregate
net present value debt service savings to the City resulting from each
series of Refunding Bonds is not less
than three per cent (3%). Separate
series of Refunding Bonds may be
issued at the same or different times.
The Refunding Bonds of each series
shall be designated as provided in the
applicable Certificate of Award. A
separate Certificate of Award may be
delivered for each series.
Section 2. Authority and Terms. The
Refunding Bonds shall be issued pursuant to the provisions of Article
XVIII of the Constitution of Ohio,
Revised Code Chapter 133 and other
applicable provisions of the Revised
Code, the Charter of the City, the
General Bond Ordinance and this
Ordinance in the principal amount
and for the purpose stated in
Section  1. The Refunding Bonds of
each series shall be issued in one lot
as fully registered bonds in denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof but in no case as to a particular maturity date exceeding the
principal amount maturing on that
date. The Refunding Bonds shall bear
the designation and be numbered as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance.
The Refunding Bonds shall be
dated the date and shall bear interest
at the rate or rates per year specified
in the Certificate of Award, provided
the weighted average of such rates
(taking into account the principal
amount
and
maturity
of
each
Refunding Bond to which a rate
applies) shall not exceed six percent
(6%) per year. Interest on the
Refunding Bonds shall be payable
when due, or until the principal
amount is paid, semiannually as specified in the Certificate of Award as
the dates on which interest on the
Refunding Bonds shall be payable
(the “Interest Payment Dates”),
beginning on the date specified in the
Certificate of Award as the first
Interest Payment Date.
The Refunding Bonds shall mature
in the years and principal amounts as
shall be permitted by law and determined by the Director of Finance and
specified in the Certificate of Award,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor to be in the best
interests of the City given market
conditions at the time the Refunding
Bonds are sold and the objectives of
the plan of refunding to obtain aggregate net present value debt service

The City Record
savings of not less than three per cent
(3%).
The Director of Finance also shall
determine and certify, on or prior to
the date of delivery of the Refunding
Bonds to the Original Purchaser, that
portion of the aggregate principal
amount of the Refunding Bonds that
is allocable to each Project, and the
principal amount of Refunding Bonds
allocated to each Project that shall be
payable at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(as
defined below) on the applicable principal payment dates; provided, that
(i) the aggregate principal amount of
the Refunding Bonds allocable to a
Project shall be determined by the
Director of Finance on a pro rata
basis by reference to the respective
amount of funds that is required for
the refunding of the Refunded Bonds
that are allocable to that Project, taking into account any funds other than
the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds
that are available and appropriated
for that purpose, and (ii) no portion of
the aggregate principal amount of
Refunding Bonds allocated to a
Project shall be payable later than
the maximum maturity for that portion of the Refunding Bonds as certified by the Director of Finance.
The Refunding Bonds stated to
mature in any year may be issued as
term bonds (the “Term Refunding
Bonds”),
payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements as defined and further
described below. The Director of
Finance shall determine in the
Certificate of Award whether any of
the Refunding Bonds shall be issued
as Term Refunding Bonds, any dates
(the “Mandatory Redemption Dates”)
on which the principal amount of the
Term Refunding Bonds shall be
payable pursuant to mandatory sinking fund installments rather than at
stated maturity and the amount of
principal
to
be
paid
on
each
Mandatory Redemption Date (the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Refunding Bonds shall be subject to redemption prior to stated
maturity as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Refunding
Bonds are issued as Term Refunding
Bonds, the Term Refunding Bonds
shall be subject to mandatory sinking
fund redemption and be redeemed
pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements, at a
redemption price of 100 percent of the
principal amount redeemed, plus
interest accrued to the redemption
date, on the Mandatory Redemption
Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to be
deposited with the Escrow Agent, currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of and
interest on any Term Refunding
Bonds shall include amounts sufficient to redeem on the Mandatory
Redemption Dates the principal
amount of Term Refunding Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided
below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined in
Section  3) for cancellation Term
Refunding Bonds in any aggregate
principal amount and to receive a
credit
against
the
then-current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirement (and corresponding
mandatory redemption obligation) of
the City for any Term Refunding

1845

17
Bonds. That option shall be exercised
by the City on or before the forty-fifth
(45th) day preceding the applicable
Mandatory Redemption Date, by furnishing the Escrow Agent a certificate, signed by the Registrar, setting
forth the extent of the credit to be
applied with respect to the then-curMandatory
Sinking
Fund
rent
Redemption Requirement. If the certificate is not timely furnished to the
Agent,
the
Mandatory
Escrow
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirement (and corresponding
mandatory redemption obligation)
shall not be reduced. A credit against
the then-current Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement (and
corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Refunding
Bonds which prior thereto have been
redeemed (other than through the
operation of the Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements) or
purchased for cancellation and canceled by the Registrar, to the extent
not applied theretofore as a credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Refunding Bond so
delivered, or previously redeemed, or
purchased and canceled, shall be credited by the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of the principal amount thereof
against the then-current Mandatory
Fund
Redemption
Sinking
Requirement (and corresponding
mandatory redemption obligation).
Any excess of that amount over the
then-current
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement shall
be
credited
against
subsequent
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements (and corresponding
mandatory redemption obligations)
in the order directed by the Director
of Finance.
(b) Optional Redemption. The
Refunding Bonds may be subject to
redemption prior to maturity by and
at the option of the City, in whole or in
part on any date, in integral multiples
of $5,000, on the optional redemption
dates and at the redemption prices
specified in the Certificate of Award,
plus, in each case, accrued interest to
the redemption date. Based on the
written advice of a financial advisor,
the Director of Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that
it is in the best interests of the City
for some or all of the Refunding
Bonds not to be callable prior to their
stated maturity.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, the Refunding
Bonds, or portions thereof, to be
redeemed optionally shall be selected
by lot prior to the selection by lot of
the Refunding Bonds to be redeemed
on the same date by operation of the
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements of paragraph (a). The
Refunding Bonds shall be redeemed
pursuant to this paragraph only upon
written notice from the Director of
Finance to the Registrar. That notice
shall specify the redemption date and
the principal amount of each maturity
of Refunding Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption date
or such shorter period as shall be
acceptable to the Registrar. There
shall be deposited with the Registrar
on or prior to the redemption date,
funds sufficient to redeem at the
redemption
price,
all
of
the
redeemable Refunding Bonds for
which notice of redemption has been
given.

18
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Refunding
Bonds are called for redemption at
one time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than all
Refunding Bonds of a single maturity
are to be redeemed, the selection of
Refunding Bonds to be redeemed, or
portions thereof in amounts of $5,000
or any integral multiple thereof, shall
be made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar.
In the case of a partial redemption of
Refunding Bonds
by lot when
Refunding Bonds of denominations
greater than $5,000 are then outstanding, each $5,000 unit of principal
thereof shall be treated as though it
were a separate Refunding Bond of
the denomination of $5,000. If it is
determined that one or more, but not
all of the $5,000 units of principal
amount represented by a Refunding
Bond are to be called for redemption,
then upon notice of redemption of a
$5,000 unit or units, the registered
owner of that Refunding Bond shall
surrender the Refunding Bond to the
Registrar (i) for payment of the
redemption price of the $5,000 unit or
units called for redemption (including, without limitation, the interest
accrued to the date fixed for redemption and any premium), and (ii) for
issuance, without charge to the registered owner thereof, of a new
Refunding Bond or Refunding Bonds
of any authorized denomination or
denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unmatured
and unredeemed portion of, and bearing interest at the same rate and
maturing on the same date as, the
Refunding Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Refunding Bonds shall identify (i) by
designation, letters, numbers or other
distinguishing marks, the Refunding
Bonds or portions thereof to be
redeemed, (ii) the redemption price to
be paid, (iii) the date fixed for
redemption, and (iv) the place or
places where the amounts due upon
redemption are payable. The notice
shall be given by the Registrar on
behalf of the City by mailing a copy of
the redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty
(30) days prior to the date fixed for
redemption (or such period specified
in the Certificate of Award), to the
registered owner of each Refunding
Bond subject to redemption in whole
or in part at the registered owner’s
address shown on the Register maintained by the Registrar at the close of
business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing. Failure to receive
notice by mail or any defect in that
notice regarding any Refunding
Bond, however, shall not affect the
validity of the proceedings for the
redemption of any Refunding Bond.
Any notice of redemption of any
Refunding Bonds may specify that
the redemption is contingent on the
deposit of moneys with the Escrow
Agent or Registrar, as paying agent,
on or prior to the redemption date in
an amount sufficient to pay the
redemption price of the Refunding
Bonds that are to be redeemed.
(e)
Payment
of
Redeemed
Refunding Bonds. Notice having been
mailed in the manner provided in the
preceding paragraph, and moneys
having been deposited by the City
with the Escrow Agent or Registrar,
as paying agent, in an amount sufficient to pay the redemption price, the
Refunding Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall become
due and payable on the redemption

The City Record
date, and, upon presentation and surrender at the place or places specified
in that notice, shall be paid. If money
for the redemption of all of the
Refunding Bonds and portions thereof to be redeemed, including interest
accrued to the redemption date, is
held by the Registrar on the redemption date, and, if notice of redemption
has been deposited in the mail, then
from and after the redemption date
those Refunding Bonds and portions
thereof called for redemption shall
cease to bear interest and no longer
shall be considered to be outstanding.
If that money shall not be so available on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited
in the mail, those Refunding Bonds
and portions thereof shall continue to
bear interest, until they are paid, at
the same rate as they would have
borne had they not been called for
redemption. All money held by the
Registrar for the redemption of particular Refunding Bonds shall be held
in trust for the account of the registered owners and shall be paid to
them, respectively, upon presentation
and surrender of those Refunding
Bonds.
The debt charges on the Refunding
Bonds shall be payable in lawful
money of the United States of
America without deduction for the
services of the Registrar or Escrow
Agent as paying agent. Principal
shall be payable when due upon presentation and surrender of the
Refunding Bonds at the principal corporate trust office of the Registrar.
Interest on a Refunding Bond shall be
paid on each Interest Payment Date
by check or draft mailed to the person
in whose name the Refunding Bond
was registered, and to that person’s
address appearing, on the Register
(as defined in Section 3) at the close
of business on the date provided in
the Registrar Agreement authorized
in Section 3 (the Record Date).
Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond Ordinance,
so long as the Refunding Bonds are
held by a Depository in a book entry
system (as described in Section 3),
debt charges on the Refunding Bonds
will be payable in lawful money of
the United States by wire transfer to
the Depository made by the Escrow
Agent on each Interest Payment
Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance.
The
General
Bond
Ordinance, except for the third paragraph of Section 13(a) (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section 4
(pertaining generally to the periods
during which the City is not required
to make any transfers or exchanges
of Refunding Bonds issued under the
General Bond Ordinance), will apply
to the Refunding Bonds. Except for
those provisions, the General Bond
Ordinance is included as a part of this
Ordinance as fully as if restated in
this Ordinance. Words and terms not
otherwise defined in this Ordinance
shall have the same meaning as set
forth in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section
3.
Execution,
Authentication, Approval and Recording of
the Refunding Bonds; Exchange and
Transfer of the Refunding Bonds;
Paying Agents. The Refunding Bonds
shall express upon their faces the purpose for which they are issued and
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance. Pursuant to Section 4 of
the General Bond Ordinance, each
Refunding Bond shall be authenticated by the manual signature of an

1846

November 24, 2010
authorized officer of the Trustee (as
defined therein). The Refunding
Bonds shall be signed by the City’s
Mayor and by the City’s Director of
Finance, and, consistent with Revised
Code Section 133.27 and notwithstanding Section 177.02 of the Codified
Ordinances of the City, either or both
of those signatures may be a facsimile. The Refunding Bonds shall bear
the seal of the City, which seal may be
a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section
83 of the City’s Charter, the Director
of Law shall prepare the Refunding
Bonds and shall endorse thereon his
approval of the form and correctness
thereof by his manual or facsimile
signature.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating
agent, bond registrar, transfer agent
and paying agent for the Refunding
Bonds (the “Registrar”); provided
that the Escrow Agent shall also act
as paying agent for the Refunding
Bonds so long as the Refunding
Bonds are held in a book entry system. The Director of Finance is authorized to sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, an agreement among the City, the Registrar
and the Escrow Agent (the “Registrar
Agreement”) approved as to form and
correctness by the Director of Law,
containing terms that are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and not
substantially adverse to the City and
that are approved by the Director of
Finance on behalf of the City, all of
which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of the
Registrar Agreement by the Director
of Finance. Payment for the services
rendered and for reimbursement of
expenses incurred pursuant to the
Registrar Agreement shall be made
from the proceeds of the Refunding
Bonds, to the extent available, and
then from other money lawfully available and appropriated for that purpose.
So long as any of the Refunding
Bonds remain outstanding, the City
will cause the Registrar to maintain
and keep at its principal corporate
trust office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Refunding Bonds as
provided
in
this
Section
(the
“Register”). Subject to the provisions
of Section 5, the person in whose name
a Refunding Bond is registered on the
Register shall be regarded as the
absolute owner of that Refunding
Bond for all purposes of this
Ordinance. Payment of or on account
of the debt charges on any Refunding
Bond shall be made only to or upon
the order of that person; neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary, but
the registration may be changed as
provided in this Section. All such payments shall be valid and effectual to
satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the Refunding Bond,
including interest, to the extent of the
amount or amounts so paid.
Any Refunding Bond may be
exchanged for Refunding Bonds of
any authorized denomination upon
presentation and surrender at the
principal corporate trust office of the
Registrar, together with a request for
exchange signed by the registered
owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to
the Registrar. A Refunding Bond may
be transferred only on the Register
upon presentation and surrender of
the Refunding Bond at the principal
corporate trust office of the Registrar
together with an assignment signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in a

November 24, 2010
form satisfactory to the Registrar.
Upon exchange or transfer the
Registrar shall complete, authenticate and deliver a new Refunding
Bond or Refunding Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner equal
in the aggregate to the unmatured
principal amount of the Refunding
Bond surrendered and bearing interest at the same rate and maturing on
the same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Refunding Bonds only
after the new Refunding Bonds are
signed by the authorized officers of
the City. In all cases of Refunding
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
authenticate
and
deliver
shall
Refunding Bonds in accordance with
the provisions of this Ordinance. The
exchange or transfer shall be without
charge to the owner, except that the
City and Registrar may make a
charge sufficient to reimburse them
for any tax or other governmental
charge required to be paid with
respect to the exchange or transfer.
The City or the Registrar may require
that those charges, if any, be paid
before the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Refunding
Bonds issued and authenticated upon
any exchange or transfer shall be
valid obligations of the City, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
Ordinance, as the Refunding Bonds
surrendered upon that exchange or
transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Refunding Bonds may be issued in
book entry form in accordance with
the provisions of this Section. As used
in this Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of beneficial interests in Refunding Bonds
and the principal of and interest on
the Refunding Bonds may be transferred only through a book entry, and
(ii) physical Refunding Bond certificates in fully registered form are
issued by the City only to a
Depository or its nominee as registered owner, with the Refunding
Bonds “immobilized” in the custody of
the Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial
interests
in
those
Refunding Bonds and that principal
and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited
purpose trust company), New York,
New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers,
banks and trust companies, and clearing corporations.
The Refunding Bonds may be
issued to a Depository for use in a
book entry system and, if and as long
as a book entry system is utilized: (i)
the Refunding Bonds may be issued
in the form of a single, fully regis-

The City Record
tered Refunding Bond representing
each maturity and registered in the
name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository;
(ii) the beneficial owners in book
entry form shall have no right to
receive Refunding Bonds in the form
of physical securities or certificates;
(iii) ownership of beneficial interests
in book entry form shall be shown by
book entry on the system maintained
and operated by the Depository and
its Participants, and transfers of the
ownership of beneficial interests
shall be made only by book entry by
the Depository and its Participants;
and (iv) the Refunding Bonds as such
shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for transfer to another
Depository or to another nominee of a
Depository, without further action by
the City.
If any Depository determines not to
continue to act as a Depository for the
Refunding Bonds for use in a book
entry system, the Director of Finance
may attempt to establish a securities
depository/book entry relationship
with another qualified Depository. If
the Director of Finance does not or is
unable to do so, the Registrar, after
making provision for notification of
the beneficial owners by the then
Depository and any other arrangements deemed necessary, shall permit
withdrawal of the Refunding Bonds
from the Depository, and the Trustee
and Registrar shall authenticate and
deliver Refunding Bond certificates
in registered form to the assigns of
the Depository or its nominee, all at
the cost and expense (including any
costs of printing), if the event is not
the result of City action or inaction, of
those
persons
requesting
such
issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to the
extent necessary or required to enter
into any agreements determined necessary in connection with the book
entry system for the Refunding
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger the
funds or securities of the City and
after the approval of the form of any
such agreement by the Director of
Law.
Section 4. Sale of Refunding Bonds.
The Refunding Bonds shall first be
offered for purchase to the Trustees
of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by them, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased for
that Account, shall be sold to one or
more firms that have proposed to
underwrite the Refunding Bonds and
have been selected by the Director of
Finance based on an evaluation of the
qualifications of those firms (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”).
The Refunding Bonds shall be
awarded to the Original Purchaser in
the Certificate of Award which shall
specify the final terms of the
Refunding Bonds in accordance with
law, the provisions of this Ordinance,
the written advice of a financial advisor retained under authority of
Section
20
and
the
Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Refunding Bonds, including: the principal amount of the Refunding Bonds,
the purchase price (which shall be not
less than 97% of the principal amount
of the Refunding Bonds plus any
accrued interest to their date of delivery), interest rate or rates, the
amounts and years in which principal
installments are payable (at stated
maturity or pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements), the Interest Payment

1847

19
Dates and the date of the Refunding
Bonds (if different from those set
forth in Section 2), and any other matters required in this Ordinance to be
set forth in that Certificate. As appropriate under the Charter, the Mayor,
Director of Finance, Director of Law,
Clerk of Council and other appropriate officers of the City are, and each
of them is, authorized to take such
actions as are necessary, appropriate
and in the best interest of the City to
establish the terms and requirements
for delivery of the Refunding Bonds
and to make such arrangements as
are necessary with the Original
Purchaser in order to establish the
date, location, procedure, and conditions
for
the
delivery
of
the
Refunding Bonds to the Original
Purchaser, to give all appropriate
notices and certificates, to cause a
true transcript of proceedings with
reference to the issuance of the
Refunding Bonds to be delivered to
the Original Purchaser, to sign any
transcript
certificates,
financial
statements and other documents and
instruments and to take such actions
as are necessary or appropriate to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take
all steps necessary to effect the due
execution, authentication and delivery of the Refunding Bonds. The
Director of Finance is further authorized to sign and deliver on behalf of
the City a bond purchase agreement
between the City and the Original
Purchaser (the “Bond Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form and
correctness by the Director of Law,
setting forth the terms and conditions
on which the City agrees to sell the
Refunding Bonds and the Original
Purchaser
agrees
to
buy
the
Refunding Bonds, which shall be consistent with this Ordinance, not substantially adverse to the City, and
approved by the Director of Finance
and the Director of Law on behalf of
the City, all of which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of the
Bond Purchase Agreement by the
Director of Finance. It is determined
that the terms of the Refunding
Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance
and as may be provided in or pursuant
to the Certificate of Award, are in the
best interest of the City and in compliance with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Director
of Finance, a disclosure document in
the form of an Official Statement is
appropriate or necessary in connection with the original issuance of the
Refunding Bonds, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare or
cause to be prepared on behalf of the
City an Official Statement and any
necessary supplements and to authorize the use and distribution of that
Official Statement and any supplements. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign on behalf of the
City that Official Statement and any
supplements. The Director of Finance
is authorized to sign and deliver, on
behalf of the City, such certificates in
connection with the accuracy of the
Official Statement and any supplements as may, in the Director’s judgment, be necessary or appropriate.
The Director of Finance is also authorized to determine and certify on
behalf of the City that such disclosure
document is “deemed final” by the
City within the meaning of Securities
and Exchange Commission Rule 15c212 (the “SEC Rule”). The Director of
Finance is authorized to contract for
services for the production and distribution of preliminary and final official statements, including by printed
and electronic means.

20
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time of
the Refunding Bonds, the City agrees,
in accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Refunding Bonds under the SEC Rule,
to provide or cause to be provided
such financial information and operating data and notices, in such manner, as may be required for purposes
of the SEC Rule. In order to describe
and specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare or
cause to be prepared, and to sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of
the City, a continuing disclosure
agreement or certificate, which shall
constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Refunding Bonds in
accordance with the SEC Rule. The
performance of that Agreement shall
be subject to the availability of funds
and their annual appropriation to
meet costs the City would be required
to incur to perform it. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to
establish procedures in order to
ensure compliance by the City with
its continuing disclosure agreement,
including the timely provision of
information and notices.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Refunding
Bonds promptly when and as the
same falls due, and also to provide for
the discharge of the Refunding Bonds
at maturity, there shall be and is
levied on all the taxable property in
the City, in addition to all other taxes,
a direct tax annually during the period the Refunding Bonds are outstanding, in an amount sufficient to provide for the payment of that interest,
when and as the same shall fall due,
and also to discharge the principal of
the Refunding Bonds at maturity,
which tax shall not be less than the
interest
and
sinking
fund
tax
required by Section 11 of Article XII
of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is ordered computed, certified, levied and extended
upon the tax duplicate and collected
by the same officers, in the same manner and at the same time that taxes
for general purposes for each of those
years are certified, extended and collected. The tax shall be placed before
and in preference to all other items
and for the full amount thereof. The
funds derived from those tax levies
shall be placed in the Unvoted Tax
Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund as required by the
General Bond Ordinance and those
funds, together with the interest collected on them shall be irrevocably
pledged for the payment of principal
of and interest on the Refunding
Bonds when and as the same fall due;
provided, however, that, subject to
the provisions of Section 8 of the
General Bond Ordinance, in each year
to the extent that revenues are available from other sources for the payment of the Refunding Bonds and are
appropriated for such purpose, the
amount of such tax shall be reduced
by the amount of such revenues so
available and appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25(B)(1) and 5705.51 of
the Revised Code, and in accordance
with the provisions of and to the

The City Record
extent required or permitted by the
General Bond Ordinance, that the City
will appropriate annually from the
proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt charges
for the Refunding Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds;
Notice of Redemption of Refunding
Bonds. Pursuant to Revised Code
Section 133.34, the General Bond
Ordinance and this Ordinance, the
proceeds of the Refunding Bonds to
be applied to the refunding of the
Refunded Bonds shall be deposited in
a separate bank account within the
Unvoted Refunding Bond and Note
Redemption Account of the Sinking
Fund held by The Huntington
National Bank, Cleveland, Ohio, as
Escrow Agent, in accordance with
of
the
Codified
Section  179.08

and shall be applied to the payment of
service

date of issuance of the Refunding
Bonds to and including their respective maturity or prior redemption

the Escrow Fund shall be determined
by the Director of Finance in the
Certificate of Award and shall be the
amount necessary, together with
money in the Unvoted Tax Supported
Obligations Account of the Sinking
Fund available for the purpose, to
provide for the refunding of the
Refunded Bonds. Any transfer to the
Escrow Fund of any money currently
on deposit in the Unvoted Tax
Supported Obligations Account and
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance to be available for payment
of the Refunding Bonds, is authorized
by this Ordinance.
Money deposited in the Escrow
Fund shall be (a) held in cash or (b)
invested in direct obligations of the
United States of America that mature
or are subject to redemption by and at
the option of the holder, in amounts
sufficient, together with any uninvested cash in the Escrow Fund but
without further investment or reinvestment, for the payment of the principal of, and any redemption premium
and interest on, the Refunded Bonds
as provided in the Escrow Agreement.
Pursuant
to
the
respective
Ordinances authorizing the Refunded
Bonds, Section 133.34 of the Revised
Code and this Ordinance, money
deposited in the Escrow Fund, and
the investment income thereon, are
pledged to the payment of the
Refunded Bonds.
Pursuant to Revised Code Chapter
133 and this Ordinance, and notwithstanding Chapter 179 of the Codified
Ordinances, any accrued interest
received from the sale of the
Refunding Bonds and any original
issue premium in excess of the
amount deposited with the Escrow
Agent under the Escrow Agreement
to accomplish the refunding of the
Refunded Bonds shall be deposited in
the
Unvoted
Tax
Supported
Obligations Account of the Sinking
Fund to be applied to the payment of
interest on the Refunding Bonds. The
proceeds of the Refunding Bonds to
be applied to pay costs of any Credit
Support Instruments obtained pursuant to Section 12 shall be paid to the
provider or providers of those Credit
Support Instruments. The proceeds of
the Refunding Bonds to be used to
pay costs of issuing the Refunding
Bonds and refunding the Refunded
Bonds shall be deposited with the
Registrar in a separate account under
the Registrar Agreement pending

1848

November 24, 2010
their application to the payment of
such costs.
The Director of Finance is authorized to sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the Issuer, an agreement (the “Escrow Agreement”)
between the City and the Escrow
Agent, providing for the investment
and holding in escrow of the proceeds
of the Refunding Bonds to be applied
to the refunding of the Refunded
Bonds and for the application of the
moneys derived from such investments, in accordance with the
General Bond Ordinance and this
Ordinance and as otherwise directed
by law. Notice of the advance refunding of any of the Refunded Bonds and
any direction for the redemption of
Refunded Bonds prior to stated maturity shall be given in accordance with
the terms of the Refunded Bonds and
as further provided in the Escrow
Agreement. The Refunded Bonds
shall be retired at stated maturity or
redeemed prior to maturity as provided in the Certificate of Award and in
accordance with the ordinance authorizing the respective Refunded Bonds
and the Escrow Agreement. The
Director of Finance shall provide for
the payment of the services rendered
and for reimbursement of expenses
incurred pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement from money lawfully
available and appropriated or to be
appropriated for that purpose. The
Director of Finance shall obtain the
services of an independent accounting firm of national reputation to provide a verification report as to the
adequacy of the escrow fund to pay
the Refunded Bonds on the dates set
forth in the Escrow Agreement. The
Director of Finance and other appropriate City officials shall execute all
documents and take all other actions
necessary or appropriate on the part
of the City to effect the refunding of
the Refunded Bonds in accordance
with the General Bond Ordinance and
this Ordinance and as otherwise
directed by law, and to cause the
Refunded Bonds to be deemed paid
and discharged.
If U.S. Treasury Securities State
and Local Government Series are to
be purchased for the Escrow Fund,
the Escrow Agent is authorized to
file, on behalf of the City, subscriptions for the purchase and issuance of
those Securities. If those Securities
are not timely available for purchase,
or if in the judgment of the Director of
Finance, an open-market purchase of
direct obligations of the United States
of America for the Escrow Fund is in
the best interest of and financially
advantageous
to
the
City,
the
Director of Finance may purchase
and deliver those obligations, engage
the services of a bidding agent or similar entity for the purpose of facilitating the bidding, purchase and delivery of such obligations for, and any
related structuring of, the Escrow
Fund, execute such instruments as
are deemed necessary to engage such
services for such purpose, and provide
further for the payment of the cost of
obtaining such services from the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds to the
extent available and otherwise from
any other funds lawfully available
and that are appropriated or shall be
appropriated for that purpose.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Refunding Bonds are secured by a
pledge and lien on a parity with the
pledges and liens authorized by the
General Bond Ordinance and, in addition to the taxes and revenues specifically pledged pursuant to this
Ordinance and the General Bond
Ordinance and the other covenants,

November 24, 2010
terms and agreements provided hereunder and in the General Bond
Ordinance to secure payment of the
principal of and interest on the
Refunding Bonds, the City hereby
determines, declares, warrants and
covenants that the Refunding Bonds
are general obligations of the City
and that the full faith and credit of
the City are hereby pledged for the
payment of the principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds in accordance with the laws and Constitution
of the State of Ohio, this Ordinance
and the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.

City shall pay or cause to be paid and
discharged
all
the
outstanding
Refunding Bonds, or there shall otherwise be paid to the holders of the
outstanding Refunding Bonds all
debt charges due or to become due
thereon, and provision shall also be
made for paying all other sums
payable hereunder, then and in that
event this Ordinance (except for
Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be
of further effect, and the covenants,
agreements and other obligations of
the City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the request
of the City execute and deliver to the
City such instruments in writing as
shall discharge the lien hereof and
enter on the record such discharge of
the lien and such other instruments as
may be reasonably required by the
City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds.
Outstanding
Refunding
Refunding Bonds shall be deemed to
have been paid and discharged within
the meaning of this Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a)
hereof, if:

Agent shall hold in special accounts
or sub-accounts, in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold in
special accounts or sub-accounts, in
trust for and irrevocably committed
solely thereto, direct obligations of
the United States certified by an independent public accounting firm of
national reputation to be of such

thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held in trust and
committed, except as hereinafter provided), as will be sufficient, together
with moneys referred to in (i) above,
for the payment, at their maturities or
redemption dates, of all debt charges
on the Refunding Bonds to their date
of maturity or redemption, as the case
may be, or if default in such payment
shall have occurred on such date then
to the date of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Refunding

Ordinance and the General Bond
Ordinance shall not apply to the
Refunding Bonds authorized herein.
(b) All covenants, terms and provisions of the General Bond Ordinance
are fully applicable to the Refunding
Bonds authorized herein, and nothing
in this Ordinance shall be deemed to
alter or restrict such full application
of the General Bond Ordinance,
except for the exclusion from application to the Refunding Bonds of the
provisions of the third paragraph of
Section 13(a) and the third paragraph
of Section 4 of the General Bond
Ordinance pursuant to Section 2 of

Section 11. Federal Tax Covenants.
The City covenants that it will use,
and will restrict the use and investment
of,
the
proceeds
of
the
Refunding Bonds in such manner and
to such extent as may be necessary so
that (a) the Refunding Bonds will not
(i) constitute private activity bonds,
arbitrage bonds or hedge bonds under
Sections 141, 148 or 149 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the Code) or (ii) be treated other
than as bonds to which Section 103(a)
of the Code applies, and (b) the interest thereon will not be treated as an
item of tax preference under Section
57 of the Code.
The City further covenants that (a)
it will take or cause to be taken such
actions that may be required of it for
the interest on the Refunding Bonds
to be and to remain excluded from
gross income for federal income tax
purposes, (b) it will not take or authorize to be taken any actions that
would adversely affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting for
it, will, among other acts of compliance, (i) apply the proceeds of the
Refunding Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing, (ii)
restrict the yield on investment property acquired with those proceeds,
(iii) make timely and adequate payments to the federal government, (iv)
maintain books and records and make
calculations and reports, and (v)
refrain from certain uses of those proceeds, and, as applicable, of property
financed with such proceeds, all in
such manner and to the extent necessary to assure such exclusion of that
interest under the Code.
Each covenant made in this section
with respect to the Refunding Bonds
is also made with respect to all issues
any portion of the debt service on
which is paid from proceeds of the
Refunding Bonds (and, if different,
the original issue and any refunding
issues in a series of refundings), to

1849

21
the extent such compliance is necessary to assure exclusion of interest on
the Refunding Bonds from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, and the officers identified above

respect to the Refunding Bonds.
The Director of Finance, as the fiscal officer, or any other officer of the

or give under the federal income tax
laws, including, without limitation
thereto, any of the elections provided

the Code, for the purpose of assuring,
enhancing or protecting favorable
tax treatment or status of the
Refunding Bonds or interest thereon
or assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose, reducing the
burden or expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or
payments or penalties, or making
payments of special amounts in lieu
of making computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as
rebate, or obviating those amounts or
payments, as determined by that officer, which action shall be in writing
and signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf of
the City, as may be appropriate to
assure the exclusion of interest from
gross income and the intended tax
status of the Refunding Bonds, and
(c) to give one or more appropriate
certificates of the City, for inclusion
in the transcript of proceedings for
the Refunding Bonds, setting forth
the reasonable expectations of the
City regarding the amount and use of
all the proceeds of the Refunding
Bonds, the facts, circumstances and
estimates on which they are based,
and other facts and circumstances relevant to the tax treatment of the
interest on and the tax status of the
Refunding Bonds.

Ratings. If, in the judgment of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,

the Director of Finance is authorized
to prepare and submit those applications and to provide to each such
agency such information as may be
required for the purpose. The Director
of Finance is authorized to contract

other evidence of legislative intent, it
is hereby declared to be the controlling legislative intent that if any such
section or part of a section or any provision thereof, or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the
remaining sections or parts of sections and the application of such provisions to any other person or circumstance, other than those as to which it
is held invalid, shall not be affected
thereby, and it is hereby declared to

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 1576-10.
By Council Member Sweeney.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio State Senate to put up for a
vote and pass House Bill 75 that creates an income tax refund “check-off”
contribution for the benefit of the
Ohio Historical Society.
Whereas,
the
Ohio
Historical
Society (OHS) has been working for
more than five years on legislation
that would create an income tax
refund check-off contribution for OHS
(House Bill 75) that would be used to
help support local history-related
organizations and projects; and
Whereas, House Bill 75 passed the
House
with
flying
colors
last
December by a bipartisan 95-1 vote,
and has since been unanimously
approved by a Senate committee; and
Whereas,
the
Ohio
Historical
Society needs the Ohio Senate to put
HB 75 up for a vote, but now the
Senate appears ready to call it quits
on the 128th General Assembly – to
not convene at all in the “lame duck”
session where unfinished business
such as HB 75 would otherwise be
passed; and
Whereas, if the Ohio Senate does
not pass HB 75 now it will die; and
Whereas, HB 75 co-sponsor Rep.
Kathleen Chandler is term-limited
and her main co-sponsor was defeated
– so neither of them will be back next
year; and
Whereas, given the dire state budget situation, passing HB 75 is one
way the Senate can help demonstrate
their support for history without costing the state anything; and
Whereas, HB 75 will be used to support the work of local history-related
organizations and projects through a
competitive matching grants program; and

1861

33
Whereas, while the Senate Ways
and
Means
and
Economic
Development Committee added an
amendment to HB 75 in the spring
that would also add a tax check-off
for the Ohio chapter of the American
Red Cross, OHS does not have a position on the Red Cross tax check-off,
and the Senate has the option to strip
that out of the bill if it so chooses; and
Whereas, OHS wants HB 75 to finally pass and move on to Governor
Strickland by the end of this year; and
Whereas, passage of HB 75 would
Cleveland
City
Council
benefit
Archives
along
with
all
Ohio
Archivists; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the

By Council Member Conwell.
An emergency resolution withdrawing supporting S.B. 235 and H.B.
493, which would create the offense of
“trafficking in persons”.
Whereas, it is estimated that hundreds of children are trafficked to and
from Ohio each year; and
Whereas, existing law provides
mandatory prison terms and requires
restitution for certain offenses committed in furtherance of human trafficking; and
Whereas, currently, most of Ohio’s
cases of human trafficking are
referred to the federal government
because Ohio’s specification is too difficult to prove and the federal statute
carries stiffer penalties; and
Whereas, SB 235 and HB 493 create
the offense of “trafficking in persons”
and will make Ohio more successful
at apprehending and prosecuting
traffickers; and
Whereas, his legislation will put
Ohio’s human trafficking definition
and stand–alone felony in line with
the Trafficking in Victims Protection
Act and the Department of Justice’s
definition of human trafficking; and
Whereas, this legislation will put
Ohio with 43 other states that have a
human trafficking definition and
stand-alone felony similar to the
Trafficking in Victims Protection Act
and the Department of Justice’s definition; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 1525-10.
By Council Members Cummins,
Keane, Kelley, Brady, J. Johnson,
Zone, Westbrook, Cleveland, Conwell,
Miller, Pruitt, Mitchell, Brancatelli,
Reed and Dow.
An emergency resolution urging
Governor-elect Kasich to continue the
3C rail project to preserve and create
good-paying rail industry jobs in
Ohio, to create affordable, energyefficient, high-quality rail transportation for Ohioans regardless of their
economic or physical ability, to promote jobs and real estate development near transportation centers in
Ohio’s largest central business districts, and to accomplish this using
only ODOT funds, as planned, that
would not burden the State of Ohio’s
troubled general revenue fund.

The City Record
Whereas, Ohio is suffering from a
10 percent unemployment rate as of
September 2010, according to the Ohio
Department of Job and Family
Services; and
Whereas, Ohio is the fifth-largest
rail industry state supplier in the
country, with 225 companies employing 26,000 people, according to the
Ohio Department of Transportation
(ODOT); and
Whereas, the Cleveland - Columbus
- Cincinnati (3C) travel corridor is the
most heavily traveled corridor for
passenger trips between metro areas
in the entire Midwest, according to
the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Bureau of Transportation
Statistics; and
Whereas, ODOT was awarded a
million
$400
zero-match-required
grant from the Federal Railroad
Administration to improve, modernize, make safer and more efficient the
railway infrastructure linking Ohio’s
largest cities for the movement of
freight and people; and
Whereas, Ohio rail industry supplier companies, including many in
Cleveland, are in an economically and
geographically advantageous position to win the construction, operation and maintenance contracts
resulting from this critically needed
federal grant; and
Whereas, the federal grant will not
incur any annual costs to the State of
Ohio’s troubled general revenue fund;
and
Whereas, the state’s share of passenger rail operating costs will
instead be supported by the ODOT
budget which is legally separate and
financially distinct from the State of
Ohio’s general revenue fund; and
Whereas, immediately upon his
election, Ohio Governor-elect John
Kasich asked in writing to President
Barack Obama and current Governor
Ted Strickland to cancel the 3C
Corridor project or instead use the
funding for freight rail and/or road
projects; and
Whereas, Governor Strickland has
declined to cancel the 3C project and
U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray
Governor-elect
informed
LaHood
Kasich in a letter dated Nov. 9, 2010
that the $400 million Ohio received
cannot legally be used for any purpose other than passenger rail corridor development and that if Ohio will
not use the $400 million for its legally
intended purposes, Ohio should immediately return the funds to the
Federal Railroad Administration; and
Whereas, the governors of Illinois,
New York and possibly other states
have asked the federal government
for Ohio’s $400 million if Governorelect Kasich opts out of it; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
urges Governor-elect Kasich to continue the 3C project to preserve and
create good-paying rail industry jobs
in Ohio, to create affordable, energyefficient, high-quality rail transportation for Ohioans regardless of their
economic or physical ability, to promote jobs and real estate development near transportation centers in
Ohio’s largest central business districts, and to accomplish this using
only ODOT funds, as planned, that
would not burden the State of Ohio’s
troubled general revenue fund; and

1871

43
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
encourages city and county officials,
Ohio
Assembly,
General
Ohio
Congressional Delegation and other
leaders to undertake all reasonable
action necessary to ensure the development of railroad infrastructure, service, safety and industries continues
unabated in Ohio’s 3C Corridor; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
Governor-elect Kasich to continue the
3C rail project to preserve and create
good-paying rail industry jobs in
Ohio, to create affordable, energyefficient, high-quality rail transportation for Ohioans regardless of their
economic or physical ability, to promote jobs and real estate development near transportation centers in
Ohio’s largest central business districts, and to accomplish this using
only ODOT funds, as planned, that
would not burden the State of Ohio’s
troubled general revenue fund.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit certified copies of this resolution to Mayor
Frank Jackson, Cuyahoga County
Executive-elect Ed FitzGerald and
members-elect,
council
county
Cuyahoga County members of the
Ohio General Assembly and Ohio
Congressional Delegation including
Senator-elect Rob Portman.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immeand
adoption
its
upon
diately

shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted November 15, 2010.
Effective November 19, 2010.

Res. No. 1526-10.
Council
Jackson,
Mayor
By
Members Kelley and Sweeney.
An emergency resolution supporting United States Senate Bill 3626, the
Thermal Renewable Energy and
Efficiency Act (TREEA) and companion legislation, United States
House of Representatives Bill 5805.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland is
extremely interested in doing all that
is feasible to foster a sustainable
energy infrastructure to provide for
its own facilities and those of the
City’s private and business residents.
Whereas, in addition, one of the significant businesses in the City is
Cleveland Thermal, a district energy
company whose facilities have provided thermal energy (steam and
chilled water) for heating and cooling purposes to a major segment of
the commercial, institutional and governmental buildings in downtown
Cleveland for over 100 years.
Whereas, the City and its residents
would benefit by both the City and
Cleveland Thermal being able to
access the significant incentives pro-

44
vided in the recently introduced
Senate
Bill
3626,
the
Thermal
Renewable Energy and Efficiency
Act (TREEA) and companion legislation introduced in the House of
Representatives Bill 5805); and
Whereas, TREEA focuses on a significant but overlooked part of the
U.S. energy picture: the 31% of all U.S.
energy consumption that is used for
thermal purposes – heating and cooling buildings and industrial processes; and
Whereas, the bill will stimulate
increased use of home-grown energy
sources that already exist in our
backyards, including biomass, geothermal and natural sources of air
conditioning, in the proven and reliable technology used in district energy facilities and CHP facilities
(Combined Heat and Power – the
concurrent production of thermal
and electric energy from a single
source) and will reduce carbon emissions, stabilize energy costs, create
domestic jobs and keep more energy
dollars
circulating
in
local
economies by doing the following
three things: 1) Make the production
tax credit (PTC) currently available
for renewable generation of electricity also applicable to thermal energy
(by limiting the PTC to electricity
only, we are missing opportunities
to expand the use of renewable energy); 2) Allow tax-exempt bonds to
finance renewable energy, CHP, and
other district energy production
facilities (currently, tax-exempt
bonds can be used only for financing
district energy piping distribution
systems but not plant facilities for
production of heating and cooling
energy); and 3) Modify a 2007 law
authorizing a program that would
provide grants to colleges, universities, cities, municipal utilities and
public school districts for implementing sustainable energy infrastructure (TREEA would modify the
authorization to strengthen this asyet unfunded program); and
Whereas, as an example, the incentives provided by TREEA could
enable the City and other governmental entities, such as Cleveland Public
Schools, to achieve energy infrastructure goals; and
Whereas, TREEA incentives could
also enable Cleveland Thermal to
modernize its facilities and build a
new CHP facility that would add up
to 50 new, highly skilled jobs and over
500 construction and facility support
jobs; and
Whereas, in addition, this plant
would reduce carbon emissions by as
much as 137,000 tons per year by
reducing coal use by as much as
110,000 tons as a direct result of CHP
efficiencies and the use of renewable
fuels.
Whereas,
these
results
and
TREEA’s basic premise are fully consistent with the conclusions of the
U.S. Department of Energy and the
Oak Ridge National Laboratory in a
joint report issued in December 2008;
and
Whereas, that report concluded
that CHP was a realistic solution to
enhance national energy efficiency,
ensure environmental quality, promote economic growth, and foster a
robust energy infrastructure; and

The City Record
Whereas, the report further concluded that, if the U.S. were to achieve
the goal of having 20% of its generating capacity produced by CHP facilities by 2030, the benefits would
include: A) A 60% reduction of the
projected increase in carbon dioxide
emissions – the equivalent of removing 154 million cars from the road; B)
Fuel savings of 5.3 quadrillion British
thermal units annually – the equivalent of nearly half the total energy
currently consumed by U.S. households; and C) The creation of 1 million
highly-skilled, competitive “green”
jobs and $234 billion in new investments throughout the U.S; and
Whereas, TREEA offers significant opportunities for both national
energy policy and the Cleveland area
economy; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports United States Senate Bill 3626,
the Thermal Renewable Energy and
Efficiency Act (TREEA) and companion legislation, United States
House of Representatives Bill 5805.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit a copy
of this resolution to the Unites States
Congress, Honorable Sherrod Brown,
Cleveland Thermal LLC, Charles
Evans, Managing Member and Mayor
Frank Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.

Whereas, she began working for

member for many years before serving as chair; and

An emergency ordinance to change
the name of Kentucky Garden in Ohio
City to the Kevin Maguire/Daniel
Cardenas Community Garden.
Whereas, the Ohio City community
honors
and
remembers
Kevin
Maguire and Daniel Cardenas as
beloved gardeners and forces for
good in the Kentucky Garden; and
Whereas, like many of us, Kevin
Maguire and his wife Joan and family
came from outside of this neighborhood. He grew up on a farm in Iowa,
and after graduating from college
there, moved to Milwaukee for
employment where he met and married Joan. They eventually moved to
Cleveland Heights, starting a family
of five wonderful kids. Kevin owned
an electrical insulation business off
of 55th and Broadway. Kevin and
Joan could have had a very comfortable life, with all of that. He was a
golfer. He and Joan were fantastic
ballroom dancers. They had friends
we wish we had for friends, too; and

November 24, 2010
Whereas, with Bill and Judy
Corrigan, Father Bob Begin, and
many others, the Maguires moved to
the Near West Side, as Ohio City was
known in the late 60’s, buying and
restoring a large home, and enrolled
the kids in public school, because,
with other members of the Thomas
Merton Community, they saw the
rightness, that people might live their
lives as brothers and sisters, Black
and White and Hispanic, rich and
poor, those who were many-talented
and obviously blessed, and those
whose gifts were more hidden, and
who needed our expressions of concern and love and patience and sharing to grow and recognize the goodness and dignity of their lives. They
saw the rightness of that. That people
might come from many different
directions, and discover a good-life
together; and
Whereas, Kevin and Joan helped
start the first hot meals, back then,
ladling out chili to the needy at St.
John’s Church. They provided a place
to a homeless man in the shelter of
their own home; and
Whereas, Kevin and Joan’s names
were the first to go onto the petition
to take over the Kentucky School
Garden, saving it from becoming a
school bus parking lot, and turning it
into the community-building garden
it is today; and
Whereas, but more than what they
“did”, the story of two lives, Kevin
and Joan, was always intertwined,
and has been a gracious dance playedout for us. A dance, that reminded us
of what it means to be vigorous and
flexible,
disciplined
and
yet
restrained, yet selfless and giving.
Balanced, yet dynamic. Gracious and
hospitable to all; and
Whereas, Joan and Kevin have
been witnesses for the people of the
neighborhood and to much of the City,
jogging, and later walking long distances, to Downtown, and Gordon
Square, witnesses not just to healthy
living, to healthy life-style, but witnesses to the love they had for one
another, as a couple. More than “keeping in shape”, just for themselves,
they have been an example of the
health and wellness of the relationship they maintained for one another.
They have always been about being a
couple, and as a couple they demonstrated an appreciation and a stewardship of the many blessings we
have been given, and which we are
entrusted with, that we might share
these blessings with others; and
Whereas, Kevin and Joan have
been community leaders, restoring
and beautifying their Ohio City home,
decades before there would be the
hope that others might do the same.
Walking rather than driving, because
it is good exercise for you, and you
meet people that way. Walking with a
plastic bag in hand, picking up every
piece of litter along the way.
Energizing the garden community,
and the yoga group; and
Whereas, this is just one very small
slice of the life of Kevin and
Joan...There are their remarkable,
successful children that grew up on
our streets, who have taken their own
gifts out to touch the lives of others,
and the fortunate friends from golfing and dancing; and

The City Record
Whereas, there are the tens of thousands who never got to know Kevin,
but who saw Kevin walking with
Joan, side by side, over the Detroit
Superior bridge, as a man and woman
in love. There are those who never
heard Kevin say a word, but who saw
him, and who understood what he
stood for, and these lives were
touched, in some small way, and they
were never the same; and
Whereas, at a time when it is
becoming harder and harder to find
common ground across generations,
between people of different ethnic
and economic backgrounds, Dan
Cardenas had a way of bringing people together. He did it through his
generosity and his love of food; and
Whereas, Dan was a prolific gardener and dedicated to the Kentucky
garden. He loved to eat and he loved
people.
Whereas, his neighbor Gregory
Peckham recalls, “I can’t count the
number of times he left home grown
goodness on our doorstep – tomatoes,
zucchini, garlic. It’s hard to describe
how a smell from a neighbor’s house
can make you feel at home in your
own.  But on Sunday mornings the
smell of chorizo and potatoes cooking
would drift from his kitchen window
into ours; and it made our house feel
like home.  We shared dishes with
him and his sister, Sara – a family
spare rib recipe, an Asian noodle
soup. In return, he lavished us with
tamales and other delicious dishes
and regularly brought us great treats
from his trips to Mexico, tamales;
stacks tortillas and bottles of tequila.
Dan embodied everything our family
has come to love about Ohio City.”;
and 
Whereas, Dan had graciousness,
wisdom, warmth, and humor. Dan was
the neighbor that everyone wants but
few are ever lucky enough to have;
and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the name of
Kentucky Garden be changed to the
Kevin
Maguire/Daniel
