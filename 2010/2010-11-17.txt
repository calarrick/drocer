Ord. No. 1515-10.
By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency ordinance to change
the name of Kentucky Garden in Ohio
City to the Kevin Maguire/Daniel
Cardenas Community Garden.
Whereas, the Ohio City community
honors
and
remembers
Kevin
Maguire and Daniel Cardenas as
beloved gardeners and forces for
good in the Kentucky Garden; and
Whereas, like many of us, Kevin
Maguire and his wife Joan and family
came from outside of this neighborhood. He grew up on a farm in Iowa,
and after graduating from college
there, moved to Milwaukee for
employment where he met and married Joan. They eventually moved to
Cleveland Heights, starting a family
of five wonderful kids. Kevin owned
an electrical insulation business off
of 55th and Broadway. Kevin and
Joan could have had a very comfortable life, with all of that. He was a
golfer. He and Joan were fantastic
ballroom dancers. They had friends
we wish we had for friends, too; and
Whereas, with Bill and Judy
Corrigan, Father Bob Begin, and
many others, the Maguires moved to
the Near West Side, as Ohio City was
known in the late 60’s, buying and
restoring a large home, and enrolled
the kids in public school, because,
with other members of the Thomas
Merton Community, they saw the
rightness, that people might live their
lives as brothers and sisters, Black
and White and Hispanic, rich and
poor, those who were many-talented
and obviously blessed, and those
whose gifts were more hidden, and
who needed our expressions of concern and love and patience and sharing to grow and recognize the goodness and dignity of their lives. They
saw the rightness of that. That people
might come from many different

1790

November 17, 2010
directions, and discover a good-life
together; and
Whereas, Kevin and Joan helped
start the first hot meals, back then,
ladling out chili to the needy at St.
John’s Church. They provided a place
to a homeless man in the shelter of
their own home; and
Whereas, Kevin and Joan’s names
were the first to go onto the petition
to take over the Kentucky School
Garden, saving it from becoming a
school bus parking lot, and turning it
into the community-building garden
it is today; and
Whereas, but more than what they
“did”, the story of two lives, Kevin
and Joan, was always intertwined,
and has been a gracious dance playedout for us. A dance, that reminded us
of what it means to be vigorous and
yet
flexible,
disciplined
and
restrained, yet selfless and giving.
Balanced, yet dynamic. Gracious and
hospitable to all; and
Whereas, Joan and Kevin have
been witnesses for the people of the
neighborhood and to much of the City,
jogging, and later walking long distances, to Downtown, and Gordon
Square, witnesses not just to healthy
living, to healthy life-style, but witnesses to the love they had for one
another, as a couple. More than “keeping in shape”, just for themselves,
they have been an example of the
health and wellness of the relationship they maintained for one another.
They have always been about being a
couple, and as a couple they demonstrated an appreciation and a stewardship of the many blessings we
have been given, and which we are
entrusted with, that we might share
these blessings with others; and
Whereas, Kevin and Joan have
been community leaders, restoring
and beautifying their Ohio City home,
decades before there would be the
hope that others might do the same.
Walking rather than driving, because
it is good exercise for you, and you
meet people that way. Walking with a
plastic bag in hand, picking up every
piece of litter along the way.
Energizing the garden community,
and the yoga group; and
Whereas, this is just one very small
slice of the life of Kevin and
Joan...There are their remarkable,
successful children that grew up on
our streets, who have taken their own
gifts out to touch the lives of others,
and the fortunate friends from golfing and dancing; and
Whereas, there are the tens of thousands who never got to know Kevin,
but who saw Kevin walking with
Joan, side by side, over the Detroit
Superior bridge, as a man and woman
in love. There are those who never
heard Kevin say a word, but who saw
him, and who understood what he
stood for, and these lives were
touched, in some small way, and they
were never the same; and
Whereas, at a time when it is
becoming harder and harder to find
common ground across generations,
between people of different ethnic
and economic backgrounds, Dan
Cardenas had a way of bringing people together. He did it through his
generosity and his love of food; and
Whereas, Dan was a prolific gardener and dedicated to the Kentucky
garden. He loved to eat and he loved
people.
Whereas, his neighbor Gregory
Peckham recalls, “I can’t count the
number of times he left home grown
goodness on our doorstep – tomatoes,
zucchini, garlic. It’s hard to describe
how a smell from a neighbor’s house

November 17, 2010
can make you feel at home in your
own.  But on Sunday mornings the
smell of chorizo and potatoes cooking
would drift from his kitchen window
into ours; and it made our house feel
like home.  We shared dishes with
him and his sister, Sara – a family
spare rib recipe, an Asian noodle
soup. In return, he lavished us with
tamales and other delicious dishes
and regularly brought us great treats
from his trips to Mexico, tamales;
stacks tortillas and bottles of tequila.
Dan embodied everything our family
has come to love about Ohio City.”;
and 
Whereas, Dan had graciousness,
wisdom, warmth, and humor. Dan was
the neighbor that everyone wants but
few are ever lucky enough to have;
and

an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL

Res. No. 1525-10.
By Council Members Cummins,
Keane, Kelley, Brady, J. Johnson,
Zone, Westbrook, Cleveland, Conwell,
Miller, Pruitt, Mitchell, Brancatelli,
Reed and Dow.
An emergency resolution urging
Governor-elect Kasich to continue the
3C rail project to preserve and create
good-paying rail industry jobs in
Ohio, to create affordable, energyefficient, high-quality rail transportation for Ohioans regardless of their
economic or physical ability, to promote jobs and real estate development near transportation centers in

Ohio’s largest central business districts, and to accomplish this using
only ODOT funds, as planned, that
would not burden the State of Ohio’s
troubled general revenue fund.
Whereas, Ohio is suffering from a
10 percent unemployment rate as of
September 2010, according to the Ohio
Department of Job and Family
Services; and
Whereas, Ohio is the fifth-largest
rail industry state supplier in the
country, with 225 companies employing 26,000 people, according to the
Ohio Department of Transportation
(ODOT); and
Whereas, the Cleveland - Columbus
- Cincinnati (3C) travel corridor is the
most heavily traveled corridor for
passenger trips between metro areas
in the entire Midwest, according to
U.S.
Department
of
the
Transportation’s
Bureau
of
Transportation Statistics; and
Whereas, ODOT was awarded a
$400
million
zero-match-required
grant from the Federal Railroad
Administration to improve, modernize, make safer and more efficient the
railway infrastructure linking Ohio’s
largest cities for the movement of
freight and people; and
Whereas, Ohio rail industry supplier companies, including many in
Cleveland, are in an economically and
geographically advantageous position to win the construction, operation and maintenance contracts
resulting from this critically needed
federal grant; and
Whereas, the federal grant will not
incur any annual costs to the State of
Ohio’s troubled general revenue fund;
and
Whereas, the state’s share of passenger rail operating costs will
instead be supported by the ODOT
budget which is legally separate and
financially distinct from the State of
Ohio’s general revenue fund; and
Whereas, immediately upon his
election, Ohio Governor-elect John
Kasich asked in writing to President
Barack Obama and current Governor
Ted Strickland to cancel the 3C
Corridor project or instead use the
funding for freight rail and/or road
projects; and
Whereas, Governor Strickland has
declined to cancel the 3C project and
U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray
LaHood
informed
Governor-elect
Kasich in a letter dated Nov. 9, 2010
that the $400 million Ohio received
cannot legally be used for any purpose other than passenger rail corridor development and that if Ohio will
not use the $400 million for its legally
intended purposes, Ohio should immediately return the funds to the
Federal Railroad Administration; and
Whereas, the governors of Illinois,
New York and possibly other states
have asked the federal government
for Ohio’s $400 million if Governorelect Kasich opts out of it; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
urges Governor-elect Kasich to continue the 3C project to preserve and
create good-paying rail industry jobs
in Ohio, to create affordable, energyefficient, high-quality rail transportation for Ohioans regardless of their
economic or physical ability, to promote jobs and real estate development near transportation centers in
Ohio’s largest central business districts, and to accomplish this using
only ODOT funds, as planned, that
would not burden the State of Ohio’s
troubled general revenue fund; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
encourages city and county officials,
Ohio
General
Assembly,
Ohio
Congressional Delegation and other

1792

November 17, 2010
leaders to undertake all reasonable
action necessary to ensure the development of railroad infrastructure, service, safety and industries continues
unabated in Ohio’s 3C Corridor; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
Governor-elect Kasich to continue the
3C rail project to preserve and create
good-paying rail industry jobs in
Ohio, to create affordable, energyefficient, high-quality rail transportation for Ohioans regardless of their
economic or physical ability, to promote jobs and real estate development near transportation centers in
Ohio’s largest central business districts, and to accomplish this using
only ODOT funds, as planned, that
would not burden the State of Ohio’s

Council
Members Kelley and Sweeney.
An emergency resolution supporting United States Senate Bill 3626, the
Thermal Renewable Energy and
Efficiency Act (TREEA) and companion legislation, United States
House of Representatives Bill 5805.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland is
extremely interested in doing all that
is feasible to foster a sustainable
energy infrastructure to provide for
its own facilities and those of the
City’s private and business residents.
Whereas, in addition, one of the significant businesses in the City is
Cleveland Thermal, a district energy
company whose facilities have provided thermal energy (steam and
chilled water) for heating and cooling purposes to a major segment of
the commercial, institutional and governmental buildings in downtown
Cleveland for over 100 years.
Whereas, the City and its residents
would benefit by both the City and
Cleveland Thermal being able to
access the significant incentives provided in the recently introduced

November 17, 2010
Senate
Bill
3626,
the
Thermal
Renewable Energy and Efficiency
Act (TREEA) and companion legislation introduced in the House of
Representatives Bill 5805); and
Whereas, TREEA focuses on a significant but overlooked part of the
U.S. energy picture: the 31% of all U.S.
energy consumption that is used for
thermal purposes – heating and cooling buildings and industrial processes; and
Whereas, the bill will stimulate
increased use of home-grown energy
sources that already exist in our
backyards, including biomass, geothermal and natural sources of air conditioning, in the proven and reliable
technology used in district energy
and
CHP
facilities
facilities
(Combined Heat and Power – the concurrent production of thermal and
electric energy from a single source)
and will reduce carbon emissions, stabilize energy costs, create domestic
jobs and keep more energy dollars circulating in local economies by doing
the following three things: 1) Make
the production tax credit (PTC) currently available for renewable generation of electricity also applicable to
thermal energy (by limiting the PTC
to electricity only, we are missing
opportunities to expand the use of
renewable energy); 2) Allow taxexempt bonds to finance renewable
energy, CHP, and other district energy production facilities (currently,
tax-exempt bonds can be used only for
financing district energy piping distribution systems but not plant facilities for production of heating and
cooling energy); and 3) Modify a 2007
law authorizing a program that
would provide grants to colleges, universities, cities, municipal utilities
and public school districts for implementing sustainable energy infrastructure (TREEA would modify the
authorization to strengthen this asyet unfunded program); and
Whereas, as an example, the incentives provided by TREEA could
enable the City and other governmental entities, such as Cleveland Public
Schools, to achieve energy infrastructure goals; and
Whereas, TREEA incentives could
also enable Cleveland Thermal to
modernize its facilities and build a
new CHP facility that would add up
to 50 new, highly skilled jobs and over
500 construction and facility support
jobs; and
Whereas, in addition, this plant
would reduce carbon emissions by as
much as 137,000 tons per year by
reducing coal use by as much as
110,000 tons as a direct result of CHP
efficiencies and the use of renewable
fuels.
Whereas,
these
results
and
TREEA’s basic premise are fully consistent with the conclusions of the
U.S. Department of Energy and the
Oak Ridge National Laboratory in a
joint report issued in December 2008;
and
Whereas, that report concluded
that CHP was a realistic solution to
enhance national energy efficiency,
ensure environmental quality, promote economic growth, and foster a
robust energy infrastructure; and
Whereas, the report further concluded that, if the U.S. were to achieve
the goal of having 20% of its generating capacity produced by CHP facilities by 2030, the benefits would
include: A) A 60% reduction of the
projected increase in carbon dioxide
emissions – the equivalent of removing 154 million cars from the road; B)
Fuel savings of 5.3 quadrillion British
thermal units annually – the equiva-

The City Record
lent of nearly half the total energy
currently consumed by U.S. households; and C) The creation of 1 million
highly-skilled, competitive “green”
jobs and $234 billion in new investments throughout the U.S; and
Whereas, TREEA offers significant opportunities for both national
energy policy and the Cleveland area
economy; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports United States Senate Bill 3626,
the Thermal Renewable Energy and
Efficiency Act (TREEA) and companion legislation, United States
House of Representatives Bill 5805.

An emergency resolution objecting
to the transfer of ownership of a D5
and D6 Liquor Permit to 727 Bolivar
Road and Patio.
Whereas, Council has been notified
by the Department of Liquor Control
of an application for the transfer of
ownership of a D5 and D6 Liquor
Permit from CRK Enterprises, Inc.,
DBA Gateway Sports Bar, 727 Bolivar
Road and patio, Cleveland, Ohio

Tops and Bottoms Gentlemen’s Club,
LLC, 727 Bolivar Road and patio,
Cleveland, Ohio 44115, Permanent
Number 8995856; and
Whereas, the granting of this application for a liquor permit to this high
crime area, which is already saturated with other liquor outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire
community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard of
the laws, regulations or local ordinances of this state or any other state;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed to
the building, safety or health requirements of the governing body of this
County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or constructed that law enforcement officers or agents of the Department of
Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it

1793

substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based on

authorizes the City to issue the
Refunding Bonds in one or more
Series for the purpose of refunding
one or more Series of Outstanding
Revenue Bonds, or designated portions thereof, to obtain aggregate
net present value debt service savings, or to eliminate or modify
covenants that are unduly restrictive, or to obtain a more favorable
debt service structure or more favorable terms under Credit Support
Instruments. With respect to Outstanding Revenue Bonds that are
short-term or variable-rate obligations, this Council authorizes the
City to issue Refunding Bonds to
refund such Outstanding Revenue
Bonds, or designated portions thereof, for the further purpose that the
Director of Finance has determined,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that such Outstanding Revenue Bonds are subjecting the City to undesirably high
rates of interest or undesirable fluctuations in rates of interest or risks
or expenses associated with Credit
Support Instruments that can economically be avoided or mitigated
through refunding. The principal
amount of each Series of Refunding
Bonds is to be the amount set forth
in the Certificate of Award authorized in Section 4 and determined by
the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, to be necessary (i) to
refund the Refunded Bonds to be
refunded by that Series, (ii) to fund
any deposit to the Debt Service
Reserve Fund required under the
Indenture or any special reserve
fund for that Series separate from
the Debt Service Reserve Fund, (iv)
to pay costs of any Credit Support
Instruments,
(v)
to
pay
any
amounts owed under Hedge Agreements, and (vi) to pay costs of issuing
the
Refunding
Bonds
and
refunding the Refunded Bonds. The
proceeds from the sale of each
Series of Refunding Bonds shall be
allocated, deposited and applied as
provided in Section 5.
The Refunding Bonds may be
issued in one or more separate
Series, each bearing a distinctive
designation,
provided
that
the
Refunding Bonds of each Series satisfy the requirements of this Ordinance. Separate Series of Refunding
Bonds may be issued at the same or
different
times.
The
Refunding
Bonds of each Series shall be designated as provided in the applicable Certificate of Award and shall
include in the designation reference
to the calendar year in which the
applicable Series is issued. A separate Certificate of Award and a separate Supplemental Indenture shall
be delivered for each Series.
Section 3. Variable Rate Refunding Bonds. In the event that a Series
of Refunding Bonds bear interest at
variable interest rates, then the
Director of Finance is authorized to
determine the method and procedure
by which the variable rate of interest to be borne by the Refunding
Bonds of that Series shall be determined, whether by reference to a
market index, by a remarketing
agent or otherwise; provided that no
variable rate Refunding Bonds may
bear interest at a rate in excess of
twenty-five percent (25%) per year

The City Record
(including any Refunding Bonds
held by a provider of a Credit Support Instrument). The Director of
Finance may determine that the
terms of a variable rate Series of
Refunding Bonds may or may not
permit the holders to tender their
variable rate Refunding Bonds for
purchase by the City. The Director
of Finance shall also designate in
the Certificate of Award for those
variable rate Refunding Bonds (and
may designate others, from time to
time, in substitution therefor) the
tender agent or agents and the
remarketing agent or agents, which
designations shall be based on the
determination of the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed
to provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable. The Director of Finance is authorized to enter
into agreements in connection with
the delivery of each Series of variable rate Refunding Bonds, and
from time to time thereafter so long
as the variable rate Refunding
Bonds of that Series are outstanding, with providers of Credit Support
Instruments, tender agents (which
may be the Trustee), remarketing
agents (which may be any of the
Original Purchasers), purchasers of
tendered Refunding Bonds, and others as may be determined by the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, to be necessary or appropriate
to provide for (i) the method of
determining the variable interest
rates, (ii) the rights and procedures
for tender, (iii) liquidity or credit
support, (iv) repayment by the City
of any amounts drawn under the
Credit Support Instrument, (v) the
direct purchase of tendered Refunding Bonds, and (vi) other arrangements in the best interests of the
City. The Director of Finance is further authorized to terminate any
such agreements if the Director of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the City’s best interests
will be served by such termination.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized to enter into agreements,
from time to time so long as the
variable rate Refunding Bonds are
outstanding,
supplementing
or
amending the applicable Supplemental Indenture for a series of
Refunding Bonds as provided in Section 9. The Director of Finance is
authorized to pay any fees associated with agreements entered into
or terminated pursuant to this Section from proceeds of Refunding
Bonds, to the extent permitted by
the Indenture, and from the Net Revenues of the Utility.
Section 4. Award and Sale of
Refunding Bonds. The Director of
Finance shall sign and deliver a
Certificate of Award for the Refunding Bonds. In the event the Refunding Bonds are issued in more than
one Series, a separate Certificate of
Award shall be signed and delivered
for each separately delivered Series.
The sale of each Series of the
Refunding Bonds shall be awarded
to the Original Purchasers selected
by the Director of Finance, based on
an evaluation of the qualifications
of firms that have proposed to
underwrite the Refunding Bonds.
The Original Purchaser so selected
shall be identified in the Certificate

determined by adding to the aggregate
principal
amount
of
the
Refunding Bonds any aggregate
original issue premium and subtracting from the amount any aggregate original issue discount, plus
(ii) any accrued interest on the
Refunding Bonds from their date to

Original Purchasers;

principal amount redeemed or by a
formula intended to make the bondholder whole for the loss of the
investment resulting from the early
redemption or by other methodology;
(d) the dates on which and
amounts in which principal of the
Refunding Bonds is to be paid,
which shall be not later than thirty
(30) years from their respective
dates of issuance, with an identification of whether the payment is
due by stated maturity or by mandatory sinking fund redemption of
Refunding Bonds of a particular
maturity;

by Refunding Bonds bearing interest at a fixed rate, the weighted
average of which shall not exceed
seven percent (7%) as to Refunding
Bonds of any Series that are TaxExempt Obligations or nine percent

Series that are Taxable Obligations,

rate is to be determined for Refunding Bonds bearing interest at variable rates, consistent with Section 3;

a special reserve fund for the
Refunding Bonds of any Series, separate from the Debt Service Reserve
Fund, and any determination as to
whether a Credit Support Instrument shall be provided in lieu of
cash in the Debt Service Reserve
Fund or such special reserve fund;
(i) the Paying Agent; and
(j) whether any Refunding Bonds

necessary or appropriate to accomplish the refunding of Refunded
Bonds, including without limitation,

payment of debt service on the
Refunded Bond to which the Escrow
Fund relates and to make any determinations required for the interest
on the Refunding Bonds to be
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes.
Section 8. Rebate Fund. There is
established and ordered to be maintained a separate account for each
Series of Refunding Bonds within
the Rebate Fund held in the custody
of the Trustee under the Indenture.
The Rebate Fund is not pledged to
the payment of debt service and is
free and clear of any pledge or lien
given under the Indenture as security for the Refunding Bonds or the
Outstanding Revenue Bonds. Calculations of excess earnings that may
be due and payable to the federal
government pursuant to the Code
and deposits to those accounts of
the Rebate Fund shall be made as
provided in the applicable Supplemental Indenture.
Section 9. Remarketing. In the
event that the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
it is advantageous to the City to
convert the interest on any Outstanding Revenue Bonds or Refunding Bonds to fixed interest rates for
a period of time or to maturity, or
to convert the interest on any Outstanding Revenue Bonds or Refunding Bonds to a different variable
rate period or mode, or to terminate
or take other actions with respect to
any existing Credit Support Instrument that will require a tender and
remarketing of any Outstanding
Revenue Bonds or Refunding Bonds
under the Indenture (such conversion or other actions and the tender
and remarketing being collectively
referred to in this Section as “remarketing”), the City shall undertake
the remarketing in accordance with
the Indenture. In connection with
any remarketing of Bonds, the
Director of Finance is authorized to
take such actions that she determines, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, will facilitate the remarketing of the Bonds
or otherwise be in the best interests
of the City, including without limitation, obtaining one or more Credit Support Instruments, terminating
any Credit Support Instrument, and
entering into agreements with one
or more purchasers for their direct
purchase of the remarketed Bonds
in lieu of a public offering of the
Bonds by a remarketing agent. In
the event the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
it is necessary to supplement or
amend the Supplemental Indenture
applicable to a Series of Bonds to be
remarketed in order to address current market conditions or to permit
the use of or to terminate a Credit
Support Instrument or otherwise
obtain
financing
arrangements
advantageous to the City, the Mayor,
the Director of Finance and the
Director of Public Utilities, or any
two of them, are authorized to sign
and deliver an amendment of that

The City Record
Supplemental
Indenture,
or
an
amended and restated Supplemental
Indenture, approved as to form by
the Director of Law, subject to the
Original Indenture as theretofore
amended.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized to satisfy the Debt Service Reserve Requirement or any
special reserve fund requirement for
the Series of Bonds to be remarketed, by the deposit of a Credit Support Instrument in lieu of cash, as
permitted and more specifically provided in the Indenture, and to apply
cash released from the Debt Service
Fund
or
such
special
Reserve
reserve fund to the payment of costs
of remarketing or other purposes
permitted by applicable laws. To the
extent the costs of remarketing are
not paid from any cash released
from the Debt Service Reserve Fund
or such special reserve fund, those
costs shall be paid from funds of the
Water Division, which are appropriated for that purpose.
The Director of Finance and the
Director of Public Utilities are
authorized to prepare one or more
disclosure documents in connection
with any remarketing of Bonds
under the same terms and conditions
as set forth in Section 14 of this
Ordinance
with
respect
to
the
issuance of Refunding Bonds. The
Director of Finance, the Director of
Public Utilities or any other officer
of the City, as appropriate under the
Charter, is authorized to take such
actions or cause to be taken such
actions as are necessary to maintain
the applicable tax status of such
Bonds and the covenants and authorizations in Section 12 of this Ordinance shall apply to such Bonds.
The Mayor, the Director of Finance,
the Director of Public Utilities and
other City officials, as appropriate
under the Charter, are authorized to
sign and deliver such instruments,
certificates and documents as are
necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions authorized by
this
Section.
The
Director
of
Finance, the Director of Public Utilities, the Director of Law and other
City officials, as appropriate under
the Charter, are authorized to make
the
necessary
arrangements
on
behalf of the City to establish the
date, location, procedure and conditions for the remarketing of any
Bonds and to take all actions necessary to effect the remarketing of
any Bonds under the terms of this
Ordinance and the Indenture. The
Clerk of Council or other appropriate official of the City shall furnish
the Trustee a true transcript of proceedings certified by the Clerk or
other official, of all proceedings had
with reference to the remarketing of
any Bonds along with such information for the records as is necessary to determine the validity of the
remarketing.
Section 10. Tender Offers. In connection with refinancing or restructuring any Outstanding Revenue
Bonds, the Director of Finance is
authorized to make a Tender Offer
for
those
Outstanding
Revenue
Bonds or any one or more maturities of the Outstanding Revenue
Bonds on such terms as the Director of Finance determines, in consultation with a Financial Advisor,
will result in debt service savings
to the City or the elimination or
modification of covenants that are
unduly restrictive or a more favorable debt service structure or more
favorable terms under Credit Support Instruments or other advan-

1810

November 17, 2010
tages to the City. The purchase
price for the purchase of any Outstanding Revenue Bonds tendered
for purchase in response to the Tender Offer shall be paid from proceeds of Refunding Bonds and any
other funds of the City available for
purpose.
The
Director
of
the
Finance is authorized to retain the
services of one or more firms to
serve as dealer manager, depository
and information agent in connection
with any Tender Offer and to pay
the fees and expenses of those firms
from proceeds of Refunding Bonds
or other funds of the City available
for the purpose; provided the Director of Finance determines that the
firms so retained possess the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required of them
and that the terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide such services are fair and commercially reasonable. The Director
of Finance is authorized to prepare
disclosure documents relating to the
terms and conditions of the Tender
Offer and containing information
about the City and the Waterworks
System and to authorize the use and
distribution of those disclosure documents.
Section 11. Authorization of Hedging
Arrangements.
This
Council
finds that by engaging in interest
rate hedging arrangements with
respect to Bonds the City may
reduce its cost of borrowing by optimizing the relative amounts of its
fixed and variable rate obligations
or minimizing the risk of variations
in its debt service costs or obtaining savings by confirming rates of
interest on Bonds in advance of
their issuance. To permit the City to
have the flexibility to undertake
with respect to Bonds interest rate
swap, swaption, rate cap, rate collar
and
other
hedging
transactions,
from time to time, and to establish
the procedures for approving those
transactions, this Council authorizes
the signing and delivery of one or
more agreements, including amendments or supplements to existing
agreements (each, a “Hedge Agreement”), and any related agreements
necessary for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by
each Hedge Agreement. The authorizations in this Section are supplemental to and not in derogation of
any authority provided by any other
ordinance of this Council concerning
hedging arrangements.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is to the financial advantage of the City and in the City’s
best
interests
that
a
hedging
arrangement be undertaken by the
City with respect to any Bonds
issued or to be issued under the
Indenture, the Director of Finance
may authorize one or more interest
rate hedge transactions in accordance with the applicable Hedge
Agreement; provided that (a) the
counterparty shall be rated at the
time of signing the Hedge Agreement not lower than A by at least
one rating agency or its obligations
under the Hedge Agreement shall be
guaranteed or insured by an entity
rated at the time of signing the
Hedge Agreement not lower than A
by at least one rating agency, with
such rating in either case determined without regard to a gradation
by numerical or plus or minus or
other modifier and (b) the term of
each hedge transaction shall not
exceed the final maturity of the
Bonds to which the hedge relates.

November 17, 2010
The Director of Finance shall
negotiate the terms of each Hedge
Agreement with a counterparty satisfying the credit criteria in this
Ordinance. The City shall receive a
written opinion of a Financial Advisor that the payments to be made
by the counterparty to the City, or
by the City to the counterparty,
shall be fair value for the Hedge
considering,
among
Agreement,
other things, the credit of the City
and the counterparty and the terms
and conditions of the Hedge Agreement. The Director of Finance shall
determine the terms and conditions
of the Hedge Agreement, including
without limitation, the rates to be
paid by the counterparty to the City
and by the City to the counterparty
under the Hedge Agreement, the
time or times and procedures for the
exercise by the counterparty or the
City, as the case may be, of any
option under the Hedge Agreement,
and whether the obligations of the
City under the Hedge Agreement
shall be secured by a Credit Support
Instrument. The approval of each
interest rate hedge transaction by
the Director of Finance shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing
and
delivery
of
the
applicable
Hedge Agreement by the Director of
Finance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to terminate any Hedge Agreements in whole or in part or any
Credit Support Instrument securing
a Hedge Agreement if the Director
of Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the City’s best interests
will be served by such termination.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized to enter into amendments
or modifications of a Hedge Agreement or any Credit Support Instrument securing a Hedge Agreement
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the City’s best interests will be
served by such amendment or modification.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from the Net Revenues of the Utility and may be payable also from
other funds permitted by law to be
used for the purpose, as identified
by the Director of Finance in the
Hedge Agreement. Those payments
may be secured by a pledge of Net
Revenues, to the extent permitted
by the Indenture, all as determined
by the Director of Finance and set
forth in the Hedge Agreement. The
obligation of the City to make payments under any Hedge Agreement
does not and shall not represent or
constitute a general obligation, debt,
bonded indebtedness or a pledge of
the faith and credit of the City or
the State of Ohio. Nothing gives any
party to any Hedge Agreement the
right to have excises, ad valorem or
other taxes levied by the City or the
State of Ohio for the payment of any
amounts due under any Hedge
Agreement.
Section 12. Covenants of the City.
The City, by issuance of each Series
of Refunding Bonds, covenants and
agrees with the Holders of that
Series of Refunding Bonds, that:
(a) The City will use the proceeds
of the Refunding Bonds for the purposes specified in Section 2.
(b) The Clerk, or other appropriate officer of the City, will furnish
to the Original Purchasers and to
the Trustee a true transcript of proceedings, certified by the Clerk or
other officer, of all proceedings had

The City Record
with reference to the issuance of the
Refunding
Bonds,
together
with
information from the City’s records
as is necessary to determine the regularity and validity of the issuance
of the Refunding Bonds.
(c) The City will, at any and all
times, cause to be done all such further acts and things and cause to be
signed and delivered all further
instruments as may be necessary to
carry out the purpose of the Refunding Bonds and this Ordinance or as
may be required by Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio or the Charter of the City or the Indenture or
the applicable Supplemental Indenture and will comply with all
requirements of law applicable to
the Waterworks System and the
operation thereof.
(d) The City will observe and perform all its agreements and obligations provided for in the Refunding
Bonds, this Ordinance, the Indenture
and each Supplemental Indenture.
All of the obligations under this
Ordinance and the Indenture and
each Supplemental Indenture are
hereby established as duties specifically enjoined by law and resulting
from an office, trust or station upon
the City within the meaning of Section 2731.01, Ohio Revised Code.
(e) The City will use, and will
restrict the use and investment of,
proceeds
of
the
Refunding
the
Bonds that are issued as TaxExempt Obligations in such manner
and to such extent as may be necessary so that (a) the Refunding
Bonds will not (i) constitute private
activity bonds, arbitrage bonds or
hedge bonds under Sections 141, 148
or 149 of the Code or (ii) be treated other than as bonds to which Section 103(a) of the Code applies, and
(b) the interest thereon will not be
treated as an item of tax preference
under Section 57 of the Code.
(f) The City covenants that (a) it
will take or cause to be taken such
actions that may be required of it
for the interest on the Refunding
Bonds that are issued as TaxExempt Obligations to be and to
remain excluded from gross income
for federal income tax purposes, (b)
it will not take or authorize to be
taken
any
actions
that
would
adversely affect that exclusion, and
(c) it, or persons acting for it, will,
among other acts of compliance, (i)
apply the proceeds of the Refunding
Bonds to the governmental purpose
of the borrowing, (ii) restrict the
yield
on
investment
property
acquired with those proceeds, (iii)
make timely rebate payments to the
federal government, (iv) maintain
books and records and make calculations and reports, and (v) refrain
from certain uses of proceeds, and,
as applicable, of property financed
with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the extent necessary to
assure such exclusion of that interest under the Code.
Each covenant made in this section with respect to the Refunding
Bonds is also made with respect to
all issues for which any portion of
the debt service is paid from proceeds of the Refunding Bonds (and,
if different, the original issue and
any refunding issues in a Series of
refundings), to the extent such compliance is necessary to assure exclusion of interest on the Refunding
Bonds that are issued as TaxExempt
Obligations
from
gross
income for federal income tax purposes, and the Director of Finance,
or any other officer having responsibility with respect to the Refund-

1811

29
ing Bonds, is authorized to take
such actions with respect to those
issues as they are authorized in this
section to take with respect to the
Refunding Bonds.
The
Mayor,
the
Director
of
Finance or any other officer of the
City, as appropriate under the Charter, is authorized (a) to make or
effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent, approval or
waiver on behalf of the City with
respect to the Refunding Bonds as
the City is permitted or required to
make or give under the federal
income tax laws, including, without
limitation, any of the elections
available under Section 148 of the
Code, for the purpose of assuring,
enhancing or protecting the favorable tax treatment or status of the
Refunding Bonds that are issued as
Tax-Exempt Obligations or interest
or
assisting
compliance
thereon
with requirements for that purpose,
reducing the burden or expense of
compliance,
reducing
the
rebate
amount or payments or penalties, or
making
payments
of
special
amounts in lieu of making computations to determine, or paying,
excess earnings as rebate, or obviating those amount or payments, as
determined by that officer, (b) to
take any and all other actions, make
or obtain calculations, make payments, and make or give reports,
covenants and certifications of and
on behalf of the City, as may be
appropriate to assure the exclusion
of interest from gross income and
the intended tax status of the
Refunding Bonds that are issued as
Tax-Exempt Obligations, and (c) to
give one or more appropriate certificates of the City, for inclusion in
the transcript of proceedings for the
Refunding Bonds, setting forth the
reasonable expectations of the City
regarding the amount and use of all
the
proceeds
of
the
Refunding
Bonds, the facts, circumstances and
estimates on which they are based,
and other facts and circumstances
relevant to the tax treatment or status of the Refunding Bonds and
interest thereon.
If the Director of Finance determines, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, and so specifies in the Certificate of Award
that the best interests of the City
would be served by issuing a Series
of Refunding Bonds the interest on
which would not be excluded from
gross income for federal income tax
purposes,
then
the
tax-related
covenants in this Section shall not
apply to or be required to be made
with respect to the Refunding Bonds
of that Series.
Section
13.
Ratings;
Credit
Enhancement. If, in the judgment of
the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, the filing of an application
for a rating on one or more Series
of Outstanding Revenue Bonds or
Refunding Bonds by one or more
nationally recognized rating agencies is in the best interests of the
City, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare and submit
those applications and to provide to
each such agency such information
as may be required for the purpose.
The Director of Finance is authorized to contract for one or more
Credit Support Instruments for any
Series
of
Outstanding
Revenue
Bonds or Refunding Bonds or designated portions thereof if the Director determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the Credit Support Instruments will

30
result in debt service savings to the
City, or will stabilize interest rates
on those Bonds or will minimize the
risk of increased interest expense
on those Bonds. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to terminate any such contract if the
Director
of
Finance
determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the City’s
best interests will be served by such
termination. The cost of obtaining
each rating and the cost of obtaining or terminating each Credit Support
Instrument,
except
to
the
extent paid by the Original Purchasers in accordance with the Bond
Purchase Agreement, shall be paid
from the proceeds of Refunding
Bonds or funds of the Water Division, which are appropriated for
that purpose.

Continuing Disclosure. The Mayor,
the Director of Finance, the Director of Public Utilities, the Commissioner of Water, or other City officials, as appropriate under the Charter, each is authorized, on behalf of
the City and in their official capacities, to (i) prepare or cause to be

Those officers each are further
authorized to use and distribute, or
authorize the use and distribution
of, one or more final official statements and supplements thereto in
connection
with
the
original

Those officers each are further
authorized to sign and deliver, on
behalf of the City and in their official capacities, each final official

and
such

and as an obligated person with
respect to the Refunding Bonds

The City Record
under, SEC Rule 15c2-12, to provide
or cause to be provided such financial information and operating data
and notices, in such manner, as may
be required for purposes of SEC
Rule 15c2-12. In order to describe
and specify certain terms of the
City’s continuing disclosure agreement for that purpose, and thereby
to
implement
that
agreement,
including provisions for enforcement, amendment and termination,
the Director of Finance and the
Director of Public Utilities are
authorized to prepare, or cause to be
prepared, and to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
a continuing disclosure agreement
or certificate, which shall constitute
the continuing disclosure agreement
made by the City for the benefit of
the holders and beneficial owners of
the Refunding Bonds of that Series
accordance
with
SEC
Rule
in
15c2-12. The performance of that
agreement shall be subject to the
availability of funds and their annual appropriation to meet costs the
City would be required to incur to
perform it.
Section 15. Authorization of Other
Documents. Each of the Mayor, the
Director of Finance, the Director of
Public Utilities and other City officials, as appropriate under the Charter, is authorized to sign and deliver such instruments, certificates and

true transcript of proceedings certified by the Clerk or other official,
of all proceedings had with reference to the issuance of each Series
of Refunding Bonds along with such

necessary to determine the regularity and validity of the issuance of
those Refunding Bonds.
Section 16. Lien of Pledge. The
Net Revenues of the Utility are subject to the lien of the pledge under
the Indenture without any physical
delivery of the Net Revenues or further act, and the lien of such pledge
is valid and binding against all parties having claims of any kind
against the City (irrespective of
whether such parties have notice of
such pledge and create a perfected
security interest for all purposes of
Chapter 1309, Ohio Revised Code)
without the necessity for separation
of delivery of the Net Revenues or
for the filing or recording of the
Indenture or any other resolution or
instrument by which such pledge is
created or any certificate, statement
or other document with respect to
such pledge. The pledge of the Net
Revenues under the Indenture shall

1812

November 17, 2010
be effective and the money therefrom and thereof may be applied to
the purposes for which pledged
without necessity for any further
act of appropriation.
Section 17. Other Provisions for
Payment of Outstanding Revenue
Bonds. The City may, from time to
time, deposit funds in trust with the
Trustee under the Indenture or an
Escrow Agreement for the payment
of debt service requirements on any
Outstanding Revenue Bonds if, in
the judgment of the Director of
Finance and the Director of Public
Utilities,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, doing
so will improve the debt service coverage ratio of the Waterworks System (being the ratio of Net Revenues
to
Annual
Debt
Service
Requirements, as defined in the
Indenture). The Director of Finance
is authorized to make such deposits,
from time to time, from moneys in
the Additions and Improvements
Fund under the Indenture (Fund No.
52-300 of the Water Division) in
amounts that, in the aggregate, do
not exceed $50,000,000, with the actual amount of any deposit to be determined by the Director of Finance in
consultation with the Director of
Public Utilities. In order to cause
any amounts so deposited to be dedicated and applied solely to the payment of the principal of and interest and any redemption premium on
the designated Outstanding Revenue
Bonds, as and when due at maturity or upon prior redemption, the
Mayor, the Director of Finance and
the Director of Public Utilities, or
any two of them, are authorized, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
to sign and deliver one or more
Escrow Agreements approved as to
form and correctness by the Director of Law, providing for the establishment of an Escrow Fund as a
trust fund in the custody of the
Trustee and the investment, dedication and application of the moneys
deposited therein and further providing for the payment to the
Trustee of fees and expenses for its
performance of its duties under the
Escrow Agreement. The officers
signing the Escrow Agreement on
behalf of the City shall determine
that the agreement satisfies the
requirements of this Section, and
that determination shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the Escrow Agreement by those officers. The Mayor, the Director of
Finance and the Director of Public
Utilities, or any two of them, are
authorized, in the name and on
behalf of the City, to sign and deliver agreements, approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, with one or more institutions,
including agreements which will
enable the City to more efficiently
structure any escrow funds established pursuant to this Section, and
thereby maximize debt service savings and minimize negative arbitrage. The Director of Finance is
authorized and directed to take such
other actions as may be necessary
or appropriate to accomplish any
defeasance of the designated Outstanding Revenue Bonds to be paid
from any escrow fund, including
without limitation, the retention of
a firm of independent certified public accountants to verify that the
securities to be deposited in escrow
are of such maturities or redemption
dates, and interest payment dates,
and bear such interest, as will be
sufficient, together with any available moneys, for the payment of

November 17, 2010
debt service on the designated Outstanding Revenue Bonds.
Section 18. Authorization of Subordinated Refunding Notes. This
Council authorizes the City to issue
Subordinated Refunding Notes in
one or more Series for the purpose
of making provision for payment of
Subordinated
Notes
Outstanding
when due or upon prior redemption.
The principal amount of each series
of Subordinated Refunding Notes is
to be the amount set forth in the
Certificate of Award and determined

the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, to be necessary (i) to
refund the Outstanding Subordinated Notes to be refunded, (ii) to fund
any deposit to any special reserve
fund, (iv) to pay costs of any Credit Support Instruments, (v) to pay
any amounts owed under any Hedge
Agreements relating to the Outstanding Subordinated Notes, and

Refunding
Notes
and
refunding the Outstanding Subordinated Notes. The proceeds from the
sale of each issue of Subordinated
Refunding Notes shall be allocated,
deposited and applied as provided in
the Certificate of Award.
The authorizations in this Ordinance with respect to Refunding
Bonds shall apply to the Subordinated Refunding Notes subject to
the following: (a) the principal of
the Subordinated Refunding Notes
shall be payable from the proceeds
of a subsequent issue of Subordinated Refunding Notes or, subject to
satisfaction of the requirements in
the Indenture for the issuance of
additional Bonds, from the proceeds
of Bonds, (b) to the extent that the
principal of and interest on the Subordinated Refunding Notes is not
paid from the proceeds of a subsequent issue of Subordinated Refunding Notes or from the proceeds of
Bonds, the Subordinate Refunding
Notes shall be payable from and
secured by the Net Revenues of the
Waterworks System on deposit in
the Additions and Improvements
Fund established under the Indenture on a basis subordinate to the
Bonds under the Indenture, (c) the
Subordinated Refunding Notes shall
not constitute “Bonds” under the
Indenture, (d) the principal of the
Subordinated Refunding Notes may
not be accelerated if any Bonds are
outstanding under the Indenture
unless
those
outstanding
Bonds
have been accelerated, and (e) the
final maturity of the Subordinated
Refunding Notes shall be no later
than five years from the date of
issuance. The City covenants to do
all things necessary to effect the
issuance, sale and delivery, prior to
the maturity of the Outstanding Subordinated Notes, of an issue of Subordinated Refunding Notes or an
issue of Bonds, in either case in the
principal amount that is necessary,
together with any other moneys
available to the City for the purpose, to pay the debt service on the
Outstanding
Subordinated
Notes
when due at maturity.
The Director of Finance is authorized to sign and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of the City, the
Registrar Agreement between the
City and the Trustee, in its capacity as registrar and paying agent for
the Subordinated Refunding Notes
(the “Registrar”), in substantially
the form as the City and the Trustee
entered into with respect to the Outstanding Subordinated Notes. The
Registrar Agreement is approved,

The City Record
together
with
any
changes
or
amendments that are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and not
substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the Registrar Agreement or amendments
thereto. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Registrar Agreement,
except to the extent paid or reimbursed by the Original Purchaser in
accordance with the Note Purchase
Agreement, from the proceeds of the
Subordinated Refunding Notes to the
extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose. No Subordinated
Refunding Notes shall be valid or
obligatory for any purpose or shall
be entitled to any security or benefit under this Ordinance unless and
until the certificate of authentication printed on the Subordinated
Refunding Note is signed by the
Registrar as authenticating agent.
by
the
Registrar
Authentication
shall be conclusive evidence that the
Subordinated Refunding Note so
