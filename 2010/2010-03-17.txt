FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES REFERRED
Ord. No. 325-10.
By Council Member Sweeney (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the procurement by one or more
requirement contracts of Group I, II
and III copiers and services for the
various divisions of City government, for a period of four years,
with one option to renew for one
additional year, exercisable by the
Director of Finance.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Finance is authorized to make one
or more written requirement contracts under the Charter and the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, for the requirements for
a period of four years, with one
option to renew for one additional
year, exercisable by the Director of
Finance of the necessary items of
Group I, II and III copiers and services, in the approximate amount as

procured during the preceding term,
to be procured by the Commissioner
of Purchases and Supplies on a unit
basis for the various divisions of
City government. Bids shall be
taken in a manner that permits an
award to be made for all items as
a single contract, or by separate
contract for each or any combination of the items as the Board of
Control determines. Alternate bids
for a period less than the specified
term may be taken if desired by the
Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies until provision is made for the
requirements for the entire term.
Section 2. That the costs of the
contract
or
contracts
shall
be
charged against the proper appropriation accounts and the Director
of Finance shall certify the amount
of the initial procurement, which
purchase, together with all later procurements, shall be made on order
of the Commissioner of Purchases
and Supplies under a requisition
against the contract or contracts
certified by the Director of Finance.
(RQN 1508 RL 3020-7)
Section 3. That under Section
108(b) of the Charter, the procurements authorized by this ordinance
may be made through cooperative
arrangements with other governmental agencies. The Director of
Finance may sign all documents
that are necessary to make the procurements, and may enter into one
or more contracts with the vendors
selected through that cooperative
process.
Section 4. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Referred to Directors of Finance,
Law; Committee on Finance.
Ord. No. 326-10.
By Council Members Kelley and
Sweeney (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Public Utilities to enter into one or more contracts with FirstEnergy Solutions
Corp. for aggregation services and
power supply for residential and
small commercial customers for a
period of 36 months and the City’s
governmental accounts for a period
of 38 months.
Whereas, Ohio state law allows a
municipality to create an electric
aggregation program through which
the municipality negotiates a bulk
discount from electric generation
suppliers to provide electricity to
the municipality’s residential and
small commercial customers; and
Whereas, Section 129.331 of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, authorizes the Director of
Public Utilities to enter into contracts with electric aggregation suppliers with the approval of City
Council; and
Whereas, the City solicited proposals from aggregation service
providers to create and manage a 36month electric aggregation program;
and

324

March 17, 2010
Whereas, FirstEnergy Solutions
Corp. submitted a proposal on December 14, 2009, revised by letter
dated January 22, 2010, to create and
manage an electric aggregation program that includes discounted rates
for customers, grants to the City,
and funding for an energy efficiency and conservation program for the
City’s Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company customers; and
Whereas, on the basis of the proposals submitted, the City has determined that the proposal submitted
by FirstEnergy Solutions Corp. best
suits the needs of Cleveland’s residents and small businesses; and
Whereas, Ohio law also permits
customers of private utilities to purchase electricity from alternative
suppliers and to arrange for the
delivery of that electricity by the
local electric utility; and
Whereas, the City solicited proposals from alternative suppliers to
provide electricity for certain City
accounts that are currently served
by CEI and that cannot presently be
served by Cleveland Public Power;
and
Whereas, the City received one
proposal, from FirstEnergy Solutions Corp., that offers firm fixed
pricing for a 38-month period and
provides substantial savings compared to the CEI standard rates; and
Whereas, on the basis of the proposals submitted, the City has determined that the proposal submitted
by FirstEnergy Solutions Corp. offers immediate and substantial savings and is the best proposal received.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Public Utilities is authorized to
enter into a contract with FirstEnergy Solutions Corp. to create and
manage an electric aggregation program on the basis of its proposal
dated December 14, 2009, as revised
by its letter dated January 22, 2010.
Section 2. That the Director of
Public Utilities is authorized to
enter into a contract with FirstEnergy Solutions Corp. to provide electric generation supply for the City’s
CEI accounts on the basis of the
proposal by FirstEnergy Solutions
Corp. dated January 22, 2010.
Section 3. That the contract or
contracts authorized by this ordinance shall contain such terms and
conditions as the Director of Law
deems necessary to benefit and protect the City and the customers of
the electric aggregation program.
Section 4. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Referred to Directors of Public
Utilities, Finance, Law; Committees
on Public Utilities, Finance.

of the Cleveland Public Library for
a sidewalk at the newly constructed Rice Branch, for the Department
of Public Service.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of

Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

and as an exception to the Codified
Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
the Commissioner of Purchases and
Supplies is authorized to acquire
