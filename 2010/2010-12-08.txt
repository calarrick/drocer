An emergency resolution supporting United Food & Commercial
Workers Union, Local 880 members
and their families in their struggle
with Rite Aid, and urging Rite Aid to
delay its changes to healthcare, as
well as other changes, and return to
the bargaining table to resolve this
dispute in favor of affordable healthcare.
Whereas, Rite Aid has many unionized stores within the City of
Cleveland and those employees are
represented by United Food &
Commercial Workers Union, Local
880; and
Whereas, Rite Aid and Local 880
have had a long history of partnering
together; and
Whereas, as a result of that partnership the unionized employees
have received a living wage and
affordable healthcare; and
Whereas, over the three year term
of the last contract between Rite Aid
and Local 880, Rite Aid’s healthcare
costs have decreased slightly each
and every year; and
Whereas, Rite Aid has breached its
long term partnership with Local 880

The City Record
and seeks to significantly increase
the cost of healthcare for its unionized workers and their families, such
that a substantial portion of those
workers will no longer be able to
afford healthcare coverage, thereby
increasing the public’s burden of providing healthcare to these individuals, even though Rite Aid is the third
largest drug store chain in the United
States; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
urges Rite Aid to delay implementing
its changes to healthcare and return
to the bargaining table to find a resolution to the current dispute that is
more equitable to the members represented by Local 880 within the greater
Cleveland area, so that those workers
and their families can continue to
obtain affordable healthcare, and so
that such costs are not otherwise
passed on to the public; and
Whereas, until such time as the dispute is resolved between Rite Aid and
Local 880—all Cleveland citizens are
urged, if they have prescriptions on
file at any Rite Aid, to transfer those
prescriptions to another vendor that
provides a living wage and affordable healthcare, such as Dave’s
Supermarkets, CVS and Giant Eagle;
and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
urges Cleveland citizens to participate in the National Day of Action on
December 15, 2010 in support of Rite
Aid workers represented by Local 880
and others around the country to urge
Rite Aid to provide affordable healthcare to all its employees; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports United Food & Commercial
Workers Union, Local 880 members
and their families in their struggle
with Rite Aid, and urges Rite Aid to
delay its changes to healthcare, as

Section 2. Authorization of the
Refunding Bonds.
This Council authorizes the City to
issue the Refunding Bonds in one or
more Series for the purpose of refunding one or more Series of Outstanding
Revenue Bonds, or designated portions thereof, to obtain aggregate net
present value debt service savings of
at least three percent (3%), or to eliminate or modify covenants that are
unduly restrictive, or to obtain a more
favorable debt service structure or
more favorable terms under Credit
Support Instruments. With respect to
Outstanding Revenue Bonds that are
short-term or variable-rate obligations, this Council authorizes the City
to issue Refunding Bonds to refund
such Outstanding Revenue Bonds, or
designated portions thereof, for any
of the foregoing purposes or for the
purpose that the Director of Finance
has determined, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
such Outstanding Revenue Bonds are
subjecting the City to undesirably
high rates of interest or undesirable
fluctuations in rates of interest or
risks or expenses associated with
Credit Support Instruments that can
economically be avoided or mitigated
through refunding. The principal
amount of each Series of Refunding
Bonds is to be the amount set forth in
the Certificate of Award authorized
in Section 5 and determined by the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
to be necessary (i) to refund the
Refunded Bonds to be refunded by
that Series, (ii) to fund any deposit to
the Bond Service Reserve Fund
required under the Indenture or any
special reserve fund for that Series
separate from the Bond Service
Reserve Fund, (iv) to pay costs of any
Credit Support Instruments, (v) to
pay any amounts owed under Hedge
Agreements, and (vi) to pay costs of
issuing the Refunding Bonds and
refunding the Refunded Bonds. The
proceeds from the sale of each Series
of Refunding Bonds shall be allocated, deposited and applied as provided
in Section 6.
Separate series of Refunding Bonds
may be issued at the same or different
times. The Refunding Bonds of each
series shall be designated as provided
in the applicable Certificate of
Award. A separate Certificate of
Award and a separate Supplemental
Indenture may be delivered for each
series. Costs of issuance of the
Refunding Bonds and any required
deposit to the Bond Service Reserve

The City Record
Fund attributable to the Refunding
Bonds shall, in each case, be included
in the costs funded from the proceeds
of
the
Refunding
Bonds.
The
Refunding Bonds shall constitute
Revenue Bonds for all purposes of the
Indenture.
This Council finds and determines
that the issuance of the Refunding
Bonds for the purpose provided in this
Ordinance serves a proper, public,
municipal purpose by reducing the
costs of air travel facilities serving
the people of the City of Cleveland,
thereby increasing and promoting
commerce by providing necessary
transportation for individuals and
commercial enterprises purchasing
and selling services and products in
northeastern Ohio, and creating and
preserving jobs and employment
opportunities in the City and improving the economic welfare of the City.
Section 3. Authorization of Hedging
Arrangements.
This Council finds that by engaging in interest rate hedging arrangements with respect to Revenue Bonds
the City may reduce its cost of borrowing by optimizing the relative
amounts of fixed and variable rate
obligations, or minimizing the risk of
variations in its debt service costs, or
obtaining savings by confirming
rates of interest on Revenue Bonds in
advance of their issuance. To permit
the City to have the flexibility to
undertake interest rate swap, swaption, rate cap, rate collar and other
hedging transactions, from time to
time, and to establish the procedures
for approving those transactions, this
Council authorizes the signing and
delivery of one or more agreements
(each, a “Hedge Agreement”) and any
related agreements necessary for the
consummation of the transactions
contemplated
by
each
Hedge
Agreement. The authorizations in
this Section 3 are supplemental to and
not in derogation of any authority
provided by any other ordinance of
this Council concerning hedging
arrangements.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
that it is to the financial advantage of
the City and in the City’s best interests that a hedging arrangement be
undertaken by the City with respect
to any Revenue Bonds issued or to be
issued under the Indenture, the
Director of Finance may authorize
one or more interest rate hedge transactions in accordance with the applicable Hedge Agreement; provided that
(a) the counterparty shall be rated at
the time of signing the Hedge
Agreement not lower than A by at
least one rating agency or its obligations under the Hedge Agreement
shall be guaranteed or insured by an
entity rated at the time of signing the
Hedge Agreement not lower than A
by at least one rating agency, and (b)
the term of each hedge transaction
shall not exceed the final maturity of
the Revenue Bonds to which the
hedge relates.
The Director of Finance shall negotiate the terms of each Hedge
Agreement with a counterparty satisfying the credit criteria in this
Ordinance. The City shall receive a
written opinion of a Financial
Advisor that the payments made or to
be made by the counterparty to the
City, or by the City to the counterparty, shall be fair value for the Hedge
Agreement, considering, among other
things, the credit of the City’s Airport
System, the credit of the counterparty
and the terms and conditions of the
Hedge Agreement. The Director of

1977

27
Finance shall determine the terms
and
conditions
of
the
Hedge
Agreement, including without limitation, the time or times and procedures
for the exercise by the counterparty
or the City, as the case may be, of any
option under the Hedge Agreement,
whether the obligations of the City
under the Hedge Agreement shall be
secured
by
a
Credit
Support
Instrument, and the rates to be paid
by the counterparty to the City and by
the City to the counterparty under the
Hedge Agreement in the event of the
exercise of the option. The approval
of each interest rate hedge transaction by the Director of Finance shall
be conclusively evidenced by the
signing and delivery of the applicable
Hedge Agreement by the Director of
Finance.
The Director of Finance is authorized
to
terminate
any
Hedge
Agreements in whole or in part or any
Credit Support Instrument securing a
Hedge Agreement if the Director of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
that the City’s best interests will be
served by such termination. The
Director of Finance is further authorized to enter into amendments or
modifications of a Hedge Agreement
or any Credit Support Instrument
securing a Hedge Agreement determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the City’s best
interests will be served by such
amendment or modification.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from the Airport Revenues as defined
in the Indenture and may be payable
also from other funds permitted by
law to be used for the purpose, as
identified by the Director of Finance
in the Hedge Agreement. Those payments may be secured by a pledge of
Airport Revenues, to the extent permitted by the Indenture, all as determined by the Director of Finance and
set forth in the Hedge Agreement.
The obligation of the City to make
payments
under
any
Hedge
Agreement does not and shall not represent or constitute a general obligation, debt, bonded indebtedness or a
pledge of the faith and credit of the
City or the State of Ohio. Nothing
gives any party to any Hedge
Agreement the right to have excises,
ad valorem or other taxes levied by
the City or the State of Ohio for the
payment of any amounts due under
any Hedge Agreement.
Section 4. Terms of Refunding
Bonds.
The Refunding Bonds shall contain
the terms provided in or determined
pursuant to, the Indenture, this
Ordinance, the applicable Certificate
of
Award
and
the
applicable
Supplemental Indenture. Each series
of Refunding Bonds may be secured
by
a
separate
Supplemental
Indenture, or a single Supplemental
Indenture may secure more than one
series of Refunding Bonds.
(a) General. In the event that the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
determines that the City’s best interests will be served by causing a series
of Refunding Bonds to be obligations
bearing interest at variable interest
rates, then the Director of Finance is
authorized to so specify in the
Certificate of Award for that series. If
the Director of Finance so determines, then the method and procedure
by which the variable rate of interest
to be borne by the Refunding Bonds of
that series shall be determined as provided in the applicable Supplemental

28
Indenture, whether by reference to a
market index, by a remarketing
agent or otherwise, provided that no
series of variable rate Refunding
Bonds shall bear interest at a rate in
excess of twenty-five percent (25%)
per year (including any Refunding
Bonds held by a provider of a Credit
Support Instrument). The Director of
Finance may determine that the
terms of a variable rate series of
Refunding Bonds may or may not permit the holders to tender their variable rate Refunding Bonds for purchase by the City. If the Director of
Finance designates any series of
Refunding Bonds as variable rate
Refunding Bonds, and if the Holders
of that series of Refunding Bonds are
to be entitled to tender those
Refunding Bonds for purchase, then
the Director of Finance shall also designate
for
those
variable
rate
Refunding Bonds (and may designate
others, from time to time, in substitution therefor), the tender agent or
agents (which may be the Trustee)
and the remarketing agent or agents
(which may be any of the Original
which
designations
Purchasers),
shall be based on the determination of
the Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
that the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed to
provide such services are fair and
reasonable.
The
commercially
Director of Finance is authorized to
enter into agreements with others in
connection with the delivery of the
Refunding Bonds, and from time to
time thereafter so long as the
Refunding Bonds are outstanding, as
may be determined by the Director of
Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for (i) the method of
determining the variable interest
rates, (ii) the rights and procedures
for tender, (iii) liquidity or credit support, (iv) repayment by the City of
any amounts drawn under the Credit
Support Instrument, (v) the direct
purchase of tendered Refunding
Bonds, and (vi) other arrangements
in the best interests of the City. The
Director of Finance is further authorized to terminate any such agreements if the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the City’s best interests will be served
by such termination. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to enter
into agreements, from time to time so
long as the variable rate Refunding
Bonds are outstanding, supplementing or amending the applicable
Supplemental Indenture for a series
of Refunding Bonds as provided in
Section 8. The Director of Finance is
authorized to pay any fees associated
with agreements entered into or terminated pursuant to this Section from
proceeds of Refunding Bonds, to the
extent permitted by the Indenture,
and from the Airport Revenues.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of any
series of Refunding Bonds, and
regardless of whether that series of
Refunding Bonds bears interest at
variable or fixed rates, is authorized
to contract for a Credit Support
Instrument, and to pay the costs of it
from proceeds of the Refunding
Bonds, if the Director determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the Credit
Support Instrument will result in a

the City.

The City Record
(b) Form; Exchange and Transfer.
All Refunding Bonds shall be issued
in
fully
registered
form.
The
Refunding Bonds initially shall be
delivered only in book-entry form,
shall be registered in the name of the
Depository or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the
custody of the Depository, and shall
not be transferable or exchangeable
(except for transfer to another
Depository or its nominee) without
further action by the City pursuant to
the provisions of the Supplemental
Indenture. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in the Original
Indenture, no Refunding Bonds shall
be exchanged for or transferable into
a coupon Revenue Bond or Bonds
unless and until the Indenture shall
have been amended in accordance
with the terms thereof to permit such
exchanges or transfers. To the extent
that the Original Indenture (particularly, but without limitation, Section
permits
fully
registered
2.05)
Revenue Bonds to be exchanged for
or transferred into coupon Revenue
Bonds or Revenue Bonds payable to
bearer, then the Original Indenture is
amended to prohibit such exchanges
or transfers for the Refunding Bonds
unless and until the Indenture shall
have been further amended to permit
such exchanges or transfers.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository for
the Refunding Bonds of any series
for use in a book entry system, the
Director of Finance and the Trustee
may attempt to establish a securities
depository/book entry relationship
with another qualified Depository. If
the Director of Finance and the
Trustee do not or are unable to do so,
the Director of Finance and the
Trustee, after making provision for
notification of the beneficial owners
by the then Depository and any other
arrangements deemed necessary,
shall permit withdrawal of the
Refunding Bonds of any series from
the Depository, and authenticate and
deliver registered Bond certificates
to the assigns of the Depository or its
nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of action or
inaction of the City, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into any agreements
determined by the Director to be necessary in connection with the book
entry system for the Refunding
Bonds, after determining that those
agreements will not endanger the
funds or securities of the City under
the Indenture (as evidenced by the
Director’s signing of those agreements).

released from the Bond Service
Reserve Fund to the payment of costs
of remarketing the Revenue Bonds
for which the interest rate has been
converted from variable rates of
interest to fixed rates of interest. To
the extent the costs of remarketing
are not paid from any cash released
from the Bond Service Reserve Fund,
those costs shall be paid from Fund
Nos. 60 SF 001, 60 SF 104, 60 SF 105, 60
SF 106 and 60 SF 141 and/or passenger facility charges, as determined by

(a) to make or effect any election,
selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or waiver on behalf of

other actions, make or obtain calculations, make payments, and make or
give reports, covenants and certifications of and on behalf of the City, as
may be appropriate to assure the
exclusion of interest from gross
income and the intended tax status of
the Tax-Exempt Bonds, and (c) to
give one or more appropriate certificates of the City, for inclusion in the
transcript of proceedings for the TaxExempt Bonds, setting forth the reasonable expectations of the City
regarding the amount and use of all
the proceeds of the Tax-Exempt
Bonds, the facts, circumstances and
estimates on which they are based,

Whereas, the authorization for
issuance of Refunding Bonds is necessary to enable the City to take
advantage of favorable market conditions on a timely basis to obtain debt
service savings and as a result, this
Ordinance constitutes an emergency
measure providing for the immediate
preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety, and for the
usual daily operation of a municipal
department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. General obligation refunding bonds of the City
(“Refunding Bonds”) are authorized
to be issued for the purpose of refunding one or more series of the City’s
general
obligation
outstanding
bonds, or designated maturities thereof, issued to provide funds to pay
costs of Projects 1 through 19 and
identified in the Certificate of Award
authorized in Section 4 (“Refunded
Bonds”), including the payment of
any expenses relating to the refunding of the Refunded Bonds and the
issuance of the Refunding Bonds,
including any financing costs within
the meaning of Revised Code Section
133.01(K), provided the aggregate net
present value debt service savings
resulting from the refunding of the
Refunded Bonds is not less than three
percent (3%).
The aggregate principal amount of
Refunding Bonds to be issued shall be
in an amount determined by the
Director of Finance and set forth in
the Certificate of Award as the
amount required to be issued, taking
into account any original issue discount and/or original issue premium
on the sale of the Refunding Bonds, in
order to refund the Refunded Bonds
and pay any expenses relating to the
refunding of the Refunded Bonds and
the issuance of the Refunding Bonds.
The Refunding Bonds may be issued
in one or more separate series, each
bearing a distinctive designation,
provided that the Refunding Bonds of
each series satisfy the requirements
of this Ordinance and the aggregate
net present value debt service savings to the City resulting from each
series of Refunding Bonds is not less
than three per cent (3%). Separate
series of Refunding Bonds may be
issued at the same or different times.
The Refunding Bonds of each series
shall be designated as provided in the
applicable Certificate of Award. A
separate Certificate of Award may be
delivered for each series.
Section 2. Authority and Terms. The
Refunding Bonds shall be issued pursuant to the provisions of Article
XVIII of the Constitution of Ohio,
Revised Code Chapter 133 and other
applicable provisions of the Revised
Code, the Charter of the City, the
General Bond Ordinance and this
Ordinance in the principal amount
and for the purpose stated in
Section  1. The Refunding Bonds of
each series shall be issued in one lot
as fully registered bonds in denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof but in no case as to a particular maturity date exceeding the
principal amount maturing on that
date. The Refunding Bonds shall bear
the designation and be numbered as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance.
The Refunding Bonds shall be
dated the date and shall bear interest
at the rate or rates per year specified
in the Certificate of Award, provided
the weighted average of such rates
(taking into account the principal

34
amount
and
maturity
of
each
Refunding Bond to which a rate
applies) shall not exceed six percent
(6%) per year. Interest on the
Refunding Bonds shall be payable
when due, or until the principal
amount is paid, semiannually as specified in the Certificate of Award as
the dates on which interest on the
Refunding Bonds shall be payable
(the “Interest Payment Dates”),
beginning on the date specified in the
Certificate of Award as the first
Interest Payment Date.
The Refunding Bonds shall mature
in the years and principal amounts as
shall be permitted by law and determined by the Director of Finance and
specified in the Certificate of Award,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor to be in the best
interests of the City given market
conditions at the time the Refunding
Bonds are sold and the objectives of
the plan of refunding to obtain aggregate net present value debt service
savings of not less than three per cent
(3%).
The Director of Finance also shall
determine and certify, on or prior to
the date of delivery of the Refunding
Bonds to the Original Purchaser, that
portion of the aggregate principal
amount of the Refunding Bonds that
is allocable to each Project, and the
principal amount of Refunding Bonds
allocated to each Project that shall be
payable at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(as
defined below) on the applicable principal payment dates; provided, that
(i) the aggregate principal amount of
the Refunding Bonds allocable to a
Project shall be determined by the
Director of Finance on a pro rata
basis by reference to the respective
amount of funds that is required for
the refunding of the Refunded Bonds
that are allocable to that Project, taking into account any funds other than
the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds
that are available and appropriated
for that purpose, and (ii) no portion of
the aggregate principal amount of
Refunding Bonds allocated to a
Project shall be payable later than
the maximum maturity for that portion of the Refunding Bonds as certified by the Director of Finance.
The Refunding Bonds stated to
mature in any year may be issued as
term bonds (the “Term Refunding
Bonds”),
payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements as defined and further
described below. The Director of
Finance shall determine in the
Certificate of Award whether any of
the Refunding Bonds shall be issued
as Term Refunding Bonds, any dates
(the “Mandatory Redemption Dates”)
on which the principal amount of the
Term Refunding Bonds shall be
payable pursuant to mandatory sinking fund installments rather than at
stated maturity and the amount of
principal
to
be
paid
on
each
Mandatory Redemption Date (the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Refunding Bonds shall be subject to redemption prior to stated
maturity as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Refunding
Bonds are issued as Term Refunding
Bonds, the Term Refunding Bonds
shall be subject to mandatory sinking
fund redemption and be redeemed
pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements, at a
redemption price of 100 percent of the
principal amount redeemed, plus
interest accrued to the redemption

The City Record
date, on the Mandatory Redemption
Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to be
deposited with the Escrow Agent, currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of and
interest on any Term Refunding
Bonds shall include amounts sufficient to redeem on the Mandatory
Redemption Dates the principal
amount of Term Refunding Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided
below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined in
Section  3) for cancellation Term
Refunding Bonds in any aggregate
principal amount and to receive a
against
the
then-current
credit
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirement (and corresponding
mandatory redemption obligation) of
the City for any Term Refunding
Bonds. That option shall be exercised
by the City on or before the forty-fifth
(45th) day preceding the applicable
Mandatory Redemption Date, by furnishing the Escrow Agent a certificate, signed by the Registrar, setting
forth the extent of the credit to be
applied with respect to the then-current
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirement. If the certificate is not timely furnished to the
Escrow
Agent,
the
Mandatory
Fund
Redemption
Sinking
Requirement (and corresponding
mandatory redemption obligation)
shall not be reduced. A credit against
the then-current Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement (and
corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Refunding
Bonds which prior thereto have been
redeemed (other than through the
operation of the Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements) or
purchased for cancellation and canceled by the Registrar, to the extent
not applied theretofore as a credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Refunding Bond so
delivered, or previously redeemed, or
purchased and canceled, shall be credited by the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of the principal amount thereof
against the then-current Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirement (and corresponding
mandatory redemption obligation).
Any excess of that amount over the
then-current
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement shall
be
credited
against
subsequent
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements (and corresponding
mandatory redemption obligations)
in the order directed by the Director
of Finance.
(b) Optional Redemption. The
Refunding Bonds may be subject to
redemption prior to maturity by and
at the option of the City, in whole or in
part on any date, in integral multiples
of $5,000, on the optional redemption
dates and at the redemption prices
specified in the Certificate of Award,
plus, in each case, accrued interest to
the redemption date. Based on the
written advice of a financial advisor,
the Director of Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that
it is in the best interests of the City
for some or all of the Refunding
Bonds not to be callable prior to their
stated maturity.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory

1984

December 8, 2010
Redemption Date, the Refunding
Bonds, or portions thereof, to be
redeemed optionally shall be selected
by lot prior to the selection by lot of
the Refunding Bonds to be redeemed
on the same date by operation of the
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements of paragraph (a). The
Refunding Bonds shall be redeemed
pursuant to this paragraph only upon
written notice from the Director of
Finance to the Registrar. That notice
shall specify the redemption date and
the principal amount of each maturity
of Refunding Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption date
or such shorter period as shall be
acceptable to the Registrar. There
shall be deposited with the Registrar
on or prior to the redemption date,
funds sufficient to redeem at the
redemption
price,
all
of
the
redeemable Refunding Bonds for
which notice of redemption has been
given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Refunding
Bonds are called for redemption at
one time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than all
Refunding Bonds of a single maturity
are to be redeemed, the selection of
Refunding Bonds to be redeemed, or
portions thereof in amounts of $5,000
or any integral multiple thereof, shall
be made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar.
In the case of a partial redemption of
Refunding Bonds
by lot when
Refunding Bonds of denominations
greater than $5,000 are then outstanding, each $5,000 unit of principal
thereof shall be treated as though it
were a separate Refunding Bond of
the denomination of $5,000. If it is
determined that one or more, but not
all of the $5,000 units of principal
amount represented by a Refunding
Bond are to be called for redemption,
then upon notice of redemption of a
$5,000 unit or units, the registered
owner of that Refunding Bond shall
surrender the Refunding Bond to the
Registrar (i) for payment of the
redemption price of the $5,000 unit or
units called for redemption (including, without limitation, the interest
accrued to the date fixed for redemption and any premium), and (ii) for
issuance, without charge to the registered owner thereof, of a new
Refunding Bond or Refunding Bonds
of any authorized denomination or
denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unmatured
and unredeemed portion of, and bearing interest at the same rate and
maturing on the same date as, the
Refunding Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Refunding Bonds shall identify (i) by
designation, letters, numbers or other
distinguishing marks, the Refunding
Bonds or portions thereof to be
redeemed, (ii) the redemption price to
be paid, (iii) the date fixed for
redemption, and (iv) the place or
places where the amounts due upon
redemption are payable. The notice
shall be given by the Registrar on
behalf of the City by mailing a copy of
the redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty
(30) days prior to the date fixed for
redemption (or such period specified
in the Certificate of Award), to the
registered owner of each Refunding
Bond subject to redemption in whole
or in part at the registered owner’s
address shown on the Register maintained by the Registrar at the close of
business on the fifteenth day preced-

December 8, 2010
ing that mailing. Failure to receive
notice by mail or any defect in that
notice regarding any Refunding
Bond, however, shall not affect the
validity of the proceedings for the
redemption of any Refunding Bond.
Any notice of redemption of any
Refunding Bonds may specify that
the redemption is contingent on the
deposit of moneys with the Escrow
Agent or Registrar, as paying agent,
on or prior to the redemption date in
an amount sufficient to pay the
redemption price of the Refunding
Bonds that are to be redeemed.
(e)
Payment
of
Redeemed
Refunding Bonds. Notice having been
mailed in the manner provided in the
preceding paragraph, and moneys
having been deposited by the City
with the Escrow Agent or Registrar,
as paying agent, in an amount sufficient to pay the redemption price, the
Refunding Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall become
due and payable on the redemption
date, and, upon presentation and surrender at the place or places specified
in that notice, shall be paid. If money
for the redemption of all of the
Refunding Bonds and portions thereof to be redeemed, including interest
accrued to the redemption date, is
held by the Registrar on the redemption date, and, if notice of redemption
has been deposited in the mail, then
from and after the redemption date
those Refunding Bonds and portions
thereof called for redemption shall
cease to bear interest and no longer
shall be considered to be outstanding.
If that money shall not be so available on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited
in the mail, those Refunding Bonds
and portions thereof shall continue to
bear interest, until they are paid, at
the same rate as they would have
borne had they not been called for
redemption. All money held by the
Registrar for the redemption of particular Refunding Bonds shall be held
in trust for the account of the registered owners and shall be paid to
them, respectively, upon presentation
and surrender of those Refunding
Bonds.
The debt charges on the Refunding
Bonds shall be payable in lawful
money of the United States of
America without deduction for the
services of the Registrar or Escrow
Agent as paying agent. Principal
shall be payable when due upon presentation and surrender of the
Refunding Bonds at the principal corporate trust office of the Registrar.
Interest on a Refunding Bond shall be
paid on each Interest Payment Date
by check or draft mailed to the person
in whose name the Refunding Bond
was registered, and to that person’s
address appearing, on the Register
(as defined in Section 3) at the close
of business on the date provided in
the Registrar Agreement authorized
in Section 3 (the Record Date).
Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond Ordinance,
so long as the Refunding Bonds are
held by a Depository in a book entry
system (as described in Section 3),
debt charges on the Refunding Bonds
will be payable in lawful money of
the United States by wire transfer to
the Depository made by the Escrow
Agent on each Interest Payment
Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance.
The
General
Bond
Ordinance, except for the third paragraph of Section 13(a) (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)

The City Record
and the third paragraph of Section 4
(pertaining generally to the periods
during which the City is not required
to make any transfers or exchanges
of Refunding Bonds issued under the
General Bond Ordinance), will apply
to the Refunding Bonds. Except for
those provisions, the General Bond
Ordinance is included as a part of this
Ordinance as fully as if restated in
this Ordinance. Words and terms not
otherwise defined in this Ordinance
shall have the same meaning as set
forth in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section
3.
Execution,
Authentication,
Approval
and
Recording of the Refunding Bonds;
Exchange and Transfer of the
Refunding Bonds; Paying Agents.
The Refunding Bonds shall express
upon their faces the purpose for
which they are issued and that they
are issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Pursuant to Section 4 of the General
Bond Ordinance, each Refunding
Bond shall be authenticated by the
manual signature of an authorized
officer of the Trustee (as defined
therein). The Refunding Bonds shall
be signed by the City’s Mayor and by
the City’s Director of Finance, and,
with
Revised
Code
consistent
Section  133.27 and notwithstanding
177.02
of
the
Codified
Section
Ordinances of the City, either or both
of those signatures may be a facsimile. The Refunding Bonds shall bear
the seal of the City, which seal may be
a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section
83 of the City’s Charter, the Director
of Law shall prepare the Refunding
Bonds and shall endorse thereon his
approval of the form and correctness
thereof by his manual or facsimile
signature.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating
agent, bond registrar, transfer agent
and paying agent for the Refunding
Bonds (the “Registrar”); provided
that the Escrow Agent shall also act
as paying agent for the Refunding
Bonds so long as the Refunding
Bonds are held in a book entry system. The Director of Finance is authorized to sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, an agreement among the City, the Registrar
and the Escrow Agent (the “Registrar
Agreement”) approved as to form and
correctness by the Director of Law,
containing terms that are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and not
substantially adverse to the City and
that are approved by the Director of
Finance on behalf of the City, all of
which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of the
Registrar Agreement by the Director
of Finance. Payment for the services
rendered and for reimbursement of
expenses incurred pursuant to the
Registrar Agreement shall be made
from the proceeds of the Refunding
Bonds, to the extent available, and
then from other money lawfully available and appropriated for that purpose.
So long as any of the Refunding
Bonds remain outstanding, the City
will cause the Registrar to maintain
and keep at its principal corporate
trust office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Refunding Bonds as
provided
in
this
Section
(the
“Register”). Subject to the provisions
of Section 5, the person in whose name
a Refunding Bond is registered on the
Register shall be regarded as the
absolute owner of that Refunding
Bond for all purposes of this
Ordinance. Payment of or on account
of the debt charges on any Refunding
Bond shall be made only to or upon

1985

35
the order of that person; neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary, but
the registration may be changed as
provided in this Section. All such payments shall be valid and effectual to
satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the Refunding Bond,
including interest, to the extent of the
amount or amounts so paid.
Any Refunding Bond may be
exchanged for Refunding Bonds of
any authorized denomination upon
presentation and surrender at the
principal corporate trust office of the
Registrar, together with a request for
exchange signed by the registered
owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to
the Registrar. A Refunding Bond may
be transferred only on the Register
upon presentation and surrender of
the Refunding Bond at the principal
corporate trust office of the Registrar
together with an assignment signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in a
form satisfactory to the Registrar.
Upon exchange or transfer the
Registrar shall complete, authenticate and deliver a new Refunding
Bond or Refunding Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner equal
in the aggregate to the unmatured
principal amount of the Refunding
Bond surrendered and bearing interest at the same rate and maturing on
the same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Refunding Bonds only
after the new Refunding Bonds are
signed by the authorized officers of
the City. In all cases of Refunding
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
authenticate
and
deliver
shall
Refunding Bonds in accordance with
the provisions of this Ordinance. The
exchange or transfer shall be without
charge to the owner, except that the
City and Registrar may make a
charge sufficient to reimburse them
for any tax or other governmental
charge required to be paid with
respect to the exchange or transfer.
The City or the Registrar may require
that those charges, if any, be paid
before the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Refunding
Bonds issued and authenticated upon
any exchange or transfer shall be
valid obligations of the City, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
Ordinance, as the Refunding Bonds
surrendered upon that exchange or
transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Refunding Bonds may be issued in
book entry form in accordance with
the provisions of this Section. As used
in this Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of beneficial interests in Refunding Bonds
and the principal of and interest on
the Refunding Bonds may be transferred only through a book entry, and
(ii) physical Refunding Bond certificates in fully registered form are
issued by the City only to a
Depository or its nominee as registered owner, with the Refunding
Bonds “immobilized” in the custody of
the Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial
interests
in
those

36
Refunding Bonds and that principal
and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited
purpose trust company), New York,
New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers,
banks and trust companies, and clearing corporations.
The Refunding Bonds may be
issued to a Depository for use in a
book entry system and, if and as long
as a book entry system is utilized: (i)
the Refunding Bonds may be issued
in the form of a single, fully registered Refunding Bond representing
each maturity and registered in the
name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository;
(ii) the beneficial owners in book
entry form shall have no right to
receive Refunding Bonds in the form
of physical securities or certificates;
(iii) ownership of beneficial interests
in book entry form shall be shown by
book entry on the system maintained
and operated by the Depository and
its Participants, and transfers of the
ownership of beneficial interests
shall be made only by book entry by
the Depository and its Participants;
and (iv) the Refunding Bonds as such
shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for transfer to another
Depository or to another nominee of a
Depository, without further action by
the City.
If any Depository determines not to
continue to act as a Depository for the
Refunding Bonds for use in a book
entry system, the Director of Finance
may attempt to establish a securities
depository/book entry relationship
with another qualified Depository. If
the Director of Finance does not or is
unable to do so, the Registrar, after
making provision for notification of
the beneficial owners by the then
Depository and any other arrangements deemed necessary, shall permit
withdrawal of the Refunding Bonds
from the Depository, and the Trustee
and Registrar shall authenticate and
deliver Refunding Bond certificates
in registered form to the assigns of
the Depository or its nominee, all at
the cost and expense (including any
costs of printing), if the event is not
the result of City action or inaction, of
those
persons
requesting
such
issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to the
extent necessary or required to enter
into any agreements determined necessary in connection with the book
entry system for the Refunding
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger the
funds or securities of the City and
after the approval of the form of any
such agreement by the Director of
Law.
Section 4. Sale of Refunding Bonds.
The Refunding Bonds shall first be
offered for purchase to the Trustees
of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by them, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account for

The City Record
purchase and, if not purchased for
that Account, shall be sold to one or
more firms that have proposed to
underwrite the Refunding Bonds and
have been selected by the Director of
Finance based on an evaluation of the
qualifications of those firms (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”).
The Refunding Bonds shall be
awarded to the Original Purchaser in
the Certificate of Award which shall
specify the final terms of the
Refunding Bonds in accordance with
law, the provisions of this Ordinance,
the written advice of a financial advisor retained under authority of
Section
20
and
the
Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Refunding Bonds, including: the principal amount of the Refunding Bonds,
the purchase price (which shall be not
less than 97% of the principal amount
of the Refunding Bonds plus any
accrued interest to their date of delivery), interest rate or rates, the
amounts and years in which principal
installments are payable (at stated
maturity or pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements), the Interest Payment
Dates and the date of the Refunding
Bonds (if different from those set
forth in Section 2), and any other matters required in this Ordinance to be
set forth in that Certificate. As appropriate under the Charter, the Mayor,
Director of Finance, Director of Law,
Clerk of Council and other appropriate officers of the City are, and each
of them is, authorized to take such
actions as are necessary, appropriate
and in the best interest of the City to
establish the terms and requirements
for delivery of the Refunding Bonds
and to make such arrangements as
are necessary with the Original
Purchaser in order to establish the
date, location, procedure, and conditions
for
the
delivery
of
the
Refunding Bonds to the Original
Purchaser, to give all appropriate
notices and certificates, to cause a
true transcript of proceedings with
reference to the issuance of the
Refunding Bonds to be delivered to
the Original Purchaser, to sign any
transcript
certificates,
financial
statements and other documents and
instruments and to take such actions
as are necessary or appropriate to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take
all steps necessary to effect the due
execution, authentication and delivery of the Refunding Bonds. The
Director of Finance is further authorized to sign and deliver on behalf of
the City a bond purchase agreement
between the City and the Original
Purchaser (the “Bond Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form and
correctness by the Director of Law,
setting forth the terms and conditions
on which the City agrees to sell the
Refunding Bonds and the Original
Purchaser
agrees
to
buy
the
Refunding Bonds, which shall be consistent with this Ordinance, not substantially adverse to the City, and
approved by the Director of Finance
and the Director of Law on behalf of
the City, all of which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of the
Bond Purchase Agreement by the
Director of Finance. It is determined
that the terms of the Refunding
Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance
and as may be provided in or pursuant
to the Certificate of Award, are in the
best interest of the City and in compliance with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Director

1986

December 8, 2010
of Finance, a disclosure document in
the form of an Official Statement is
appropriate or necessary in connection with the original issuance of the
Refunding Bonds, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare or
cause to be prepared on behalf of the
City an Official Statement and any
necessary supplements and to authorize the use and distribution of that
Official Statement and any supplements. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign on behalf of the
City that Official Statement and any
supplements. The Director of Finance
is authorized to sign and deliver, on
behalf of the City, such certificates in
connection with the accuracy of the
Official Statement and any supplements as may, in the Director’s judgment, be necessary or appropriate.
The Director of Finance is also authorized to determine and certify on
behalf of the City that such disclosure
document is “deemed final” by the
City within the meaning of Securities
and Exchange Commission Rule 15c212 (the “SEC Rule”). The Director of
Finance is authorized to contract for
services for the production and distribution of preliminary and final official statements, including by printed
and electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time of
the Refunding Bonds, the City agrees,
in accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Refunding Bonds under the SEC Rule,
to provide or cause to be provided
such financial information and operating data and notices, in such manner, as may be required for purposes
of the SEC Rule. In order to describe
and specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare or
cause to be prepared, and to sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of
the City, a continuing disclosure
agreement or certificate, which shall
constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Refunding Bonds in
accordance with the SEC Rule. The
performance of that Agreement shall
be subject to the availability of funds
and their annual appropriation to
meet costs the City would be required
to incur to perform it. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to
establish procedures in order to
ensure compliance by the City with
its continuing disclosure agreement,
including the timely provision of
information and notices.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Refunding
Bonds promptly when and as the
same falls due, and also to provide for
the discharge of the Refunding Bonds
at maturity, there shall be and is
levied on all the taxable property in
the City, in addition to all other taxes,
a direct tax annually during the period the Refunding Bonds are outstanding, in an amount sufficient to provide for the payment of that interest,
when and as the same shall fall due,
and also to discharge the principal of
the Refunding Bonds at maturity,
which tax shall not be less than the
interest
and
sinking
fund
tax
required by Section 11 of Article XII
of the Constitution of Ohio.

December 8, 2010
The tax shall be and is ordered computed, certified, levied and extended
upon the tax duplicate and collected
by the same officers, in the same manner and at the same time that taxes
for general purposes for each of those
years are certified, extended and collected. The tax shall be placed before
and in preference to all other items
and for the full amount thereof. The
funds derived from those tax levies
shall be placed in the Unvoted Tax
Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund as required by the
General Bond Ordinance and those
funds, together with the interest collected on them shall be irrevocably
pledged for the payment of principal
of and interest on the Refunding
Bonds when and as the same fall due;
provided, however, that, subject to
the provisions of Section 8 of the
General Bond Ordinance, in each year
to the extent that revenues are available from other sources for the payment of the Refunding Bonds and are
appropriated for such purpose, the
amount of such tax shall be reduced
by the amount of such revenues so
available and appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25(B)(1) and 5705.51 of
the Revised Code, and in accordance
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the
General Bond Ordinance, that the City
will appropriate annually from the
proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt charges
for the Refunding Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds;
Notice of Redemption of Refunding
Bonds. Pursuant to Revised Code
Section 133.34, the General Bond
Ordinance and this Ordinance, the
proceeds of the Refunding Bonds to
be applied to the refunding of the
Refunded Bonds shall be deposited in
a separate bank account within the
Unvoted Refunding Bond and Note
Redemption Account of the Sinking
Fund held by The Huntington
National Bank, Cleveland, Ohio, as
Escrow Agent, in accordance with
Section  179.08
of
the
Codified

Escrow Agreement described below,
and shall be applied to the payment of
debt
service
charges
on
the
Refunding Bonds from and after the
date of issuance of the Refunding
Bonds to and including their respective maturity or prior redemption
dates. The amount to be deposited in
the Escrow Fund shall be determined
by the Director of Finance in the
Certificate of Award and shall be the
amount necessary, together with
money in the Unvoted Tax Supported
Obligations Account of the Sinking
Fund available for the purpose, to
provide for the refunding of the
Refunded Bonds. Any transfer to the
Escrow Fund of any money currently
on deposit in the Unvoted Tax
Supported Obligations Account and
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance to be available for payment
of the Refunding Bonds, is authorized
by this Ordinance.
Money deposited in the Escrow
Fund shall be (a) held in cash or (b)
invested in direct obligations of the
United States of America that mature
or are subject to redemption by and at
the option of the holder, in amounts
sufficient, together with any uninvested cash in the Escrow Fund but
without further investment or rein-

The City Record
vestment, for the payment of the principal of, and any redemption premium
and interest on, the Refunded Bonds
as provided in the Escrow Agreement.
Pursuant
to
the
respective
Ordinances authorizing the Refunded
Bonds, Section 133.34 of the Revised
Code and this Ordinance, money
deposited in the Escrow Fund, and
the investment income thereon, are
pledged to the payment of the
Refunded Bonds.
Pursuant to Revised Code Chapter
133 and this Ordinance, and notwithstanding Chapter 179 of the Codified
Ordinances, any accrued interest
received from the sale of the
Refunding Bonds and any original
issue premium in excess of the
amount deposited with the Escrow
Agent under the Escrow Agreement
to accomplish the refunding of the
Refunded Bonds shall be deposited in
the
Unvoted
Tax
Supported
Obligations Account of the Sinking
Fund to be applied to the payment of
interest on the Refunding Bonds. The
proceeds of the Refunding Bonds to
be applied to pay costs of any Credit
Support Instruments obtained pursuant to Section 12 shall be paid to the
provider or providers of those Credit
Support Instruments. The proceeds of
the Refunding Bonds to be used to
pay costs of issuing the Refunding
Bonds and refunding the Refunded
Bonds shall be deposited with the
Registrar in a separate account under
the Registrar Agreement pending
their application to the payment of
such costs.
The Director of Finance is authorized to sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the Issuer, an agreement (the “Escrow Agreement”)
between the City and the Escrow
Agent, providing for the investment
and holding in escrow of the proceeds
of the Refunding Bonds to be applied
to the refunding of the Refunded
Bonds and for the application of the
moneys derived from such investments, in accordance with the
General Bond Ordinance and this
Ordinance and as otherwise directed
by law. Notice of the advance refunding of any of the Refunded Bonds and
any direction for the redemption of
Refunded Bonds prior to stated maturity shall be given in accordance with
the terms of the Refunded Bonds and
as further provided in the Escrow
Agreement. The Refunded Bonds
shall be retired at stated maturity or
redeemed prior to maturity as provided in the Certificate of Award and in
accordance with the ordinance authorizing the respective Refunded Bonds
and the Escrow Agreement. The
Director of Finance shall provide for
the payment of the services rendered
and for reimbursement of expenses
incurred pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement from money lawfully
available and appropriated or to be
appropriated for that purpose. The
Director of Finance shall obtain the
services of an independent accounting firm of national reputation to provide a verification report as to the
adequacy of the escrow fund to pay
the Refunded Bonds on the dates set
forth in the Escrow Agreement. The
Director of Finance and other appropriate City officials shall execute all
documents and take all other actions
necessary or appropriate on the part
of the City to effect the refunding of
the Refunded Bonds in accordance
with the General Bond Ordinance and
this Ordinance and as otherwise
directed by law, and to cause the

1987

37
Refunded Bonds to be deemed paid
and discharged.
If U.S. Treasury Securities State
and Local Government Series are to
be purchased for the Escrow Fund,
the Escrow Agent is authorized to
file, on behalf of the City, subscriptions for the purchase and issuance of
those Securities. If those Securities
are not timely available for purchase,
or if in the judgment of the Director of
Finance, an open-market purchase of
direct obligations of the United States
of America for the Escrow Fund is in
the best interest of and financially
advantageous
to
the
City,
the
Director of Finance may purchase
and deliver those obligations, engage
the services of a bidding agent or similar entity for the purpose of facilitating the bidding, purchase and delivery of such obligations for, and any
related structuring of, the Escrow
Fund, execute such instruments as
are deemed necessary to engage such
services for such purpose, and provide
further for the payment of the cost of
obtaining such services from the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds to the
extent available and otherwise from
any other funds lawfully available
and that are appropriated or shall be
appropriated for that purpose.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Refunding Bonds are secured by a
pledge and lien on a parity with the
pledges and liens authorized by the
General Bond Ordinance and, in addition to the taxes and revenues specifically pledged pursuant to this
Ordinance and the General Bond
Ordinance and the other covenants,
terms and agreements provided hereunder and in the General Bond
Ordinance to secure payment of the
principal of and interest on the
Refunding Bonds, the City hereby
determines, declares, warrants and
covenants that the Refunding Bonds
are general obligations of the City
and that the full faith and credit of
the City are hereby pledged for the
payment of the principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds in accordance with the laws and Constitution
of the State of Ohio, this Ordinance
and the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid and
discharged
all
the
outstanding
Refunding Bonds, or there shall otherwise be paid to the holders of the
outstanding Refunding Bonds all
debt charges due or to become due
thereon, and provision shall also be
made for paying all other sums
payable hereunder, then and in that
event this Ordinance (except for
Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be
of further effect, and the covenants,
agreements and other obligations of
the City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the request
of the City execute and deliver to the
City such instruments in writing as
shall discharge the lien hereof and
enter on the record such discharge of
the lien and such other instruments as
may be reasonably required by the
City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Refunding
Bonds.
Outstanding
Refunding Bonds shall be deemed to
have been paid and discharged within

or sub-accounts, in trust for and irrev-

38
ocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold in
special accounts or sub-accounts, in
trust for and irrevocably committed
solely thereto, direct obligations of
the United States certified by an independent public accounting firm of
national reputation to be of such
maturities and interest payment
dates and to bear such interest, without further investment or reinvestment of either the principal amount
thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held in trust and
committed, except as hereinafter provided), as will be sufficient, together
with moneys referred to in (i) above,
for the payment, at their maturities or
redemption dates, of all debt charges
on the Refunding Bonds to their date
of maturity or redemption, as the case
may be, or if default in such payment
shall have occurred on such date then

interest earned by, or increment to,
the investments held under this
Section shall, to the extent determined from time to time by the
Escrow Agent to be in excess of the
amount required to be held by it for
the purposes of this Section, be transferred at the time of such determination as provided in Section 17(a) of
the General Bond Ordinance for
unclaimed funds held by a Paying
Agent. In the event of nonpresentment of any Refunding Bond as
described in Section 17(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance, the moneys
held pursuant to this Section shall be
held and paid as provided in said
Section 17(a) for unclaimed funds
held by a Paying Agent.

(b) All covenants, terms and provisions of the General Bond Ordinance
are fully applicable to the Refunding
Bonds authorized herein, and nothing
in this Ordinance shall be deemed to
alter or restrict such full application
of the General Bond Ordinance,

provisions of the third paragraph of
Section 13(a) and the third paragraph
of Section 4 of the General Bond
Ordinance pursuant to Section 2 of
this Ordinance.
Section 10. Captions. The captions

The City covenants that it will use,
and will restrict the use and investment
of,
the
proceeds
of
the
Refunding Bonds in such manner and

The City Record
to such extent as may be necessary so
that (a) the Refunding Bonds will not
(i) constitute private activity bonds,
arbitrage bonds or hedge bonds under
Sections 141, 148 or 149 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the Code) or (ii) be treated other
than as bonds to which Section 103(a)
of the Code applies, and (b) the interest thereon will not be treated as an
item of tax preference under Section
57 of the Code.
The City further covenants that (a)
it will take or cause to be taken such
actions that may be required of it for
the interest on the Refunding Bonds
to be and to remain excluded from
gross income for federal income tax
purposes, (b) it will not take or authorize to be taken any actions that
would adversely affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting for
it, will, among other acts of compliance, (i) apply the proceeds of the
Refunding Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing, (ii)
restrict the yield on investment property acquired with those proceeds,
(iii) make timely and adequate payments to the federal government, (iv)
maintain books and records and make
calculations and reports, and (v)
refrain from certain uses of those proceeds, and, as applicable, of property
financed with such proceeds, all in
such manner and to the extent necessary to assure such exclusion of that
interest under the Code.
Each covenant made in this section
with respect to the Refunding Bonds
is also made with respect to all issues
any portion of the debt service on
which is paid from proceeds of the
Refunding Bonds (and, if different,
the original issue and any refunding
issues in a series of refundings), to
the extent such compliance is necessary to assure exclusion of interest on
the Refunding Bonds from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, and the officers identified above
are authorized to take actions with
respect to those issues as they are
authorized in this section to take with
respect to the Refunding Bonds.
The Director of Finance, as the fiscal officer, or any other officer of the
City
having
responsibility
for
issuance of the Refunding Bonds is
hereby authorized (a) to make or
effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or
waiver on behalf of the City with
respect to the Refunding Bonds as the
City is permitted or required to make
or give under the federal income tax
laws, including, without limitation
thereto, any of the elections provided
for in Section 148(f)(4)(C) of the
Code or available under Section 148 of
the Code, for the purpose of assuring,
enhancing or protecting favorable
tax treatment or status of the
Refunding Bonds or interest thereon
or assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose, reducing the
burden or expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or
payments or penalties, or making
payments of special amounts in lieu
of making computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as
rebate, or obviating those amounts or
payments, as determined by that officer, which action shall be in writing
and signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf of
the City, as may be appropriate to
assure the exclusion of interest from
gross income and the intended tax
status of the Refunding Bonds, and

(c) to give one or more appropriate
certificates of the City, for inclusion
in the transcript of proceedings for
the Refunding Bonds, setting forth
the reasonable expectations of the
City regarding the amount and use of
all the proceeds of the Refunding
Bonds, the facts, circumstances and
estimates on which they are based,
and other facts and circumstances relevant to the tax treatment of the
interest on and the tax status of the
Refunding Bonds.
Section 12. Credit Enhancement and
Ratings. If, in the judgment of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
the filing of an application for a rating on one or more Series of
Refunding Bonds by one or more
nationally recognized rating agencies is in the best interests of the City,
the Director of Finance is authorized
to prepare and submit those applications and to provide to each such
agency such information as may be
required for the purpose. The Director
of Finance is authorized to contract

Support Instrument” means an insurance policy, surety, letter of credit, or
other instrument used to enhance or
provide for the security of Refunding
Bonds. The cost of obtaining each rating and the cost of obtaining each
Credit Support Instrument, except to
the extent paid by the Original
Purchasers in accordance with the
Bond Purchase Agreement, shall be
paid from the proceeds of Refunding
Bonds or funds appropriated for that
purpose.

advice of any financial advisor so
retained. Any financial advisor
employed under the authority of this
Ordinance shall be disinterested in
the transaction and be independent of
the underwriters and any other party
interested in the transaction.

That
the
Codified
Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
are supplemented by enacting new
Sections 3167.01 to 3167.06 and 3167.99
to read as follows:
CHAPTER 3167
FLOOD PLAIN MANAGEMENT
Section 3167.01 General Provisions
(a) Statutory Authorization. Article
XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities
the legal authority to adopt land use
and control measures for promoting
the health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens.
(b) Findings of Fact. The City of
Cleveland has special flood hazard
areas that are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss
of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the
tax base. Additionally, structures
that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from
flood damage also contribute to the
flood loss. In order to minimize the
threat of such damages and to
achieve the purposes hereinafter set
forth, these regulations are adopted.
(c) Statement of Purpose. It is the
purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to:
(1) Protect human life and health;
(2) Minimize expenditure of public
money for costly flood control projects;
(3) Minimize the need for rescue
and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at
the expense of the general public;
(4) Minimize prolonged business
interruptions;
(5) Minimize damage to public
facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and
sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;
(6) Help maintain a stable tax base
by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood
hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
(7) Ensure that those who occupy
the areas of special flood hazard
assume
responsibility
for
their
actions;
(8) Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
(9) Ensure that the flood storage
and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
(10) Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values of the floodplain;
(11) Prevent floodplain uses that
are either hazardous or environmentally incompatible; and

1998

(12) Meet community participation
requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(d) Methods of Reducing Flood
Loss. In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and provisions for:
(1) Restricting or prohibiting uses
which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water hazards,
or which result in damaging increases in flood heights or velocities;
(2) Requiring that uses vulnerable
to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against
flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
(3) Controlling the alteration of
natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers,
which help accommodate or channel
flood waters;
(4) Controlling filling, grading,
dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase
flood damage; and,
(5) Preventing or regulating the
construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood, waters
or which may increase flood hazards
in other areas.
Lands
to
Which
These
(e)
Regulations Apply. These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of Cleveland as identified in division (f) of this section,
including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the City
of Cleveland.
(f) Basis for Establishing the areas
of Special Flood Hazard. For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and / or maps are adopted:
(1)
Flood
Insurance
Study
Cuyahoga
County,
Ohio
and
Incorporated
Areas
and
Flood
Insurance
Rate
map
Cuyahoga
County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
both effective December 3, 2010.
(2) Other studies and / or maps,
which may be relied upon for establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year floodplain, floodways or delineation of
other areas of special flood hazard.
(3) Any hydrologic and hydraulic
engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in
the State of Ohio which has been
approved by the City of Cleveland as
required by division (c) of Section
3167.04, Subdivisions and Large Scale
Developments.
Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and / or studies are hereby adopted by reference and declared
to be a part of these regulations. Such
maps and/or studies are on file at 601
Lakeside Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio
44114.
Abrogation
and
Greater
(g)
Restrictions. In the event of a conflict
between these regulations and any
other ordinance, the more restrictive
shall be followed. These regulations
shall not impair any deed restriction

December 8, 2010
covenant or easement but the land
subject to such interests shall also be
governed by the regulations.
(h) Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions shall be:
Considered
as
minimum
(1)
requirements;
(2) Liberally construed in favor of
the governing body; and,
(3) Deemed neither to limit nor
repeal any other powers granted
under state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in
conflict with a state or Federal law,
such state or Federal law shall take
precedence over these regulations.
(i) Warning and Disclaimer of
Liability. The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is
considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on scientific
and
engineering
considerations.
Larger floods can and will occur on
rare occasions. Flood heights may be
increased by man-made or natural
causes. These regulations do not
imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on
the part of the City of Cleveland, any
officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management
Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
(j) Severability. Should any section
or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision
shall not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part so declared to
be unconstitutional or invalid.
Section 3167.02 Definitions
Unless specifically defined below,
words or phrases used in these regulations shall be interpreted so as to
give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
(a) Accessory Structure. A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and
subordinate to, the principal structure.
(b) Appeal. A request for review of
the floodplain administrator’s interpretation of any provision of these
regulations or a request for a variance.
(c) Base Flood. The flood having a
one percent chance of being equaled
or exceeded in any given year. The
base flood may also be referred to as
the 1% chance annual flood or
one-hundred (100) year flood.

in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In
Zone AO areas, the base flood elevation is the natural grade elevation
plus the depth number (from 1 to 3
feet).
(e) Basement. Any area of the
building having its floor subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.
(f) Development. Any manmade
change to improved or unimproved
real estate, including but not limited

The City Record
(g) Enclosure Below the Lowest
Floor. See “Lowest Floor.”
(h)
Executive
Order
11988
(Floodplain Management). Issued by
President Carter in 1977, this order

(2) The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters
from any source.
(l) Flood Hazard Boundary Map
(FHBM). Usually the initial map, produced by the Federal Emergency
Management
Agency,
or
U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban
Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
(m) Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM). An official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management
Agency or the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development has

hazard.
(n) Flood Insurance Risk Zones.
Zone designations on FHBMs and
FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of
the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone
definitions:
(1) Zone A: Special flood hazard
areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
(2) Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:
Special flood hazard areas inundated
by the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
(3) Zone AO: Special flood hazard
areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain);
average depths are determined.
(4) Zone AH: Special flood hazard
areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually
areas of ponding); base flood elevations are determined.
(5) Zone A99: Special flood hazard
areas inundated by the 100-year flood
to be protected from the 100-year flood
by a Federal flood protection system
under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
(6) Zone B and Zone X (shaded):
Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average
depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage area less than 1
square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
(7) Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
(o) Flood Insurance Study (FIS).
The official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management
Agency or the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development has
provided flood profiles, floodway
boundaries (sometimes shown on
Flood
Boundary
and
Floodway
Maps), and the water surface elevations of the base flood.
(p) Flood Protection Elevation.
The Flood Protection Elevation, or
FPE, is the base flood elevation plus
two (2) feet of freeboard. In areas

1999

49
where no base flood elevations exist
from any authoritative source, the
flood protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
determined
and/or
elevations
approved by the floodplain administrator.
(q) Floodway. A floodway is the
channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas
that have been reserved in order to
pass the base flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through
a hydraulic and hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative
increase in the water surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no
more than a designated height. In no
case shall the designated height be
more than one foot at any point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by any of the following:
Moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and
projectile impacts, and moderate to
high erosion forces.
(r) Freeboard. A factor of safety
usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends
to compensate for the many unknown
factors that could contribute to flood
heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and
floodway conditions, such as wave
action, obstructed bridge openings,
debris and ice jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
(s) Historic structure. Any structure that is:
(1) Listed individually in the
National Register of Historic Places
(a listing maintained by the U.S.
Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of
the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listings on the
National Register;
(2) Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a
registered historic district; or
(3) Individually listed on the State
of Ohio’s inventory of historic places
maintained by the Ohio Historic
Preservation Office.
(t) Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis. An analysis performed by a professional engineer,
registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA,
used to determine flood elevations
and/or floodway boundaries.
(u) Letter of Map Change (LOMC).
A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to
amend or revise effective Flood
Insurance
Rate
Maps,
Flood
Boundary and Floodway Maps, and
Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are
broken down into the following categories:
(1) Letter of Map Amendment
(LOMA). A revision based on technical data showing that a property was
incorrectly included in a designated
special flood hazard area. A LOMA
amends the current effective Flood
Insurance Rate Map and establishes
that a specific property is not located
in a special flood hazard area.
(2)
Letter
of
Map
Revision
(LOMR). A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade
changes, shows changes to flood
zones, flood elevations, floodplain
and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One common type of

50
LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination
concerning whether a structure or
parcel has been elevated by fill above
the base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood
hazard area.
(3) Conditional Letter of Map
Revision (CLOMR). A formal review
and comment by FEMA as to whether
a proposed project complies with the
minimum National Flood Insurance
Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does not amend or
revise effective Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway
Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
(v) Lowest floor. The lowest floor
of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) of a structure. This
definition excludes an “enclosure
below the lowest floor” which is an
unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an
area other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in
accordance
with
the
applicable
design requirements specified in
these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
(w) Manufactured home. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent
chassis and is designed for use with
or without a permanent foundation
when connected to the required utilities. The term “manufactured home”
does not include a “recreational vehicle”. For the purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes
manufactured homes and mobile
homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of
the Ohio Revised Code.
(x) Manufactured home park. As
specified in the Ohio Administrative
Code 3701-27-01, a manufactured home
park means any tract of land upon
which three or more manufactured
homes, used for habitation are
parked, either free of charge or for
revenue purposes, and includes any
roadway, building, structure, vehicle,
or enclosure used or intended for use
as part of the facilities of the park. A
tract of land that is subdivided and
the individual lots are not for rent or
rented, but are for sale or sold for the
purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes
are parked thereon, if the roadways
are dedicated to the local government
authority.
(y) National Flood Insurance
Program (NFIP). The NFIP is a
Federal program enabling property
owners in participating communities
to purchase insurance protection
against losses from flooding. This
insurance is designed to provide an
insurance alternative to disaster
assistance to meet the escalating
costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is
based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will
adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future
flood risks to all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal
government will make flood insurance available within the community
as a financial protection against
flood loss.
(z) New construction. Structures
for which the “start of construction”
commenced on or after the initial
effective date of the City of Cleveland
Flood Insurance Rate Map, August 1,
1978, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.

The City Record
(aa) Person. Includes any individual or group of individuals, corporation, partnership, association, or any
other entity, including state and local
and
agencies.
An
governments
agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any
governmental entity of the state and
includes, but is not limited to, any
board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community college district, technical college district, or state community college. “Agency” does not include the
general assembly, the controlling
board, the adjutant general’s department, or any court.
(bb) Recreational vehicle. A vehicle which is (1) built on a single chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when
measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be selfpropelled or permanently towable by
a light duty truck, and (4) designed
primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living
quarters for recreational, camping,
travel, or seasonal use.
(cc)
Registered
Professional
Architect. A person registered to
engage in the practice of architecture
under the provisions of sections
4703.01 to 4703.19 of the Revised Code.

Engineer. A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter
4733 of the Revised Code.
(ee)
Professional
Registered
Surveyor. A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter
4733 of the Revised Code.
(ff) Special Flood Hazard Area.
Also known as “Areas of Special
Flood Hazard”, it is the land in the
floodplain subject to a one percent or
greater chance of flooding in any
given year. Special flood hazard
areas are designated by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency on
Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A,
AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special
flood hazard areas may also refer to
areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal state or local
sources of data including but not limited to historical flood information
reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and flood
prone soils associated with a watercourse.
(gg) Start of construction. The date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means
either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a
site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on
a foundation. Permanent construction
does not include land preparation,
such as clearing, grading, and filling;
nor does it include the installation of
streets and/or walkways; nor does it
include excavation for a basement,
footings, piers, or foundations or the
erection of temporary forms; nor does
it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as
garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction
means the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor, or other structural part
of a building, whether or not that

2000

December 8, 2010
alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
(hh) Structure. A walled and roofed
building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
(ii) Substantial Damage. Damage
of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the
structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent
of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
(jj) Substantial Improvement. Any
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market
value of the structure before the
“start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures,
which have incurred “substantial
damage”, regardless of the actual
repair work performed. The term does
not, however, include:
(1) Any improvement to a structure
that is considered “new construction,”
(2) Any project for improvement of
a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary,
or safety code specifications which
have been identified prior to the
application for a development permit
by the local code enforcement official
and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions;
or
(3) Any alteration of a “historic
structure,” provided that the alteration would not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure”.
(kk) Variance. A grant of relief
from the standards of these regulations consistent with the variance
conditions herein.
(ll) Violation. The failure of a
structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.

have
flood
data
reviewed
and
approved by FEMA, and to ensure
that the City of Cleveland flood maps,
studies and other data identified in
division (f) of Section 3167.01 accurately represent flooding conditions
so appropriate floodplain management criteria are based on current
data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
(1) Requirement to Submit New
Technical Data
A. For all development proposals
that impact floodway delineations or
base flood elevations, the community
shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted
to FEMA within six months of the
date such information becomes available. These development proposals
include:
1. Floodway encroachments that
increase or decrease base flood elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
2. Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures where
the applicant desires to remove the
site from the special flood hazard
area;
3. Alteration of watercourses that
result in a relocation or elimination of
the special flood hazard area, including the placement of culverts; and
4. Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the establishment of base flood elevations in
accordance with division (c) of
Section 3167.04.

52
B. It is the responsibility of the
applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with division
(j)(1) of Section 3167.03 prepared in a
format required for a Conditional
Letter of Map Revision or Letter of
Map Revision, and submitted to
FEMA. Submittal and processing fees
for these map revisions shall be the
responsibility of the applicant.
C. The Floodplain Administrator
shall require a Conditional Letter of
Map Revision prior to the issuance of
a floodplain development permit for:
1. Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood elevation; and
2. Proposed development which
increases the base flood elevation by
more than one foot in areas where
FEMA has provided base flood elevations but no floodway.
D. Floodplain development permits
by
the
Floodplain
issued
Administrator shall be conditioned
upon the applicant obtaining a Letter
of Map Revision from FEMA for any
development proposal subject to division (j)(1)A. of Section 3167.03.
(2) Right to Submit New Technical
Data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the
information shown on an effective
map that does not impact floodplain
or floodway delineations or base
flood elevations, such as labeling or
planimetric details. Such a submission shall include appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City of
Cleveland and may be submitted at
any time.
(3) Annexation / Detachment. Upon
occurrence,
the
Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in
writing whenever the boundaries of
the City of Cleveland have been modified by annexation or the community
has assumed authority over an area,
or no longer has authority to adopt
and enforce floodplain management
regulations for a particular area. In
order that the City of Cleveland’s
Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately
represent the City of Cleveland
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the City of
Cleveland suitable for reproduction,
clearly showing the new corporate
limits or the new area for which the
City of Clevelandhas assumed or
relinquished floodplain management
regulatory authority.
(k) Data Use and Flood Map
Interpretation. The following guidelines shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data
showing areas of special flood hazard:
(1) In areas where FEMA has not
identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood
hazard areas where base flood elevation and floodway data have not been
identified,
the
Floodplain
Administrator shall review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard
data available from a federal, state,
or other source.
(2) Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take
precedence over base flood elevations
and floodway boundaries by any
other source that reflect a reduced
floodway width and/or lower base
flood elevations. Other sources of
data, showing increased base flood
elevations and/or larger floodway
areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably
used
by
the
Floodplain
Administrator.
(3)
When
Preliminary
Flood
Insurance Rate Maps and / or Flood

The City Record
Insurance Study have been provided
by FEMA:
A. Upon the issuance of a Letter of
Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data
shall be used and replace all previously existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of
administering these regulations.
B. Prior to the issuance of a Letter
of Final Determination by FEMA, the
use of preliminary flood hazard data
shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and /or floodway
areas exist or where the preliminary
base flood elevations or floodway
area exceed the base flood elevations
and/or floodway widths in existing
flood hazard data provided from
FEMA. Such preliminary data may be
subject to change and / or appeal to
FEMA.
(4) The Floodplain Administrator
shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the
flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the
determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section 3167.05,
Appeals and Variances.
(5) Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard
and field elevations disagree, the
base flood elevations or flood protection elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table,
established high water marks, etc.)
shall prevail.
(l)
Substantial
Damage
Determinations. Damages to structures may result from a variety of
causes including flood, tornado, wind,
heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a
damage
event,
the
Floodplain
Administrator shall:
(1) Determine whether damaged
structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
(2) Conduct substantial damage
determinations for damaged structures located in special flood hazard
areas; and
(3) Make reasonable attempt to
notify owners of substantially damaged structures of the need to obtain
a floodplain development permit prior
to repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
Additionally,
the
Floodplain
Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process. These measures
include issuing press releases, public
service announcements, and other
public information materials related
to the floodplain development permits
and repair of damaged structures;
coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist
with substantial damage determinations; providing owners of damaged
structures materials and other information related to the proper repair of
damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of
substantially damaged structures
with Increased Cost of Compliance
insurance claims.

(i) Assurance of Flood Carrying
Capacity. Pursuant to the purpose
and methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the
following additional standards are
adopted to assure that the reduction
of the flood carrying capacity of
watercourses is minimized:
(1) Development in Floodways.
A. In floodway areas, development
shall cause no increase in flood levels
during the occurrence of the base
flood discharge. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the
applicant must submit a hydrologic
and hydraulic analysis, conducted by
a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed
development would not result in any
increase in the base flood elevation;
or
B. Development in floodway areas
causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided
all of the following are completed by
the applicant:
1. Meet the requirements to submit
technical data in division (j)(1) of
Section 3167.03;
2. An evaluation of alternatives,
which would not result in increased
base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are not
feasible;
3. Certification that no structures
are located in areas that would be
impacted by the increased base flood

(2) Development in Riverine Areas
with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways
A. In riverine special flood hazard
areas identified by FEMA where base
flood elevation data are provided but
no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed
development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base
flood elevation more than 1.0 (one)
foot at any point. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the
applicant must submit a hydrologic
and hydraulic analysis, conducted by
a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has
been met; or,
B. Development in riverine special
flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation
data are provided but no floodways
have been designated causing more
than one foot increase in the base
flood elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
1. An evaluation of alternatives
which would result in an increase of
one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
2. Divisions (i)(1)B.1., (i)(1)B.3,
(i)(1)B.4., and (i)(1)B.5. of Section
3167.04.
(3) Alterations of a Watercourse.
For the purpose of these regulations,
a watercourse is altered when any
change occurs within its banks. The
extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
“bankfull stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based
on methods presented in Chapter 7 of
the USDA Forest Service General
Technical Report RM-245, Stream
Channel
Reference
Sites:
An
Illustrated Guide to Field Technique
or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed
developments that alter a watercourse, the following standards
apply:
A. The bankfull flood carrying
capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not
be diminished. Prior to the issuance
of a floodplain development permit,
the applicant must submit a description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as
a result of the proposed development,
and certification by a registered professional engineer that the bankfull
flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be diminished.
B. Adjacent communities, the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio
Department
of
Natural
Resources, Division of Water, must be
notified prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of
such notification must be submitted
to
the
Federal
Emergency
Management Agency.
C. The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary maintenance for the altered or relocated
portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not
be
diminished.
The
Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit
holder to enter into an agreement
with the City of Cleveland specifying

54
the maintenance responsibilities. If
an agreement is required, it shall be
made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
D. The applicant shall meet the
requirements to submit technical
data in division (j)(1)A.3. of Section
3167.03) when an alteration of a
watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood
hazard area, including the placement
of culverts.
Section 3167.05 Appeals Board
Established
(a)
The
Board
of
Building
Standards and Buildings Appeals as
established by the Charter shall hear
and decide appeals and requests for
variances from the requirements of
this chapter.
(b) Powers and Duties
(1) The Appeals Board shall hear
and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made
by the Floodplain Administrator in
the administration or enforcement of
these regulations.
(2) Authorize variances in accordance with division (d) of this section
of these regulations.
(c) Appeals. Any person affected by
any notice and order, or other official
action
of
the
Floodplain
Administrator may request and shall
be granted a hearing on the matter
before the Appeals Board provided
that such person shall file, within
thirty (30) days of the date of such
notice and order, or other official
action, a brief statement of the
grounds for such hearing or for the
mitigation of any item appearing on
any
order
of
the
Floodplain
Administrator’s decision. Such appeal
shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain
Administrator.
Upon
receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said
notice and all pertinent information
on
which
the
Floodplain
Administrator’s decision was made to
the Appeals Board.
Upon receipt of the notice of appeal,
the Appeals Board shall fix a reasonable time for the appeal, give notice
in writing to parties in interest, and
decide the appeal within a reasonable
time after it is submitted.
(d) Variances. Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship may
file an application for a variance. The
Appeals Board shall have the power
to authorize, in specific cases, such
variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with
Federal regulations, as will not be
contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot
or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
(1) Application for a Variance.
A. Any owner, or agent thereof, of
property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for
a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon
receipt of the variance shall transmit
it to the Appeals Board.
B. Such application at a minimum
shall contain the following information: Name, address, and telephone
number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel
map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of
the variance sought; and reason for
the variance request.

The City Record
C. All application for a variance
shall be accompanied by a Variance
Application Fee set in accordance
with Section 329.05.
(2) Notice for Public Hearing. The
Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty
(30) days after the receipt of an application for a variance from the
Floodplain Administrator. Prior to
the hearing, a notice of such hearing
shall be given in one (1) or more
newspapers of general circulation in
the community at least ten (10) days
before the date of the hearing.
(3) Public Hearing. At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the
Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance applications, the
Appeals Board shall consider and
make findings of fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of these
regulations and the following factors:
A. The danger that materials may
be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
B. The danger to life and property
due to flooding or erosion damage.
C. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
D. The importance of the services
provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
E. The availability of alternative
locations for the proposed use that are
not subject to flooding or erosion
damage.
F. The necessity to the facility of a
waterfront location, where applicable.
G. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development.
H. The relationship of the proposed
use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for
that area.
I. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles.
J. The expected heights, velocity,
duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the
effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site.
K. The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets
and bridges.
Variances shall only be issued
upon:
L. A showing of good and sufficient
cause.
M. A determination that failure to
grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of
meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an
exceptional hardship to the applicant.
N. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that
which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety;
extraordinary public expense, nuisances, fraud on or victimization of
the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
O. A determination that the structure or other development is protected
by methods to minimize flood damages.
P. A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.

2004

December 8, 2010
Upon consideration of the above
factors and the purposes of these regulations, the Appeals Board may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as it deems necessary
to further the purposes of these regulations.
(4) Other Conditions for Variances
A. Variances shall not be issued
within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during
the base flood discharge would result.
B. Generally, variances may be
issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected
on a lot of one-half acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots
with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing
items in division (d)(3) of Section
3167.05 have been fully considered. As
the lot size increases beyond one-half
acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance
increases.
C. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the
increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
(e) Procedure at Hearings
(1) All testimony shall be given
under oath.
(2) A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except confidential deliberations of the Board, but
including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
(3) The applicant shall proceed
first to present evidence and testimony in support of the appeal or variance.
(4) The administrator may present
evidence or testimony in opposition to
the appeal or variance.
(5) All witnesses shall be subject to
cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
(6) Evidence that is not admitted
may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
(7) The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of
issuance and service shall be collected in advance.
(8) The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its decision.
The decision may be announced at the
conclusion of the hearing and thereafter issued in writing or the decision
may be issued in writing within a reasonable time after the hearing.
(f) Appeal to the Court. Those
aggrieved by the decision of the
Appeals Board may appeal such decision to the Cuyahoga County Court of
Common Pleas, as provided in
Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised
Code.
Section 3167.06 Enforcement
(a) Compliance Required
