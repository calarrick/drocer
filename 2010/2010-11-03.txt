applicable provisions of the Code,
the Construction Contract, and the
Standards and Procedures relating
to Resident or Low-Income Person

be appealed to the Board of Zoning
Appeals by filing a notice of appeal
with the Board and a copy to the
Director within 15 days of the decision. The Board of Zoning Appeals
shall, after a hearing, determine
whether the decision of the Director
is arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. The decision of the Board
of Zoning Appeals, in turn, may be
reviewed by the Common Pleas
Court of Cuyahoga County under
Chapter 2506 of the Revised Code, or
as otherwise provided by law.
(e) Failure to submit, or knowing
falsification of, the reports required
in Sections 188.02 and 188.04 shall
result in a breach of the Construction Contract subject to assessment
of the maximum penalty provided in
division (b), and the penalty shall
be calculated as if no Residents of
the City were employed on the construction project in furtherance of
the Construction Contract.
(f) No Contractor shall knowingly falsify any required reports,
statements or payroll certifications.

and subject to a fine of not more
than five thousand dollars ($5,000).
If a Contractor is convicted under
this division, that Contractor shall
be barred from contracting with the
City on any construction project subject to this chapter for a period of

necessary legislative authority and
provided the funds are used in compliance with all laws or restrictions
regarding their use.

supply false information to establish
