By Council Members Polensek, J.
Johnson and Miller.
An emergency resolution supporting
Councilperson Polensek and the Collinwood community in their efforts to

The City Record
keep Ginn Academy in its present
location at the former Margaret Spellacy School on East 162nd Street.
Whereas, the Cleveland Metropolitan School District’s (CMSD) Transformation Plan proposes to relocate
Ginn Academy from its present location at the former Margaret Spellacy School on East 162nd Street to
Glenville High School; and
Whereas, Councilperson Polensek
worked diligently with Coach Ted
Ginn, Sr. over the last three years
to find a permanent suitable location to house “Ted’s dream” of a
stand-alone, all boys, single gender
academy that places safety, security and academic excellence as its
core values; and
Whereas, even as the City’s graduation rate has fallen to 54 percent,
Ginn Academy, now in its third
year, has grown in its present location to 300 students, and no one has
dropped out;
Whereas, of the 37 students in its
first senior class, 32 have already
passed Ohio’s mandatory graduation
exam; and
Whereas, “Ted’s dream” is working, so Ginn Academy needs to build
on its success in its present location
rather than be disrupted by moving
to a new neighborhood and building
to share with a new girls-only program; and
Whereas, CMSD has spent over 2
million in “warm, safe, and dry”
expenses and renovations since 2002
on the Margaret Spellacy School
building that is home to Ginn Academy; and
Whereas, CMSD spent $775,000 in
renovation costs to the Margaret
Spellacy School building to make it
the site of Ginn Academy last fall;
and
Whereas, abandoning Ginn Academy’s present location after spending
so much in renovation costs is a
waste of tax payers’ money and
state funds; and
Whereas, Councilperson Polensek
and the Collinwood community will
work to keep the successful Ginn
Academy continuing its progress at
its present location; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports Councilperson Polensek
and the Collinwood community in
their efforts to keep Ginn Academy
in its present location at the former
Margaret Spellacy School on East
162nd Street.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Eugene
Sanders, CEO, the CMSD School
Board, Mayor Jackson, and Congresswoman Marcia Fudge, and United
States Senator George Voinovich.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted February 1, 2010.
Effective February 4, 2010, without the signature of the Mayor.
