An emergency resolution supporting the Ohioans for Humane Farms
Ballot
Initiative
requiring
that
calves used for veal, egg-laying hens
and breeding pigs on industrialized
factory farms have enough room to
turn around and extend their limbs.
Whereas, animal welfare organizations and the media have illuminated the cruel and inhumane confinement of veal calves, egg-laying
hens and breeding pigs in tiny
cages and crates on factory farms;
and
Whereas, animal welfare charities,
veterinarians, family farmers, environmental organizations, health professionals and concerned citizens have
formed a coalition called Ohioans
for Humane Farms to start gathering 650,000 signatures to place this
initiative on the November 2010 ballot; and
Whereas, if passed, this initiative
will phase out the use of veal crates
for calves, battery
cages for egg laying hens, and
gestation crates for breeding pigs in
the State of Ohio; and
Whereas, if passed, this initiative
would prohibit the transport of sick
and injured animals to slaughter for
human consumption; and
Whereas, the extreme overcrowded conditions that have become the
norm in some sectors of animal
agribusiness cause immense suffering for the animals while polluting
the air, contaminating groundwater
and threatening human health; and
Whereas, young calves used for
veal are kept in tiny enclosures, purposely confined so intensively that
they are not even able to turn

982

June 16, 2010
around or even lie down in comfortably; and
Whereas, the vast majority of egglaying hens are confined in barren
battery cages that are so small they
can barely move — each bird has
less space than a single sheet of
paper on which to live; and
Whereas, during their pregnancies,
the female breeding pigs are severely restricted in individual “gestation
crates” measuring just two feet
wide where they are unable to exercise or even turn around, and are
prone to developing crippling joint
disorders and lameness; and
Whereas, Florida, Arizona, Oregon, California and Michigan have
state laws that prohibit gestation
crates, and food producers and retailers, including Smithfield Foods,
Maple Leaf Foods, Wolfgang Puck,
Burger King, Carl’s Jr., Hardees,
Subway, and many more, are producing and/or retailing pork, veal,
and eggs without the use of gestation crates or battery cages; and
Whereas, Ohio environmental groups
have endorsed the measure because
Ohio factory farms continue to be
one of the leading causes of resource depletion and pollution in our
our state; and
Whereas, thousands of Ohio citizens — including Cleveland residents — are now volunteering their
time to collect signatures to put a
measure on the November 2010 ballot that would require that calves
used for veal, egg-laying hens, and
pigs used for breeding be given
enough room to turn around and
extend their limbs; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports
the
Ohioans
for
Humane
Farms Ballot Initiative requiring
that calves used for veal, egg-laying
hens and breeding pigs on industrialized factory farms have enough
room to turn around and extend
their limbs.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
The Humane Society of the United
States, Karen Minter, Ohio State
Director.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

University System of Ohio Strategic
Plan for Higher Education and by

language in House Bill 562 signed by
the Governor on June 24, 2008; and
Whereas, this medical education
will
include
a
special
program
emphasis on urban primary care education for students in Cleveland,
including students from lower socioeconomic and disadvantaged backgrounds; and
Whereas, the CSU/NEOUCOM interprofessional health education partnership will initiate this program
with its first cohort of up to 20 students beginning with the Fall 2011
Academic Year; and
Whereas, this program will include
a student pipeline to support students
throughout the educational continuum of “Middle School to Practice”
that will tie education and debt
reduction to service in medical practice in Ohio; and
Whereas, this program will contribute directly to the regional economy by increasing the number of
Ohioans who obtain their education
in the health professions and who
remain in the region to establish professional health care practices which
generate revenues and support new
jobs in this community; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public

now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

be issued as Recovery Zone Economic Development Revenue Bonds.

advice of a Financial Advisor, that
it is to the financial advantage of
the City and in the City’s best interests given prevailing market conditions and taking into account other
bond issuances of the City, the
Director of Finance is authorized to
determine whether the Bonds shall
be issued as Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds or as
Tax-Exempt Bonds, which determination shall be specified in a certificate providing for the final terms
of the Bonds and signed by the
Director of Finance (the “Final
Terms Certificate”).
(b) Principal Components and
Term. Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, which may be
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that it is to the
financial advantage of the City and
in the City’s best interests, the
Director of Finance is authorized to
cooperate with the Port Authority to
negotiate and provide for the terms
of the Bonds and the Appropriation
Payments, which Appropriation Payments shall be equal to the Debt Service Charges on the Bonds plus the
amount of Administrative Expenses.
The aggregate principal amount of
the Bonds and the corresponding
principal component of Appropriation
Payments shall be equal to the principal amount specified in the Final
Terms Certificate, which in the
aggregate
shall
not
exceed
$11,000,000, and shall be used (i) to
pay the cost of the acquisition of the
Property and a portion of the costs
of the construction of the Public

any
Credit
Support

the Bonds, (iv) to pay any capitalized interest due on the first interest payment date, and Administrative Expenses that may be due during that capitalized interest period
and (v) to pay costs of issuing the
Bonds. The Bonds shall mature on
the dates beginning no later than
December 1, 2012 and no earlier than
February 1, 2011 and ending no less
than 20 years and no more than 27
years thereafter and shall mature in
annual or semi-annual installments
in the principal amounts (either by
principal maturity date or redemption date) such that the total principal and interest payments due on
the Bonds in any fiscal year (a) in
which principal is payable and there
are two semi-annual interest payments (if principal is payable annually) or (b) in which there are two
semi-annual principal and interest
payments (if principal is payable
semi-annually), in either case is not
more than three times the amount
of those payments in any other fiscal year, all as to be set forth in the

1023

63
Final Terms Certificate and the
Bond Purchase Agreement, and to
be consistent with this Ordinance,
the Cooperative Agreement and the
Trust Indenture.
(c) Interest. The Bonds shall be
issued as obligations bearing interest at a fixed rate or rates not to
exceed 8.0% with respect to any
maturity if the Bonds are issued as
Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds or not to exceed 6.0%
with respect to any maturity if the
Bonds are issued as Tax-Exempt
Bonds, based on the determination
of the Director of Finance as to the
financial advantage to, and best
interests of, the City given prevailing conditions in the financial markets, as specified in the Final Terms
Certificate. Interest on the Bonds
shall
be
payable
semiannually
beginning not later than December
1, 2011.
(d) Credit Support Instruments.
The Director of Finance is authorized to approve one or more Credit
Support Instruments, if the Director
of Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the Credit Support Instruments will result in a savings in the
cost of the financing to the City,
which determination shall be specified in the Final Terms Certificate.
The costs of such Credit Support
Instruments shall be paid from proceeds of the Bonds or from other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose, as determined by the
Director of Finance.
(e) Appropriation Payments. The
Appropriation Payments to be payable under and in accordance with
the Cooperative Agreement during
any fiscal year shall be an amount
sufficient to cover the semi-annual
or annual Debt Service Charges on
the Bonds that are due and payable
during that fiscal year and the
Administrative Expenses that are
due and payable during that fiscal
year, and such Appropriation Payments shall be specified in an exhibit to the Cooperative Agreement;
provided, however, that the City’s
payment of Appropriation Payments
is subject to appropriation as provided in the Cooperative Agreement
and nothing in the Cooperative
Agreement, the Bonds or the Trust
Indenture constitutes or shall constitute a pledge by the City, or an
obligation of the City, of any taxes
or other moneys to the payments
due thereunder.
(f) Redemption. The Bonds may
be subject to redemption if the closing of the Property does not occur
by the date and under the circumstances as provided in the Cooperative Agreement.
The Bonds also may be subject to
redemption by the Port Authority,
solely at the direction of the City,
including, but not limited to, any
redemption that the City may direct
if all or a portion of the credit payments from the federal government
associated with Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds are no
longer being paid or if a change has
occurred to the Code that impacts
the amount of the credit payments
to be paid to the City (“RZEDB
Redemption”), in each case, with

64
such premium as is agreed to by the
Director of Finance upon her determination that it is to the financial
advantage of the City and in the
City’s best interests and consistent
with Section 7 hereof and as set
forth in the Final Terms Certificate.
(g) Primary Offering Disclosure.
If, in the judgment of the Director
of Finance after consultation with
the Port Authority and the Original
Purchasers, a disclosure document is
appropriate relating to the initial
offering of the Bonds, the Director
of Finance, on behalf of the City
and in that officer's official capacity, is authorized to (i) cooperate
with the Port Authority and the
Original Purchasers in the preparation of, and the making of modifications, completions or changes of
or supplements to, such a disclosure
document, (ii) determine, and certify or otherwise represent when the
disclosure document is to be deemed final or is final, (iii) authorize
the use and distribution of that disclosure document and any supplements thereto in connection with the
initial offering of the Bonds, and
(iv) sign certificates, statements or
other documents in connection with
the finality, accuracy and completeness of that disclosure document.
(h) Continuing Disclosure. If and
to the extent required by Rule 15c212 (the “Rule”) promulgated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in connection with the
sale of the Bonds, the Director of
Finance shall enter into a continuing disclosure agreement on behalf
of the City, approved as to form and
correctness by the Director of Law,
among the City, the Port Authority
and the Trustee, with terms not
inconsistent with this Ordinance and
as may be approved by the Director
of Finance signing that agreement
on behalf of the City, all of which
shall be conclusively evidenced by
that signing. In each such continuing disclosure agreement, the City
shall agree to provide, or cause to
be provided, to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”)
established by the SEC, in an electronic format as prescribed by the
MSRB, such as its Electronic Municipal Market Access system, the
annual financial information and
operating data and notices of specified events required by that Rule, as
more particularly described in the
continuing
disclosure
agreement.
The Director of Finance is authorized to sign and deliver each continuing disclosure agreement and
any related agreements, certificates
and other instruments, and to deliver such information, as may be necessary or appropriate to comply
with the requirements of the Rule.
The City understands and agrees
that those commitments are intended to be for the benefit of the holders from time to time of the Bonds,
including
holders
of
book-entry
interests in those Bonds.
(i) Application for Ratings. If, in
the judgment of the Director of
Finance, the filing of applications
for one or more ratings on the
Bonds by one or more nationally recognized rating agencies is necessary or desirable for marketing purposes, the Director of Finance is
authorized to cooperate with the

The City Record
Port Authority to provide information as may be required in support
of applications for that purpose. The
cost of obtaining each such rating,
except to the extent paid by the
Original Purchasers in accordance
with the Bond Purchase Agreement,
shall be paid from the proceeds of
the Bonds to the extent available
and then from other money made
available by the Port Authority.
(j) Application of Proceeds. The
proceeds from the sale of the Bonds
shall be deposited and applied as
provided in the Cooperative Agreement and the Trust Indenture and
for the purposes stated in this Ordinance.
Section 7. Sale of the Bonds; Bond
Purchase Agreement. The Director
of Finance shall sign and deliver
the Final Terms Certificate referred
to herein and a Bond Purchase
Agreement for the Bonds, on a date
she deems appropriate, setting forth
the conditions for delivery of the
Bonds that are consistent with this
Ordinance, the Cooperative Agreement and the Trust Indenture that
are determined by the Director of
Finance, which may be based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, to be customary for bonds that
are subject to appropriation issued
by governmental entities, including,
without limitation, representations
as to the accuracy and completeness
of information contained in the disclosure document described in Section 6 of this Ordinance. The Bond
Purchase Agreement shall provide
for the sale of the Bonds to the Original Purchasers selected by the Port
Authority and approved by the
Director of Finance and identified
in the Bond Purchase Agreement,
based on an evaluation of the qualifications of firms that have proposed to underwrite the Bonds.
In addition to the terms required
to be set forth in the Bond Purchase
Agreement in Section 6 hereof, the
Bond Purchase Agreement shall set
forth the following, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, consistent with this Ordinance:
(a) the Purchase Price for the
Bonds;
(b) whether any Bonds are to be
subject to redemption prior to maturity, and, if so, the earliest redemption date for those Bonds subject to
prior redemption, which shall be not
later than twelve years from the
first interest payment date, and the
applicable redemption price, which
shall be not greater than 102% of
the principal amount redeemed, except that in the event of a RZEDB
Redemption or a redemption due to
a failure to timely close the purchase of the Property the premium
may be up to an amount agreed to
by the Director of Finance that is
calculated to make the bond holders
fully whole for such prepayment;
(c) the title and series designation for the Bonds;
(d) whether any Bonds are to be
secured by or payable from a Credit Support Instrument.
It is determined that the terms of
the Bonds and the corresponding
terms of Appropriation Payments as
so determined within the limitations
set forth in this Ordinance and as
so specified and set forth in the
Bond Purchase Agreement will be in

1024

June 16, 2010
the best interest of the City and consistent with all legal requirements.
