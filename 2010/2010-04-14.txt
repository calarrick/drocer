therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

necessary to issue the Series 2010
Bonds in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed Eleven Million
Four Hundred Thousand Dollars
($11,400,000) for the purpose of providing funds to improve facilities

the Ohio Revised Code, the Charter
of the City, and this Ordinance for
the purpose stated in Section 1. The
Series 2010 Bonds shall be payable

City (“General Obligation Bonds”)
under Ordinance No. 1749-80 passed

amended by Ordinance No. 1112-83
passed by the Council on May 6,
1983,

from income tax collections remaining after depositing with the escrow
agent under the General Bond Ordinance the amount required for the
payment of debt service on the
City’s

permits the issuance of additional
bonds, subject to certain restrictions. The Series 2008 Bonds, the
Series 2010 Bonds and any additional bonds issued under the Indenture
are collectively referred to in this
Ordinance as the “Bonds.”
Section 3. Pledge and Covenant to
Maintain Income Tax. So long as
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City pledges the
municipal income taxes of the City
and grants a lien thereon, subordinate to the lien granted in the General Bond Ordinance as security for
the General Obligation Bonds of the
City issued and outstanding under
the General Bond Ordinance, to the
full extent required to meet debt
charges
payable
on
the
Bonds
issued and outstanding, from time to
time, under the Indenture. The City
covenants to appropriate annually
sufficient amounts from the income
taxes to pay all debt charges on the
General Obligation Bonds, the Bonds
outstanding under the Indenture,
any Parity Obligations and the
Unrestricted Income Tax Obligations (each as defined in the Indenture). The City further covenants
that so long as any Bonds are outstanding under the Indenture, the
City shall not repeal or amend, or
suffer the repeal of, any ordinance
for the levy or collection of its
income taxes in any manner or to
such extent that the City would not
be able to meet its obligations to the
holders of the Bonds.
Section 4. Terms of the Series 2010
Bonds. The Series 2010 Bonds shall
be issued in fully registered form.
The Series 2010 Bonds may be
issued in one or more series or subseries. The Series 2010 Bonds initially shall be delivered only in
book-entry form, shall be registered
in the name of the Depository (as
defined in the Indenture) or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository, and shall not be transferable
or exchangeable (except for transfer to another Depository or its nominee) without further action by the
City pursuant to the provisions of
the Indenture and the Second Supplement identified in Section 7. The
Series 2010 Bonds shall be designated “Public Facilities Improvement
Bonds, Series 2010” and may contain
such further designation as provided in the Certificate of Award identified below. The Series 2010 Bonds
shall be issued in one lot as fully
registered Series 2010 Bonds in
denominations of $5,000 or any
whole multiple thereof. The Series
2010 Bonds shall be numbered as
determined

of
Finance. The Series 2010 Bonds
shall be signed by the officials of
the City and in the manner set forth
in the Indenture.
The Series 2010 Bonds shall be
dated as of May 15, 2010, or such
other date specified in the certificate of award providing for the
final terms of the Series 2010 Bonds
and the sale of the Series 2010
Bonds in accordance with this Ordinance (the “Certificate of Award”).
The Series 2010 Bonds shall be
issued in the principal amount specified in the Certificate of Award,
which shall not exceed the amount
stated in Section 1. The Series 2010
Bonds shall bear interest from their

10
date until the principal amount is
paid at the rate or rates per year
specified
in
the
Certificate
of
Award, provided that the weighted
average of such rates (taking into
account the principal amount and
maturity of each Bond to which a
rate applies) shall not exceed six
percent (6%) per year if issued as
Tax-Exempt Bonds or eight percent
(8%) per year if issued as BABs.
Interest on the Series 2010 Bonds
shall be payable semi-annually on
April 1 and October 1, or such other
dates specified in the Certificate of
Award
(the
“Interest
Payment
Dates”).
The
Series
2010
Bonds
shall
mature in the years and principal
amounts set forth in the Certificate
of Award, provided that (i) each
principal payment shall occur on an
Interest Payment Date, and (ii) the
final maturity date of the Series
2010 Bonds shall be no later than
December 31, 2019. The Series 2010
Bonds stated to mature in any year
may be issued as serial Series 2010
Bonds or as term Series 2010 Bonds
payable prior to stated maturity pursuant to sinking fund redemption
(the “Term Bonds”). The Director of
Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award whether any of
the Series 2010 Bonds shall be issued
as Term Bonds, any dates (the
“Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on
which the principal amount of the
Term Bonds shall be payable pursuant to mandatory sinking fund
installments rather than at stated
maturity and the amount of principal to be paid on each Mandatory
Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements”). If any of the Series 2010
Bonds are issued as Term Series
2010 Bonds, the Term Bonds shall be
redeemed pursuant to the Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements at a redemption price
of 100 percent of the principal
amount
redeemed,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date, on
the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to be
deposited with the Trustee for payment of principal of and interest on
any
Term
Bonds
shall
include
amounts sufficient to redeem on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates the
principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided in
the Indenture and the Second Supplement).
The Series 2010 Bonds may be subject to redemption prior to maturity
by and at the option of the City, in
whole or in part on any date, in
whole multiples of $5,000, on the
redemption dates and at the redemption prices specified in the Certificate of Award, plus, in each case,
accrued interest to the redemption
date. Based on the written advice of
a financial advisor, the Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that it is in the
best interests of the City (i) for
some or all of the Series 2010 Bonds
not to be callable prior to their stated maturity, and (ii) for a premium
to be payable on the redemption of
any Series 2010 Bonds calculated in
a manner to make the bondholder
whole for the loss of the investment
or calculated as a percentage in
excess of 100% of the principal
amount redeemed.

The City Record
If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the City
may have the option to purchase
any Bond which is redeemable by
optional redemption at a purchase
price not less than the redemption
price that would be payable if that
Bond
were
called
for
optional
redemption on the date of the proposed purchase. That election shall
be exercised as provided in the Second Supplement.
If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the Series
2010 Bonds may be secured by a
Debt Service Reserve Fund to be
held by the Trustee under the Indenture. The principal amount of the
Series 2010 Bonds may include provision for funding the Debt Service
Reserve Fund from the proceeds of
the Bonds, subject to compliance
with applicable federal tax laws.

if not purchased by them, shall be

(the

Code shall apply to the Notes and

Ordinance, the Director of Finance
may determine in the Certificate of
Award, based on the written advice
of a financial advisor, that the
City’s best interests will be served
by causing all or a portion of the
Notes to be obligations bearing
interest at variable rates. If the
Director of Finance so determines,
then the Director of Finance shall
specify in the Certificate of Award
the method and procedure by which
the variable rate of interest to be
borne by the variable rate Notes
shall be determined; provided that
the variable rate Notes shall not
bear interest at a rate in excess of
twenty-five percent (25%) per year.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into agreements in
connection with the delivery of the
variable rate Notes, and from time
to time thereafter so long as the
variable rate Notes are outstanding,

The City Record

Instruments (as defined in Section
11) and others as may be determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
financial advisor, to be necessary or
appropriate

the
method of determining the variable
interest rates, permitting holders
the right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support for the payment of the variable rate Notes upon
tender for purchase or redemption,
and providing for the repayment by
the City of any amounts drawn
under the Credit Support Instrument. The Trustee shall be the
authenticating
agent,
registrar,
transfer agent and paying agent for
the Notes. The Notes shall be signed
by the officials of the City and in
the manner set forth in the Indenture. The Notes shall first be offered

that Account, shall be sold at not
less than par and accrued interest
to one or more firms that have proposed to underwrite the Notes and
have been selected by the Director
of Finance based on an evaluation
of the qualifications of those firms
(the “Note Purchaser”) in the principal amount set forth in a certificate of award to be executed by the
Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate of Award”). The proceeds of
such sale shall be paid into the
proper fund or funds set forth in the
Note Certificate of Award and used
for the purpose for which the Notes
are being issued under the provisions of this Ordinance.

disclosure document (each, an “Official Statement”) is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
sale of the Notes or the Series 2010

prepared on behalf of the City an
Official Statement with respect to
the Notes or the Series 2010 Bonds,

certify on behalf of the City that
such disclosure document is “deemed
final” by the City within the meaning of Securities and Exchange

April 14, 2010
Ord. No. 458-10.
By Council Member Sweeney (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the issuance and sale of bonds
in the maximum principal amount of
$8,900,000 for the purpose of providing funds to improve municipal
parks and recreation facilities and
authorizing related matters.
Whereas, this Council desires to
issue bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed Eight Million Nine Hundred Thousand Dollars
($8,900,000) (the “Series 2010 Bonds”)
to finance the costs of certain permanent improvements described in
Section 1; and
Whereas, the Series 2010 Bonds
shall be payable from and secured
by income tax revenues of the City
remaining after deposits required
under the General Bond Ordinance
(as defined in Section 2) are made
to the escrow agent for the City’s
general obligation bonds; and
Whereas, the American Recovery
and
Reinvestment
Act
of
2009
amended the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), to
authorize new types of obligations
that may be issued on or before January 1, 2011 by states and political
subdivisions that may provide lower
cost of financing for public improvements, including taxable governmental bonds referred to as “Build
America Bonds” and meeting the
requirements of Section 54AA of the
Code (“BABs”), of which one type is
subsidized through federal tax credits to investors in the bonds (“Tax
Credit BABs”) and the other type is
subsidized by a refundable credit
paid to the issuer of the bonds equal
to 35% of the amount of interest
paid on the bonds (“Direct Payment
BABs”); and
Whereas, the Series 2010 Bonds
may be issued in whole or in part
as Tax Credit BABs or Direct Payment BABs or as obligations to
which Section 103 of the Code
applies, the interest on which is
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes (“TaxExempt Bonds”); and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of this City, has certified to this Council that the estimated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be financed with
the proceeds of the Series 2010
Bonds is at least five (5) years, as
evidenced by the certificate contained in File No. 458-10-A; and
Whereas, the authorization for
issuance of the Series 2010 Bonds is
necessary to provide funds to pay
the costs of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1
that are urgently needed for the
benefit of the City, and as a result,
this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the
immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety, and for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary to issue the Series 2010
Bonds in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed Eight Million
Nine Hundred Thousand Dollars
($8,900,000) for the purpose of providing funds to improve municipal
parks and recreation facilities by
constructing, reconstructing, rehabili-

water toys, skating rinks, greenhouses, stages, bicycle paths, multipurpose trails, playgrounds, play
fields and courts, concourse areas,
stands, tracks, fields, dog parks,
public artwork, fountains, fitness
stations and related buildings, structures, walkways, pavement and facilities, and providing necessary water
systems, bio-filtration areas, drainage, lighting, signage, fixtures, furnishings, landscaping, equipment, safety modifications and site improvements, together with all necessary
and incidental appurtenances and
the acquisition of any required real
estate and interests in real estate
and the demolition of any existing
buildings, structures, walkways and
facilities, and to pay any capitalized
interest and all expenses incurred in
connection with the issuance of the
securities, including all financing
costs within the meaning of Section
133.01(K) of the Revised Code and
such other costs of the foregoing
permanent improvements that may
be financed with the proceeds of
securities as permitted by Section
133.15(B) of the Ohio Revised Code
and as otherwise permitted by law.
Section 2. Authority, Security and
Source of Payment. The Series 2010
Bonds shall be issued pursuant to
the Ohio Constitution, Chapter 133 of
the Ohio Revised Code, the Charter
of the City, and this Ordinance for
the purpose stated in Section 1. The
Series 2010 Bonds shall be payable
from and secured by the income tax
revenues of the City on a basis subordinate to the security given to the
General Obligation Bonds of the
City (“General Obligation Bonds”)
under Ordinance No. 1749-80 passed
by the Council on October 8, 1980, as
amended by Ordinance No. 1112-83
passed by the Council on May 6,
1983,
and
Ordinance
No.
944-96,
passed by the Council on June 10,
1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so
amended and as the same may further be amended from time to time
in accordance with its provisions, is
referred to as the “General Bond
Ordinance”). The debt service on the
Series 2010 Bonds shall be payable
from income tax collections remaining after depositing with the escrow
agent under the General Bond Ordinance the amount required for the
payment of debt service on the
City’s
General
Obligation
Bonds
issued and outstanding, from time to
time, under the General Bond Ordinance. The Series 2010 Bonds shall
be issued and secured under the
terms of the Trust Indenture dated
as of April 1, 2008 (the “Indenture”)
between the City and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the
“Trustee”). The Indenture secures
five series of Subordinate Lien
Income Tax Bonds issued on May 1,
2008 (the “Series 2008 Bonds”) and
permits the issuance of additional
bonds, subject to certain restrictions. The Series 2008 Bonds, the
Series 2010 Bonds and any additional bonds issued under the Indenture
are collectively referred to in this
Ordinance as the “Bonds.”
Section 3. Pledge and Covenant to
Maintain Income Tax. So long as
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City pledges the

489

13
municipal income taxes of the City
and grants a lien thereon, subordinate to the lien granted in the General Bond Ordinance as security for
the General Obligation Bonds of the
City issued and outstanding under
the General Bond Ordinance, to the
full extent required to meet debt
charges
payable
on
the
Bonds
issued and outstanding, from time to
time, under the Indenture. The City
covenants to appropriate annually
sufficient amounts from the income
taxes to pay all debt charges on the
General Obligation Bonds, the Bonds
outstanding under the Indenture,
any Parity Obligations and the
Unrestricted Income Tax Obligations (each as defined in the Indenture). The City further covenants
that so long as any Bonds are outstanding under the Indenture, the
City shall not repeal or amend, or
suffer the repeal of, any ordinance
for the levy or collection of its
income taxes in any manner or to
such extent that the City would not
be able to meet its obligations to the
holders of the Bonds.
Section 4. Terms of the Series 2010
Bonds. The Series 2010 Bonds shall
be issued in fully registered form.
The Series 2010 Bonds may be
issued in one or more series or subseries. The Series 2010 Bonds initially shall be delivered only in
book-entry form, shall be registered
in the name of the Depository (as
defined in the Indenture) or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository, and shall not be transferable
or exchangeable (except for transfer to another Depository or its nominee) without further action by the
City pursuant to the provisions of
the Indenture and the Second Supplement identified in Section 7. The
Series 2010 Bonds shall be designated “Parks and Recreation Facilities
Improvement Bonds, Series 2010”
and may contain such further designation as provided in the Certificate of Award identified below. The
Series 2010 Bonds shall be issued in
one lot as fully registered Series
2010 Bonds in denominations of
$5,000 or any whole multiple thereof. The Series 2010 Bonds shall be
numbered as determined by the
Director of Finance. The Series 2010
Bonds shall be signed by the officials of the City and in the manner
set forth in the Indenture.
The Series 2010 Bonds shall be
dated as of May 15, 2010, or such
other date specified in the certificate of award providing for the
final terms of the Series 2010 Bonds
and the sale of the Series 2010
Bonds in accordance with this Ordinance (the “Certificate of Award”).
The Series 2010 Bonds shall be
issued in the principal amount specified in the Certificate of Award,
which shall not exceed the amount
stated in Section 1. The Series 2010
Bonds shall bear interest from their
date until the principal amount is
paid at the rate or rates per year
specified
in
the
Certificate
of
Award, provided that the weighted
average of such rates (taking into
account the principal amount and
maturity of each Bond to which a
rate applies) shall not exceed six
percent (6%) per year if issued as
Tax-Exempt Bonds or eight percent
(8%) per year if issued as BABs.
Interest on the Series 2010 Bonds
shall be payable semi-annually on

14
April 1 and October 1, or such other
dates specified in the Certificate of
Award
(the
“Interest
Payment
Dates”).
The
Series
2010
Bonds
shall
mature in the years and principal
amounts set forth in the Certificate
of Award, provided that (i) each
principal payment shall occur on an
Interest Payment Date, and (ii) the
final maturity date of the Series
2010 Bonds shall be no later than
December 31, 2031. The Series 2010
Bonds stated to mature in any year
may be issued as serial Series 2010
Bonds or as term Series 2010 Bonds
payable prior to stated maturity pursuant to sinking fund redemption
(the “Term Bonds”). The Director of
Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award whether any of
the Series 2010 Bonds shall be issued
as Term Bonds, any dates (the
“Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on
which the principal amount of the
Term Bonds shall be payable pursuant to mandatory sinking fund
installments rather than at stated
maturity and the amount of principal to be paid on each Mandatory
Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements”). If any of the Series 2010
Bonds are issued as Term Series
2010 Bonds, the Term Bonds shall be
redeemed pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements at a redemption price of
100 percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates. The aggregate of the moneys to be deposited
with the Trustee for payment of
principal of and interest on any
Term Bonds shall include amounts
sufficient to redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal
amount of Term Bonds payable on
those dates pursuant to the Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements (less the amount of
any credit as provided in the Indenture and the Second Supplement).
The Series 2010 Bonds may be subject to redemption prior to maturity
by and at the option of the City, in
whole or in part on any date, in
whole multiples of $5,000, on the
redemption dates and at the redemption prices specified in the Certificate of Award, plus, in each case,
accrued interest to the redemption
date. Based on the written advice of
a financial advisor, the Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that it is in the
best interests of the City (i) for
some or all of the Series 2010 Bonds
not to be callable prior to their stated maturity, and (ii) for a premium
to be payable on the redemption of
any Series 2010 Bonds calculated in
a manner to make the bondholder
whole for the loss of the investment
or calculated as a percentage in
excess of 100% of the principal
amount redeemed.
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the City may
have the option to purchase any Bond
which is redeemable by optional redemption at a purchase price not less
than the redemption price that would
be payable if that Bond were called
for optional redemption on the date of
the proposed purchase. That election
shall be exercised as provided in the
Second Supplement.
If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the Series

The City Record
2010 Bonds may be secured by a
Debt Service Reserve Fund to be
held by the Trustee under the Indenture. The principal amount of the
Series 2010 Bonds may include provision for funding the Debt Service
Reserve Fund from the proceeds of
the Bonds, subject to compliance
with applicable federal tax laws.
Section 5. Sale of Series 2010
Bonds. The Series 2010 Bonds shall
first be offered for purchase to the
Trustees of the Sinking Fund and,
if not purchased by them, shall be
offered to the Treasury Investment
Account for purchase and, if not purchased for that Account, shall be
sold to one or more firms that have
proposed to underwrite the Series
2010 Bonds and have been selected
by the Director of Finance based on
an evaluation of the qualifications
of those firms (collectively, the
“Original Purchaser”).

awarded to the Original Purchaser
in the Certificate of Award which
shall specify the final terms of the
Series 2010 Bonds in accordance

Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Series 2010 Bonds, including: the

Bonds, the purchase price (which
shall be not less than 97% of the
principal amount plus accrued interest to their date of delivery), interest rate or rates, the amounts and
years in which principal installments are payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements), terms and conditions under
which any Series 2010 Bonds may be
redeemed prior to maturity at the
option of the City, the Interest Payment Dates and the date of the

Director of Finance is authorized to
sign and deliver on behalf of the
City a bond purchase agreement

Law, setting forth the terms and
conditions on which the City agrees
to sell the Series 2010 Bonds and the
Original Purchaser agrees to buy
the Series 2010 Bonds on terms consistent with this Ordinance and the
Indenture, that are not substantially adverse to the City and that are
approved by the Director of Finance
on behalf of the City, all of which
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Bond Purchase
Agreement or amendments to the
Bond Purchase Agreement by the
Director of Finance. It is determined
that the terms of the Series 2010
Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance
and as may be provided in or pursuant to the Certificate of Award,
the Indenture and the Second Supplement, are in the best interest of
the City and in compliance with all
legal requirements.

Director of Finance as not substantially adverse to the City. The Second Supplement shall be approved
as to form and correctness by the
Director of Law. The determination
by the Director of Finance that the

Section 8. Bond Anticipation Notes.
For the purpose of raising money in
anticipation of the issuance of the
Series 2010 Bonds for the purpose
set forth in Section 1, notes of the
City may be issued in an aggregate
principal amount not to exceed
Eight Million Nine Hundred Thousand
Dollars
($8,900,000)
(the
“Notes”) upon the direction of the
Director of Finance to be set forth
in a certificate providing for the
final terms of the Notes and the sale
of the Notes and signed by the
Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate of Award”). The Notes, if
sold as fixed rate obligations, shall
bear interest at such rate, not
exceeding three percent (3%) per
year, and shall be payable on the
date or dates, as shall be determined
by the Director of Finance of the
City in the Note Certificate of
Award; shall be dated their date of
issuance; shall mature on the date
set forth in the Note Certificate of
Award; shall be subject to redemption by the City at any time prior
to maturity without penalty, unless
the Director of Finance, based on
the advice of a financial advisor,
determines that it is in the best
interest of the City in order to
enhance the marketability of the
Notes, that the Notes not be redeemable prior to maturity or that
a premium be paid on their prior
redemption;
shall
be
designated
“Parks and Recreation Facilities
Improvement
Bond
Anticipation
Notes” or as otherwise provided in
the Note Certificate of Award; shall
be issued in such numbers and
denominations as may be requested
by the Note Purchaser (hereinafter
defined); and shall be issued in
fully registered form (which may be
in a book entry only system). The
provisions of Sections 9.98 to 9.983 of
the Revised Code shall apply to the
Notes and pursuant to that authority and this Ordinance, the Director
of Finance may determine in the
Certificate of Award, based on the
written advice of a financial advisor, that the City’s best interests
will be served by causing all or a
portion of the Notes to be obligations bearing interest at variable
rates. If the Director of Finance so
determines, then the Director of
Finance shall specify in the Certificate of Award the method and procedure by which the variable rate of
interest to be borne by the variable
rate Notes shall be determined; provided that the variable rate Notes
shall not bear interest at a rate in
excess of twenty-five percent (25%)
per year. The Director of Finance is
authorized to enter into agreements
in connection with the delivery of
the variable rate Notes, and from
time to time thereafter so long as
the variable rate Notes are outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support Instruments (as defined in
Section 11) and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a financial advisor, to be
necessary or appropriate to provide
for the method of determining the
variable interest rates, permitting
holders the right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support

The City Record
for the payment of the variable rate
Notes upon tender for purchase or
redemption, and providing for the
repayment by the City of any
amounts drawn under the Credit
Support Instrument. The Trustee
shall be the authenticating agent,
registrar, transfer agent and paying
agent for the Notes. The Notes shall
be signed by the officials of the City
and in the manner set forth in the
Indenture. The Notes shall first be
offered for purchase to the Trustees
of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by them, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account
for purchase and, if not purchased
for that Account, shall be sold at not
less than par and accrued interest
to one or more firms that have proposed to underwrite the Notes and
have been selected by the Director
of Finance based on an evaluation
of the qualifications of those firms
(the “Note Purchaser”) in the principal amount set forth in a certificate of award to be executed by the
Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate of Award”). The proceeds of
such sale shall be paid into the
proper fund or funds set forth in the
Note Certificate of Award and used
for the purpose for which the Notes
are being issued under the provisions of this Ordinance.
Section 9. Official Statement; Continuing Disclosure. If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a
disclosure document (each, an “Official Statement”) is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
sale of the Notes or the Series 2010
Bonds, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare or cause to be
prepared on behalf of the City an
Official Statement with respect to
the Notes or the Series 2010 Bonds,
as the case may be, and any necessary supplements and to authorize
the use and distribution of each

Director of Finance is authorized to
sign and deliver on behalf of the
City and in her official capacity
such certificates in connection with
the accuracy of each Official Statement and any supplements as may,
in her judgment, be necessary or
appropriate. The Director of Finance

certify on behalf of the City that
such disclosure document is “deemed
final” by the City within the meaning of Securities and Exchange
Commission Rule 15c2-12 the “SEC
Rule.” The Director of Finance is

for the production and distribution
of preliminary and final Official
Statements, including by printed

beneficial owners from time to time
of the Notes or the Series 2010
Bonds, the City agrees, in accordance with, and as the only obligated person with respect to the
Notes and the Series 2010 Bonds
under the SEC Rule, to provide or

therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

the Ohio Revised Code, the Charter
of the City, and this Ordinance for
the purpose stated in Section 1. The
Series 2010 Bonds shall be payable
from and secured by the income tax
revenues of the City on a basis subordinate to the security given to the
General Obligation Bonds of the
City (“General Obligation Bonds”)
under Ordinance No. 1749-80 passed

amended by Ordinance No. 1112-83
passed by the Council on May 6,
1983,

be issued and secured under the
terms of the Trust Indenture dated
as of April 1, 2008 (the “Indenture”)
between the City and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the
“Trustee”). The Indenture secures
five series of Subordinate Lien
Income Tax Bonds issued on May 1,
2008 (the “Series 2008 Bonds”) and
permits the issuance of additional
bonds, subject to certain restrictions. The Series 2008 Bonds, the
Series 2010 Bonds and any additional bonds issued under the Indenture
are collectively referred to in this
Ordinance as the “Bonds.”
Section 3. Pledge and Covenant to
Maintain Income Tax. So long as
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City pledges the
municipal income taxes of the City
and grants a lien thereon, subordinate to the lien granted in the General Bond Ordinance as security for
the General Obligation Bonds of the
City issued and outstanding under
the General Bond Ordinance, to the
full extent required to meet debt
charges
payable
on
the
Bonds
issued and outstanding, from time to
time, under the Indenture. The City
covenants to appropriate annually
sufficient amounts from the income
taxes to pay all debt charges on the
General Obligation Bonds, the Bonds
outstanding under the Indenture,
any Parity Obligations and the
Unrestricted Income Tax Obligations (each as defined in the Indenture). The City further covenants
that so long as any Bonds are outstanding under the Indenture, the
City shall not repeal or amend, or
suffer the repeal of, any ordinance
for the levy or collection of its
income taxes in any manner or to
such extent that the City would not
be able to meet its obligations to the
holders of the Bonds.
Section 4. Terms of the Series 2010
Bonds. The Series 2010 Bonds shall
be issued in fully registered form.
The Series 2010 Bonds may be issued
in one or more series or subseries.
The Series 2010 Bonds initially shall

Depository (as defined in the Indenture) or its nominee, as registered
owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository, and shall not
be transferable or exchangeable (except for transfer to another Depository or its nominee) without further
action by the City pursuant to the
provisions of the Indenture and the
Second Supplement identified in Section 7. The Series 2010 Bonds shall be
designated “Bridges and Roadways
Improvement Bonds, Series 2010” and
may contain such further designation
as provided in the Certificate of
Award identified below. The Series
2010 Bonds shall be issued in one lot
as fully registered Series 2010 Bonds
in denominations of $5,000 or any
whole multiple thereof. The Series
2010 Bonds shall be numbered as determined by the Director of Finance.
The Series 2010 Bonds shall be signed
by the officials of the City and in the
manner set forth in the Indenture.
The Series 2010 Bonds shall be

other date specified in the certificate of award providing for the
final terms of the Series 2010 Bonds
and the sale of the Series 2010
Bonds in accordance with this Ordi-

18
nance (the “Certificate of Award”).
The Series 2010 Bonds shall be
issued in the principal amount specified in the Certificate of Award,
which shall not exceed the amount
stated in Section 1. The Series 2010
Bonds shall bear interest from their
date until the principal amount is
paid at the rate or rates per year
specified
in
the
Certificate
of
Award, provided that the weighted
average of such rates (taking into
account the principal amount and
maturity of each Bond to which a
rate applies) shall not exceed six
percent (6%) per year if issued as
Tax-Exempt Bonds or eight percent
(8%) per year if issued as BABs or
RZED Bonds. Interest on the Series
2010 Bonds shall be payable semiannually on April 1 and October 1,
or such other dates specified in the
Certificate of Award (the “Interest
Payment Dates”).
The
Series
2010
Bonds
shall
mature in the years and principal
amounts set forth in the Certificate
of Award, provided that (i) each
principal payment shall occur on an
Interest Payment Date, and (ii) the
final maturity date of the Series
2010 Bonds shall be no later than
December 31, 2027. The Series 2010
Bonds stated to mature in any year
may be issued as serial Series 2010
Bonds or as term Series 2010 Bonds
payable prior to stated maturity pursuant to sinking fund redemption
(the “Term Bonds”). The Director of
Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award whether any of
the Series 2010 Bonds shall be issued
as Term Bonds, any dates (the
“Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on
which the principal amount of the
Term Bonds shall be payable pursuant to mandatory sinking fund
installments rather than at stated
maturity and the amount of principal to be paid on each Mandatory
Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements”). If any of the Series 2010
Bonds are issued as Term Series
2010 Bonds, the Term Bonds shall be
redeemed pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements at a redemption price of
100 percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates. The aggregate of the moneys to be deposited
with the Trustee for payment of
principal of and interest on any
Term Bonds shall include amounts
sufficient to redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal
amount of Term Bonds payable on
those dates pursuant to the Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements (less the amount of
any credit as provided in the Indenture and the Second Supplement).

Section 8. Bond Anticipation Notes.
For the purpose of raising money in
anticipation of the issuance of the
Series 2010 Bonds for the purpose set

may be issued in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed Eight Million Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars ($8,700,000) (the “Notes”) upon
the direction of the Director of
Finance to be set forth in a certificate providing for the final terms of
the Notes and the sale of the Notes
and
signed
by
the
Director
of
Finance (the “Note Certificate of
Award”). The Notes, if sold as fixed
rate obligations, shall bear interest at
such rate, not exceeding three percent (3%) per year, and shall be
payable on the date or dates, as shall
be determined by the Director of
Finance of the City in the Note Certificate of Award; shall be dated their
date of issuance; shall mature on the
date set forth in the Note Certificate
of Award; shall be subject to redemption by the City at any time prior to
maturity without penalty, unless the
Director of Finance, based on the
advice of a financial advisor, determines that it is in the best interest
of the City in order to enhance the
marketability of the Notes, that the
Notes not be redeemable prior to
maturity or that a premium be paid
on their prior redemption; shall be
designated “Bridges and Roadways
Improvement
Bond
Anticipation
Notes” or as otherwise provided in
the Note Certificate of Award; shall

Revised Code shall apply to the Notes
and pursuant to that authority and
this
Ordinance,
the
Director
of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award, based on the written advice of a financial advisor, that
the City’s best interests will be
served by causing all or a portion of
the Notes to be obligations bearing
interest at variable rates. If the
Director of Finance so determines,
then the Director of Finance shall
specify in the Certificate of Award
the method and procedure by which
the variable rate of interest to be
borne by the variable rate Notes shall
be determined; provided that the variable rate Notes shall not bear interest at a rate in excess of twenty-five
percent (25%) per year. The Director
of Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements in connection with the
delivery of the variable rate Notes,

The City Record
and from time to time thereafter so
long as the variable rate Notes are
outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support Instruments (as defined in
Section 11) and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance, based on the written advice
of a financial advisor, to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the
method of determining the variable
interest rates, permitting holders the
right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support for the payment
of the variable rate Notes upon tender for purchase or redemption, and
providing for the repayment by the
City of any amounts drawn under the
Credit
Support
Instrument.
The
Trustee shall be the authenticating
agent, registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Notes. The
Notes shall be signed by the officials
of the City and in the manner set
forth in the Indenture. The Notes
shall first be offered for purchase to

and, if not purchased by them, shall
be offered to the Treasury Investment Account for purchase and, if not
purchased for that Account, shall be
sold at not less than par and accrued
interest to one or more firms that
have proposed to underwrite the
Notes and have been selected by the
Director of Finance based on an evaluation of the qualifications of those
firms (the “Note Purchaser”) in the
principal amount set forth in a certificate of award to be executed by
the Director of Finance (the “Note
Certificate of Award”). The proceeds
of such sale shall be paid into the
proper fund or funds set forth in the
Note Certificate of Award and used
for the purpose for which the Notes
are being issued under the provisions
of this Ordinance.
Section 9. Official Statement; Continuing Disclosure. If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a
disclosure document (each, an “Official Statement”) is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
sale of the Notes or the Series 2010

and to sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the
continuing
disclosure

Purpose
The purpose of this document is to
identify the policy that will govern
the investment activities of the
Treasurer’s Office of the City of
Cleveland. This policy has been
adopted by, and, if necessary, will
be revised on an annual basis by,
the Director of Finance.
This policy is designed to ensure
prudent
management
of
public
funds, conformance to Chapter 178
of the Codified Ordinances of the
City of Cleveland, availability of
operating and capital funds when
needed, and an investment return
competitive with comparable funds
and financial market indices.
All participants in the investment
process shall act responsibly as custodians of the public trust. Investment officials shall recognize that
the investment portfolio is subject
to public review and evaluation. The
overall program shall be designed
and managed with a degree of professionalism that is worthy of the
public trust.

All Portfolios shall be managed to
accomplish the following hierarchy
of objectives:
1. Preservation of Principal – The
single most important objective
of the City of Cleveland investment program is the preservation of principal of those funds
within the Portfolio.
2. Maintenance of Liquidity – The
Portfolio shall be managed in
such a manner that assures that
funds are available as needed to
meet those immediate and/or
future operating requirements
of the City of Cleveland.
3. Maximize Return – The Portfolio shall be managed in such a
fashion as to attain a marketaverage rate of return throughout budgetary and economic
cycles, within the context and
parameters set forth by objectives 1 and 2 above.

Delegation of Authority
The Treasurer is responsible for the
prudent investment of the City of
Cleveland Treasury and shall oversee the establishment of investment
procedures consistent with this policy. Such procedures shall include
explicit delegation of authority to
persons responsible for investment
transactions. No person may engage
in an investment transaction except
as provided under the terms of this
policy and the procedures established by the Treasurer. The Treasurer shall be responsible for all
trades undertaken, and shall establish a system of controls to regulate
the activities of subordinate officials and shall exercise control over
that staff. Investment staff shall be
bonded in amounts appropriate to
levels of responsibility and portfolio
characteristics.
The City’s Internal Auditor will
review the investment program to
ensure compliance with this policy.

Standard of Prudence
Scope of the Investment Policy
This policy applies to the investment of all moneys of the City of
Cleveland under the custody and
control of the Division of Treasury.

The standard of prudence to be
applied to the investment of the City
of Cleveland shall be the industry
standard “Prudent Investor Rule”,
which states:

505

29
“Investments shall be made with
judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing which
persons of prudence, discretion
and intelligence exercise in the
management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for
investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as
well as the probable income to
be derived.”
Treasury staff acting in accordance
with this policy or any other written procedures pertaining to the
administration and management of
the City of Cleveland and who exercise the proper due diligence shall
be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or market price changes, provided that these deviations are
reported immediately to the Treasurer and that appropriate action is
taken to control and prevent any
further adverse developments.

Ethics and Conflict of Interest
Employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could
conflict with the proper execution
and management of the investment
program, or that could impair their
ability to make impartial decisions.
Further, no employee involved in
the investment process shall use the
authority to influence of office or
employment to secure anything of
value or the promise or offer of anything of value that would create an
improper influence upon the public
official or employee with respect to
that person’s duties.
Employees and investment officials
shall comply fully with the reporting and disclosure requirements of
Chapter 102 of the Ohio Revised
Code.

Authorized Instruments
The Treasurer is authorized to invest the City of Cleveland in instruments as described in section 178.12
of the Codified Ordinances as summarized and restricted below:
A. U.S. Treasury Obligations. United
States Treasury bills, notes, or
any other obligation or security
issued by the United States Treasury or any other obligation
guaranteed as to principal and
interest by the United States.
B. Federal Agency Obligations. Bonds,
notes, debentures, or other obligations or securities issued by any
federal government agency or
instrumentality.
C. State and Municipal Bonds and
Notes. Bonds and notes of the
State of Ohio, and any municipal
corporation, village, county, township, or other political subdivision
of Ohio for which the full faith
and credit of the subdivision is
pledged, so long as such subdivision has not defaulted in the payment of principal or interest on
its bonds or notes within the last
ten (10) years.

The City Record

30
D. State Pool. State of Ohio Local
Agency Investment Pool (STAR
Ohio) authorized under section
135.45 of the Ohio Revised Code.
E. Bank Deposits. Time certificates
of deposit (not to exceed one [1]
year)
or
savings
or

accounts in an eligible institution as defined in Chapter 178 of
the Codified Ordinances of the
City of Cleveland. Collateralization is required on all deposits of
City funds as stated in Chapter
178 of the Codified Ordinances of
the City of Cleveland.
F. U.S. Government money market
mutual funds. Issued by open
ended investment companies registered with the SEC, with an
average maturity of one hundred
twenty (120) days or less, which
have the objective of maintaining a constant net asset value
per share, and which invest exclusively in U.S. Treasury Obligations, Federal Agency Obligations, and repurchase agreements
secured by such obligations.
G. Repurchase Agreements. Specific
agreements shall not exceed a
term of one (1) year with any eligible depository or designated
securities broker/dealer which
has entered into a master repurchase agreement pursuant to Codified Ordinance Section 178.12, division (c), under the terms of
which agreement the City Treasurer purchases for the City, and
such eligible depository or securities broker/dealer agrees to
unconditionally repurchase, any
of the securities listed in Section
178.12, divisions (b)(1), (b)(2), or
(b)(3), of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland.

Diversification
Each Portfolio shall be structured to
diversify investments to reduce the
risk of loss resulting from over-concentration of assets in a specific
maturity, a specific issuer or a specific type of security. The maximum
percentage of the Total Average
Portfolio permitted in each security
is as follows:
A. U.S. Treasury
B. Federal Agency
(Fixed Rate)

Obligations
100% maximum
Money Market
Mutual Funds
10% maximum
Repurchase Agreements

Maximum Maturity
Maintenance of adequate liquidity to
meet the cash flow needs of the City
is essential. Accordingly, each Portfolio will be structured in a manner
that ensures sufficient cash is available to meet anticipated liquidity
needs. Selection of investment maturities must be consistent with the
cash requirements in order to avoid
the forced sale of securities prior to
maturity.
Assets will be invested in permitted
investments with a stated maturity
of no more than five (5) years from
the date of purchase unless the security is matched to a specific obligation or debt of the City. To control
the volatility of the assets, the Treasurer of the City will determine a
duration target, not to exceed three
(3) years.
Notwithstanding these limitations,
in no case will the assets in any
Portfolio be invested in securities
with
a
term
to
maturity
that
exceeds the expected disbursement
date of those funds.

Prohibited Investments and
Investment Practices
The Treasurer is expressly prohibited from the following investments
and investment practices. This is
not an exclusive list.
1. Short sales (selling a specific
security before it has been
legally purchased);
2. Investment in complex derivatives such as range notes, dual
index notes, inverse floating
rate
notes
and
deleveraged
notes, or notes linked to lagging
indices or to long-term indices;
3. Collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) and real estate
mortgage investment conduits
(REMICs);
4. Investing in any security not
specifically permitted by this
Policy.

Monitoring and Adjusting the
Portfolio
Those responsible for the day-to-day
management of the Portfolios will
routinely monitor the contents of
each Portfolio, the available markets and the relative values of competing instruments, and will adjust
each Portfolio as necessary to meet
the
investment
objectives
listed
above. It is recognized and understood that this non-speculative active management of Portfolio holdings may cause a loss on the sale
of an owned investment. It is the
policy of the City of Cleveland to
charge any such loss against the
interest income account during the
month in which the loss was realized.

506

April 14, 2010
The City of Cleveland Office of Budget and Management, on a quarterly
basis,
allocates
the
net
income/losses earned on investments
of the General Revenue Account to
various funds based on each fund’s
cash balance in proportion to the
City of Cleveland as a whole.

Internal Controls
The City Treasurer is responsible
for monitoring a system of internal
controls governing the administration and management of the Portfolio which include a review of all
investment activity, trade reconciliation, and targeting cash balances.
Such controls are designed to prevent and control losses of the City
funds arising from fraud, employee
error, misrepresentation by third
parties, unanticipated changes in
financial
markets,
or
imprudent
actions by any personnel. The internal controls address: control of collusion, separation of duties, separating transaction authority from
accounting and record keeping, custodial safekeeping, clear delegation
of authority, written confirmation of
telephone transactions, minimizing
the number of authorized investments officials and documentation
of investment transactions.

Eligible Banks and Broker/Dealers
The Director of Finance will establish and the Treasurer will maintain
a list of eligible brokers, dealers,
and banks with which investment
transactions
can
be
made,
as
described in Section 178.11 of the
Codified Ordinances of the City of
Cleveland. Qualified firms will be
limited to “primary” dealers and
other dealers that qualify under
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15C3-1 (uniform net capital rule) that are registered with
the Ohio Department of Commerce
to do business in the State of Ohio.
All financial institutions and broker
dealers must provide the following
information, on an annual basis:
1. Sworn statement pledging to
adhere to “Capital Adequacy
Standards”
2. Annual financial statements for
the most recent year showing
the amount of liquid capital
3. A written statement from a certified public accountant certifying no weakness in the internal
systems of controls of the dealer or broker were found
4. A completed “Broker/Dealer Request for Information” and all
documentation required by Section 178.12 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland.
Preference will be given to banks
and broker/dealers who are headquartered or maintain a presence in
the City of Cleveland.
Financial
institutions
and
broker/dealers will be required to comply with this policy and to pledge
to offer for sale only appropriate
securities.

April 14, 2010
Competitive Selection of Investment
Instruments
It will be the policy of the Treasurer to transact all security purchases/sales only with approved
financial institutions through a competitive process. The City shall
accept the offer which (a) has the
highest rate of return within the
maturity required; and (b) optimizes
the investment objective of the overall portfolio. When selling a security, the Treasurer will select the bid
that generates the highest sale
price.
Primary fixed price Federal Agency
offerings may be purchased from
the list of qualified broker/dealers
without competitive solicitation.
In making investment decisions, all
other things being equal and subject
to compliance with any applicable
Internal Revenue Code requirements
for bond proceeds, investment in corporations and financial institutions
doing business in the City of Cleveland will be given preference over
other investment options.

The City Record
each depository from the preceding
business day. Within fifteen (15)
business days of the end of the
month, the City Treasurer shall submit an investment report to the
Director of Finance. This report
shall include: (i.) a listing of the
existing
portfolios
in
terms
of
investment securities, book value,
maturity date, return, market value,
and other features deemed relevant,
(ii.) a listing of all transactions executed during the month. The City
Treasurer will also prepare annual
reports in sufficient detail to provide full disclosure of all investment
activities to the Director of Finance.

Conflict of Law
In the event that any portion of this
policy is in conflict with any City,
State, or Federal law, that law will
prevail.

Investment Policy Effective Date
This policy is adopted this 9th day
of April 2009 and shall remain in
effect until rescinded or amended by
the Director of Finance.

Safekeeping and Custody
All investment securities purchased
by the Treasurer or held as collateral on deposits or investments shall
be held in third-party safekeeping at
the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland or at a secured and insured
depository as required by Chapter
178 of the City of Cleveland Codified
Ordinance and Section 113.05 of the
Ohio Revised Code.
All securities in the Portfolio shall
be held in the name of the Treasurer of the City of Cleveland and
will be free and clear of any lien.
Further, all investment transactions
will be conducted on a delivery-vs.payment basis. The depository shall
issue a safekeeping receipt to the
Treasurer listing the specific instrument, rate, maturity and other
pertinent information.
Appropriate Treasury officials and
representatives of the depository
responsible for, or in any manner
involved with, the safekeeping and
custody process of the City of Cleveland shall be bonded in such a fashion as to protect the City from losses from malfeasance and misfeasance.

Performance Standards
The investment portfolios shall be
designed and managed with the
objective of obtaining a market rate
of return throughout budgetary and
economic cycles, commensurate with
the investment risk constraints and
cash flows needs of the City.

Reporting
The City Treasury shall maintain
accurate,
complete,
and
timely
records of all investment activities.
Each business day, the Treasurer
shall provide the Commissioner of
Accounts and the City Controller a
sworn statement (Daily Treasurer’s
Report) showing the total amount
deposited in and withdrawn from
