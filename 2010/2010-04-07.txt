ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 415-10.
By Council Members Kelley, Sweeney,
Cleveland,
Polensek,
Westbrook, Brancatelli, Mitchell, Pruitt,
Keane, Brady and J. Johnson.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio General Assembly to enact
telecommunications regulatory reform
legislation with an appropriate balance of regulatory reform, incentives for investment and job preservation and creation, a safety net for
those in need, and consumer protection.
Whereas, currently there is telecommunications regulatory reform
legislation pending before the Ohio
General Assembly, known as House
Bill 276 and Senate Bill 162, that
would reform the regulation of telecommunications services in Ohio,

create incentives for investment and
job preservation and creation by the
telecommunications industry, maintain a safety net for those in need,
and provide for the protection of
consumers
of
telecommunications
services; and
Whereas, this proposed legislation
will update Ohio law in order to
position the state, the City, and all
Ohioans to benefit from new investment, jobs, and an improved telecommunications
infrastructure
in
order to effectively compete in the
global economy; and
Whereas, this proposed legislation
will preserve important consumer
protections and a safety net for
those in need, including Lifeline service, while eliminating burdensome
and antiquated requirements that
have applied to only one segment of
the
telecommunications
industry;
and
Whereas, this proposed legislation
is likely to be acted upon soon by
the Ohio General Assembly, after
extensive hearings and debate; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio General Assembly to enact
telecommunications regulatory reform
legislation with an appropriate balance of regulatory reform, incentives for investment and job preservation and creation, a safety net for
those in need, and consumer protection.
Section 2. That upon passage of
House Bill 276 or Senate Bill 162,
this Council urges Governor Ted
Strickland to sign the legislation
into law at the earliest possible time
so that Ohio can benefit from jobs,
investment and improved telecommunications infrastructure.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Governor Ted Strickland, Lt. Governor
Lee Fisher, and the Cleveland delegation in the Ohio General Assembly.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted March 29, 2010.
Effective March 31, 2010.

Res. No. 417-10.
By Council Members J. Johnson,
Westbrook, Miller and Mitchell.
An emergency resolution commending President Barack Obama
and the United States Congress for
passing historic legislation to improve the nation’s Health Care system, and urging the State of Ohio’s
Governor Ted Strickland and the
Ohio legislature to support its implementation within our state.

458

April 7, 2010
Whereas, this Council wants to
thank President Barack Obama and
the U.S. Congress for their commitment to pass a national Health Care
law that will have a positive impact
within the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, among the immediate
benefits of the new law is that
Cleveland residents who are uninsured will have the opportunity to
have health insurance and many
will no longer fear being dropped by
their health insurance companies
because of an illness or be prevented from having health insurance
because of a pre-existing health condition; and
Whereas, the new national Health
Care law will expand coverage to
an additional 32 million Americans;
and
Whereas, the uninsured will receive immediate access to coverage
through high-risk pools if they have
pre-existing conditions; and
Whereas, children can remain on
their parents’ health insurance plans
until they are 26 years of age; and
Whereas, small businesses can receive tax credits to purchase insurance for employees; and
Whereas, health insurance companies will be prohibited from refusing to sell policies and will be limited in their ability to set prices on
the basis of health status; and
Whereas, the prescription-drug coverage gap, known as the “doughnut
hole” will eventually be eliminated;
and
Whereas, this Council acknowledges the courage and hard work of
President Obama, the Congressional
Delegation of Northeast Ohio, and
other members of the U.S. Congress
in their support of the new national
health care legislation during a difficult, and at times, hostile pre-vote
period of debate; their leadership
allowed the law to be passed; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council commends President Barack Obama and
the United States Congress for passing historic legislation to improve
the nation’s Health Care system,
and urging the State of Ohio’s Governor Ted Strickland and the Ohio
legislature to support its implementation within our state.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to President
Barack Obama, the Congressional
Delegation from Northeast Ohio,
Governor Ted Strickland and the
Ohio legislature.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Ord. No. 1660-A-09 (As a substitute
for Ord. No. 1660-09).
By Mayor Jackson and Council
Members Cimperman, Zone, Mitchell,
Westbrook, Brady, Pruitt, Brancatelli, Cummins and Polensek.
An ordinance to supplement the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, by enacting new Sections
187A.01 to 187A.07 and 187A.99, relating to the Local Producer, LocalFood Purchaser, and Sustainable
Business Preference Code.
Whereas,
large
purchasers
of
goods and materials such as the
City of Cleveland can strengthen the
regional economy by procuring a
greater percentage of their purchases from local businesses; and
Whereas, purchasing local products will reduce the City of Cleveland’s carbon footprint by reducing
the distance that goods travel from
factories and farms to the city,
thereby decreasing the amount of
harmful emissions; and
Whereas, the Greater Cleveland
region has a vibrant manufacturing,
industrial, and food production history and we are continuing to
strengthen our local economy by
supporting local producers; and
Whereas, purchasing local goods
and materials will increase the City
of
Cleveland’s
self-reliance
and
resiliency, as well as acting as a
model for local purchasing policies
that support both local and regional business development and economic growth; and
Whereas, encouraging local businesses to follow sustainable practices will expedite their participation in high-growth sectors of the
economy such as renewable energy,
recycling, green building, zero waste
and other sustainable businesses,
which in turn will encourage more
graduates to remain in the Greater
Cleveland region and attract new
talent to the region; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
supplemented by enacting new Sections 187A.01 to 187A.07 and 187A.99,
to read as follows:
CHAPTER 187A
LOCAL PRODUCER, LOCAL-FOOD
PURCHASER, AND SUSTAINABLE
BUSINESS PREFERENCE CODE
Section 187A.01 Definitions of Terms
As used in this Chapter, the following words, phrases, and terms
shall be defined as set forth below:
(a) “Bidder” means a Person offering or proposing to contract with
the City respectively in response to
an invitation to bid or to a request
for proposals.
(b) “Bid Discount” means the application of a percentage discount to
the total amount of a bid submitted
by a Bidder for a Contract solely for
the purpose of bid comparisons
when determining the lowest and
best bid, or lowest responsible bid.
The use of a Bid Discount for Bid
Comparison does not alter the total
amount of the bid submitted by a
Bidder or the Contract executed
based on a bid.
