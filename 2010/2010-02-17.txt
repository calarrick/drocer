NO MEETING

THE CALENDAR
The following measures will be on
their final passage at the next meeting:
Ord. No. 1784-09.
By Council Members Kelley, Cimperman and Sweeney (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Port Control to
enter into one or more Leases By
Way of Concession for the use of certain City-owned property known as
Ninth Street Lots Nos. 9 and 10 for the
use, privilege, permit, and license to
operate special event parking and to
collect fees in connection with special
event parking.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That, notwithstanding
Section 183.03 or any other provision
of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, to the contrary, the
Director of Port Control is authorized to enter one or more Leases
By Way of Concession on the basis
of competitive proposals for the use,
privilege, permit, and license to
operate special event parking and to
collect fees in connection with special event parking at certain Cityowned property known as Ninth
Street Lots Nos. 9 and 10. The Leases by Way of Concession shall be
with the highest and best bidder as

181

determined and approved by the
Board of Control after competitive
bidding and advertising as provided
by Section 108 of the Charter of the
City of Cleveland. The Leases By
Way of Concession shall not exceed
a term of one year, unless a Master
Parking Plan is implemented before
the one-year term has expired. If a
Master Parking Plan is implemented, the leases that are the subject
of this ordinance shall be a part of
that Master Parking Plan along
with all other eligible agreements
and properties.
Section 2. That the Lease or Leases by Way of Concession shall
include provisions stating that the
Lessee or Lessees shall pay the City
one hundred percent of the parking
revenues in excess of Three Hundred Seventy Dollars ($370.00) per
special event, plus any applicable
sales and parking tax due any taxing authorities in connection with
such parking revenues. The Lease
or Leases by Way of Concession
shall not be construed as the conveyance of any right, title or interest in public property but merely as
the granting of the privilege to use
the
property
for
the
purposes
described in the Lease or Leases by
Way of Concession.
Section 3. That the Lease or Leases By Way of Concession shall be
prepared by the Director of Law.
Section 4. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Ord. No. 1785-09.
By Council Members Kelley, Cimperman and Sweeney (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Port Control to
