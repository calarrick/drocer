Section 2. That existing Sections

Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
as amended by Ordinance No. 239302, passed February 3, 2003 and Ordinance No. 1199-2000, passed October
30, 2000, are repealed.
Section 3. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
supplemented by enacting new Sections 551.041 and 551.991 to read as
follows:
Section 551.041 Infractions Related
to Automated Waste Collection and
Curbside Recycling
Findings.
It is essential to the success of the
automated waste collection and curbside recycling program described in
division (b) that waste set out for collection is placed in the correct container for type of waste involved.
If the correct container is not
used, it increases both the labor and
disposal costs for the waste. If recyclable materials become contaminated by regular household waste, then
they must be disposed of as regular
solid waste, which is more costly
than treating them as recyclables. If
the regular household waste container is used for the disposal of
recyclable materials, then the economic and environmental benefits of
recycling are not realized.
To achieve the goals of the program it is necessary that all citizens
use the container intended for disposal of the type of waste involved
and avoid all mixing of recyclable
materials and regular household
waste.
(a) No person shall do any of the
following at any parcel included in
the automated waste collection and
curbside recycling program described
in division (b):
(1) Set out for collection the container
designated
for
recyclable
materials if its contents exceed 2%
regular household waste by volume.
(2) Set out for collection the container designated for regular household waste if its contents exceed
10% recyclable materials by volume.
(3) Set out for collection any regular household waste in any container or bag other than the container designated for regular household waste for use in the automated waste collection program.
It is not a violation of this division to set out for collection at any
parcel included in the program
described in division (b) special
waste set out in accordance with
Section 551.05 or recyclable materials placed out in addition to recyclable materials contained in the
container designated for recyclable
materials, provided that they are
prepared for disposal in accordance
with this chapter and any rules or
regulations issued under it.
Nothing in this section shall be
construed as abrogating or limiting
any other section of these Codified
Ordinances including without limitation the prohibition on setting out
an excessively large quantity of
waste for collection as proscribed by
Section 551.111.
(b) The offenses established in
division (a) pertain to any parcel
that is included in the automated
waste collection and curbside recycling program in which the waste is
collected by means of a truck
equipped with mechanical arms. The

The City Record
City will distribute two containers
to each household in the program,
one designated for regular household waste, and the other designated for recyclable materials.
(c) As use in this section:
(1) “Recyclable materials” means
glass, metal cans, plastic bottles
mixed paper, and cardboard that are
prepared for collection in accordance with this chapter and the
rules and regulations issued under
it.
(2) “Regular household waste”
means waste generated in ordinary
residential
uses
excluding
recyclable materials, hazardous waste
and any waste excluded from being
placed out for curbside collection by
law, rule or regulation.
Section 551.991 Civil Infractions
(a)
Civil
enforcement
system
established. The City of Cleveland
hereby adopts a civil enforcement
system for the infractions established by this section. This civil
enforcement system imposes monetary liability on the responsible parties as defined in division (m).

(3) Section 551.111, division (a),
relating to excessively large quantity of waste for collection.
(4) Section 551.041, division (b),
relating to automated waste collection and recycling infractions.
Any person who violates any of
the foregoing prohibitions has committed an infraction for which liability is imposed by division (b)
upon the responsible parties as
defined in division (m).
(b) Liability imposed. Any person
who commits an infraction under
division (a), the parcel owner, and
any other person lawfully entitled to

liable to the City of Cleveland in the
amounts established in divisions (f)
and (g).
(c) Noncriminal offense; no conviction. The infractions established
by this section are noncriminal.
The imposition of liability upon the
responsible parties under this section shall not be deemed a conviction for any purpose.
(d) Other costs and penalties not
abrogated. Nothing in this section
shall be construed as altering or limiting the effects of any other section
of these Codified Ordinances, the
criminal penalties imposed by any
such other section, or the ability of
a law enforcement officer to enforce
those sections.
(e) Tickets – service; contents. If a

or the date of personal service, whichever is applicable, shall be deemed
to be the date of issuance of the ticket.
The ticket shall identify the occupant of the parcel, its owner, and
any other person lawfully entitled to
possession of the parcel as respondents. The ticket shall state that the
respondents may be responsible parties for the commission of a civil
infraction under this section. If the
mailing is unreturned, then it shall
establish that the respondents were
given actual or constructive notice
of the imposition of liability under
this section.
The
ticket
shall
inform
the
respondents of the procedure to file
an appeal and the time frame for filing it. It shall include a statement
to inform any responsible person as
defined in division (m) that if that
person fails to challenge the ticket,
then a default finding of civil liability may be imposed upon that person for the costs established in divisions (f) and (g).
The ticket may be in any format
that includes all of the elements
required by this section.
(f) Penalties established. The costs
imposed by this section upon the
responsible parties for the commission of an infraction contrary to division (a) shall be assessed in accordance with the following schedule:

in the manner described in the ticket. The appeal shall be taken not
later than 20 days from the date of

year, and such Appropriation Payments shall be specified in an exhibit to the Cooperative Agreement;
provided, however, that the City’s
payment of Appropriation Payments
is subject to appropriation as provided in the Cooperative Agreement

to be paid to the City (“RZEDB
Redemption”), in each case, with

among the City, the Port Authority
and the Trustee, with terms not

The City Record
for one or more ratings on the

of applications for that purpose. The
cost of obtaining each such rating,
except to the extent paid by the
Original Purchasers in accordance
with the Bond Purchase Agreement,
shall be paid from the proceeds of
the Bonds to the extent available
and then from other money made
available by the Port Authority.

of information contained in the disclosure document described in Section 6 of this Ordinance. The Bond
Purchase Agreement shall provide
for the sale of the Bonds to the Original Purchasers selected by the Port
Authority and approved by the
Director of Finance and identified

based on an evaluation of the qualifications of firms that have proposed to underwrite the Bonds.
In addition to the terms required

forth the following, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, consistent with this Ordinance:

applicable redemption price, which
shall be not greater than 102% of
the principal amount redeemed, except that in the event of a RZEDB
Redemption or a redemption due to
a failure to timely close the purchase of the Property the premium
may be up to an amount agreed to
by the Director of Finance that is
calculated to make the bond holders
fully whole for such prepayment;
(c) the title and series designation for the Bonds;

An emergency resolution urging
that
the
Cleveland
Metropolitan
School District and the CMSD Board
develop and make public a safety
and security plan for the school
buildings that are already closed
and those that soon will be closed,
which plan shall include the creation of a fund to be used to reimburse the City of Cleveland for any
demolition, boarding up, repairing
or otherwise securing of the properties that may be performed by the
City.
Whereas, the Cleveland Metropolitan School District (CMSD) intends
to demolish 25 buildings, including
13 of 16 schools scheduled to close
in June; and
Whereas, the demolition apparently includes buildings already closed
by CMSD and left vacant for years;
and
Whereas, although CMSD says it
will demolish these 25 buildings,
CMSD has not given a time frame
when such demolitions will be accomplished and some schools that
have been closed previously are still
sitting vacant; and
Whereas, vacant school buildings
have been and will continue to be a
huge maintenance and security problem for residents of those neighborhoods and for the City as a whole;
and
Whereas, CMSD has not provided
adequate maintenance or security for
school buildings previously closed;
and
Whereas, unless CMSD provides
security for and adequately maintains the closed school buildings
prior to demolition, then the City of
Cleveland will be obligated to do so,
for the safety and security of its
neighborhoods and citizens living
there; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
should be reimbursed for all services performed in keeping the

828

May 26, 2010
vacant school buildings safe and
secure; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,

the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges that the Cleveland Metropolitan

An emergency resolution calling
upon United States Congress to
pass Comprehensive Immigration
Reform that will solve the problem
of undocumented immigration at
its roots instead of through piecemeal enforcement-only measures,
and opposing Arizona’s Senate Bill
1070.
Whereas, a comprehensive approach to solve our broken immigration system is necessary to meet
the dual goals of ensuring a thriving and secure community and economy in the United States and protecting the human and civil rights
of immigrants; and
Whereas, comprehensive immigration reform should include the following elements: (1) an earned path
to citizenship that requires currently undocumented immigrants living
in the United States to register with
the government, begin learning English, pay-taxes, and pass a background check; (2) improvement of
the economic situation of all workers in the United States; (3) the
implementation of enforcement measures targeted at violators of immigration and labor laws and those
who represent real threats to our
nation’s safety; (4) prioritizing immigrant integration into our country; (5) respect for the due process
rights of everyone in the United
States; and (6) adjusting quotas for
future flows of immigrants, including family reunification; and
Whereas, enforcement-based immigration strategies for the past two
decades have mostly failed in deterring unauthorized migration despite
the allocations of hundreds of millions of federal tax dollars; and
Whereas, our city is facing difficult budget cuts and critical services such as police, fire, schools
and transportation would benefit
from the additional tax revenue generated by a program of comprehensive immigration reform with an
earned path to citizenship; and
Whereas, this Council encourages
President Barack Obama and the
U.S. Congress to pass a Comprehensive Immigration Reform bill that
keeps families together, upholds our
values as Americans, promotes economic growth and fixes the broken
immigration system for the longterm; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public

830

peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council calls

Reform that will solve the problem
of undocumented immigration at
