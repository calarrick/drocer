An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio House of Representatives
to support and pass H.B. 323.
Whereas, the foreclosure crisis
continues to result in thousands of

12
foreclosure filing in the City of
Cleveland; and
Whereas, banks and mortgage
companies fail to execute on the
decree for sale of the property; and
Whereas, the banks and foreclosure companies fail to assume title
per the legal decree of foreclosure;
and
Whereas, these “toxic title” properties become unmarketable — then
become a dangerous blight and are
harmful to the neighborhood health,
safety and welfare; and
Whereas, the Ohio General Assembly is considering H.B. 323 that will
provide assistance to local government to address bank “walkaways
and toxic titles”; and
Whereas, H.B. 323 provides a systematic judicial authority to remedy
the failure to execute a foreclosure
decree; and
Whereas, H.B. 323 provides for the
following remedies:
• requires a preliminary judicial
report or a commitment for an
owner’s fee policy of title insurance
to be filed along with the filing of
the complaint for foreclosure instead of 14 days after filing the complaint as under existing law;
• requires the plaintiff in a foreclosure action to file a motion requesting a default judgment under
specified circumstances and establishes that failure to file as required
results in dismissal of the action;
• permits a plaintiff requesting a
default judgment to also request a
transfer in lieu of sale and in lieu
of the right to a deficiency judgment under specified circumstances;
• prohibits the sale at a sheriff’s
auction of a foreclosed residential
property that constitutes a public
nuisance and prohibits the county
recorder from recording the deed for
such a property;
• requires a probable cause hearing to determine if a foreclosed
property could be a public nuisance
and specifies the basis upon which
a court could find probable cause;
• permits a plaintiff or other lien
holder to present information at the
probable cause hearing, to pledge to
abate the nuisance while the foreclosure action continues, or to purchase the property at auction and
abate the nuisance after gaining
title to the property;
• grants the court continuing
jurisdiction when it grants permission to abate a nuisance;
• permits specified interested parties to intervene in a foreclosure
action to bring a nuisance abatement action against the property;
• requires the plaintiff to file for
a writ of execution of a judgment
on a foreclosed residential property
within 60 days after the clerk files
the judgment, and establishes that
failure to file is grounds for the
court deeming the property abandoned unless good cause is shown;
• generally prohibits a plaintiff
and other lien holders from withdrawing or seeking dismissal of a
petition for a writ of execution or an
order of sale unless for good cause;
• enables a court to deem foreclosed residential properties abandoned when the plaintiff does not
seek a writ of execution as required
or a property fails to sell at sheriff’s auction three times;
• provides for the transfer of abandoned property to the board of county commissioners for use pursuant to
rules the commissioners adopt;

The City Record
• generally exempts a board of
county commissioners from liability
with respect to abandoned properties that are transferred to it;
• places additional duties on the
clerk of courts with respect to
notices, and requires clerk to collect
an additional fee of $20 for each
foreclosure filing;
• permits a plaintiff to make a
written bid on a property prior to a
sheriff’s sale and enables the sheriff to open the auction at that price;
• prohibits charging fees to a purchasing lien holder in a sheriff’s
sale prior to the time the purchase
price is due;
• establishes a procedure for the
court to confirm a sale at auction
by deeming the sale final if no
objections have been received;
• enables purchaser at sheriff’s
sale to submit the deed for recording upon payment of balance of
price
along
with
an
affidavit
promising to file, and establishes
that failure to so file may result in
contempt of court;
• establishes new procedures for
pricing residential properties at a
sheriff’s sale;
• expands the Public Nuisance
Law to include land, subsidized
housing, and any type of building —
not just buildings that contain residential units;
• excludes from the Public Nuisance Law buildings with three or
fewer residential units and that are
owner occupied unless the building
is undergoing foreclosure and is the
subject of a nuisance probable cause
hearing; and
• provides that properties foreclosed due to delinquent taxes that
are forfeited to a political subdivision, school district, or land bank are
free of taxes, assessment charges,
penalties, interest, costs, and subordinate liens; and
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio House of Representatives
to support and pass H.B. 323.

An emergency resolution ´support ing President Obama’s Memorandum
for the Secretary of Health and
Human Services on the subject of

576

April 28, 2010
“Respecting the Rights of Hospital
Patients to Receive Visitors and to
Designate Surrogate Decision Makers for Medical Emergencies”; and
urging Governor Strickland to issue
a similar memorandum, and the
Ohio General Assembly to adopt a
Patients’ Bill of Rights to give each
patient the right to designate visitors who shall receive the same visitation privileges as the patient’s
immediate family members.
Whereas, on April 15, 2010, President Obama issued a Memorandum
for the Secretary of Health and
Human Services regarding the subject of “Respecting the Rights of
Hospital Patients to Receive Visitors and to Designate Surrogate
Decision Makers for Medical Emergencies”; and
Whereas, in the Memorandum,
President Obama addresses the problem of patients all across America
being denied the caring of a loved
one to comfort them and act as a
legal surrogate; and
Whereas, President Obama highlighted widows or widowers denied
the comfort of a good friend, members of religious orders unable to
choose someone other than an immediate family member to visit them
and make medical decisions, and
gay and lesbian Americans who are
often barred from the bedsides of
the partners with whom they may
have spent decades of their lives;
and
Whereas, for these Americans, the
failure to have their wishes respected concerning who may visit them
or make medical decisions on their
behalf has real consequences, both
in obtaining medical information,
and in senselessly denying patients
comfort of companionship; and
Whereas, President Obama acknowledged that many States, including
North Carolina, Delaware, Nebraska,
and Minnesota, have tried to end
these problems by amending or
adopting a Patients’ Bill of Rights
to give each patient at every hospital in the State “the right to designate visitors who shall receive the
same visitation privileges as the
patient’s immediate family members, regardless of whether the visitors are legally related to the
patient”; and
Whereas, President Obama stated
that his “Administration can expand
on these important steps to ensure
that patients can receive compassionate care and equal treatment
during their hospital stays”; and
Whereas, President Obama requested that the Secretary of Health
and Human Services take certain
steps, including but not limited to,
1) initiating rulemaking to ensure
that hospitals that participate in
Medicare or Medicaid respect the
rights of patients to designate visitors, and may not deny visitation
privileges on the basis of race, color,
national origin, religion, sex, sexual
orientation, gender identity, or disability; 2) ensuring that all hospitals participating in Medicare and
Medicaid are in full compliance with
regulations promulgated to guarantee that all patients’ advance directives, such as durable powers of
attorney and health care proxies,
are respected, and 3) providing additional recommendations to the President within 180 days on actions the
Department of Health and Human
Services can take to address hospital visitation, medical decisionmak-

April 28, 2010
ing, or other health care issues that
affect LGBT patients and their families; and
Whereas, patients in the State of
Ohio would benefit from a similar
memorandum being issued by Governor Ted Strickland; and
Whereas, patients in the State of
Ohio would benefit from the Ohio
General
Assembly
adopting
a
“Patients’ Bill of Rights” similar to
that of other states like North Carolina, to give each patient at every
hospital in the State “the right to
designate visitors who shall receive
the same visitation privileges as the
patient’s immediate family members, regardless of whether the visitors are legally related to the
patient”; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of

Res. No. 571-10.
By Council Member Reed, Brancatelli, K. Johnson, Polensek, Mitchell,
Cleveland, Cummins, Zone, Brady,
Kelley, Miller, Pruitt, Dow, Westbrook, J. Johnson and Conwell.
An emergency resolution u
ú rging
the United States Congress to pass
H. B. 4812 and S. B. 3206 to provide
$23 billion in funding to state and
local government to avoid the potential layoffs of more than 300,000 education jobs nationwide, including
over 500 teachers in the Cleveland
Municipal School District.
Whereas, Senator Tom Harkin (DIA), Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and of the Senate Appropriations
panel that funds education initiatives, introduced H. B. 4812 and S.
B. 3206, the Keep Our Educators
Working Act on April 14, 2010; and
Whereas, the bill will create a $23
billion Education Jobs Fund to help
keep teachers, principals, librarians

578

April 28, 2010
and other school personnel on the
job as states face crippling budget
shortfalls; and
Whereas, the bill will help avoid
a nationwide massive wave of layoffs in our schools and institutions
of higher learning that could weaken our economic recovery and cause
serious damage to our education
system; and
Whereas, the Keep Our Educators
Working Act will create an Education Jobs Fund modeled after the
State
Fiscal
Stabilization
Fund
(SFSF) that was established in the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (the ‘Recovery Act’); and
Whereas, the SFSF is currently
supporting more than 300,000 education jobs, such as teachers, principals,
librarians, and counselors, and is
widely credited with mitigating the
impact of the recent recession; however, even with the SFSF, schools
across the country have laid off
workers, and the job outlook is worse
for the 2010-2011 school year; and
Whereas, additional resources are
needed to help states and districts
avoid a “funding cliff” that would
result in even more layoffs; and
Whereas, the $23 billion included
in the Keep Our Educators Working
Act is roughly half of the amount
dedicated to state aid in the SFSF,
and is equal to the amount passed
by the House in its December 2009
jobs legislation; and
Whereas, funding could be used for:
• compensation and benefits and
other expenses necessary to retain
existing employees, and for the hiring of new employees, in order to
provide early childhood, elementary,
secondary, or postsecondary educational and related services; or
• on-the-job training activities for
education-related careers; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that passage is necessary to avoid
the potential layoffs of over 500
teachers in the Cleveland Municipal
School District that would devastate
the education of Cleveland’s children; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the United States Congress to pass
H. B. 4812 and S. B. 3206 to provide
$23 billion in funding to state and
local government to avoid the potential layoffs of more than 300,000 education jobs nationwide, including
over 500 teachers in the Cleveland
Municipal School District.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
the United States Congress, and
Mayor Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

Res. No. 525-10.
By Council Member Brancatelli.
An emergency resolution objecting to the transfer of Liquor License
of a C2 and C2X Liquor Permit to
7025 Fleet Avenue.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Department of Liquor
Control of an application for a transfer of Liquor License of a C2 and
C2X Liquor Permit from Mona Dakdouk, DBA Gaza Market, 5407 Fleet
Avenue, 1st floor and basement,
Cleveland, Ohio 44105, Permanent
Number 1907286 to Fleet Gas Mart,
Inc., 7025 Fleet Avenue, Cleveland,
Ohio
44105,
Permanent
Number
2772868; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local

591

27
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to
Section 4303.26 of the Ohio Revised
Code. Council’s objection to said
permit must be received by the

Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of

is amended to read as follows:
Section 196.03 Tax Imposed
(a) Purpose. An excise tax is
imposed by this chapter for the purpose of providing funds for the following:
(1) the payment of costs of permanent improvements, including costs
of acquiring, constructing, reconstructing, rehabilitating, remodeling, renovating, enlarging, improving, equipping or furnishing facilities by contract, lease, lease-purchase, or otherwise; and

or other obligations.
(b) Order of Application of the
Tax. The annual collections shall be
used to fund any lawful municipal
purposes, including payment of costs
of general municipal operations, permanent improvements, and the elimination of deficits in City funds, all
subject to provisions governing the
collection, investment and disbursement of collections from the tax contained in the proceedings for any
bonds, notes, leases, leasepurchase
agreements or other obligations issued or incurred for those purposes.
(c) Tax. An excise tax is imposed
upon the privilege of parking occupancy within the City. Such tax is
imposed upon the patron for each
transaction and shall be in the
amount of eight percent (8%) of the
parking fee charged for parking
occupancy. The tax herein imposed
is in addition to any other taxes
imposed by law on or relating to
transactions or the income or gross
receipts therefrom.
(d) Exemptions.
(1) The tax shall not apply to
transactions with respect to which:
A. the operator is the United
States government or a division or
department thereof; or
B. the patron is a resident of a
single-family home, multiple-family
dwelling unit, apartment, boarding
house, condominium, or mobile home
occupying parking space for the
purpose of parking onsite at that
place of residence or at an off-site
parking facility under contract to
provide parking for residents at that
place of residence, provided that the
resident
utilizes
such
home,
dwelling unit, apartment, boarding
house, condominium, or mobile home
for living or sleeping purposes for
at least thirty (30) consecutive days;
or
C. the patron is a licensed valet,
provided that the parking space
being occupied is made available
pursuant to a written contract with
the facility operator and is being
occupied in the ordinary course of
providing parking services to a
patron of the valet.
(2) No exemption from tax shall
be granted without a valid exemption certificate completed by the
party claiming to be exempt. The
exemption certificate shall be prescribed by the Commissioner and
include all information deemed necessary for the identification of the
parties to the transaction and the
authority from which an exemption
is claimed. A transaction shall be
presumed to be taxable in the
absence of a complete exemption
certificate executed at the time of
the transaction. The operator shall
remit the original exemption certificates with the remittance return in
which the exempt transaction is
reported and retain copies of all
exemption certificates on file for a
period of time consistent with this
chapter.
(e) Collection of Tax. An operator
is required to collect the tax at the
time of the transaction and to pay
the amount collected or amount that
should have been collected over to
the Commissioner as provided here-

The City Record
in. The tax shall be paid and the
operator held liable, whether or not
such tax has been in fact collected
