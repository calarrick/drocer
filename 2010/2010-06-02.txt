By Council Member Brancatelli.
An emergency ´resolution ´strong ly objecting to the opening of “Internet cafes,” “sweepstakes parlors,”
“poker clubs” and like operations in
the City of Cleveland and other communities in Ohio.
Whereas, it appears that illegal
gambling has been revitalized in
the form of Internet cafes, poker
clubs and sweepstakes parlors set
up in storefronts in places such as
Youngstown,
Newburg
Heights,
Cuyahoga Heights and Garfield
Heights; and
Whereas, these types of gambling
operations facilitate playing games
of chance where the business makes
a profit and are illegal under Ohio
law; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that the Cleveland Law Department
should file a formal complaint
against any such Internet cafes,
sweepstakes
parlors
and
poker
clubs operating illegally in the
City and the Ohio Attorney General’s office should stop all these
gambling outfits from operating
illegally in Ohio; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby strongly objects to the opening
of “Internet cafes,” “sweepstakes
parlors,” “poker clubs” and like operations in the City of Cleveland and
other communities in Ohio.
