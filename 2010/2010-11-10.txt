Amount as submitted for review to the Budget Committee plus thirty percent (30%) of the difference between the previous year’s Schedule Amount and the Schedule Amount submitted for review to the Budget Committee for the ensuing
year.
(2) By December 1st of each year, the Director shall make available to Tenant the calculation of Rent for the ensuing
year, based on the formula set forth herein.
(3) Tenant shall be assigned an occupancy factor which shall be determined by multiplying the total amount of occupied square footage, as evidenced the market Plan, times a location factor times a use factor.
A. The location factor shall be:
1. 1.8 for stands located in the Market House; or
2. 1.2 for stands located outside the Market House.
B. The use factor associated with the designated Use Category as defined in the Market Rates shall be:
1. 1.6 for “fast food” or “specialty” stands;
2. 1.0 for “traditional” stands;
3. 0.5 for “grocery” stands; or
4. 0.3 for “restaurant” stands.
(4) The occupancy factors for all stands upon the Market Grounds shall be added together. The result of that addition
shall be “Total Occupancy Factor.” The Total Occupancy Factor shall be multiplied by five percent (5%) to reflect average vacancy rates from year to year. This calculation shall result in the “Vacancy Factor.”
(5) The aggregate of all revenue to be derived under the ensuing year from rental or Storage Lockers shall be deducted from the Schedule Amount. The result of this calculation shall be the “Adjusted Schedule Amount.”
(6) The Adjusted Schedule Amount shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is Tenant’s occupancy
factor and the denominator of which is the Total Occupancy factor minus the Vacancy Factor. This calculation shall
result in the “Annual Rent,” which shall then be divided by twelve (12) to determine the Rent due on the first (1st) day
of each month.
(7) A fee for energy consumption for the outdoor heating system will be assessed to each Tenant of the Arcade. A fee
for maintenance and repair services for the refrigerated display cases will be assessed to each Tenant of the Market
House. Such payments are deemed part of the rental obligation.
(b) The Director may rent such spaces or parts or grant the right to use the same for a period not to exceed one year.
He may make such provision for renewal or extension of the rental right or grant as he may deem advisable from time
to time for additional periods not exceeding one year each, upon notification to Council, providing that the option or
right of renewal shall be exercisable only by the Director and not by the grantee. The Director is authorized to provide
in the renting or granting of rights to the use of such part or space that the rental right or grant shall not be transferred
or assigned by the grantee thereof to any other person without the consent, in writing, of the Director. Such right or

impractical, provided that the person
operating the vehicle has safely and
appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor
as noted on the affidavit.

construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of
the child, but the production of a valid
birth certificate for a child showing
that the child was not of an age to

against any ticket, citation, or summons issued for violating this section.

(b) Designation of Interior Public
Spaces of Buildings or Structures.
(1) No interior public space, or part
or feature of any interior public
space, shall be considered designated
for preservation under this chapter
unless it has been specifically designated after the initial effective date

the designation of any area, place,
building, structure, interior public
space, part or feature of an interior

or penalties contained in this chapter.
Section
161.05
Regulation
of
Environmental Changes; Certificate
of Appropriateness
No person owning, renting or occupying property which has been designated a landmark or which is situated
in a designated landmark district
shall
make
any
environmental
change in such property unless a certificate of appropriateness has been
previously issued by the Commission
with respect to such environmental
change. The following procedures
shall apply to all alterations, demolitions, removals, or constructions of
such property in the City:
Any
application
to
the
(a)
Department of Building and Housing
for a building permit for an environmental change shall also be deemed
an application for a certificate of
appropriateness, and shall be forwarded to the Commission, together
with copies of all detailed plans,
designs, elevations, specifications
and documents relating thereto, within seven days after receipt thereof. An
application for a certificate of appropriateness may be filed by the applicant directly with the Commission at
the same time that an application for
a building permit is filed or in lieu of
filing for a building permit, if no
building permit is required for the
proposed environmental change.
(b) The Commission shall evaluate
applications to determine whether or
not the environmental change proposed by the applicant will adversely
affect any significant historical or
aesthetic feature of the property and
to determine whether or not the environmental change proposed by the
applicant is consistent with the spirit
and purposes of this chapter.
(1) In evaluating applications for
alterations or construction of property, the Commission shall consider the
following standards created by the
U.S. Department of the Interior:
A. A property shall be used for its
historic purpose or be placed in a new
use that requires minimal change to
the defining characteristics of the
building and, its features, spaces,
site, and environment;
B. The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved.
The removal of historic materials or
alteration of features and spaces that
characterize a property shall be
avoided;
C. Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time,
place, and use. Changes that create a
false sense of historical development,
such as adding conjectural features
or architectural elements from other
buildings, shall not be undertaken;
D. Most properties change over
time; those changes that have
acquired historic significance in their
own right shall be retained and preserved;
E. Distinctive features, finishes,
and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property shall be preserved;
F. Deteriorated historic features
shall
be
repaired
rather
than

30
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature
shall match the old in design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities
where
possible,
materials.
and,
Replacement of missing features
shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence;
G. Chemical or physical treatments,
such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be
used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible;
Significant
archaeological
H.
resources affected by a project shall
be protected and preserved. If such
resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken;
I. New additions, alterations to
property, features, spaces, or related
new construction shall not destroy
historic materials that characterize
the property. The new work shall be
differentiated from the old and shall
be compatible with the massing, size,
scale, and architectural features to
protect the historic integrity of the
property and its environment; and
J. New additions and adjacent or
related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that if
removed in the future, the essential
form and integrity of the historic
property and its environment would
be unimpaired.
(2) In evaluating applications for
demolition or removal of property, the
Commission shall consider the following standards:
A. The architectural and historic
significance of the subject building,
structure, interior public space, or
part of feature of the interior public
space;
B. The significance of the building,
structure, interior public space, or
part or feature of the interior public
space in contributing to the architectural or historic character of its environs;
C. In the case of a request to move a
building, structure, interior public
space, or part or feature of the interior public space, the relationship
between the location of the subject
building or structure and its overall
significance;
D. The present and potential economic viability of the subject building, structure, interior public space,
or part or feature of the interior public space, given its physical condition
and marketability;
E. If the demolition will remedy
conditions imminently dangerous to
life, health, or property, which imminently dangerous conditions have
been determined in writing by the
Department of Building and Housing,
the
Division
of
Fire
or
the
Department of Public Health; and
F. The appropriateness of the proposed new structure, interior part or
feature, or use and its impact on the
surrounding community.
(c) If the Commission finds that the
environmental change proposed by
the applicant will not adversely
affect any significant historical or
aesthetic feature of the property and
is appropriate and consistent with the
spirit and purposes of this chapter, or
that the environmental change proposed by the applicant is the only
means to remedy conditions imminently dangerous to life, health or
property, which imminently dangerous conditions have been determined
in writing by the Department of
Building and Housing or the Division
of Fire or the Department of Public

The City Record
Health, then the Commission shall
issue a certificate of appropriateness.
(d) If the Commission finds that the
environmental change proposed by
the applicant will adversely affect
any significant historical or aesthetic
feature of the property or is inappropriate or inconsistent with the spirit
and purposes of this chapter, the
Commission may either deny the
application or delay action on the
application. Any decision to delay
action on the application shall be by
mutual agreement of the Commission
and the applicant and shall be for a
period not to exceed six (6) months.
During
the
delay
period,
the
Commission shall conduct further
investigation with regard to the proposed environmental change, conduct
negotiations with the applicant and
any other party in an effort to find a
means of preserving the property, or
explore alternatives to the proposed
environmental
change.
The
Commission may also investigate the
feasibility of all available ways and
means of preserving the improvement, interior public space, or part or
feature of the interior public space,
including without limitation, inducing by contract or other consideration
the creation of covenants restricting
the use of property, leasing and subleasing the property for the purposes
of preservation and acquiring by eminent domain or contract or conveyance all or any part of or interest
in the property.
(e) At the end of the delay period,
the Commission shall either approve
or deny the application, or delay
action. A decision to delay action, at
the end of one delay period, shall be
by
mutual
agreement
of
the
Commission and the applicant and
shall be for a period not to exceed six
(6) months. The Commission shall
only agree to a second and final delay
period if the Commission determines
that this additional time period may
be useful in securing an alternative to
the proposed environmental change.
At the end of the second and final
delay period, the Commission shall
either approve or deny the application for a certificate of appropriateness.
(f) Upon the issuance, denial or a
delay in the issuance of a certificate
of appropriateness, the Commission
shall give written notices of the
issuance, denial or delay in the
issuance to the applicant and the
Department of Building and Housing.
The Commission shall provide written notice of the issuance, denial or
delay in the issuance of a certificate
of appropriateness to the applicant
and the Department of Building and
Housing within forty five (45) days of
the receipt by the Commission of an
application from either the applicant
or the Department of Building and
Housing.
(g) If no action has been taken by
the Commission on an application for
a certificate of appropriateness to
approve, deny or delay action within
forty-five (45) days after such application has been received by the
Commission, the certificate of appropriateness shall be deemed issued.
