Res. No. 892-14.
By Council Members Brancatelli,
Zone, Cimperman, Brady, Polensek
and J. Johnson.
An emergency resolution establishing a working committee to study the
effectiveness of Trap-Neuter-Return
and Return to Field Community Cat
city services and community education to decrease free-roaming cat populations in Cleveland’s neighborhoods and create a safe, healthy, and
humane community for cats and people alike.
Whereas, the Cleveland Animal
Protective League (APL) estimates
that there are more than 60,000 freeroaming, feral, or “community” cats in
Cleveland alone; and
Whereas, the APL, Cleveland Division of Animal Control Services
(CDACS), and Cleveland City Council
receive countless calls from city residents about cats in their neighborhoods; and
Whereas, currently, a partnership
between the APL and the City of
Cleveland allows caretakers to trap
free-roaming cats, transport them to
the APL where they are spayed and
neutered at a subsidized cost, and
return cats to their territory and provide ongoing care; and
Whereas, since the inception of this
trap-neuter-return (TNR) program,
approximately 5000 free-roaming cats
are served a year, with approximately
50% coming from the city of Cleveland, and the number of complaints
received
about
stray
cats
has
decreased at the CDACS and in Cleve-

1036

July 23, 2014
land’s neighborhoods; and
Whereas, this Council will establish a working committee, including
the APL, CDACS, Health Department,
and Committees on Safety, Development, Planning and Sustainability,
and Health to study the effectiveness
of Trap-Neuter-Return services that
are currently provided by the City and
APL, and how to expand those services to include targeted TNR and
new Return to Field (RTF) strategies
to further decrease free-roaming cat
populations and create a safe,
healthy, and humane community; and
Whereas, this working committee
will study TNR and RTF Community
Cat ordinances and programs in other
cities, examine the City’s current ordinances, and possibly repeal portions
that require the City to impound cats;
and
Whereas, the committee also will
study ways to educate the community
on how to be an effective cat caretaker, including possible caregiver training; and
Whereas, the committee will study
the feasibility of incorporating Community Cat services into the CDACS’s
operations and new facility, and
study and propose costs to be included
in the 2015 City budget; and
Whereas, the ultimate goal of the
working committee is to reduce reproduction of free-roaming cats by
humanely trapping, surgically sterilizing, and returning the cats to their
territory as “community” cats.
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council establishes a working committee to study
the effectiveness of Trap-NeuterReturn and Return to Field Community Cat city services and community
education to decrease free-roaming
cat populations in Cleveland’s neighborhoods and create a safe, healthy,
and humane community for cats and
people alike.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit a copy
of this resolution to Sharon A. Harvey, President & CEO, Cleveland Animal Protective League
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.

Ord. No. 695-14.
By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency ordinance to amend
Section 235.01 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as
amended by Ordinance No. 473-11
passed April 25, 2011, defining smoking to include alternative nicotine
products, including electronic cigarettes, in the smoking ban on City
property.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
already prohibits smoking in certain
declared outdoor areas and areas
within 150 feet of City places of
employment; and
Whereas, the use of electronic cigarettes increases fine particle air pollution and levels of potentially carcinogenic compounds in people who
use them, according to a recent study
from the Bavarian Health and Food
Safety Authority; and
Whereas, their data confirms that
electronic cigarettes are not emission
free and that pollutants could be of
health concern for users and secondhand smokers; and
Whereas, this Council is compelled
to also prohibit smoking alternative
nicotine products, including electronic cigarettes, on City property in order
to protect Cleveland’s citizens from
the harmful health effects of nicotine
vapor inhaled while smoking and
while exposed to secondhand smoke
of electronic cigarettes; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 235.01 of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
