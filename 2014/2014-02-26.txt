An emergency resolution supporting Federal Senate Bill 394, the Metal
Theft Prevention Act of 2013.
Whereas, with the price of metal
increasing, metal theft in the United
States has jumped by 80%, costing
U.S. businesses $1 billion dollars a
year; and
Whereas, the state of Ohio is number one in the nation in metal theft,
with 3,200 reported claims between
2010 and 2012; and
Whereas, in Cleveland, between
2000 and 2008, 80,000 homes have been
foreclosed upon, causing property
values to plummet and leading to
entire blocks of vacant and abandoned houses that are quickly
stripped of all aluminum siding,
metal appliances, copper wire and
plumbing; and
Whereas, S. 394, the Metal Theft
Prevention Act of 2013, is bipartisan
federal legislation that would make
metal theft a federal crime, give state
attorneys general the power to bring
civil actions to enforce the bill’s provisions, open metal theft to potentially tougher sentences and make it significantly more difficult for criminals
to sell stolen metal to scrap metal
dealers; and
Whereas, the Metal Theft Prevention Act of 2013 will significantly
assist in improving prevention of
metal theft from critical infrastructure as well as crack down on criminals who commit this crime; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,

By Council Members Cimperman,
Zone, Brady, Polensek, Brancatelli
and Cummins.
An emergency resolution in support
of and solidarity with the people in
Ukraine who continue to demonstrate
in favor of their sovereign right to
chart an independent and democratic
future for their country.
Whereas,
the
government
of
Ukraine made significant progress
toward meeting the requirements and
signing an Association Agreement
and Free Trade Agreement with the
European Union; and
Whereas, in November 2013, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych
suspended preparations for signing
the Association Agreement and a
Free Trade Agreement with the European Union following several months
of pressure from the Russian Federation; and
Whereas, this reversal of policy
triggered peaceful demonstrations by
millions of Ukrainians in Kyiv and
cities throughout the country and the
world,
including
Cleveland,
to
demand closer European integration;
and
Whereas, in response to these
peaceful protests, Ukrainian authorities have resorted to cruel brutality,
repression, censorship and violence;
and
Whereas, clashes between police
and protesters have resulted in scores
of confirmed deaths and thousands of
injuries including targeted attacks

228

February 26, 2014
on members of the media and medical
personnel; and
Whereas, two days ago, Ukrainian
President Yanukovych fled the country and a warrant is out for his arrest
for “mass killings of civilians”; and
Whereas, Cleveland is the home of
tens of thousands of people of Ukrainian descent who continue to support a
constructive and peaceful solution to
the crisis; and
Whereas, this Council supports
Ukrainians' aspirations for democracy, national sovereignty and association with Europe, in accordance with
their universal right to choose their
own future, free of fear, intimidation
and outside interference; and
Whereas, the United States government must continue to support the
desire of millions of Ukrainian citizens for democracy and human rights
with any all appropriate measures,
including targeted sanctions against
those who authorize or engage in the
use of force against protesters, targeted financial assistance for peopleto-people
cooperation
between
Ukraine and the United States, including Cleveland-based institutions, and
to use every appropriate international organization and agreement--e.g.
International Monetary Fund, the
United Nations, World Trade Organization, Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe--to defend
Ukrainians' right to democracy and
national sovereignty; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby
supports and is in solidarity with the
people in Ukraine who continue to
demonstrate in favor of their sovereign right to chart an independent
and democratic future for their country.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit a copy
of this resolution to United Ukrainian
Organizations of Ohio.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
