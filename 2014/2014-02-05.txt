of Cleveland’s children is of vital
importance; and

babies are born each year in the United States of America with a congenital heart defect; and

defects are not diagnosed until
months or years after birth; and
Whereas, undiagnosed congenital
heart conditions cause many cases of
sudden cardiac deaths in young
Clevelanders; and

pediatricians, and all those in the
health profession have a greater
awareness of the potential for congenital heart defects among newborns and children; and
Whereas, many of Cleveland’s families and communities are directly or

136

February 5, 2014

been affected to celebrate life, to
remember loved ones lost, to honor
dedicated health professionals, and to
meet others and know they are not
alone; and

Res. No. 133-14.
By Council Member Brancatelli.
An emergency resolution urging
the U. S. House of Representatives
and the U. S. Senate to support and
pass the Homeowners Debt Relief
Extension Act and the Mortgage
Forgiveness Tax Relief Act that
will extend the Mortgage Debt
Relief Act of 2007, allowing for tax
forgiveness as a result of mortgage
loan modifications.
Whereas, the “foreclosure crisis”
has impacted millions of homeowners, not only in the City of Cleveland,
but the entire nation with the loss of
their homes; and
Whereas, those foreclosure—mortgage holders have come to recognize
that renegotiation of their mortgages
was in their best interest; and
Whereas, those affected foreclosure homeowners have successfully
renegotiated their mortgages; and
Whereas, in renegotiated mortgages the homeowner faced IRS
penalties as a result of renegotiated
mortgage debt or the cancellation of
mortgage debt; and
Whereas, the Mortgage Debt Relief
Act of 2007 makes debt that is reduced
or cancelled through a loan modification or debt forgiven not liable for
taxes for the difference between the
house’s value and the loan modification; and
Whereas, the Mortgage Debt Tax
Relief Act expired on December 2013;
and
Whereas, there continues to be a
need for mortgage loan modifications
to reduce the number of foreclosures;
and
Whereas, an extension of the provisions set forth in the Mortgage Debt
Relief Act are contained in both H. R
3856 and S. B. 1187; and
Whereas, the passage of H. R. 3856
and S. B. 1187, known as the Homeowners Debt Relief Extension Act
and the Mortgage Forgiveness Tax
Relief Act, would allow for a two year
extension of tax relief contained in
the Mortgage Debt Relief Act of 2007;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Urging the U.S. House of
Representatives and the U. S. Senate
to support and pass the Homeowners
Debt Relief Extension Act and the
Mortgage Forgiveness Tax Relief Act
that will extend the Mortgage Debt
Relief Act of 2007, allowing for tax
forgiveness as a result of mortgage
loan modifications.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit copies
of this resolution to the Honorable
Barack Obama, President of the United States, U. S. Senator Rob Portman,
Ohio, U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown,
Ohio, U.S. Congresswoman Marcy
Kaptur, 9th District, Ohio, U.S. Congresswoman Marcia Fudge, 11th District, and Ohio Attorney General Mike
DeWine.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from
