FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES REFERRED
Ord. No. 1439-14.
By Council Members Brancatelli, K.
Johnson and Kelley (by departmental
request).
An emergency ordinance giving
consent of the City of Cleveland to the
Director of Transportation of the
State of Ohio for repairing pavement

along a portion of Broadview Road;
authorizing the Director of Capital
Projects to enter into any relative
agreements; and causing payment of
the City’s share to the State for the
cost of the improvement.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That it is declared to be in
the public interest that the consent of
the City of Cleveland is given to the
Director of Transportation of the
State of Ohio (“the State”) to construct the following improvement
under plans, specifications, and estimates approved by the State: repairing pavement along Broadview Road
between Brookpark Road and Pearl
Road, PID No. 98624 (the “Improvement”).
Section 2. That the City proposes to
cooperate with the State in the cost of
the Improvement by assuming and
contributing the entire cost and
expense of the Improvement, less the
amount of federal funds allocated by
the Federal Highway Administration,
United States Department of Transportation. The City agrees to assume
one hundred percent (100%) of the
cost of preliminary engineering,
right-of-way and environmental documentation. Also, the City agrees to
assume and contribute 100% of the
cost of any items included in the construction contract at the request of
the City, which are determined by the
State not eligible or made necessary
by the Improvement. The share of the
cost of the City is estimated in the
amount of $400,000, but the estimated
amount is to be adjusted in order that
the City’s ultimate share of the
Improvement shall correspond with
the percentages of actual costs when
the actual costs are determined.
Section 3. That the Director of Capital Projects is authorized to enter into
one or more agreements with the
State necessary to complete the planning and construction of the Improvement, which agreements shall contain
terms and conditions that the Director
of Law determines shall best protect
the public interest.
Section 4. Utilities and Right-ofWay Statement. The City agrees to
acquire and/or make available to
ODOT, under current State and Federal regulations, all necessary right-ofway required for the Improvement.
The City also understands that rightof-way costs include eligible utility
costs. The City agrees to be responsible for all utility accommodation,
relocation, and reimbursement and
agrees that all such accommodations,
relocations,
and
reimbursements
shall comply with the current provisions of 23 CFR 645 and the ODOT
Utilities Manual.
Section 5. Maintenance. Upon completion of the Improvement, and
unless otherwise agreed, the City
shall: (1) provide adequate maintenance for the Improvement under all
applicable state and federal laws,
including, but not limited to, 23 USC
116; (2) provide ample financial provisions, as necessary, for the maintenance of the Improvement; (3) maintain the right-of-way, keeping it free
of obstructions; and (4) hold said
right-of-way inviolate for public highway purposes.
Section 6. That the Director of Capital Projects is authorized to enter into
contracts with ODOT pre-qualified

1614

November 12, 2014
consultants for the preliminary engineering phase of the Improvement
and to enter into contracts with the
Director of Transportation necessary
to complete the above described project. Upon the request of ODOT, the
Director of Capital Projects is also
authorized to assign all rights, title,
and interests of the City to ODOT arising from any agreement with its consultant in order to allow ODOT to
direct additional or corrective work,
recover damages due to errors or
omissions, and to exercise all other
contractual rights and remedies
afforded by law or equity.
Section 7. That the City agrees that
if Federal Funds are used to pay the
cost of any consultant contract, the
City shall comply with 23 CFR 172 in
the selection of its consultant and the
administration of the consultant contract. Further, the City agrees to
incorporate ODOT’s “Specifications
for Consulting Services” as a contract
document in all of its consultant contracts. The City agrees to require, as a
scope of services clause, that all plans
prepared by the consultant must conform to ODOT’s current design standards and that the consultant shall be
responsible for ongoing consultant
involvement during the construction
phase of the Improvement. The City
agrees to include a completion schedule acceptable to ODOT and to assist
ODOT in rating the consultant’s performance through ODOT’s Consultant
Evaluation System.
Section
8.
That
this
Council
requests the State to proceed with the
Improvement.
Section 9. That the Director of Capital Projects is authorized to enter into
any agreements necessary to implement the improvement.
Section 10. That the Clerk of Council is authorized and directed to transmit to the State three (3) certified
copies of this ordinance immediately
on its taking effect, and it shall
become the basis for proceeding with
the Improvement.
Section 11. That this Council authorizes payment to the State of the
City’s share of the Improvement from
Fund Nos. 20 SF 520, 20 SF 528, 20 SF
534, 20 SF 540, 20 SF 546, 20 SF 554, and
20 SF 563, and any all funds approved
by the Director of Finance, including
future bond funds if issued for this
purpose, Request No. RQS 0103, RL
2014-128.
Section 12. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure
and, provided it receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take
effect and be in force immediately
upon its passage and approval by the
Mayor; otherwise it shall take effect
and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.
Referred to Directors of Capital
Projects, City Planning Commission,
Finance, Law; Committees on Municipal Services and Properties, Finance.

November 12, 2014
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes

assume and contribute 100% of the
cost of any items included in the construction contract at the request of
the City, which are determined by the
State not eligible or made necessary
by the Improvement. The share of the
cost of the City is estimated in the
amount of $240,000, but the estimated
amount is to be adjusted in order that
the City’s ultimate share of the
Improvement shall correspond with
the percentages of actual costs when
the actual costs are determined.
Section 3. That the Director of Capital Projects is authorized to enter into
one or more agreements with the
State necessary to complete the planning and construction of the Improvement, which agreements shall contain
terms and conditions that the Director
of Law determines shall best protect
