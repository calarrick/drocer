Candidates will NOT be permitted to bring any knowledge sources identified on the Reading List nor any other documents to the Written Examination administration site. Additionally, no electronic communication devices (e.g., pagers,
telephones, tablet devices, laptops, etc.) will be allowed at the Written Examination administration site.
All candidates who complete the Written Examination will be eligible to participate in the Oral Board and In-Basket
Tests. 
Written In-Basket Test: This component is designed to assess abilities found to underlie effective job performance in
the context of typical situations encountered by Cleveland Division of Police Captains. Candidates will be asked to provide written, essay-style responses to explain how they would respond to these situations. The situations will be presented in the context of a series of written documents such as calendars, personnel and duty rosters, organizational
charts, forms, memos, e-mails, telephone messages, reports, and other written correspondence. These documents will be
based on standardized documents used by personnel in the Cleveland Division of Police and/or generic forms which are
typical of managerial positions at this level. Candidates will be asked to describe in writing how they would respond to
the issues presented - - what actions they would take, what decisions they would make, etc. Some of the documents may
be related so it will be important for candidates to review all of their test materials before responding to each issue.
Based on the job analysis of the Cleveland Division of Police Captain position, the In-Basket Test will be designed to
allow for an assessment of such abilities as: communication (written), interpersonal interactions, analyzing and deciding, and managing resources. The In-Basket will be evaluated by raters drawn from law enforcement agencies outside
the Cleveland Division of Police.
Candidates will be permitted to use any knowledge sources identified on the Reading List or other documents during
the In-Basket Test. However, it should be kept in mind that the focus of the In-Basket Test is on the kinds of abilities
listed above, not technical knowledge.
All candidates who complete the Written Examination and In-Basket Test will be eligible to participate in the Oral
Board Test.
Oral Board Test The Oral Board Test is designed to assess abilities found to underlie effective job performance in the
context of typical situations encountered by Cleveland Division of Police Captains. The Oral Board Test will consist of
three exercises requiring candidates to conduct such activities as commanding an incident scene, correcting subordinate
performance problems, and resolving community problems. Candidates will be given an opportunity to review written
scenarios describing each situation and to prepare their responses before appearing before the Oral Board Test assessment panels to conduct each exercise. Candidates will then be given a set amount of time to present their responses to
the Oral Board Test assessment panels which will consist of raters trained to evaluate their performance. The raters will
be drawn from agencies outside the Cleveland Division of Police. Total candidate participation time for the Oral Board
Test will be approximately two hours and 15 minutes including time to check-in and review instructions, time to review
the Oral Board Test exercise materials and prepare responses, and time to provide your response to each Oral Board Test
exercise.
Based on the job analysis of the Cleveland Division of Police Captain position, the Oral Board Test exercises will be
designed to allow for an assessment of such abilities as: communication (oral), interpersonal interactions, analyzing
and deciding, managing activities, and adaptability.
Candidates will NOT be permitted to bring any knowledge sources identified on the Reading List nor any other documents to the Oral Board Test site. Any knowledge sources or other documents that might be needed to respond to the
Oral Board Test exercises will be made available to candidates at the test administration site.
Applicants will be notified of the date, time and place of their In Basket and Oral Board Tests through the United States
mail after the Written Test is completed.

The City Record

August 13, 2014

Technical Knowledge Test: The Written Examination will consist of 85 multiple-choice questions designed to assess
candidates’ understanding of job-related technical knowledge determined to be important to the effective performance
of the Cleveland Division of Police Lieutenant position based on the job analysis results. Questions will be developed
based on the information contained in the knowledge source subsections outlined in the Reading List. The Reading List
specifies which subsections of each knowledge source will be covered on the Written Examination. The allocation of
Written Examination questions among the knowledge source subsections will be based on the job analysis results. All
Written Examination questions will be tested in a closed-book manner.
Candidates will NOT be permitted to bring any knowledge sources identified on the Reading List nor any other documents to the Written Examination administration site. Additionally, no electronic communication devices (e.g., pagers,
telephones, tablet devices, laptops, etc.) will be allowed at the Written Examination administration site.
All candidates who complete the Written Examination will be eligible to participate in the Oral Board Test.
Oral Board Test: The Oral Board Test is designed to assess abilities found to underlie effective job performance in the
context of typical situations encountered by Cleveland Division of Police Lieutenants. The Oral Board Test will consist
of two exercises requiring candidates to conduct such activities as supervising an incident scene and correcting subordinate performance problems. Candidates will be given an opportunity to review written scenarios describing each situation and to prepare their responses before appearing before the Oral Board Test assessment panels to conduct each
exercise. Candidates will then be given a set amount of time to present their responses to the Oral Board Test assessment panels which will consist of raters trained to evaluate their performance. The raters will be drawn from agencies
outside the Cleveland Division of Police. Total candidate participation time for the Oral Board Test will be approximately one hour and 30 minutes including time to check-in and review instructions, time to review the Oral Board Test
exercise materials and prepare responses, and time to provide your response to each Oral Board Test exercise.
Based on the job analysis of the Cleveland Division of Police Lieutenant position, the Oral Board Test exercises will be
designed to allow for an assessment of such abilities as: communication (oral), interpersonal interactions, analyzing
and deciding, managing activities, and adaptability.
Candidates will NOT be permitted to bring any knowledge sources identified on the Reading List nor any other documents to the Oral Board Test site. Any knowledge sources or other documents that might be needed to respond to the
Oral Board Test exercises will be made available to candidates at the test administration site.
THE USE OF THE FOLLOWING DURING THE EXAMINATION WILL BE PROHIBITED: ANY ELECTRONIC
DEVICES (E.G.
EARPHONES, EARPLUGS, CALCULATORS, RADIOS INCLUDING DEPARTMENTAL RADIOS,
PAGERS, TAPE RECORDERS, TAPE PLAYERS), AND SCRAP PAPER. APPLICANTS BRINGING THE AFOREMENTIONED ARTICLES TO THE EXAMINATION SITE WILL HAVE THEM CONFISCATED.

in the Armed Forces of the United States, seniority credit shall be granted for the time so served. No additional credit
for military service shall be allowed in promotional examinations; time lost for leaves of absence, other than military,
as a result of disciplinary action, or any other time during which an employee is off the City payroll (e.g. AWOL, layoff,
suspension) shall not be credited toward seniority.

five (5) working days. During this five (5) day period, any competitor who desires to challenge any answer contained
in the tentative answer key shall submit such challenge in writing together with authoritative proof of his/her claim.
All such written challenges shall be considered by the Commission provided, however, that the identity of the applicants
submitting the challenges shall not be known to the Commission. If the Commission is satisfied as to the validity of such

Commission. Only the final examination answer key shall be used in scoring all examination papers.

printed name, and signature on the Civil Service Objection Form. Applicants who do not provide this information will
not have their protests addressed.
NOTE: In lieu of a hearing before the Civil Service Commission regarding challenges, the Commission reserves the right
to designate a Referee to hear the challenges who may then submit Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law to the Civil
Service Commission for its review.

From the returns of each competitive examination, the Commission shall prepare and keep open to the public inspection
of an eligible list of the persons … who are otherwise eligible. Such persons shall be notified and take rank upon the eligible list in order of their relative grades. The grade of any applicant failing to qualify shall not be made public.
5.11 BREAKING OF EXAMINATION TIE SCORES
In a Promotional Examination, should two (2) or more applicants receive the same grade, seniority in the classification
from which the promotion is sought shall determine the order in which their names shall be placed on the eligible list.
If the applicants are still tied after the aforementioned seniority has been considered, seniority and grade in the next
lower ranks shall be used as necessary. If the applicants are still tied, placement on the eligible list will be determined
by random selection. The Civil Service Commission shall determine the method of random selection.
NOTE: Seniority will be computed as of August 23, 2014.
2014 Cleveland Division of Police Lieutenant Examination
Reading List Explanation
I. Reading List Explanation
Candidates for promotion to Lieutenant will be responsible for the knowledge sources listed on the attached Reading
List. This list is organized by knowledge source (e.g., Cleveland Division of Police General Police Orders), identifies the
specific subsections (e.g., 1.1.07 Sexual Harassment Policy) of each overall knowledge source that may be included on
the Written Examination. The fact that a specific knowledge source subsection is listed on the Reading List does not
necessarily mean that a question will appear on the Written Examination from that subsection; it simply means that a
question may appear on the Written Examination from that subsection. Knowledge source subsections that do not
appear on this Reading List will not be tested. Decisions regarding the inclusion of knowledge sources and subsections
were made based on information collected from the job analysis of the position of Cleveland Division of Police Lieutenant.
Please note that all subsections/chapters from an overall knowledge source may not be included on the Written Examination Reading List. For example, Chapters 7 and 8 of the ninth edition of the Legal Guide for Police: Constitutional
Issues have been excluded from the Written Examination Reading List. You should carefully review the Written Examination Reading List when identifying chapters/subsections to study for the Written Examination.
Finally, please note that for the external textbooks, the publisher’s website has been identified to assist candidates in
obtaining each external textbook.  
II. Administrative Procedures
A. ALL questions on the Written Examination will be closed-book. Candidates will NOT be permitted to use any knowledge sources on the Reading List or other documents of any kind during the Written Examination.
B. Candidates will ONLY be responsible for information contained within knowledge source subsections included on the
Reading List. Any other subsections that are referenced within subsections appearing on the Reading List, but are not
actually included on the Reading List themselves, will NOT be tested.
C. NO electronic equipment will be allowed at the examination administration site, including pagers, tablets, cellphones,
laptops, etc. Candidates may, however, bring timekeeping devices to keep track of time. Candidates will NOT be permitted to use a cell phone or any other electronic communication device to keep track of time.

are allowed). ONLY pencils will be provided at the examination administration site. You may bring highlighters and
pens to the administration site.
E. Candidates will be responsible for all revisions made to the Cleveland Division of Police internal knowledge
sources/documents up until the Reading List is published. Candidates will NOT be responsible for revisions that occur
after the Reading List is published. Candidates can obtain an electronic copy of the internal knowledge sources by
bringing a blank flash drive to the Policy Unit. 
F. Any of the knowledge sources appearing on the Reading List may be of relevance to the Oral Board Test even though
the focus of this test is on abilities. Candidates will NOT be permitted to bring any knowledge sources on the Reading
List or other documents to the Oral Board Test. However, any critical knowledge sources or other documents needed to
respond to the Oral Board Test exercises will be made available to candidates at the Oral Board Test site.

PLACE: THE CLEVELAND PUBLIC AUDITORIUM, 500 Lakeside Avenue
TYPE: The examination will consist of two components, a Written Technical Knowledge Test and an Oral Board Test.
Both of these components are described below:
Written Test: The Written Examination will consist of 85 multiple-choice questions designed to assess candidates’
understanding of job-related technical knowledge determined to be important to the effective performance of the Cleveland Division of Police Sergeant position based on the job analysis results. Questions will be developed based on the
information contained in the knowledge source subsections outlined in the Reading List. The Reading List specifies
which subsections of each knowledge source will be covered on the Written Examination. The allocation of Written
Examination questions among the knowledge source subsections will be based on the job analysis results. All Written
Examination questions will be tested in a closed-book manner.
Candidates will NOT be permitted to bring any knowledge sources identified on the Reading List nor any other documents to the Written Examination administration site. Additionally, no electronic communication devices (e.g., pagers,
telephones, tablet devices, laptops, etc.) will be allowed at the Written Examination administration site.
All candidates who complete the Written Examination will be eligible to participate in the Oral Board Test.
Oral Board Test: The Oral Board Test is designed to assess abilities found to underlie effective job performance in the
context of typical situations encountered by Cleveland Division of Police Sergeants. The Oral Board Test will consist
of two exercises requiring candidates to conduct such activities as supervising an incident scene and correcting subordinate performance problems. Candidates will be given an opportunity to review written scenarios describing each situation and to prepare their responses before appearing before the Oral Board Test assessment panels to conduct each
exercise. Candidates will then be given a set amount of time to present their responses to the Oral Board Test assessment panels which will consist of raters trained to evaluate their performance. The raters will be drawn from agencies
outside the Cleveland Division of Police. Total candidate participation time for the Oral Board Test will be approximately one hour and 30 minutes including time to check-in and review instructions, time to review the Oral Board Test
exercise materials and prepare responses, and time to provide your response to each Oral Board Test exercise.
Based on the job analysis of the Cleveland Division of Police Sergeant position, the Oral Board Test exercises will be
designed to allow for an assessment of such abilities as: communication (oral), interpersonal interactions, analyzing
and deciding, managing activities, and adaptability.
Candidates will NOT be permitted to bring any knowledge sources identified on the Reading List nor any other documents to the Oral Board Test site. Any knowledge sources or other documents that might be needed to respond to the
Oral Board Test exercises will be made available to candidates at the test administration site.
THE USE OF THE FOLLOWING DURING THE EXAMINATION WILL BE PROHIBITED: ANY ELECTRONIC
DEVICES (E.G.
EARPHONES, EARPLUGS, CALCULATORS, RADIOS INCLUDING DEPARTMENTAL RADIOS,
PAGERS, TAPE RECORDERS, TAPE PLAYERS), AND SCRAP PAPER. APPLICANTS BRINGING THE AFOREMENTIONED ARTICLES TO THE EXAMINATION SITE WILL HAVE THEM CONFISCATED.
WAIVER OF RULES
4.40-B PASSING GRADE
The waiver of this Rule will allow the Civil Service Commission to set the minimum passing score based on acceptable
testing criteria.
APPLICABLE RULES
The following Rules will be applicable to this examination:
4.40-A WEIGHTS
Written Test – 40% of final grade
Oral Board Test – 60% of final grade
4.40-C SENIORITY CREDIT
Applicants obtaining passing grades in promotional examinations shall have added to their passing grades, credit for
seniority. Such credit shall be for all service rendered, pursuant to Regular appointment in all classifications which are
lower in rank and which are considered in the direct line of promotion. The amount of such credit shall be obtained by
allowing an amount for each month of an applicant’s prior regular service in accordance with the following schedule:
one percent of the total grade obtainable for each of the first four years of prior service and six-tenths percent of such
total grade for each year of the next ten years of prior service. When such prior service has been interrupted by service
in the Armed Forces of the United States, seniority credit shall be granted for the time so served. No additional credit
for military service shall be allowed in promotional examinations; time lost for leaves of absence, other than military,
as a result of disciplinary action, or any other time during which an employee is off the City payroll (e.g. AWOL, layoff,
suspension) shall not be credited toward seniority.
4.50 ESTABLISHING ANSWER KEY AND REVIEW OF EXAMINATION PAPERS
Following the administration of the written part of the examination, the question and answers thereto which the Commission proposes to use in grading the examination shall be available to applicants in such examinations for a period of
five (5) working days. During this five (5) day period, any competitor who desires to challenge any answer contained

All such written challenges shall be considered by the Commission provided, however, that the identity of the applicants
submitting the challenges shall not be known to the Commission. If the Commission is satisfied as to the validity of such
proposed changes and/or amendments, they shall be made part of the examination answer key. The original examination answer key together with any changes and/or amendments thereto shall constitute the final examination answer
key. No further requests for changes and/or amendments to the examination answer key shall be entertained by the
Commission. Only the final examination answer key shall be used in scoring all examination papers.
Any applicant shall have the right to review his/her own graded examination papers and to submit written requests for
the correction of clerical errors in their grading during five (5) working days following the applicant’s notification, by
mail, of his/her grade…. Examination papers are not subject to inspection by the public except upon unanimous vote of
the Commission. The Civil Service Commission reserves the right to allow the review of examinations and/or answer
sheets as stated in the examination announcement.
NOTE: There will be a review period for the Technical Knowledge Test only. A Departmental Notice will be issued indicating the time, dates, and place.
The review time for challenges will be limited to two hours for each applicant.
NOTE: Any applicant protesting a question or answer will have to submit his/her protest in writing on the approved
Civil Service Objection Form. All protest forms must be turned in upon the applicant’s completion of the review period.
No objection forms will be accepted: 1) before or after the review period, or 2) at any location other than the location
designated for review. Anyone who does not follow the instructions on the objection form will lose the right to their
objection. The Commission shall not entertain any objections other than those on the approved form.
NOTE: Applicants will be required to give their examination identification number, rank of examination applied for,
printed name, and signature on the Civil Service Objection Form. Applicants who do not provide this information will
not have their protests addressed.
NOTE: In lieu of a hearing before the Civil Service Commission regarding challenges, the Commission reserves the right
to designate a Referee to hear the challenges who may then submit Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law to the Civil
Service Commission for its review.
5.20 ESTABLISHMENT OF ELIGIBLE LIST
From the returns of each competitive examination, the Commission shall prepare and keep open to the public inspection
of an eligible list of the persons who are otherwise eligible. Such persons shall be notified and take rank upon the eligible list in order of their relative grades. The grade of any applicant failing to qualify shall not be made public.
5.11 BREAKING OF EXAMINATION TIE SCORES
In a Promotional Examination, should two (2) or more applicants receive the same grade, seniority in the classification
from which the promotion is sought shall determine the order in which their names shall be placed on the eligible list.
If the applicants are still tied after the aforementioned seniority has been considered, seniority and grade in the next
lower ranks shall be used as necessary. If the applicants are still tied, placement on the eligible list will be determined
by random selection. The Civil Service Commission shall determine the method of random selection.
NOTE: Seniority will be computed as of August 23, 2014.
2014 SERGEANT OF POLICE WRITTEN EXAM READING LIST
I. Reading List Explanation
Candidates for promotion to Sergeant will be responsible for the knowledge sources listed on the attached Reading List.
This list is organized by knowledge source (e.g., Cleveland Division of Police General Police Orders), identifies the specific subsections [e.g., 1.1.22 Deadly Force Investigation Team, Use of (UDFIT)] of each overall knowledge source that
may be included on the Written Examination. The fact that a specific knowledge source subsection is listed on the Reading List does not necessarily mean that a question will appear on the Written Examination from that subsection; it simply means that a question may appear on the Written Examination from that subsection. Knowledge source subsections
that do not appear on this Reading List will not be tested. Decisions regarding the inclusion of knowledge sources and
subsections were made based on information collected from the job analysis of the position of Cleveland Division of
Police Sergeant.
Please note that all subsections/chapters from an overall knowledge source may not be included on the Written Examination Reading List. For example, Chapters 7 and 8 of the ninth edition of the Legal Guide for Police: Constitutional
Issues have been excluded from the Written Examination Reading List. You should carefully review the Written Examination Reading List when identifying chapters/subsections to study for the Written Examination.
Finally, please note that for the external textbooks, the publisher’s website has been identified to assist candidates in
obtaining each external textbook.  
II. Administrative Procedures
A. ALL questions on the Written Examination will be closed-book. Candidates will NOT be permitted to use any knowledge sources on the Reading List or other documents of any kind during the Written Examination.
B. Candidates will ONLY be responsible for information contained within knowledge source subsections included on the
Reading List. Any other subsections that are referenced within subsections appearing on the Reading List, but are not
actually included on the Reading List themselves, will NOT be tested.
