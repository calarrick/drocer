public utility referred to as the Waterworks System; (b) to make, from time

present value debt service savings of
at least three percent (3%), or to eliminate or modify covenants that are

With respect to Outstanding Revenue

be issued at the same or different
times. The Refunding Bonds of each
Series shall be designated as provided
in the applicable Certificate of Award
and shall include in the designation
reference to the calendar year in
which the applicable Series is issued.
A separate Certificate of Award and a
separate Supplemental Indenture
shall be delivered for each Series.
Section 3. Variable Rate Refunding
Bonds.
In the event that a Series of Refunding Bonds bear interest at variable
interest rates, then the Director of
Finance is authorized to determine
the method and procedure by which
the variable rate of interest to be
borne by the Refunding Bonds of that
Series shall be determined, whether
by reference to a market index, by a
remarketing agent or otherwise; provided that no variable rate Refunding
Bonds may bear interest at a rate in
excess of twenty-five percent (25%)
per year (including any Refunding
Bonds held by a provider of a Credit
Support Instrument). The Director of
Finance may determine that the
terms of a variable rate Series of
Refunding Bonds may or may not permit the holders to tender their variable rate Refunding Bonds for purchase by the City. The Director of
Finance shall also designate in the
Certificate of Award for those variable rate Refunding Bonds (and may
designate others, from time to time, in
substitution therefor) the tender
agent or agents and the remarketing
agent or agents, which designations
shall be based on the determination of
the Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
that the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed to
provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable. The Director of Finance is authorized to enter
into agreements in connection with
the delivery of each Series of variable
rate Refunding Bonds, and from time
to time thereafter so long as the variable rate Refunding Bonds of that
Series
are
outstanding,
with
providers of Credit Support Instruments, tender agents (which may be
the Trustee), remarketing agents
(which may be any of the Original
Purchasers), purchasers of tendered
Refunding Bonds, and others as may
be determined by the Director of
Finance, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, to be necessary or appropriate to provide for (i)
the method of determining the variable interest rates (ii) the rights and
procedures for tender (iii) liquidity or
credit support (iv) repayment by the
City of any amounts drawn under the
Credit Support Instrument (v) the
direct purchase of tendered Refunding Bonds, and (vi) other arrangements in the best interests of the City.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized to terminate any such
agreements if the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the City’s best interests will be served
by such termination. The Director of

The City Record
Finance is further authorized to enter
into agreements, from time to time so
long as the variable rate Refunding
Bonds are outstanding, supplementing or amending the applicable Supplemental Indenture for a series of
Refunding Bonds as provided in Section 9. The Director of Finance is
authorized to pay any fees associated
with agreements entered into or terminated pursuant to this Section from
proceeds of Refunding Bonds, to the
extent permitted by the Indenture,
and from the Net Revenues of the Utility.
Section 4. Award and Sale of
Refunding Bonds.
The Director of Finance shall sign
and deliver a Certificate of Award for
the Refunding Bonds. In the event the
Refunding Bonds are issued in more
than one series sold at different
times, a separate Certificate of Award
shall be signed and delivered for each
separately delivered series. The sale
of the Refunding Bonds shall be
awarded to the Original Purchaser
selected by the Director of Finance
and identified in the Certificate of
Award. In the case of Refunding
Bonds to be underwritten in a public
offering, the Director of Finance
shall select the Original Purchaser
based on her evaluation, in consultation with a Financial Advisor, of the
qualifications and relevant experience of firms that have proposed to
underwrite the Refunding Bonds.
Alternatively, the Director of Finance
may determine, in consultation with a
Financial Advisor, that more advantageous terms for the Refunding
Bonds may be obtained by the private
placement of the Refunding Bonds
with an investor or investors (including financial institutions) purchasing for their own account and not for
resale, in which case the Director of
Finance may designate such investor
or investors as the Original Purchaser. In addition, each Certificate of
Award shall determine the following,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, consistent with
this Ordinance and the Indenture:
(a) the aggregate principal amount
of Refunding Bonds issued;
(b) the purchase price to be paid to
the City by the Original Purchasers,
which amount shall be not less than:
(i) 97% of the amount determined by
adding to the aggregate principal
amount of the Refunding Bonds any
aggregate original issue premium
and subtracting from the amount any
aggregate original issue discount,
plus (ii) any accrued interest on the
Refunding Bonds from their date to
the date of their delivery to the Original Purchasers;
(c) whether any Refunding Bonds
are to be subject to redemption prior
to maturity, and, if so, the redemption
date for those Refunding Bonds subject to prior redemption and the
redemption price, which may be determined as a percentage of the principal amount redeemed or by a formula
intended to make the bondholder
whole for the loss of the investment
resulting from the early redemption
or by other methodology;
(d) the dates on which and amounts
in which principal of the Refunding
Bonds is to be paid, which shall be not
later than thirty (30) years from their
respective dates of issuance, with an
identification of whether the payment is due by stated maturity or by
mandatory sinking fund redemption
of Refunding Bonds of a particular
maturity;

1358

September 17, 2014
(e) the interest rates to be borne by
Refunding Bonds bearing interest at
a fixed rate, the weighted average of
which shall not exceed six percent
(6%) as to Refunding Bonds of any
Series that are Tax-Exempt Obligations or eight percent (8%) as to
Refunding Bonds of any Series that
are Taxable Obligations, or the
method by which the interest rate is
to be determined for Refunding
Bonds bearing interest at variable
rates, consistent with Section 3;
(f) the particular Outstanding Revenue Bonds or portions thereof to be
Refunded Bonds, and the date or
dates on which the Refunded Bonds
shall be called for redemption or otherwise retired;
(g) the title and Series designation
for the Refunding Bonds;
(h) the amount, if any, and source
of any money to be deposited in the
Debt Service Reserve Fund in order to
cause the balance therein to equal the
Debt Service Reserve Requirement, if
and to the extent required by the
applicable Supplemental Indenture,
and any determination as to whether
there shall be a special reserve fund
for the Refunding Bonds of any
Series, separate from the Debt Service
Reserve Fund, and any determination
as to whether a Credit Support Instrument shall be provided in lieu of cash
in the Debt Service Reserve Fund or
such special reserve fund;
(i) the Paying Agent; and
(j) whether any Refunding Bonds
are to be secured by or payable from
any Credit Support Instruments.
It is determined that the terms of
the Refunding Bonds as so determined within the limitations set forth
in this Ordinance and as so specified
and set forth in the Certificate of
Award will be in the best interest of
the City and consistent with all legal
requirements.
The Director of Finance may enter
into a Bond Purchase Agreement with
the Original Purchasers of each
Series of Refunding Bonds setting
forth the conditions for delivery of
the Refunding Bonds that are consistent with this Ordinance, the Certificate of Award, and the Indenture and
that are determined by the Director of
Finance, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, to be customary for water revenue bonds issued by
governmental entities, including,
without limitation, representations as
to the accuracy and completeness of
information contained in the Official
Statement of the City described in Section 14.
Section 5. Application of Proceeds
of Refunding Bonds.

Series of Refunding Bonds shall be

Original Purchasers and subsequent
holders of each Series of the Refunding Bonds, a Supplemental Indenture,
approved as to form by the Director of
Law, not inconsistent with this Ordinance, the Certificate of Award and
the Indenture and not substantially
adverse to the City as may be
approved by the officers signing the
same on behalf of the City. The determination by those officers that a Supplemental Indenture is not substantially adverse to the City shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing
and delivery of that Supplemental
Indenture by those officers. Subject to

31
amended, or amend and restate the
Original Indenture, to permit the City
to obtain a Credit Support Instrument
or to permit increased flexibility for
the use of financial or credit structures and techniques determined by
the Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
to be in the best interests of the City.
In order to cause the proceeds of
each Series of Refunding Bonds and
any funds of the City deposited in an
Escrow Fund to be invested as permitted under Section 9.02 of the Indenture so that the Refunded Bonds are
deemed paid and discharged, and in
order to cause the amount to be
deposited to be dedicated and applied
to the payment of the principal of and
interest and any redemption premium
on the Refunded Bonds as and when
due, to and including the applicable
redemption date, the Director of
Finance is authorized to sign and
deliver one or more Escrow Agreements between the City and the
Trustee as Escrow Agent, approved
as to form by the Director of Law, providing for the establishment of each
Escrow Fund as a trust fund in the
custody of the Trustee and for the
investment, dedication and application of the moneys deposited in the
accounts therein and further providing for the payment of the fees and
expenses of the Trustee for the performance of its duties as Escrow
Agent. Each Escrow Agreement shall
provide for the redemption of the
Refunded Bonds identified in the
applicable Certificate of Award to be
called for redemption prior to maturity and shall provide irrevocable
instruction to the Trustee to effect
such redemption in accordance with
the Indenture. The Director of
Finance is authorized to take such
other actions as may be necessary or
appropriate to accomplish the refunding of Refunded Bonds, including
without limitation, the retention of an
independent public accounting firm
to verify that the securities to be in an
Escrow Fund are of such maturities
or redemption dates and interest payment dates, and bear such interest, as
will be sufficient, together with any
cash in an Escrow Fund, for the payment of debt service on the Refunded
Bond to which the Escrow Fund
relates and to make any determinations required for the interest on the
Refunding Bonds to be excluded from
gross income for federal income tax
purposes.

be maintained a separate account for
each Series of Refunding Bonds that
are Tax-Exempt Obligations within
the Rebate Fund held in the custody
of the Trustee under the Indenture.

payment of debt service and is free
and clear of any pledge or lien given
under the Indenture as security for
the Refunding Bonds or the Outstanding Revenue Bonds. Calculations of
excess earnings that may be due and
payable to the federal government
pursuant to the Code and deposits to
those accounts of the Rebate Fund
shall be made as provided in the
applicable Supplemental Indenture.
Section 9. Remarketing.
In the event that the Director of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
that it is advantageous to the City to
convert the interest on any short-term
or variable rate Outstanding Revenue

32
Bonds or Refunding Bonds to fixed
interest rates for a period of time or to
maturity, or to convert the interest on
any short-term or variable rate Outstanding Revenue Bonds or Refunding Bonds to a different variable rate
period or mode, or to terminate or
take other actions with respect to any
existing Credit Support Instrument
that will require a tender and remarketing of any Outstanding Revenue
Bonds or Refunding Bonds under the
Indenture (any such conversion or
other action or tender or remarketing
being collectively referred to in this
Section as “remarketing”), the City
shall undertake the remarketing in
accordance with the Indenture. In
connection with any remarketing of
Bonds, the Director of Finance is
authorized to take such actions that
she determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, will
facilitate the remarketing of the
Bonds or otherwise be in the best
interests of the City, including without limitation, obtaining one or more
Credit Support Instruments, terminating any Credit Support Instrument,
and entering into agreements with
one or more purchasers for their
direct purchase of the remarketed
Bonds in lieu of a public offering of
the Bonds by a remarketing agent. In
the event the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that it
is necessary to supplement or amend
the Supplemental Indenture applicable to a Series of Bonds to be remarketed in order to address current market conditions or to permit the use of
or to terminate a Credit Support
Instrument
or
otherwise
obtain
financing arrangements advantageous to the City, the Mayor, the
Director of Finance and the Director
of Public Utilities, or any two of them,
are authorized to sign and deliver an
amendment of that Supplemental
Indenture, or an amended and restated Supplemental Indenture, approved
as to form by the Director of Law, subject to the Original Indenture as
theretofore amended.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized to satisfy any Debt Service Reserve Requirement or any special reserve fund requirement for the
Series of Bonds to be remarketed, by
the deposit of a Credit Support Instrument in lieu of cash, as permitted and
more specifically provided in the
Indenture, and to apply cash released
from the Debt Service Reserve Fund
or such special reserve fund to the
payment of costs of remarketing or
other purposes permitted by applicable laws. To the extent the costs of
remarketing are not paid from any
cash released from the Debt Service

authorized to make a Tender Offer for
all or any portion of those Outstanding Revenue Bonds or all or any portion of any one or more maturities of
those Outstanding Revenue Bonds on

Support Instruments or other advantages to the City. The purchase price
for the purchase of any Outstanding
Revenue Bonds tendered for purchase
in response to the Tender Offer shall

provided
the
Director
of
Finance determines that the firms so
retained
possess
the
requisite
resources and experience to provide
the services required of them and that
the terms on which the designated
parties have agreed to provide such
services are fair and commercially
reasonable. The Director of Finance
is authorized to prepare disclosure
documents relating to the terms and
conditions of the Tender Offer and
containing information about the City
and the Waterworks System and to

Section 11. Authorization of Hedging Arrangements.
This Council finds that by engaging in interest rate hedging arrangements with respect to Bonds the City
may reduce its cost of borrowing by
optimizing the relative amounts of its
fixed and variable rate obligations or
minimizing the risk of variations in

1360

September 17, 2014
its debt service costs or obtaining savings by confirming rates of interest
on Bonds in advance of their issuance.
To permit the City to have the flexibility to undertake with respect to
Bonds interest rate swap, swaption,
rate cap, rate collar and other hedging transactions, from time to time,
and to establish the procedures for
approving those transactions, this
Council authorizes the signing and
delivery of one or more agreements,
including amendments or supplements to existing agreements (each,
a “Hedge Agreement”), and any related agreements necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by each Hedge Agreement.
The authorizations in this Section are
supplemental to and not in derogation
of any authority provided by any
other ordinance of this Council concerning hedging arrangements.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
that it is to the financial advantage of
the City and in the City’s best interests that a hedging arrangement be
undertaken by the City with respect
to any Bonds issued or to be issued
under the Indenture, the Director of
Finance may authorize one or more
interest rate hedge transactions in
accordance
with
the
applicable
Hedge Agreement; provided that (a)
the counterparty shall be rated at the
time of signing the Hedge Agreement
not lower than “A” by at least one rating agency or its obligations under
the Hedge Agreement shall be guaranteed or insured by an entity rated
at the time of signing the Hedge
Agreement not lower than “A” by at
least one rating agency, with such
rating in either case determined without regard to a gradation by numerical or plus or minus or other modifier
and (b) the term of each hedge transaction shall not exceed the final maturity of the Bonds to which the hedge
relates.
The Director of Finance shall negotiate the terms of each Hedge Agreement with a counterparty satisfying
the credit criteria in this Ordinance.
The City shall receive a written opinion of a Financial Advisor that the
payments to be made by the counterparty to the City, or by the City to the
counterparty, shall be fair value for
the Hedge Agreement, considering,
among other things, the credit of the
City and the counterparty and the
terms and conditions of the Hedge
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall determine the terms and conditions of the Hedge Agreement, including without limitation, the rates to be
paid by the counterparty to the City
and by the City to the counterparty
under the Hedge Agreement, the time
or times and procedures for the exercise by the counterparty or the City,
as the case may be, of any option
under the Hedge Agreement, and
whether the obligations of the City
under the Hedge Agreement shall be
secured by a Credit Support Instrument. The approval of each interest
rate hedge transaction by the Director of Finance shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing and delivery
of the applicable Hedge Agreement
by the Director of Finance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to terminate any Hedge Agreements in whole or in part or any Credit Support Instrument securing a
Hedge Agreement if the Director of
Finance determines, based on the

September 17, 2014
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
that the City’s best interests will be
served by such termination. The
Director of Finance is further authorized to enter into amendments, novations, assignments or modifications
of a Hedge Agreement or any Credit
Support Instrument securing a Hedge
Agreement determined by the Director of Finance, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the City’s best interests will be served
by such amendment or modification.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from the Net Revenues of the Utility
and may be payable also from other
funds permitted by law to be used for
the purpose, as identified by the
Director of Finance in the Hedge
Agreement. Those payments may be
secured by a pledge of Net Revenues
that may be subordinate to the pledge
of Net Revenues for the Bonds, to the
extent permitted by the Indenture, all
as determined by the Director of
Finance and set forth in the Hedge
Agreement. The obligation of the City
to make payments under any Hedge
Agreement does not and shall not represent or constitute a general obligation, debt, bonded indebtedness or a
pledge of the faith and credit of the
City or the State of Ohio. Nothing
gives any party to any Hedge Agreement the right to have excises, ad valorem or other taxes levied by the City
or the State of Ohio for the payment of
any amounts due under any Hedge
Agreement.
Section 12. Covenants of the City.
The City, by issuance of each Series
of Refunding Bonds, covenants and
agrees with the Holders of that Series
of Refunding Bonds, that:
(a) The City will use the proceeds
of the Refunding Bonds for the purposes specified in Section 2.
(b) The Clerk, or other appropriate
officer of the City, will furnish to the
Original Purchasers and to the
Trustee a true transcript of proceedings, certified by the Clerk or other

reference to the issuance of the
Refunding Bonds, together with
information from the City’s records as
is necessary to determine the regularity and validity of the issuance of the
Refunding Bonds.
(c) The City will, at any and all
times, cause to be done all such further acts and things and cause to be
signed and delivered all further
instruments as may be necessary to
carry out the purpose of the Refunding Bonds and this Ordinance or as
may be required by Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio or the Charter of the City or the Indenture or the
applicable Supplemental Indenture
and will comply with all requirements of law applicable to the Waterworks System and the operation
thereof.
(d) The City will observe and perform all its agreements and obligations provided for in the Refunding
Bonds, this Ordinance, the Indenture
and each Supplemental Indenture. All
of the obligations under this Ordinance and the Indenture and each
Supplemental Indenture are hereby
established as duties specifically
enjoined by law and resulting from
an office, trust or station upon the
City within the meaning of Section
2731.01, Ohio Revised Code.
(e) The City will use, and will
restrict the use and investment of, the
proceeds of the Refunding Bonds that

The City Record
are issued as Tax-Exempt Obligations in such manner and to such
extent as may be necessary so that
(a) the Refunding Bonds will not (i)
constitute private activity bonds,
arbitrage bonds or hedge bonds under
Sections 141, 148 or 149 of the Code or
(ii) be treated other than as bonds to
which Section 103(a) of the Code
applies, and (b) the interest thereon
will not be treated as an item of tax
preference under Section 57 of the
Code.
(f) The City covenants that (a) it
will take or cause to be taken such
actions that may be required of it for
the interest on the Refunding Bonds
that are issued as Tax-Exempt Obligations to be and to remain excluded
from gross income for federal income
tax purposes (b) it will not take or
authorize to be taken any actions that
would adversely affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting for
it, will, among other acts of compliance (i) apply the proceeds of the
Refunding Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing (ii)
restrict the yield on investment property acquired with those proceeds
(iii) make timely rebate payments to
the federal government (iv) maintain
books and records and make calculations and reports, and (v) refrain
from certain uses of proceeds, and, as
applicable, of property financed with
such proceeds, all in such manner and
to the extent necessary to assure such
exclusion of that interest under the
Code.
Each covenant made in this section
with respect to the Refunding Bonds
is also made with respect to all issues
for which any portion of the debt service is paid from proceeds of the
Refunding Bonds (and, if different,
the original issue and any refunding
issues in a Series of refundings), to
the extent such compliance is necessary to assure exclusion of interest on
the Refunding Bonds that are issued
as Tax-Exempt Obligations from
gross income for federal income tax
purposes, and the Director of Finance,
or any other officer having responsibility with respect to the Refunding
Bonds, is authorized to take such
actions with respect to those issues as
they are authorized in this section to
take with respect to the Refunding
Bonds.
The Mayor, the Director of Finance
or any other officer of the City, as
appropriate under the Charter, is
authorized (a) to make or effect any
election,
selection,
designation,
choice, consent, approval or waiver on
behalf of the City with respect to the
Refunding Bonds as the City is permitted or required to make or give
under the federal income tax laws,
including, without limitation, any of
the elections available under Section
148 of the Code, for the purpose of
assuring, enhancing or protecting the
favorable tax treatment or status of
the Refunding Bonds that are issued
as Tax-Exempt Obligations or interest thereon or assisting compliance
with requirements for that purpose,
reducing the burden or expense of
compliance, reducing the rebate
amount or payments or penalties, or
making payments of special amounts
in lieu of making computations to
determine, or paying, excess earnings
as rebate, or obviating those amount
or payments, as determined by that
officer (b) to take any and all other
actions, make or obtain calculations,
make payments, and make or give

1361

33
reports, covenants and certifications
of and on behalf of the City, as may be
appropriate to assure the exclusion of
interest from gross income and the
intended tax status of the Refunding
Bonds that are issued as Tax-Exempt
Obligations, and (c) to give one or
more appropriate certificates of the
City, for inclusion in the transcript of
proceedings for the Refunding Bonds,
setting forth the reasonable expectations of the City regarding the
amount and use of all the proceeds of
the Refunding Bonds, the facts, circumstances and estimates on which
they are based, and other facts and
circumstances relevant to the tax
treatment or status of the Refunding
Bonds and interest thereon.
If the Director of Finance determines, based on the written advice of
a Financial Advisor, and so specifies
in the Certificate of Award that the
best interests of the City would be
served by issuing a Series of Refunding Bonds as Taxable Obligations,
then the tax-related covenants in this
Section shall not apply to or be
required to be made with respect to
the Refunding Bonds of that Series.

submit those applications and to provide to each such agency such information as may be required for the purpose. The Director of Finance is
authorized to contract for one or more
Credit Support Instruments for any

a Financial Advisor, that the Credit

debt service savings to the City, or
will stabilize interest rates on those
Bonds or will minimize the risk of
increased interest expense on those
Bonds. The Director of Finance is further authorized to terminate any such
contract if the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the City’s best interests will be served
by such termination. The cost of
obtaining each rating and the cost of
obtaining or terminating each Credit
Support Instrument, except to the
extent paid by the Original Purchasers in accordance with the Bond
Purchase Agreement, shall be paid
from the proceeds of Refunding
Bonds or funds of the Water Division,
which are appropriated for that purpose.

Polensek, Conwell, J. Johnson, Brady,
Brancatelli, Cummins, Zone and
Keane.
An emergency ordinance designating East 8th Street between Euclid
and Prospect Avenues with a secondary and honorary designation of
“City Club Way”.
Whereas, the City Club has made a
home at 850 Euclid Avenue since 1983,
and some 15 years ago, the Citizens
Building became The City Club Building; and
Whereas, the City Club has had a
few homes over the years, starting
with Weber’s Restaurant off Public
Square in 1912 and perhaps most
famously on Short Vincent Street; and
Whereas, the City Club was founded by some of the great men of our
local history, including Mayor Newton D. Baker, Rabbi Moses Gries,
Ralph Hayes, and Mayo Fesler; and
Whereas, but in these last three
decades, civic leaders have convened
on a regular basis in the City Club’s
second floor home for civil civic dialogue with the express purposes of
engaging the community and finding
solutions to the problems we share;
and
Whereas, the City Club has had its
share of famous speakers — from
Cesar Chavez to Oliver North, House
Speakers Newt Gingrich and Nancy
Pelosi, Pei Min Xing of the Tiannamen Square protests to Condoleezza
Rice — Robert F. Kennedy to Ronald
Reagan, as well as sitting U.S. Presidents; and
Whereas, even more than its
famous speakers, the City Club is
most proud of the service it provides
for the community; and
Whereas, for over 100 years, the
City Club has provided a place and a
practice of bringing people together
to think together about how we can
improve our community, how we can
make government work better, how
we can strengthen our neighborhoods, and how we can respond to the
crises that emerge; and
Whereas, it is the place where current and emerging leaders share their

September 17, 2014
vision for moving the community forward, and where candidates for elective office join in dialogue and debate
so that voters can make informed
decisions; it is also the place where
constituents ask vital questions of
their elected leaders; and
Whereas, the citizens of Cleveland
want to honor the legacy and continued service of the City Club, devoted
as it has been for more than a century
to celebrating Cleveland’s devotion to
civic engagement and free speech,
with a street sign designation of “City
Club Way”; and,
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure for the immediate preservation of public peace,
property, health or safety; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That East 8th Street
between
Euclid
and
Prospect
Avenues is designated with a secondary and honorary designation of
“City Club Way”.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
