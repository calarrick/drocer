these parcels are located in SemiIndustry. Said parcels shall have a
minimum of 50,000 square feet and
in this case 9,240 square feet are
provided. Such premises shall be
enclosed within a minimum 7 foot
high solid masonry wall or slightly

9

solid,
nontransparent,
well-maintained substantial fence; existing
fence is 6 foot high chain link with
approximately 1 foot of barbed wire.
2. Section 349.04(j) states that the
parking area must equal 15% of the

employee and none is proposed.
3. Section 349.07(a) requires that
the off-street parking spaces and
maneuvering areas shall be properly graded for drainage so that all
water is drained within the lot providing such parking spaces, surfaced with concrete, asphalt or other
surfacing materials approved by the
Director of Building and Housing
and the existing surface is gravel.
