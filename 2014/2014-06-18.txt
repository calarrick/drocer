Whereas, recognizing the Fourth of
July is an opportunity for Americans
to reflect and celebrate the founding
of the United States; and
Whereas, July would be an appropriate month to designate as “Buy
American Month” and send a message
to our manufacturers by buying
American exclusively for all of July
to bring jobs back to America; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the

approximately twenty permanent
jobs in addition to construction jobs;
and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland supports the collaboration between Welcome House, the Cuyahoga County
