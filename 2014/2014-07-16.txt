2010, Resolution No. 580-11, adopted
December 7, 2011, Resolution No. 25412, adopted June 13, 2012, and Resolution No. 346-12, passed July 18,
2012, fixing rates for electric services or products of the Division of
Cleveland
Public
Power
(“Division”), Department of Public Utilities, which rates were previously
approved by the Council of the City
of Cleveland and enacted in various
sections of Chapter 523 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio,
1976 (“C.O.”), is amended further by
revising that part fixing the rate of
an “energy adjustment charge,” subject to the approval of the Council
of the City of Cleveland, to read as
follows:
“Energy Adjustment Charge”
(a) An additional incremental
charge for excess fuel and power
production
and
purchase
power
costs may be applied to the rates
prescribed in Sections 523.02 to
523.065 C.O. and any other rate
schedule as may be adopted by the
City.
(b) The incremental charge shall
be based on the fuel and purchase
power cost per kilowatt hour delivered
calculated
under
divisions
(c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.
(c)(1) The fuel and purchase
power cost per kilowatt hour sold to
residential ratepayers shall be determined by dividing the sum of the
cost of the kilowatt hours purchased
from the Power Authority of the
State of New York and the average
cost of kilowatt hours purchased
from other sources needed to supply
the residential customers by the
total kilowatt hours distributed to
residential customers. The incremental charge calculated herein
shall be adjusted by subtracting 15
mils per kilowatt hour for residential customers who provide the Division of Cleveland Public Power with
a certificate of reduction of taxes
obtained pursuant to the Homestead
Exemption provisions of Sections
323.157
of
the
323.151
through
Revised Code, and 9.75 mils per kilowatt hour for all other residential
customers.
(2) Except as provided in Section
523.048 C.O., the fuel and purchase
power cost per kilowatt hour sold to
all ratepayers, other than residential
ratepayers,
during
the
twelve
months of the year, shall be determined by dividing the sum of the
total cost of coal, oil, gas and purchase power by the total kilowatt

4
hours distributed, except that the
computation shall exclude the cost
of PASNY power and the amount of
PASNY power allocable to kilowatt
hours distributed, and shall exclude
the costs of all purchase power and
kilowatt
hours
from
a
specific
source or sources purchased by the
Division for distribution to ratepayers
under
Sections
523.048
and
523.049 C.O. The incremental charge
calculated herein shall be adjusted
by subtracting 3.0 mils per kilowatt
hour.
(d) At the end of each month, the
Division of Cleveland Public Power
shall determine the actual fuel and
power costs during such month as
herein provided and may adjust the
additional incremental charge for
future months to defer or over-recover the total cost of power in order
to stabilize customer bills.
Be it further resolved that, under
the authority of Charter Section 112,
rates of the Division of Cleveland
Public Power, Department of Public
Utilities, for electric service agreements with commercial customers,
subject to the approval of the Council of the City of Cleveland, are
fixed as follows:
“Electric Service Agreements with
Commercial Customers”
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Commissioner of Cleveland Public Power is
authorized to enter into electric service agreements with commercial
customers whose peak demand is or
will be equal to or in excess of one
hundred fifty (150) kilowatts that
provide for the adjustment of the
commercial customer’s rates and
other charges under the following
terms and conditions:
(a) The Division of Cleveland
Public Power must recover not less
than the incremental cost to provide
service to the commercial customer
as computed by the Division of
Cleveland Public Power;
(b) The adjusted rates and other
charges may not exceed the rates
and charges in the otherwise applicable rate schedule in this chapter;
(c) The adjustment must be made
at a level to retain net margins and
so that the resulting rates and
charges in combination with service
levels and length of contract provide
competitive terms; and
(d) The necessity for the adjustment of rates and other charges
must be based on uniform criteria
determined by the Commissioner
and approved by the Director of
Public Utilities, including, if applicable, that a commercial customer’s
existing contract is approaching
expiration; a bona fide offer has
been made to a commercial customer
from an electric competitor of the
Division of Cleveland Public Power;
the agreement generates a positive
contribution margin in excess of
that which would be obtained by not
entering into the agreement; the
agreement is necessary to protect
Cleveland Public Power’s service
area, customer base, and revenue
stream; the commercial customer’s
load profile provides a beneficial
contribution to Cleveland Public
Power’s load profile; and that similarly situated commercial customers
receive similar adjustments.

The City Record
All electric service agreements
entered under this section shall
have a term of at least five years
and shall be valid and enforceable
at law.
Be it further resolved that all
other provisions of Resolution No.
140-95, adopted February 27, 1995, as
