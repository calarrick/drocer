“Victoria and Michael Sokolowski

Whereas, in 1923 Victoria and
Michael Sokolowski founded a Polish
restaurant on a bank of the Cuyahoga

Whereas, today, the family-owned
Sokolowski’s University Inn serves
edible homages to the city’s immigrant-driven industrial past, dishing
sturdy comfort foods like cabbage
rolls that once fueled the city’s
growth; and,
Whereas, what began as a tavern
when the Tremont neighborhood was
flush with blue-collar steelworkers,
expanded to cafeteria-style service in
the 50s, and has evolved, more recently into a touchstone restaurant for
Polish families in search of their culinary roots; and
Whereas, Sokolowski’s University
Inn was just named a 2014 winner of
the James Beard Foundation’s “American Classics” Award for its timeless
appeal and quality food that reflects
the character of the community; and
Whereas, the citizens of Cleveland
want to honor the legacy of Victoria
and Michael Sokolowski and the
Sokolowski family with a street sign
designation of “Victoria and Michael
Sokolowski Way”; and,
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure for the immediate preservation of public peace,
property, health or safety; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of

between Abbey and University Roads
is designated with a secondary and
honorary designation of “Victoria and
Michael Sokolowski Way”.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all

encountered due to the blockage of
two (2) outfalls. Various methods
were employed to correct the soil
bearing issues associated with the
saturated subgrade. During the excavation of the east-side taxiway pavement, unsuitable subgrade in the
form of rubbish was encountered. In
an effort to mitigate these issues, the
typical pavement section was revised
to include subgrade fabric and an
increased aggregate depth. A portion
of the additional material and labor
associated with these items were paid
under Contingency Authorization #1.
• Drainage Improvements
Drainage
improvements
were
required to remove blockages of two
outfalls on the west side of the airfield (see aforementioned section
above). The improvements included
re-routing of outfall #1 and installation of extra pipe sections for outfall
#2.

was that there was little to no fill over
the existing utilities including the
primary power to the Runway 24R
Glide Slope, control power to the Runway 24R Localizer, and the Taxiway
F edge light circuit. This item will
lower and re-grade the existing utilities to the proper depth or reroute
them out of the runway safety area as
necessary. the grades and increased
the depth of the typical roadway section. A portion of these costs have
