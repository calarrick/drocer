An emergency resolution Supporting the observance of “Earth Hour

Whereas, on March 29, 2014, the
world once again observed “Earth
Hour” when hundreds of millions of
people, organizations, corporations
and governments around the world
came together to make a bold statement about their concern for climate
change by turning off their lights for
one hour between the 8:30 pm and 9:30
pm; and
Whereas, in the United States, participants turned off their lights, sending a clear message that we want to
“turn out the lights” on dirty air, dangerous dependency on foreign oil and
costly climate change impacts, and
make the switch to cleaner air, a
strong economic future and a more
secure nation; and
Whereas, since its inception seven
years ago, Earth Hour has become a
global phenomenon; and
Whereas, more than 7000 cities and
towns in 150 countries worldwide
switched off their lights for Earth
Hour 2014, in the annual display of
commitment to protect our planet; and
Whereas, as in years past, during
Earth Hour 2014, iconic buildings and
landmarks from Asia Pacific to
Europe and Africa to the Americas
were switched off; people across the
world from all walks of life turned off
their lights and came together in celebration and contemplation of the one
thing we all have in common – our
planet; and
Whereas, landmarks from around
the world went dark for Earth Hour
2014, including: the Empire State
Building; the Brooklyn Bridge; Broadway Theater Marquees; the Las
Vegas Strip; United Nations Headquarters; the Golden Gate Bridge;
Seattle’s Space Needle; Church of Latter-Day Saints Temple; the Gateway
Arch in St Louis; the Great Pyramids
of Giza; the Acropolis and Parthenon
in Athens; Christ the Redeemer Statue in Rio de Janeiro; St. Peter’s Basilica in Vatican City; Big Ben and Houses of Parliament in London; Elysee

mutually agreed upon statewide standards for use of traffic cameras if a
local municipality chooses to use
them; and
Whereas, this Council does not support the passage of Amended House
Bill 69 and asks that members of the
Ohio Senate State Government Oversight and Reform Committee reject
this legislation as a violation of local
charter municipalities’ Constitutional
Home Rule authority; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes
Amended House Bill 69, which prohibits the use of red light and traffic
cameras by municipalities in Ohio, as
a violation of charter municipalities’
Home Rule authority.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit a copy of this
resolution to all members of the Ohio
General Assembly.

shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 395-14.
By Council Members J. Johnson,
Kelley,
Pruitt,
Zone,
Cummins,
Mitchell, Conwell, Brancatelli, Cleveland and Sweeney.
An emergency resolution opposing
Amended House Bill 69, which prohibits the use of red light and traffic
cameras by municipalities in Ohio, as
a violation of charter municipalities’
Home Rule authority.
Whereas, Amended House Bill 69
would ban across Ohio red light and
speed traffic cameras, with the one
exception for school zones if a local
law enforcement officer is present;
and
Whereas, the proposed bill, which
was passed by the Ohio House of Representatives in 2013, is now being considered for passage by the Ohio State
Senate State Government Oversight
and Reform Committee; and
Whereas, if passed, Amended
House Bill 69 would preempt local legislation of Charter cities, like Cleveland and Columbus, where the majority of city council members voted in
favor of using the traffic cameras;
and
Whereas, this Council believes the
decision to use or not to use traffic
cameras is not for the Ohio Legislature but solely the right of local charter municipalities under the Home
Rule provisions of the Ohio Constitution; and
Whereas, this Council supports a
partnership with the Ohio Legislature
and the Governor to work towards

Res. No. 406-14.
By Council Members Brancatelli,
Zone, Pruitt, Polensek, Conwell,
Mitchell, Cummins, J. Johnson, Reed
and Cleveland.
An emergency resolution strongly
urging the U.S. House of Representative’s Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies to provide
at least $3.3 billion in formula funding for the Community Development
Block Grant for FY 2015.
Whereas, the U.S House of Representatives Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies is considering Community Development
Block Grant (CDBD) funding for next
year; and
Whereas, the subcommittee develops priorities for the FY 2015 Transportation and Urban Development
Appropriations Act which will determine the amount of the CDBG formula; and
Whereas, the CDBG is one of the
most effective federal programs for
growing the local economy and
investing in housing initiatives for
the most vulnerable populations in
our communities; and
Whereas, since 2012, funding for
the CDBG has been cut by 25% and
has severely limited economic and
housing programs and investments
for low and moderate income families; and
Whereas, CDBG funding is critical
to the City of Cleveland to recover
from the foreclosure crisis as well as
to provide both new home construc-

424

April 2, 2014
tion and home rehabilitation assistance for low and moderate income
families; and
Whereas, City of Cleveland CDBG
funding has been reduced from $29
million to $19 million since 2004; and
Whereas, every $1.00 of CDBG
spending leverages an additional
$4.05 in non-CDBG funding; and
Whereas, this Council requests the
subcommittee again provide at least
$3.3 billion in formula funding for the
CDBG for FY 2015; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council strongly urges the U.S. House of Representative’s Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies to provide
at least $3.3 billion in formula funding for the Community Development
Block Grant for FY 2015.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
resolution to Tom Latham, Chairman,
Subcommittee on Transportation,
Housing and Urban Development and
Related Agencies; Ed Pastor, Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies; and
Marcia Fudge, Congresswoman, District 11, Ohio.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
