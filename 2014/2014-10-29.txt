An emergency resolution declaring
October 20, 2014 as Cleveland Down
Syndrome Day, and encouraging our
citizens to work together to promote
respect and inclusion of individuals
with Down syndrome and to celebrate
their accomplishments and contributions.
Whereas, approximately one in
every 691 children are born with
Down syndrome;  and
Whereas, Down syndrome occurs
in people of all races and economic
levels;  and
Whereas, there are over 400,000
individuals living with Down syndrome in the United States; and
Whereas, people with Down syndrome attend school, work, participate in decisions that affect them,
and contribute to society in many
wonderful ways; and
Whereas, the Up Side of Downs of
Northeast Ohio has been working
for over 30 years to provide support,
education and advocacy to individuals with Down syndrome, their families and the community, and currently serves over 900 families; and
Whereas, through public awareness, the city of Cleveland celebrates the hard work and progress
made by parents, self-advocates,
medical professionals, researchers,
educators, and many non-profit organizations including, but not limited
to, the Up Side of Downs; and
Whereas,
despite
dramatic
increases in lifespan and intellectual ability in the U.S., there is still
much work to be done regarding the
rights to equality, inclusion, education, medical care, research and support for people with Down syndrome;
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the

peace, property, health or safety,

Res. No. 1398-14.
By Council Members Brady and J.
Johnson.
An emergency resolution requesting the Ohio Development Services
Agency to make policy revisions to
existing criteria related to the Ohio
Preservation Tax Credit in order to
create a more equitable playing field
for smaller-scale projects.

1578

October 29, 2014
Whereas, the Ohio Historic Preservation Tax Credit is an invaluable
program assisting non-profits and
developments to save Ohio’s historic
structures as well as creating jobs
for Ohio residents; and
Whereas, the present scoring system by which projects vie to secure
an award, unintentionally eliminates
neighborhood-scale
projects
(those with over $8 million dollars
in rehabilitation costs) located in
small cities and urban neighborhoods; and
Whereas, the neighborhood-scale
projects, though costly, are smaller
in square footage than large downtown projects and thus can never
compete in number of construction
jobs; and
Whereas, in discussions with staff
at the Ohio Development Services
Agency, some policy revisions were
proposed that could be implemented
administratively, including:
• increase the intermediate project
set aside of qualified rehabilitation
expenditure to $10 million dollars for
the present $8 million dollars or less;
• increase the small projects pool
to $2 million dollars; and
• create a strategic initiative set
aside of $5 million dollars in annual
Ohio Historic Preservation Tax Credits.
Whereas, proposals such as these
have been implemented by other
state agencies administering tax
credit programs to increase flexibility and ensure a balance in type of
project and geographic location; and
Whereas, Ohio Development Services Agency staff might also consider new or revised point scoring
categories for the set aside pool
thereby increasing the differentiation among projects and creating
opportunities to fund projects in
greater alignment with the Agency’s
objectives; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
requests the Ohio Development Services Agency to make policy revisions to existing criteria related to
the Ohio Preservation Tax Credit in
order to create a more equitable playing field for smaller-scale projects.
Section 2. That the Clerk of the
Council is directed to transmit copies
of this resolution to the administrative body of the Ohio Development
Services Agency
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from

An emergency resolution recognizing the importance of public transportation to the future of our city.

October 29, 2014
Whereas, as an integral component of a Statewide Transit Needs
Study,
the
Ohio
Department
of
Transportation is conducting several regional meetings during the
month of October; and
Whereas, the purpose of the study

needs of public transit and determine how much financial assistance
is needed from the State of Ohio;
and
Ohio
Whereas,
the
Northeast
region will hold its meeting on October 21, 2014 at the RTA offices in
downtown Cleveland; and
Whereas, key stakeholders will be
in attendance to discuss the importance of public transportation to the
City of Cleveland and to highlight
the growing need for RTA services
to reduce transportation inequity in
impoverished neighborhoods; and
Whereas, this council recognizes
that public transportation provides
citizens with a viable option to driving which, among other things, is
critical to getting to schools, jobs
and healthcare, and to reducing traffic congestion, parking needs and
traffic related negative environmental impact; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,

Ord. No. 1395-14.
By Council Members Brady and
Brancatelli.
An emergency ordinance declaring
a moratorium on the review and
issuance of zoning permits, certificates of occupancy, and other license
or permit applications for hookah
lounge operations and vapor lounge
operations in the City of Cleveland.
Whereas,
hookah
lounges
or
hookah bars, establishments where
patrons
share
flavored
tobacco
known as shisha, or non-tobacco
herbal shisha from a communal
hookah or waterpipe placed on a
table, have become popular in Cleveland in recent years; by whatever
name it might be known, hereinafter “hookah lounges”; and
Whereas, vapor lounges are establishments
similar
to
hookah
lounges, where patrons use a heating element that vaporizes a substance that releases nicotine, tobacco, flavored vapor or other substances through one or more electronic or battery operated delivery
devices, including devices known as
electronic cigarettes, vape pens or
hookah pens, and known variously
as vape bars, vape lounges, e-cigarette lounges or vape cafes; by
whatever name it might be known,
hereinafter “vapor lounges”; and
Whereas,
research
shows
that
hookah smoke can do as much or
more damage to your health as
smoking cigarettes or cigars; further, devices that vaporize substances, such as electronic cigarettes, are not emission free and the
use of such devices increases fine
particle air pollution and levels of
potentially carcinogenic compounds
in people who use them and;
Whereas, a study by the World
Health Organization indicates that
smoke inhaled during a typical
hookah session of one hour can
equal 100 cigarettes or more; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that a number of hookah lounge
establishments are operating in the

City of Cleveland in violation of
Ohio’s Smoking Ban (Chapter 3794
of the Revised Code) as well as
other state and local laws; and
Whereas, a number of hookah
lounges in the city are connected to
other businesses, including restaurants, allow patrons to bring in alcohol, and allow underage drinking
and smoking; moreover, numerous
fights and shootings have occurred
outside these establishments; and
Whereas, most recently, a young
man was shot and killed outside one
such hookah lounge on the City’s
west side; and
Whereas, because of concern for
the health and safety of the citizens
of the City, the public nuisances
hookah lounge present, as well as
the detrimental effects to the health
of patrons of hookah lounges and
vapor lounges, this Council finds it
necessary to evaluate how best to
regulate hookah lounge operations
and vapor lounge operations in the
city and to consider their prohibition; and
Whereas, this Council will consider legislation that would regulate or
prohibit hookah lounge operations
and vapor lounge operations in the
City; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health, safety, or
welfare in that a moratorium on the
review and issuance of zoning permits, certificates of occupancy, and
other license or permit applications
for hookah lounge operations and
vapor lounge operations in the City
is necessary to enable this Council
to consider reasonable regulations
or the prohibition of hookah lounge
operations and vapor lounge operations; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That, for the reasons stated in the preamble, this Council
declares a moratorium on the review
and issuance of zoning permits, certificates of occupancy, and other

October 29, 2014
license or permit applications for
hookah lounge operations and vapor
lounge operations for a period commencing on the effective date of this
ordinance and ending on either the
effective date of an ordinance regulating or prohibiting hookah lounge
operations and vapor lounge operations or April 20, 2015, whichever date
occurs first.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately upon its passage and approval
by the Mayor; otherwise it shall take
effect and be in force from and after
the earliest period allowed by law.
Passed October 20, 2014.
Effective October 22, 2014.
