An emergency resolution supporting President Obama’s new initiative
“My Brother’s Keeper” which will
work to implement practical strategies to ensure that young men of color
are on equal footing with their peers
in having access to opportunities to
achieve the American dream.
Whereas, data shows that boys and
young men of color, regardless of
where they are from, suffer disproportionately from poverty, family instability, failure in school, unemployment, incarceration and homicide;
and
Whereas, by the time they are in
the 4th grade, 86% of African American boys and 82% of Hispanic boys
are reading below proficiency levels –
compared to 54% of white 4th graders
reading below proficiency levels; and
Whereas, African American and
Hispanic young men are more than
six times as likely to be victims of
murder than their white peers, and
account for almost half of the country’s murder victims each year; and
Whereas, President Obama has
brought to the forefront this often
overlooked crisis among African
American and Hispanic boys and
young men by recently announcing
the My Brother’s Keeper initiative
and establishing a My Brother’s
Keeper Task Force that will take a
collaborative,
multi-disciplinary
approach to build ladders of opportunity and unlock the full potential of
boys and young men of color; and
Whereas, across the country are initiatives currently working to address
the challenges that befall boys and
young men of color; for example,
Cities United helps mayors and
municipal leaders across the country
create safer, healthier communities
by working across multiple sectors to
identify achievable, commonsense
solutions to ending the high levels of
violence that affect too many African
American boys; and
Whereas, My Brother’s Keeper is
focused on action-oriented public and
private partnerships to make sure
that every young man of color who is
willing to work hard and lift himself
up has an opportunity to get ahead
and reach his full potential; and
Whereas, the My Brother’s Keeper
Task Force will determine which public and private efforts are working,
how the Federal government can support those efforts, and how to get
more people involved in those efforts;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
