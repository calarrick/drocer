ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 692-14.
By Council Members Pruitt, Cummins and Polensek.
An emergency resolution supporting
Ohio’s
Energy
Efficiency
Resource and Renewable Portfolio
Standards and urging the Ohio House
of Representatives, the Ohio Senate,
and Governor John Kasich to oppose
Substitute Senate Bill 58, Senate Bill
34, Senate Bill 310, and any future legislation that would impede Ohio’s
advancement in energy efficiency.
Whereas, Ohio’s current Energy
Efficiency
Resource
Standard
requires electric utilities to implement energy efficiency programs that
have proven to reduce Ohio’s energy
consumption, reassure investment in
energy efficient products and technologies, and create local jobs; and
Whereas, Ohio’s current Renewable
Portfolio Standard requires electric
utilities to purchase and/or increase
production of energy from renewable
energy sources that have proven to
reduce Ohio’s reliance on fossil fuels
as a primary energy source, advance
renewable energy projects, keep
Ohio’s businesses competitive and
create jobs; and
Whereas, in 2008 these Standards
were enacted by the Ohio legislature
with a nearly unanimous bipartisan
vote; and
Whereas, these current Standards
will result in a projected 22.5% reduction of Ohio’s energy use by the year
2025; and
Whereas, Substitute Senate Bill 58.
Senate Bill 34 and Senate Bill 310 propose to reduce and/or eliminate these
energy efficiency and renewable
energy standards; and
Whereas, Ohio businesses are integral in the manufacturing and construction of wind farms, helping the
state of Ohio place fourth in the
nation for employment in the wind
industry; and
Whereas, Ohio’s energy efficiency
sector is ranked 3rd in the nation and
Ohio’s manufacturing industry places
second in the nation for its ability to
manufacture wind turbines and all of
their parts; and
Whereas, increased efforts in energy efficiency have reduced harmful
emissions, saved consumers and local
businesses money, and allowed for
new job opportunities for citizens;
and
Whereas, the American Council for
an Energy Efficient Economy has
established that for every dollar
invested in energy efficiency programs, consumers save more than
three dollars on their utility bills; and
Whereas, these programs have collectively saved Ohio businesses and
consumers more than $1 billion in utility costs since 2009 according to
reports submitted to the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio by Ohio’s
major utilities; and
Whereas, current Standards have
contributed to more than 10,000 jobs
for Ohioans in the energy efficiency
sector and more than 25,000 jobs in the
clean energy sector with over 400
advanced energy businesses; and
Whereas, continued energy efficiency investments will result in
improved local economy, enhanced
infrastructure, and will transform
Ohio’s manufacturing base; and

731

9
Whereas, Sub S.B. 58, S.B. 34, and
S.B. 310 would remove incentives for
clean energy companies to locate or
expand in Ohio, placing 400 businesses and 25,000 jobs at risk over the next
12 years; and
Whereas, Sub S.B. 58, S.B. 34, S.B.
310 will make Ohio less competitive to
prospective businesses in the clean
energy market by making electricity
more expensive to buy; and
Whereas, Ohio’s consumers would
see an increase on their utility bills
by removing the energy efficiency
standards and any incentives for businesses to invest in energy efficiency
would be removed; and
Whereas, rolling back Ohio’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Portfolio Standard will have significant
impacts on Ohio’s public health, economy and jobs
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports
Ohio’s
Energy
Efficiency
Resource and Renewable Portfolio
Standards and urges the Ohio House
of Representatives, the Ohio Senate,
and Governor John Kasich to oppose
Substitute Senate Bill 58, Senate Bill
34, Senate Bill 310, and any future legislation that would impede Ohio’s
advancement in energy efficiency.
Section 2. That the Clerk is directed
to transmit copies of this resolution to
Governor John Kasich; William
Batchelder, Speaker of the Ohio
House; Keith Faber, President of the
Ohio Senate; Peter Stautberg, Chair of
the Ohio House Public Utilities Committee; and William Seitz, Chair of
the Ohio Senate Public Utilities Committee.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.

energy adjustment charge; and to
enact new Section 523.196 of the Codified Ordinances relating to electric
service agreements with commercial
customers.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of

Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, as amended by Ordinance
No. 216-12, passed April 16, 2012, is
amended to read as follows:
Section 523.21 Energy Adjustment
Charge
(a) An additional incremental
charge for excess fuel and power production and purchase power costs
may be applied to the rates prescribed
in Sections 523.02 to 523.065 and any
other rate schedule as may be adopted
by the City.
(b) The incremental charge shall
be based on the fuel and purchase
power cost per kilowatt hour delivered calculated under divisions
(c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.
(c) (1) The fuel and purchase
power cost per kilowatt hour sold to
residential ratepayers shall be determined by dividing the sum of the cost
of the kilowatt hours purchased from
the Power Authority of the State of
New York and the average cost of
kilowatt hours purchased from other
sources needed to supply the residential customers by the total kilowatt
hours distributed to residential customers. The incremental charge calculated herein shall be adjusted by
subtracting fifteen (15) mils per kilowatt hour for residential customers
who provide the Division of Cleveland
Public Power with a certificate of
reduction of taxes obtained pursuant
to the Homestead Exemption provisions of Sections 323.151 through
323.157 of the Revised Code, and nine
and three-quarters (9.75) mils per
kilowatt hour for all other residential
customers.
(2) Except as provided in Section
523.048, the fuel and purchase power
cost per kilowatt hour sold to all
ratepayers, other than residential
ratepayers, during the twelve (12)
months of the year, shall be determined by dividing the sum of the total
cost of coal, oil, gas and purchase
power by the total kilowatt hours distributed, except that the computation
shall exclude the cost of PASNY
power and the amount of PASNY
power allocable to kilowatt hours distributed, and shall exclude the costs
of all purchase power and kilowatt
hours from a specific source or
sources purchased by the Division for
distribution to ratepayers pursuant to
Sections 523.048 and 523.049. The
incremental charge calculated herein

May 28, 2014
shall be adjusted by subtracting three
(3.0) mils per kilowatt hour.
(d) At the end of each month, the
Division of Cleveland Public Power
shall determine the actual fuel and
power costs during such month as
herein provided and may adjust the
additional incremental charge for
future months to defer or over-recover the total cost of power in order
to stabilize customer bills.
Section 3. That existing Section
523.21 of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended by
Ordinance No. 216-12, passed April 16,
2012, is repealed.
Section 4. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
supplemented by enacting new Section 523.196 to read as follows:

Agreements with Commercial Customers
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Commissioner of Cleveland Public Power is authorized to enter into electric service

charges under the following terms
and conditions:
(a) The Division of Cleveland Public Power must recover not less than
the incremental cost to provide service to the commercial customer as
computed by the Division of Cleveland Public Power;
(b) The adjusted rates and other
charges may not exceed the rates and
charges in the otherwise applicable
rate schedule in this chapter;
(c) The adjustment must be made
at a level to retain net margins and so
that the resulting rates and charges
in combination with service levels
and length of contract provide competitive terms; and
(d) The necessity for the adjustment of rates and other charges must
be based on uniform criteria determined by the Commissioner and
approved by the Director of Public
Utilities, including, if applicable, that
a commercial customer’s existing contract is approaching expiration; a
bona fide offer has been made to a
commercial customer from an electric
competitor of the Division of Cleveland Public Power; the agreement
generates a positive contribution
margin in excess of that which would
be obtained by not entering into the
agreement; the agreement is necessary to protect Cleveland Public
Power’s service area, customer base
and revenue stream; the commercial
customer’s load profile provides a
beneficial contribution to Cleveland
Public Power’s load profile; and that
similarly situated commercial customers receive similar adjustments.
All electric service agreements
entered under this section shall have
a term of at least five years and shall
be valid and enforceable at law.
Section 5. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure
and, provided it receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take

upon its passage and approval by the
