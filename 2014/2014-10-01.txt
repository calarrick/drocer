Res. No. 1237-14.
By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency resolution supporting the Round 13 Catalytic Project
Application of Landmark Management to the Ohio Development Services Agency for State Historic
Preservation Tax Credits for the
adaptive reuse and redevelopment of
the May Company Building, located
at 200 Euclid Avenue.
Whereas, each year the State of
Ohio through the Ohio Development
Services Agency allocates State Historic Preservation Tax Credits to
encourage private investment in
redeveloping historically significant
buildings throughout Ohio using a
competitive proposal process; and
Whereas, Landmark Management
is applying for the State’s newly
enacted $25 million tax credit award
under the Catalytic Project Application that will only be awarded to
one project within the entire State
of Ohio during Round 13 for the
biennium that includes 2014 and
2015, in order to execute its plans
for redevelopment of the May Company Building; and
Whereas,

Square, at a central point in Downtown Cleveland at the heart of our
transit operations where residents
and visitors enter the downtown
experience to work, play or visit our
community; and
Whereas, the May Company Building’s
redevelopment
will
anchor

Public Square at the 2016 Republican National Convention, and have
a catalytic impact on the broader
image of Cleveland and Ohio on a
national stage; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
supports Landmark Management’s

Building as a high priority initiative
for future development in the heart
of Downtown to benefit the citizens

Whereas, the Directors of Capital

implementing Opportunity Corridor;
and
Whereas, ODOT has also requested
the City to convey certain easements
