believe is the subject of an offense.
(c) The officer shall give written
notice of the seizure and impoundment to the owner, keeper, or harborer of the animal that was seized and
impounded within 3 days of seizure if
they can be found. If the officer is
unable to give the notice to the owner,
keeper, or harborer of the animal, the

The City Record
officer shall post the notice on the
door of the residence or in another
conspicuous place on the premises at
which the animal was seized.
(1) If the seizure is for a violation
of Sections 603.072, 603.08, 603.091, or
603.092 the notice shall include a
statement that, upon written request
by the owner, keeper, or harborer of
the animal to the impounding agency,
which is received by the impounding
agency within five calendar days of
the notice of seizure and impoundment, a hearing will be held at the
next available court date, or no later
than three days from the date the
notice of a request for a hearing was
received, whichever is earlier. If a
hearing is not timely requested, the
animal is deemed forfeited without
hearing and the impounding agency
may determine the disposition of the
animal.
(2) If the seizure is for a violation
of Sections 603.09 the notice shall
include a statement that, upon written request by the owner, keeper, or
harborer of the animal to the
impounding
agency,
which
is
received by the impounding agency
within ten calendar days of the notice
of seizure and impoundment, a hearing will be held at the next available
court date, or no later than three days
from the date the notice of a request
for a hearing was received, whichever is earlier. If a hearing is not timely
requested, the animal is deemed forfeited without hearing and the

than thirty days beginning on the
date on which the animal was seized
and impounded.
(d) An animal that is seized under
this section may be humanely
destroyed immediately or at any time
during impoundment or otherwise
provided with veterinary care if a
licensed veterinarian determines it to
be necessary because the animal is
suffering.
(e) (1) If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the animal has requested a
hearing in writing, the court shall
hold a hearing to determine whether
the officer impounding an animal had
probable cause to seize the animal. If
the court determines that probable
cause exists, the court shall determine the amount of a bond or cash
deposit that is needed to provide for
the animal's care and keeping for not
less than thirty days beginning on the
date on which the animal was
impounded. If a hearing is not timely
requested, the animal is deemed forfeited without hearing and the
impounding agency may determine
the disposition of the animal.
(2) If the court determines that
probable cause does not exist, the
court immediately shall order the
impounding agency to return the animal to its owner if possible.
(3) If the court determines that
probable cause exists and determines
the amount of a bond or cash deposit,
the case shall continue and the owner
shall post a bond or cash deposit to
provide for the animal's care and
keeping for not less than thirty days
beginning on the date on which the

1708

November 26, 2014
animal was impounded. The owner
may renew a bond or cash deposit by
posting, not later than ten days following the expiration of the period
for which a previous bond or cash
deposit was posted, a new bond or
cash deposit in an amount that the
court, in consultation with the
impounding agency, determines is
sufficient to provide for the animal's
care and keeping for not less than
thirty days beginning on the date on
which the previous period expired. If
no bond or cash deposit is posted or if
a bond or cash deposit expires and is
not renewed, the impounding agency
may determine the disposition of the
animal unless the court issues an
order that specifies otherwise. The
notice provided in this section shall
include notice that if no bond or cash
deposit is posted or if the bond or cash
deposit expires and is not renewed
and the owner or person in control of
the animal fails to appear for the
hearing, the impounding agency may
determine the disposition of the animal.
(f) If a person is convicted of committing an offense, the court may
impose the following additional
penalties against the person:
(1) A requirement that the person
pay for the costs incurred by the
impounding agency in caring for an
animal involved in the applicable
offense, provided that the costs were
incurred during the animal's seizure
or impoundment. A bond or cash
deposit posted under this section may
be applied to the costs.
(2) An order permanently terminating the person's right to possession,
title, custody, or care of the animal
that was involved in the offense. If
the court issues such an order, the
court shall order the disposition of the
animal.
(g) If a person is found not guilty
of committing an offense, the court
immediately shall order the impounding agency to return the animal to its
owner if possible and to return the
entire amount of any bond or cash
deposit posted under division (e) of
this section. If the animal cannot be
returned because it has been adopted
or euthanized the impounding agency
shall pay the fair market value of the
animal at the time that it was
impounded plus statutory interest as
defined in Section 1343.03 of the
Revised Code from the date of the
impoundment or an amount determined by the court to be equal to the
cost of treatment of the injury to the
animal, as applicable. The requirements established in this division
regarding the return of a bond or cash
deposit and the payment of the reasonable market value of the companion animal shall not apply in the case
of a dog that was not registered, in
accordance with applicable registration laws, at the time it was seized
and impounded.
(h) If charges are filed for an
offense described in this Section
against the custodian or caretaker of
an animal, but the animal that is the
subject of the charges is not impounded, the court in which the charges are
pending may order the owner or person having custody of the animal to
provide to the animal the necessities
described in division (C)(5), (D)(2),
and (E)(5) of Section 959.131 of the
Revised Code until the final disposition of the charges. If the court issues
an order of that nature, the court also
may authorize an officer or another

animal is being kept, at the times and
under the conditions that the court
may set, to determine whether the
animal is receiving those necessities
and to remove and impound the animal if the animal is not receiving
those necessities.
(i) Nothing in this Section shall be
interpreted to apply to an animal
impounded under Section 603.03.

Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
as amended by various ordinances,
to add gender identity and expression to employment nondiscrimination laws for goals and compliance
of contractors.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of

Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the following sections of the Codified Ordinances of

Section 135.40, as amended by Ordinance No. 1126-75, passed July 25, 1977,
Sections 187.15 and 187.16, as
amended by Ordinance No. 77-08,
passed February 4, 2008,
Sections 321.17 and 623.16, as
amended by Ordinance No. 77-94,
passed March 14, 1994, and
Section 665.15, as amended by Ordinance No. 162-A-2000, passed December 4, 2000, are amended to read as follows:
Section 135.40 Using Services of
Local Colleges and Universities
In carrying out and implementing
the provisions of Section 135.37, the
Director of Public Safety shall actively seek out, utilize and establish a
working plan and program with any
local college or university in establishing an in-service training program and also to further the education of members of the uniform ranks
in the Division of Police either by setting up new or utilizing existing programs of education, leading to courses in or a degree in a field of education relating directly or indirectly to
police work. For purposes of such con-

The City Record
tinuing and further education, the
Director of Public Safety may rely on
recommendations of the Personnel
Counselor as to those members of the
Division of Police who would reasonably appear to benefit from a program
of continuing or further education at
local colleges or universities, beyond
the level of in-service training programs. Provided, however, that no
member of the uniform ranks of the
Division of Police shall be discriminated against in selection as a candidate for continuing or further education, beyond the in-service training
program, at a local college or university on the basis of race, religion,
color, sex, sexual orientation, gender
identity or expression, national origin, age, disability, ethnic group or
Vietnam-era or disabled veteran status.”.
Section 187.15 Employment; Nondiscrimination; Goals of Contractors
(a) No Contractor shall Discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race,
religion, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression,
national origin, age, Disability, ethnic group or Vietnam-era or disabled
veteran status. Contractors shall take
affirmative action to ensure that
applicants are employed and that
employees are treated during employment without regard to race, religion,
color, sex, sexual orientation, gender
identity or expression, national origin, age, Disability, ethnic group or
Vietnam-era or disabled veteran status. As used in this chapter, “treated”
means and includes without limitation the following: recruited whether
by advertising or other means; compensated, whether in the form of rates
of pay or other forms of compensation; selected for training, including
apprenticeship, promoted, upgraded,
demoted, transferred, laid off and terminated. Contractors shall post in
conspicuous places available to
employees and applicants for employment, notices to be provided by the
hiring representative of contractors
setting forth the provisions of this
nondiscrimination clause.
(b) Within sixty (60) days after
entering into a Contract, each Contractor shall have filed with the
Director a written affirmative action
program, approved by the Administrator, containing standards and procedures ensuring that the Contractor,
by specified affirmative actions with
regard to its employees, facilities and
performance of the Contract, affords
all qualified employees and applicants for employment equal opportunities in the Contractor’s recruitment,
selection, and advancement processes.
(c) Each Contractor’s affirmative
action program shall contain the following components:
(1) A diagnostic component that
includes quantitative analyses comparing the composition of the Contractor’s workforce to the composition of the Cleveland Contracting
Market employment pool according to
the most current census data available, grouped by EEO occupations.
(2) Each affirmative action program shall contain placement goals
as follows:
A. For each non-construction Contract, placement goals equal to the
availability percentage for women or
minorities where the percentage of
women or minorities employed by the
Contractor in a particular job group is
less than would reasonably be expected given their percentage availabilities in the corresponding Cleveland

1724

November 26, 2014
Contracting Market employment pool.
Placement goals are objective targets
reasonably attainable by applying a
good-faith effort to implement all
aspects of the affirmative action program; they are not inflexible quotas.
Placement goals do not authorize or
require a Contractor to grant a preference to any individual or adversely
affect an individual’s employment
status for an unlawful discriminatory
reason.
B. For each construction Contract,
establish placement goals for minorities and women for each trade
involved in the performance of the
Contract equal to the goals established by the Director. Placement
goals are objective targets reasonably attainable by applying a goodfaith effort to implement all aspects
of the affirmative action program;
they are not inflexible quotas. Placement goals do not authorize or require
a Contractor to grant a preference to
any individual or adversely affect an
individual’s employment status for an
unlawful Discriminatory reason.
(3) Identification of problem areas
through analysis of the Contractor’s
employment process to determine if it
affords or incorporates, or contains
impediments to, equal employment
opportunities.
(4) Action-oriented programs consisting of practical steps the Contractor will implement to address any
identified problem areas or the underutilization of women or minorities in
relation to their availability in the
relevant labor pool.
(5) Internal auditing and reporting
systems that monitor and examine
the impact the Contractor’s employment decisions and compensation systems have on women and minorities
and their progress toward achieving
a workforce that would be expected
in the absence of discrimination.
(6) Policies, practices, and procedures that the Contractor will implement to ensure that all qualified
applicants and employees enjoy equal
opportunity in recruitment, selection,
advancement, and every other term
and privilege associated with employment.
(7) Any additional requirements
require
the
Administrator
may
through the Regulations or on a caseby-case review of a Contractor’s proposed affirmative action program.
Section 187.16 Compliance with
Employment Goals
(a) Each Contractor shall be eligible for a certificate of employment
compliance required under Section
187.07 when the Administrator, from
the required submittals and other
information supplied by the Contractor, determines that the Contractor is
complying with this Code and the
Regulations.
(b) Each Contractor shall submit to
the Administrator and implement a
written affirmative action program
containing the components required
under division (c) of Section 187.15.
When the Administrator is satisfied
that the Contractor has complied with
the Code and its regulations, the
Administrator shall issue a written
“certificate of employment compliance.”
(c) Immediately upon a finding
that sixty (60) days after entering
into a Contract, a Contractor has no
affirmative action program, has deviated substantially from an approved
affirmative action program, or has
Discriminated against any employee
or applicant for employment because

November 26, 2014
of race, religion, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, age, Disability,
ethnic group or Vietnam-era or disabled veteran status, the Administrator shall proceed according to division (f) of Section 187.17. Anything in
the foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, the Director shall not
impose sanctions or remedial action
against a Contractor solely because
the Contractor fails to achieve the
established placement goals.
(d) By notice in writing to the
Director and the Clerk of Council, the
Mayor may waive compliance with
the employment goals established
under division (c) of Section 187.15
with respect to a specific Contractor
seeking the award of a specific Contract when, in the Mayor’s sole judgment, the action is necessary in the
best interests of the City and its citizens.
Section 321.17 Contents of Project
Agreement
When authorized by the Board of
Control as provided in Sections 321.15
and 321.16, the Director of Community
Development shall enter into a project agreement for the sale and development or rehabilitation of sites in
the community development project
for and on behalf of the City, with the
proposed purchaser, which agreement shall contain among other
things
such
restrictions
and
covenants running with the land as
set forth in the community development plan adopted and approved in
accordance with Chapters 315 and 317,
and which will prevent a recurrence
of slum, blighted or deteriorating conditions, provided that no such restrictions shall be based upon race, religion, color, sex, sexual orientation,
gender identity or expression, national origin, age, disability, ethnic group
or Vietnam-era or disabled veteran
status; shall provide appropriate
remedies for any breach of the
covenants or conditions; and shall be
prepared by the Director of Law and
contain such other conditions as may
be required by the Board of Control
and, in Federally assisted projects, by
the United States government.

2903.21, 2903.22, 2909.06, 2909.07 or

person or group of persons.
(b) Whoever violates this section is
guilty of ethnic intimidation. Ethnic
intimidation is an offense of the next
higher degree than the offense the

threat of force willfully injure, intimidate or interfere with, or attempt to
