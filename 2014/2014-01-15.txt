Fleet Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44105,

Whereas, the granting of this application for a liquor permit to this high

qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard of

and
Whereas, the place for which the

Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or constructed that law enforcement officers or agents of the Division of
Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based on
other legal grounds as set forth in
Revised Code Section 4303.292; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of
the public peace, prosperity, safety
and welfare pursuant to Section

EXCEPTIONS REGARDLESS OF THE REASON. DOORS WILL OPEN AT 9:00 A.M.
PLACE: THE CLEVELAND PUBLIC AUDITORIUM
TYPE: The examination will consist of two components, a Written Examination and an Oral Board Test. Each of these
components is described below:
Written Examination This is a paper and pencil examination that will consist of approximately 80 multiple-choice items
designed to assess candidates’ understanding of job-related technical knowledge determined to be important to the
Cleveland Fire Captain position based on the job analysis results. Items will be developed based on the information contained in the reference materials outlined in the Reading List. As noted on the Reading List, this examination will consist of two parts, a closed-book test and an open-book test. The Reading List specifies which sections of each document
will be covered on the closed-book test and which sections will be covered on the open-book test. The allocation of items
to the closed-book and open-book tests will be based on the job analysis results.
The closed-book test items will be designed to assess candidates’ understanding of job-related technical knowledge that
the job analysis indicates must be memorized so no reference materials will be available for use during this part of the
Written Examination. Items on this part will be drawn ONLY from reference materials identified on the Reading List as
closed-book.
The open-book test items will be designed to assess candidates’ understanding of job-related technical knowledge that
the job analysis indicates need not be memorized but can be looked up when needed. Therefore, ALL reference materials included on the Reading List (closed-book and open-book) and any other documents candidates may wish to bring
will be available for use during the open-book part of the Written Examination. However, items on this part will be
drawn ONLY from reference materials identified on the Reading List as open-book.
All candidates who complete the Written Examination will be eligible to participate in the Oral Board Test.
Oral Board Test: The Oral Board Test is designed to assess abilities found to underlie effective job performance in the
context of typical situations encountered by Cleveland Fire Captains. This component will consist of two exercises
requiring candidates to conduct such activities as commanding an incident scene, conducting meetings with other fire
personnel or civilians who are experiencing some problems or expressing some complaints, or conducting other activities that a Captain might reasonably be expected to conduct. Candidates will be given an opportunity to review written
scenarios describing each situation and to prepare their responses before appearing before the Oral Boards to conduct
each exercise. Candidates will then be given a set amount of time to present their responses to the Oral Boards which
will consist of raters trained to evaluate their performance. The raters will be drawn from agencies outside the Cleveland Division of Fire. Total candidate participation time for the Oral Board will be approximately one hour and 45 minutes including time to check-in and review instructions, time to review exercise materials and prepare responses, and
time to appear before each Oral Board to conduct each exercise.
Based on the job analysis of the Fire Captain position, this component will be designed to allow for an assessment of
such abilities as: oral communication, interpersonal interactions, analyzing and deciding, managing activities, and
adaptability.
Candidates will NOT be permitted to bring any reference materials identified on the Reading List nor any other documents to the Oral Board Test site. Any reference materials or other documents that might be needed to respond to the situations presented will be made available to candidates at the test site.
Applicants will be notified of the date, time and place of their Oral Board Examination through the United States mail
after the Written Examinations are completed.
THE USE OF THE FOLLOWING DURING THE EXAMINATION WILL BE PROHIBITED: ANY ELECTRONIC
DEVICES (E.G. CELLPHONES, EARPHONES, EARPLUGS, CALCULATORS, RADIOS INCLUDING DEPARTMENTAL
RADIOS, PAGERS, TAPE RECORDERS, TAPE PLAYERS), AND SCRAP PAPER. APPLICANTS BRINGING THE
AFOREMENTIONED ARTICLES TO THE EXAMINATION SITE WILL HAVE THEM CONFISCATED.

2014 City of Cleveland Division of Fire Captain Promotion Examination
Written Examination Reading List Explanation
Explanation of Reading List: Candidates for promotion to Captain will be responsible for the reference sources listed on
the attached Reading List. This list is organized by general source (e.g., CFD General Orders), identifies the specific
sections (e.g., CATEGORY 1: EMERGENCY FIELD OPERATIONS, Number 1-29: Truss Roofs) of each general source
that may be included on the Written Examination, and indicates whether each section will be covered on the “ClosedBook” or “Open-Book” part of the Written Examination. Decisions regarding the inclusion and placement of material
were made based on information collected from the job analysis of the position of Cleveland Division of Fire Captain.
Please note that in some cases not all existing sections of a source are included on the Reading List. For instance, CATEGORY 9: PROTECTIVE AND UNIFORM CLOTHING of the CFD General Orders has been omitted. You should also note
that in some overall sources, such as the City of Cleveland Medical Protocols (EMT-B Portion), all sections that are
included will be tested on the same part (i.e., Closed-Book) of the Written Examination, and in other sources, such as the
CFD Standard Operating Procedures, some sections will be covered on the Closed-Book part of the Written Examination
while other sections will be covered on the Open-Book part of the Written Examination. In instances where the entire
source is to be included on either the Open-Book or Closed-Book test (e.g., Manual of Rules and Regulations, City of
Cleveland Medical Protocols, and Fire Officer’s Handbook of Tactics), only the overall source title has been included
with a designation of “ALL SECTIONS” or “ALL CHAPTERS.” In addition, the titles of the sections from the CFD General Orders and CFD Standard Operating Procedures on the Reading List reflect the titles included on the Table of Contents, not the titles included in the actual sections of these overall sources. Finally, please note that for the external textbooks, the publisher’s website has been identified to assist candidates in ordering and obtaining each external text.  
Additional Points about the Reading List and Written Examination Procedures:
1. All questions on the closed-book part of the Written Examination will be drawn from sections identified on the reading list as “Closed.”
Candidates will NOT be permitted to use any reference sources on the Reading List or other documents of any kind during the Closed-Book part of the Written Examination.
2. All questions on the open-book part of the Written Examination will be drawn from sections identified on the reading
list as “Open.”
Candidates WILL be permitted to use any references sources on the Reading List or other documents during the OpenBook part of the Written Examination.
3. Only hard copies of reference sources/documents may be brought to the Written Examination. No electronic equipment will be allowed at the examination administration site, including pagers, cellphones, laptops, etc.
4. Candidates must obtain and bring their own copies of reference sources/documents to the Written Examination. No
documents will be provided to candidates at the examination administration site. No sharing of any documents or materials will be allowed.
5. Where possible, candidates may reorganize the Open-Book sections of their reference sources into separate binders to
facilitate their efforts during the Open-Book part of the Written Examination.
6. Candidates will only be responsible for information contained within reference sources included on the Reading List.
Any other documents that are referenced within sources appearing on the Reading List, but are not actually included on
the Reading List themselves, will not be tested.
7. Highlighting and writing in reference sources or other documents prior to the Written Examination administration is
permitted. Writing in reference sources or other documents during the Written Examination is NOT permitted. Writing
in test booklets during the Written Examination is permitted and encouraged (pen, pencil and highlighter are allowed).
8. Candidates will be responsible for the CFD’s internal reference sources including the General Orders, Standard Operating Procedures, CFD Manual of Rules and Regulations, and City of Cleveland Medical Protocols (EMT-B Portion).
Links to these internal department source documents have been provided below. Candidates will be responsible for the
material provided within these links, they will NOT be responsible for revisions that occur after the links have been provided. Note that the links to the internal department source documents contain more sections than those that appear on
the reading list. Therefore, you will need to identify the appropriate sections based on the Reading List.
