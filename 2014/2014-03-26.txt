FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 395-14.
By Council Members J. Johnson,
Kelley,
Pruitt,
Zone,
Cummins,
Mitchell, Conwell, Brancatelli, Cleveland and Sweeney.
An emergency resolution opposing
Amended House Bill 69, which prohibits the use of red light and traffic
cameras by municipalities in Ohio, as
a violation of charter municipalities’
Home Rule authority.
Whereas, Amended House Bill 69
would ban across Ohio red light and
speed traffic cameras, with the one
exception for school zones if a local
law enforcement officer is present;
and
Whereas, the proposed bill, which
was passed by the Ohio House of Representatives in 2013, is now being considered for passage by the Ohio State
Senate State Government Oversight
and Reform Committee; and
Whereas, if passed, Amended
House Bill 69 would preempt local legislation of Charter cities, like Cleveland and Columbus, where the majority of city council members voted in
favor of using the traffic cameras;
and
Whereas, this Council believes the
decision to use or not to use traffic
cameras is not for the Ohio Legislature but solely the right of local charter municipalities under the Home
Rule provisions of the Ohio Constitution; and

March 26, 2014
Whereas, this Council supports a
partnership with the Ohio Legislature
and the Governor to work towards
mutually agreed upon statewide standards for use of traffic cameras if a
local municipality chooses to use
them; and
Whereas, this Council does not support the passage of Amended House
Bill 69 and asks that members of the
Ohio Senate State Government Oversight and Reform Committee reject
this legislation as a violation of local
charter municipalities’ Constitutional
Home Rule authority; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes
Amended House Bill 69, which prohibits the use of red light and traffic
cameras by municipalities in Ohio, as
a violation of charter municipalities’
Home Rule authority.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit a copy of this
resolution to all members of the Ohio
General Assembly.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immeupon

and

Res. No. 406-14.
By Council Members Brancatelli,
Zone, Pruitt, Polensek, Conwell,
Mitchell, Cummins, J. Johnson, Reed
and Cleveland.
An emergency resolution strongly
urging the U.S. House of Representative’s Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies to provide
at least $3.3 billion in formula funding for the Community Development
Block Grant for FY 2015.
Whereas, the U.S House of Representatives Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies is considering Community Development
Block Grant (CDBD) funding for next
year; and
Whereas, the subcommittee develops priorities for the FY 2015 Transportation and Urban Development
Appropriations Act which will determine the amount of the CDBG formula; and
Whereas, the CDBG is one of the
most effective federal programs for
growing the local economy and
investing in housing initiatives for
the most vulnerable populations in
our communities; and
Whereas, since 2012, funding for
the CDBG has been cut by 25% and

The City Record
has severely limited economic and
housing programs and investments
for low and moderate income families; and
Whereas, CDBG funding is critical
to the City of Cleveland to recover
from the foreclosure crisis as well as
to provide both new home construction and home rehabilitation assistance for low and moderate income
families; and
Whereas, City of Cleveland CDBG
funding has been reduced from $29
million to $19 million since 2004; and
Whereas, every $1.00 of CDBG
spending leverages an additional
$4.05 in non-CDBG funding; and
Whereas, this Council requests the
subcommittee again provide at least
$3.3 billion in formula funding for the
CDBG for FY 2015; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council strongly urges the U.S. House of Representative’s Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies to provide
at least $3.3 billion in formula funding for the Community Development
Block Grant for FY 2015.

is directed to transmit copies of this
resolution to Tom Latham, Chairman,
Subcommittee on Transportation,
Housing and Urban Development and
Related Agencies; Ed Pastor, Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies; and
Marcia Fudge, Congresswoman, District 11, Ohio.

Spafford Road, 1st floor and basement, Cleveland, Ohio 44105, Permanent Number 3608035; and

County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or constructed that law enforcement officers or agents of the Division of
Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment; and
Whereas, the place for which the

respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based on
other legal grounds as set forth in
Revised Code Section 4303.292; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of

AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 1598-13.
By Council Members K. Johnson,
Miller, Cleveland and Kelley (by
departmental request).
An emergency resolution declaring the intent to vacate a portion of
Luke Road S.E.
Whereas, this Council is satisfied
that there is good cause to vacate a
portion
of
Luke
Road
S.E.
as
described; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
declares its intent to vacate a portion
of the following described real property:
The vacation of a portion of Luke
Road S.E.
Situated in the City of Cleveland,
County of Cuyahoga and State of Ohio
and known as being a portion of Original One Hundred Acre lot No. 443:
Being al that portion of Luke Road
S.E. extending from the Northerly prolongation of the east line of a parcel

veys and House Numbering Section.
Section 2. That this resolution is
declared to be an emergency measure
and, provided it receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take
effect and be in force immediately
upon its adoption and approval by the
Mayor; otherwise it shall take effect
and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.
Adopted March 17, 2014.
Effective March 18, 2014.

Res. No. 344-14.
By Council Members Cimperman
and Zone.
An emergency resolution urging
the United States Congress to pass the
Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act (PAMTA), H.R.
965, and the Preventing of Antibiotic
Resistance Act (PARA), S. 1256; and
supporting a statewide and national
ban on nontherapeutic uses of antibiotics in livestock production.
Whereas, eighty percent of the
antibiotics sold in the United States
are used in livestock production, and
the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention has reported that most of
those antibiotics are used irresponsibly; and
Whereas, low doses of antibiotics
are routinely fed to livestock for
growth promotion and disease prevention to compensate for crowded,
unsanitary conditions, in a practice
known as “nontherapeutic use”; and
Whereas, “nontherapeutic use” creates ideal conditions for the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria;
and
Whereas, antibiotic resistant bacteria on livestock operations are known
to spread to retail meat, farmers and
farmworkers, and rural environments; and
Whereas, antibiotic resistance in
pathogens due to nontherapeutic use
of antibiotics in livestock production
has been a public health concern
since the 1960s; and
Whereas, antibiotic resistant bacteria have been the cause of several
foodborne illness outbreaks, including a 2011 outbreak of antibiotic resistant Salmonella in ground turkey that
sickened 136 people, hospitalized 37,
and killed one and lead to the third
largest meat recall in the USDA’s
records and a 2013 outbreak of antibiotic resistant Salmonella in chicken
that sickened 416 people and hospitalized 162;
Whereas, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention reported that
at least two million Americans suffer
from antibiotic resistant bacterial
infections each year and twenty-three
thousand Americans die from those
infections; and
Whereas, the medical and social
costs of antibiotic-resistance infections in just one hospital for one year
have been estimated to be between
$13 million and $18 million; and
Whereas, the federal government
has limited nontherapeutic uses of
two classes of antibiotics, but otherwise largely relied on voluntary guidance to attempt to reduce overuse of
antibiotics in livestock production,
despite regular acknowledgements
that nontherapeutic use and the
development of antibiotic resistant
bacteria poses a significant public

March 26, 2014
health threat; and
Whereas, PAMTA and PARA preserve the effectiveness of medically
important antimicrobials used in the
treatment of human and animal diseases by limiting nontherapeutic uses
of antibiotics in livestock production;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the United States Congress to pass the
Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act (PAMTA), H.R.
965 and the Preventing of Antibiotic
Resistance Act (PARA), S. 1256; and
supports a statewide and national
ban on nontherapeutic uses of antibiotics in livestock production.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
resolution to the Ohio House of Representatives, Ohio Congressional Representatives Marcia Fudge and Marcy
Kaptur, and U.S. Senators Sherrod
Brown and Robert Portman.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted March 17, 2014.
Effective March 18, 2014.

An emergency resolution supporting President Obama’s new initiative
“My Brother’s Keeper” which will
work to implement practical strategies to ensure that young men of color
are on equal footing with their peers
in having access to opportunities to

32
achieve the American dream.
Whereas, data shows that boys and
young men of color, regardless of
where they are from, suffer disproportionately from poverty, family instability, failure in school, unemployment, incarceration and homicide;
and

the 4th grade, 86% of African American boys and 82% of Hispanic boys
are reading below proficiency levels –
compared to 54% of white 4th graders
reading below proficiency levels; and

Hispanic young men are more than
six times as likely to be victims of
murder than their white peers, and
account for almost half of the country’s murder victims each year; and

brought to the forefront this often
overlooked crisis among African
American and Hispanic boys and
young men by recently announcing
the My Brother’s Keeper initiative
and establishing a My Brother’s
Keeper Task Force that will take a
collaborative,
multi-disciplinary
approach to build ladders of opportunity and unlock the full potential of
boys and young men of color; and
Whereas, across the country are initiatives currently working to address
the challenges that befall boys and
young men of color; for example,
Cities United helps mayors and
municipal leaders across the country
create safer, healthier communities
by working across multiple sectors to
identify achievable, commonsense
solutions to ending the high levels of
violence that affect too many African
American boys; and
Whereas, My Brother’s Keeper is
focused on action-oriented public and
private partnerships to make sure
that every young man of color who is
willing to work hard and lift himself
up has an opportunity to get ahead
and reach his full potential; and
Whereas, the My Brother’s Keeper
Task Force will determine which public and private efforts are working,
how the Federal government can support those efforts, and how to get
more people involved in those efforts;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of

An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Economic Development to enter into an agreement
with Applied Industrial Technologies
and to release debt reserve proceeds
from a zero coupon bond that the City
holds to Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. towards the purchase of
their headquarters building at 3201

Whereas, Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. formerly known as
Bearings, Inc., (“Applied”) is a For-

389

tune 1000 Company with its headquarters located at One Applied
Plaza, 3201 Euclid Avenue (Permanent Parcel Nos. 103-07-001 and 10306-003) in Cleveland; and
Whereas, in 1996, the City worked
with the State, Cleveland Development Partnership, Cuyahoga County,
and the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County
Port Authority (“Port Authority”) to
construct a deal with Applied to
build their headquarters in the City
of Cleveland; and
Whereas, among other things, the
1996 deal provided that the Port
Authority would acquire the land
and construct the new headquarters
and that Applied would lease the
property from the Port Authority for
a term of 20 years funded in part by
bonds issued by the Port Authority,
which would be repaid over 20 years
with a balloon payment of $3.8 million due in 2016; and
Whereas, the lease also provided
for an option for Applied to renew
the lease or an option for Applied to
purchase the property outright at
the end of the term and if neither
option were exercised by Applied,
then the City of Cleveland would
own the building in 2016; and
Whereas, the approximately $3.8
million debt reserve would pay the
bonds, however, the City would be
required to pay balloons to the State
in an approximate amount of $4 million and Cleveland Development
Partnership an approximate amount
of $1.9 million if another buyer was
not immediately available; and
Whereas, it is in the best interests
of the parties to restructure the 1996
deal; and
Whereas, under the restructured
deal, Applied will remain in Cleveland and purchase the property,
eliminating the obligation of the
City to purchase the property at the
end of the lease for an approximate
amount of $5.9 million; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of

release debt reserve proceeds from a
zero coupon bond that the City holds,
with an estimated current value of
$3,843,741.74, and any interest accrued

purchase of their headquarters building at Permanent Parcel Nos. 103-07001 and 103-06-003, in exchange for
Applied’s obligation to keep its headquarters in Cleveland for a period of
at least 10 years.
Section 2. That the Director of Economic Development is authorized to
enter into an agreement with Applied
containing terms and conditions necessary to implement this ordinance.
Section 3. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure
and, provided it receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take
