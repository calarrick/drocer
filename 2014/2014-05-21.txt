FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 692-14.
By Council Members Pruitt, Cummins and Polensek.
An emergency resolution supporting
Ohio’s
Energy
Efficiency
Resource and Renewable Portfolio
Standards and urging the Ohio House
of Representatives, the Ohio Senate,
and Governor John Kasich to oppose
Substitute Senate Bill 58, Senate Bill
34, Senate Bill 310, and any future legislation that would impede Ohio’s
advancement in energy efficiency.
Whereas, Ohio’s current Energy
Efficiency
Resource
Standard
requires electric utilities to implement energy efficiency programs that
have proven to reduce Ohio’s energy
consumption, reassure investment in
energy efficient products and technologies, and create local jobs; and
Whereas, Ohio’s current Renewable
Portfolio Standard requires electric
utilities to purchase and/or increase

689

13
production of energy from renewable
energy sources that have proven to
reduce Ohio’s reliance on fossil fuels
as a primary energy source, advance
renewable energy projects, keep
Ohio’s businesses competitive and
create jobs; and
Whereas, in 2008 these Standards
were enacted by the Ohio legislature
with a nearly unanimous bipartisan
vote; and
Whereas, these current Standards
will result in a projected 22.5% reduction of Ohio’s energy use by the year
2025; and
Whereas, Substitute Senate Bill 58.
Senate Bill 34 and Senate Bill 310 propose to reduce and/or eliminate these
energy efficiency and renewable
energy standards; and
Whereas, Ohio businesses are integral in the manufacturing and construction of wind farms, helping the
state of Ohio place fourth in the
nation for employment in the wind
industry; and
Whereas, Ohio’s energy efficiency
sector is ranked 3rd in the nation and
Ohio’s manufacturing industry places
second in the nation for its ability to
manufacture wind turbines and all of
their parts; and
Whereas, increased efforts in energy efficiency have reduced harmful
emissions, saved consumers and local
businesses money, and allowed for
new job opportunities for citizens;
and
Whereas, the American Council for
an Energy Efficient Economy has
established that for every dollar
invested in energy efficiency programs, consumers save more than
three dollars on their utility bills; and
Whereas, these programs have collectively saved Ohio businesses and
consumers more than $1 billion in utility costs since 2009 according to
reports submitted to the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio by Ohio’s
major utilities; and
Whereas, current Standards have
contributed to more than 10,000 jobs
for Ohioans in the energy efficiency
sector and more than 25,000 jobs in the
clean energy sector with over 400
advanced energy businesses; and
Whereas, continued energy efficiency investments will result in
improved local economy, enhanced
infrastructure, and will transform
Ohio’s manufacturing base; and
Whereas, Sub S.B. 58, S.B. 34, and
S.B. 310 would remove incentives for
clean energy companies to locate or
expand in Ohio, placing 400 businesses and 25,000 jobs at risk over the next
12 years; and
Whereas, Sub S.B. 58, S.B. 34, S.B.
310 will make Ohio less competitive to
prospective businesses in the clean
energy market by making electricity
more expensive to buy; and
Whereas, Ohio’s consumers would
see an increase on their utility bills
by removing the energy efficiency
standards and any incentives for businesses to invest in energy efficiency
would be removed; and
Whereas, rolling back Ohio’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Portfolio Standard will have significant
impacts on Ohio’s public health, economy and jobs
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

14
Section 1. That this Council supports
Ohio’s
Energy
Efficiency
Resource and Renewable Portfolio
Standards and urges the Ohio House
of Representatives, the Ohio Senate,
and Governor John Kasich to oppose
Substitute Senate Bill 58, Senate Bill
34, Senate Bill 310, and any future legislation that would impede Ohio’s
advancement in energy efficiency.
Section 2. That the Clerk is directed
to transmit copies of this resolution to
Governor John Kasich; William
Batchelder, Speaker of the Ohio
House; Keith Faber, President of the
Ohio Senate; Peter Stautberg, Chair of
the Ohio House Public Utilities Committee; and William Seitz, Chair of
the Ohio Senate Public Utilities Committee.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from
