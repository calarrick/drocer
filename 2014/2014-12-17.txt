and disability applications, as well
as the other essential services that
SSA field offices provide to the public;  and
Whereas, in recent years, SSA has
closed more than 70 field offices and
hundreds of contract stations around
the country, and reduced hours so
that offices are open to the public
only until noon on Wednesdays and
close 1
hours early on other weekdays; and
Whereas, these closures represent
a 28 percent reduction in time spent
helping people face-to-face to gain
access to their benefits under Social
Security; and

1882

December 17, 2014
Whereas, Social Security beneficiaries have always received, have

highest
quality
personal
service
offered to more than 53 million program participants; and
Whereas, high-quality service is
threatened both by budget cuts and
by a concerted effort on the part of
the agency to nearly eliminate field
offices and personal service as
described in a recent document produced by a seven member panel of
the National Academy of Public
Administration under contract to the
Social
Security
Administration,
which included three former highranking SSA officials;  and
Whereas,
the
SSA
2014-2018
Agency Strategic Plan specifically
cites the “Vision 2025” plan referenced above, and thereby has signaled high-level support for this
approach that is hostile to the interests of the American people; and
Whereas,
public
confidence
in
SSA’s ability to deliver on its
promises is being threatened by the
continuous announcements of office
closures,
reduced
office
hours
around
the
nation,
and
service
reductions at field offices; and
Whereas, SSA has decided to stop
providing two essential documents
at SSA field offices, the Social Security Number Printout and the Benefit Verification statement, and 11
million people who came in last
year to get these documents will be
told they must go online and print
them out, request that prospective
employers verify their Social Security Numbers, ask other serviceproviders to get the information
themselves, or contract the Call Center and wait a week or more to
receive
these
vital
verifications
needed to receive assistance from
other service-providers or to verify
eligibility to work; and
Whereas, this Council supports
the Alliance for Retired Americans’
work for the passage of legislation
introduced by Rep. Brian Higgins
(D-NY) and John Duncan (R-TN),
H.R.
3997,
the
Social
Security
Accountability
Act
of
2014,
to
impose an immediate moratorium on
further closures until SSA explains
its plan for future closings, the reasoning for it, and how it will mitigate the impact on the public; and
Whereas, this Council supports
the work of the Alliance for Retired
Americans, the American Federation
of Government Employees (AFGE)
and other unions to work with the
Social Security Works Coalition, the
Leadership Council of Aging Organizations and community organizations to expand the resources and
front-line staffing available for SSA
operations and fight to restore field
office service delivery as the most
critical part of the SSA infrastructure; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Social Security Administration to
place a moratorium on Social Security
Office closings and service cuts.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
Resolution to Michael B. Williams,

December 17, 2014

supplemented by enacting new Section 603.032 to read as follows:
Section
603.032
Seizure
and
Impoundment of Animals for Fights,
Poisoning, Cruelty, Neglect or Tethering; Hearing
(a) As used in this section:
(1) “Impounding Agency” means
the City of Cleveland Division of Animal Care and Control or County
Humane Society organized under
1717.05 of the Revised Code.
(2) “Offense” means a violation of
any of the following Sections: 603.072
“Illegal Fights between Animals;”
603.08 “Poisoning Animals;” 603.09
“Cruelty to Animals;” 603.091 “Neglect
of Animals;” or “603.092 “Tethering
Animals.”
(3) “Officer” means any law
enforcement, County humane agent,
or Animal Control Officer in the City
of Cleveland.
(b) An officer may immediately
seize and cause to be impounded at an
impounding agency an animal that
the officer has probable cause to
believe is the subject of an offense.
(c) The officer shall give written
notice of the seizure and impoundment to the owner, keeper, or harborer of the animal that was seized and
impounded within 3 days of seizure if
they can be found. If the officer is
unable to give the notice to the owner,
keeper, or harborer of the animal, the
officer shall post the notice on the
door of the residence or in another
conspicuous place on the premises at
which the animal was seized.
(1) If the seizure is for a violation
of Sections 603.072, 603.08, 603.091, or
603.092 the notice shall include a
statement that, upon written request
by the owner, keeper, or harborer of
the animal to the impounding agency,
which is received by the impounding

1906

December 17, 2014
agency within five calendar days of
the notice of seizure and impoundment, a hearing will be held at the
next available court date, or no later
than three days from the date the
notice of a request for a hearing was
received, whichever is earlier. If a
hearing is not timely requested, the
animal is deemed forfeited without
hearing and the impounding agency
may determine the disposition of the
animal.
(2) If the seizure is for a violation
of Sections 603.09 the notice shall
include a statement that, upon written request by the owner, keeper, or
harborer of the animal to the
impounding
agency,
which
is
received by the impounding agency
within ten calendar days of the notice
of seizure and impoundment, a hearing will be held at the next available
court date, or no later than three days
from the date the notice of a request
for a hearing was received, whichever is earlier. If a hearing is not timely
requested, the animal is deemed forfeited without hearing and the
impounding agency may determine
the disposition of the animal.
(3) In either case, the notice shall
also state that the hearing will be
held to determine whether the officer
had probable cause to seize the animal and, if applicable, to determine
the amount of a bond or cash deposit
that is needed to provide for the animal’s care and keeping for not less
than thirty days beginning on the
date on which the animal was seized
and impounded.
(d) An animal that is seized under
this section may be humanely
destroyed immediately or at any time
during impoundment or otherwise
provided with veterinary care if a
licensed veterinarian determines it to
be necessary because the animal is
suffering.
(e) (1) If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the animal has requested a
hearing in writing, the court shall
hold a hearing to determine whether
the officer impounding an animal had
probable cause to seize the animal. If
the court determines that probable
cause exists, the court shall determine the amount of a bond or cash
deposit that is needed to provide for
the animal’s care and keeping for not
less than thirty days beginning on the
date on which the animal was
impounded. If a hearing is not timely
requested, the animal is deemed forfeited without hearing and the
impounding agency may determine
the disposition of the animal.
(2) If the court determines that
probable cause does not exist, the
court immediately shall order the
impounding agency to return the animal to its owner if possible.
(3) If the court determines that
probable cause exists and determines
the amount of a bond or cash deposit,
the case shall continue and the owner
shall post a bond or cash deposit to
provide for the animal’s care and
keeping for not less than thirty days
beginning on the date on which the
animal was impounded. The owner
may renew a bond or cash deposit by
posting, not later than ten days following the expiration of the period
for which a previous bond or cash
deposit was posted, a new bond or
cash deposit in an amount that the
court, in consultation with the
impounding agency, determines is
sufficient to provide for the animal’s
care and keeping for not less than

December 17, 2014
thirty days beginning on the date on
which the previous period expired. If
no bond or cash deposit is posted or if
a bond or cash deposit expires and is
not renewed, the impounding agency
may determine the disposition of the
animal unless the court issues an
order that specifies otherwise. The
notice provided in this section shall
include notice that if no bond or cash
deposit is posted or if the bond or cash
deposit expires and is not renewed
and the owner or person in control of
the animal fails to appear for the
hearing, the impounding agency may
determine the disposition of the animal.
(f) If a person is convicted of committing an offense, the court may
impose the following additional
penalties against the person:
(1) A requirement that the person
pay for the costs incurred by the
impounding agency in caring for an
animal involved in the applicable
offense, provided that the costs were
incurred during the animal’s seizure
or impoundment. A bond or cash
deposit posted under this section may
be applied to the costs.
(2) An order permanently terminating the person’s right to possession,
title, custody, or care of the animal
that was involved in the offense. If
the court issues such an order, the
court shall order the disposition of the
animal.
(g) If a person is found not guilty
of committing an offense, the court
immediately shall order the impounding agency to return the animal to its
owner if possible and to return the
entire amount of any bond or cash
deposit posted under division (e) of
this section. If the animal cannot be
returned because it has been adopted
or euthanized the impounding agency
shall pay the fair market value of the
animal at the time that it was
impounded plus statutory interest as
defined in Section 1343.03 of the
Revised Code from the date of the
impoundment or an amount determined by the court to be equal to the
cost of treatment of the injury to the
animal, as applicable. The requirements established in this division
regarding the return of a bond or cash
deposit and the payment of the reasonable market value of the companion animal shall not apply in the case
of a dog that was not registered, in
accordance with applicable registration laws, at the time it was seized
and impounded.
(h) If charges are filed for an
offense described in this Section

The City Record
against the custodian or caretaker of
an animal, but the animal that is the
subject of the charges is not impounded, the court in which the charges are
pending may order the owner or person having custody of the animal to
provide to the animal the necessities
described in division (C)(5), (D)(2),
and (E)(5) of Section 959.131 of the
Revised Code until the final disposition of the charges. If the court issues
an order of that nature, the court also
may authorize an officer or another
person to visit the place where the
animal is being kept, at the times and
under the conditions that the court
may set, to determine whether the
animal is receiving those necessities
and to remove and impound the animal if the animal is not receiving
those necessities.
(i) Nothing in this Section shall be
interpreted to apply to an animal
impounded under Section 603.03.
Section 4. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure
and, provided it receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take
effect and be in force immediately
upon its passage and approval by the
Mayor; otherwise it shall take effect
and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.

Ord. No. 1591-14.
By Council Member Kelley (by
departmental request)
An emergency ordinance authorizing the issuance and sale of one or
more series of General Obligation
Refunding Bonds to refund currently
outstanding general obligation bonds
of the City to obtain debt service savings and authorizing and approving
related matters.
Whereas, the City has from time to
time issued general obligation bonds
in various series that are currently
outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $268,445,000; and
Whereas, this Council has determined to authorize the City to issue
one or more series of Refunding
Bonds (as defined in Section 1) for the
purpose of obtaining debt service savings with respect to all currently outstanding general obligation bonds of
the City; and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of this City, has previously certified to this Council that
the estimated life or usefulness of
each of the Projects (as defined
below) was, at the time the original
Bonds for each Project were issued, at
least five years, and that the maximum maturity of that portion of the
Refunding Bonds to be allocated to
each of the Projects financed by the
original Bonds to be refunded is
December 31 of the years determined
by the Director of Finance for each
Project based on each Project’s estimated life or usefulness; and
Whereas, this Council passed Ordinance No. 1749-80 on October 8, 1980,
and thereafter amended that ordinance by Ordinance No. 1112-83,
passed May 6, 1983 and Ordinance No.
944-96, passed June 10, 1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so amended and
as the same may further be amended
from time to time in accordance with
its provisions, is referred to as the
“General Bond Ordinance”), providing the general terms and provisions
for the issuance of unvoted general
obligations of the City, with the specific terms of each series of Bonds to
be contained in ordinances authorizing the issuance of Bonds in accordance with the provisions thereof
(the “Series Bond Ordinances”); and
Whereas, the authorization for
issuance of Refunding Bonds is necessary to enable the City to take
advantage of favorable market conditions on a timely basis to obtain debt
service savings, and as a result, this
Ordinance constitutes an emergency
measure providing for the immediate
preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety, and for the
usual daily operation of a municipal
department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. One or more
series of general obligation refunding bonds of the City (“Refunding
Bonds”) are authorized to be issued
for the purpose of refunding one or
more series of the City’s outstanding
general obligation bonds, or designated maturities thereof, issued to pro-

vide funds to pay costs of various projects of the City (the “Projects”) and
identified in the Certificate of Award
authorized in Section 4 (“Refunded
Bonds”), including the payment of
any expenses relating to the refunding of the Refunded Bonds and the
issuance of the Refunding Bonds,
including any financing costs within
the meaning of Revised Code Section
133.01(K), provided that the aggregate net present value debt service
savings resulting from the refunding
of the Refunded Bonds is not less than
3%.
The aggregate principal amount of
each respective series of Refunding
Bonds to be issued under this Ordinance shall be in an amount determined by the Director of Finance and
set forth in the Certificate of Award
as the amount required to be issued,
taking into account any original
issue discount and/or original issue
premium on the sale of the Refunding
Bonds, in order to refund the Refunded Bonds and pay any expenses relating to the refunding of the Refunded
Bonds and the issuance of the Refunding Bonds. The Refunding Bonds may
be issued in one or more separate
series, each bearing a distinctive designation, provided that the Refunding Bonds of each series satisfy the
requirements of this Ordinance and
the aggregate net present value debt
service savings to the City resulting
from each series of Refunding Bonds
is not less than 3%. Separate series of
Refunding Bonds may be issued at
the same or different times. The
Refunding Bonds of each series shall
be designated as provided in the
applicable Certificate of Award. A
separate Certificate of Award may be
delivered for each series.
Section 2. Authority and Terms. The
Refunding Bonds shall be issued pursuant to the provisions of Article
XVIII of the Constitution of Ohio,
Revised Code Chapter 133 and other
applicable provisions of the Revised
Code, the Charter of the City, the General Bond Ordinance and this Ordinance in the principal amount and for
the purpose stated in Section 1. The
Refunding Bonds of each series shall
be issued in one lot as fully registered
bonds in denominations of $5,000 or
any integral multiple thereof but in
no case as to a particular maturity
date exceeding the principal amount
maturing on that date. The Refunding Bonds shall bear the designation
and be numbered as determined by
the Director of Finance.
The Refunding Bonds shall be
dated the date and shall bear interest
at the rate or rates per year specified
in the Certificate of Award, provided
the weighted average of such rates
per series of Refunding Bonds (taking into account the principal amount
and maturity of each Refunding Bond
to which a rate applies) shall not
exceed 6% per year. Interest on the
Refunding Bonds shall be payable
when due, or until the principal
amount is paid, semiannually as specified in the Certificate of Award as

1909

the dates on which interest on the
Refunding Bonds shall be payable
(the “Interest Payment Dates”),
beginning on the date specified in the
Certificate of Award as the first Interest Payment Date.
The Refunding Bonds shall mature
in the years and principal amounts as
shall be permitted by law and determined by the Director of Finance and
specified in the Certificate of Award,
based on (i) the written advice of a
Financial Advisor to be in the best
interests of the City given market
conditions at the time the Refunding
Bonds are sold and (ii) the objectives
of the plan of refunding to obtain
aggregate net present value debt service savings of not less than 3%.
The Director of Finance also shall
determine and certify, on or prior to
the date of delivery of the Refunding
Bonds to the Original Purchaser, that
portion of the aggregate principal
amount of the Refunding Bonds that
is allocable to each Project, and the
principal amount of Refunding Bonds
allocated to each Project that shall be
payable at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(as
defined below) on the applicable principal payment dates; provided, that
(i) the aggregate principal amount of
the Refunding Bonds allocable to a
Project shall be determined by the
Director of Finance on a pro rata
basis by reference to the respective
amount of funds that is required for
the refunding of the Refunded Bonds
that are allocable to that Project, taking into account any funds other than
the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds
that are available and appropriated
for that purpose, and (ii) no portion of
the aggregate principal amount of
Refunding Bonds allocated to a Project shall be payable later than the
maximum maturity for that portion of
the Refunding Bonds as certified by
the Director of Finance.
The Refunding Bonds stated to
mature in any year may be issued as
term bonds (the “Term Refunding
Bonds”), payable pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements as defined and further
described below. The Director of
Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award whether any of the
Refunding Bonds shall be issued as
Term Refunding Bonds, any dates
(the “Mandatory Redemption Dates”)
on which the principal amount of the
Term Refunding Bonds shall be
payable pursuant to mandatory sinking fund installments rather than at
stated maturity and the amount of
principal to be paid on each Mandatory Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements”).
The Refunding Bonds shall be subject to redemption prior to stated
maturity as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Refunding
Bonds are issued as Term Refunding
Bonds, the Term Refunding Bonds
shall be subject to mandatory sinking

36
fund redemption and be redeemed
pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements, at a
redemption price of 100% of the principal amount redeemed, plus interest
accrued to the redemption date, on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to be
deposited with the Escrow Agent, currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of and
interest on any Term Refunding
Bonds shall include amounts sufficient to redeem on the Mandatory
Redemption Dates the principal
amount of Term Refunding Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided
below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined in
Section 3) for cancellation Term
Refunding Bonds in any aggregate
principal amount and to receive a
credit
against
the
then-current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirement (and corresponding
mandatory redemption obligation) of
the City for any Term Refunding
Bonds. That option shall be exercised
by the City on or before the forty-fifth
(45th) day preceding the applicable
Mandatory Redemption Date, by furnishing the Escrow Agent a certificate, signed by the Registrar, setting
forth the extent of the credit to be
applied with respect to the then-current
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirement. If the certificate is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the thencurrent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding
mandatory
redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Refunding
Bonds which prior thereto have been
redeemed (other than through the
operation of the Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements) or
purchased for cancellation and canceled by the Registrar, to the extent
not applied theretofore as a credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Refunding Bond so
delivered, or previously redeemed, or
purchased and canceled, shall be credited by the Escrow Agent at 100% of
the principal amount thereof against
the then-current Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement (and
corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation). Any excess of that
amount over the then-current Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirement
shall
be
credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligations) in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(b) Optional Redemption. The
Refunding Bonds may be subject to
redemption prior to maturity by and
at the option of the City, in whole or in
part on any date, in whole multiples
of $5,000, on the optional redemption
dates and at the redemption prices
specified in the Certificate of Award,
plus, in each case, accrued interest to
the redemption date. Based on the
written advice of a financial advisor,
the Director of Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that

The City Record
it is in the best interests of the City
for some or all of the Refunding
Bonds not to be callable prior to their
stated maturity.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, the Refunding
Bonds, or portions thereof, to be
redeemed optionally shall be selected
by lot prior to the selection by lot of
the Refunding Bonds to be redeemed
on the same date by operation of the
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements of paragraph (a). The
Refunding Bonds shall be redeemed
pursuant to this paragraph only upon
written notice from the Director of
Finance to the Registrar. That notice
shall specify the redemption date and
the principal amount of each maturity
of Refunding Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption date
or such shorter period as shall be
acceptable to the Registrar. There
shall be deposited with the Registrar
on or prior to the redemption date,
funds sufficient to redeem at the
redemption
price,
all
of
the
redeemable Refunding Bonds for
which notice of redemption has been
given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Refunding
Bonds are called for redemption at
one time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than all
Refunding Bonds of a single maturity
are to be redeemed, the selection of
Refunding Bonds to be redeemed, or
portions thereof in amounts of $5,000
or any integral multiple thereof, shall
be made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar.
In the case of a partial redemption of
Refunding Bonds by lot when Refunding Bonds of denominations greater
than $5,000 are then outstanding, each
$5,000 unit of principal thereof shall
be treated as though it were a separate Refunding Bond of the denomination of $5,000. If it is determined
that one or more, but not all of the
$5,000 units of principal amount represented by a Refunding Bond are to
be called for redemption, then upon
notice of redemption of a $5,000 unit
or units, the registered owner of that
Refunding Bond shall surrender the
Refunding Bond to the Registrar (i)
for payment of the redemption price
of the $5,000 unit or units called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the date
fixed for redemption and any premium), and (ii) for issuance, without
charge to the registered owner thereof, of a new Refunding Bond or
Refunding Bonds of any authorized
denomination or denominations in an
aggregate principal amount equal to
the unmatured and unredeemed portion of, and bearing interest at the
same rate and maturing on the same
date as, the Refunding Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Refunding Bonds shall identify (i) by
designation, letters, numbers or other
distinguishing marks, the Refunding
Bonds or portions thereof to be
redeemed, (ii) the redemption price to
be paid, (iii) the date fixed for
redemption, and (iv) the place or
places where the amounts due upon
redemption are payable. The notice
shall be given by the Registrar on

1910

December 17, 2014
behalf of the City by mailing a copy of
the redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty
(30) days prior to the date fixed for
redemption (or such period specified
in the Certificate of Award), to the
registered owner of each Refunding
Bond subject to redemption in whole
or in part at the registered owner’s
address shown on the Register maintained by the Registrar at the close of
business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing. Failure to receive
notice by mail or any defect in that
notice regarding any Refunding
Bond, however, shall not affect the
validity of the proceedings for the
redemption of any Refunding Bond.
Any notice of redemption of any
Refunding Bonds may specify that
the redemption is contingent on the
deposit of moneys with the Escrow
Agent or Registrar, as paying agent,
on or prior to the redemption date in
an amount sufficient to pay the
redemption price of the Refunding
Bonds that are to be redeemed.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Refunding Bonds. Notice having been mailed
in the manner provided in the preceding paragraph, and moneys having
been deposited by the City with the
Escrow Agent or Registrar, as paying
agent, in an amount sufficient to pay
the redemption price, the Refunding
Bonds and portions thereof called for
redemption shall become due and
payable on the redemption date, and,
upon presentation and surrender at
the place or places specified in that
notice, shall be paid. If money for the
redemption of all of the Refunding
Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, including interest accrued
to the redemption date, is held by the
Registrar on the redemption date,
and, if notice of redemption has been
deposited in the mail, then from and
after the redemption date those
Refunding Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease to
bear interest and no longer shall be
considered to be outstanding. If that
money shall not be so available on the
redemption date, or that notice shall
not have been deposited in the mail,
those Refunding Bonds and portions
thereof shall continue to bear interest, until they are paid, at the same
rate as they would have borne had
they not been called for redemption.
All money held by the Registrar for
the redemption of particular Refunding Bonds shall be held in trust for
the account of the registered owners
and shall be paid to them, respectively, upon presentation and surrender
of those Refunding Bonds.
The debt charges on the Refunding
Bonds shall be payable in lawful
money of the United States of America without deduction for the services
of the Registrar or Escrow Agent as
paying agent. Principal shall be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Refunding
Bonds at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar. Interest on a
Refunding Bond shall be paid on each
Interest Payment Date by check or
draft mailed to the person in whose
name the Refunding Bond was registered, and to that person’s address
appearing, on the Register (as
defined in Section 3) at the close of
business on the date provided in the
Registrar Agreement authorized in
Section 3 (the “Record Date”).
Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond Ordinance,
so long as the Refunding Bonds are

December 17, 2014
held by a Depository in a book entry
system (as described in Section 3),
debt charges on the Refunding Bonds
will be payable in lawful money of
the United States by wire transfer to
the Depository made by the Escrow
Agent on each Interest Payment
Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance. The General Bond Ordinance, except for the third paragraph
of Section 13(a) (pertaining generally to an adjustment of the interest
rate in an event of default) and the
third paragraph of Section 4 (pertaining generally to the periods during
which the City is not required to make
any transfers or exchanges of
Refunding Bonds issued under the
General Bond Ordinance), will apply
to the Refunding Bonds. Except for
those provisions, the General Bond
Ordinance is included as a part of this
Ordinance as fully as if restated in
this Ordinance. Words and terms not
otherwise defined in this Ordinance
shall have the same meaning as set
forth in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Refunding Bonds; Exchange and
Transfer of the Refunding Bonds;
Paying Agents. The Refunding Bonds
shall express upon their faces the purpose for which they are issued and
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance. Pursuant to Section 4 of
the General Bond Ordinance, each
Refunding Bond shall be authenticated by the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee (as
defined therein). The Refunding
Bonds shall be signed by the City’s
Mayor and by the City’s Director of
Finance, and, consistent with Revised
Code Section 133.27 and notwithstanding Section 177.02 of the Codified Ordinances of the City, either or both of
those signatures may be a facsimile.
The Refunding Bonds shall bear the
seal of the City, which seal may be a
facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section 83
of the City’s Charter, the Director of
Law shall prepare the Refunding
Bonds and shall endorse thereon her
approval of the form thereof by her
manual or facsimile signature.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating
agent, bond registrar, transfer agent
and paying agent for the Refunding
Bonds (the “Registrar”); provided
that the Escrow Agent shall also act
as paying agent for the Refunding
Bonds so long as the Refunding
Bonds are held in a book entry system. The Director of Finance is authorized to sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, an agreement among the City, the Registrar
and the Escrow Agent (the “Registrar
Agreement”) approved as to form by
the Director of Law, containing terms
that are not inconsistent with this
Ordinance and not substantially
adverse to the City and that are
approved by the Director of Finance
on behalf of the City, all of which
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Registrar Agreement by the Director of Finance. Payment for the services rendered and for
reimbursement of expenses incurred
pursuant to the Registrar Agreement
shall be made from the proceeds of
the Refunding Bonds, to the extent
available, and then from other money
lawfully available and appropriated
for that purpose.

The City Record
So long as any of the Refunding
Bonds remain outstanding, the City
will cause the Registrar to maintain
and keep at its principal corporate
trust office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Refunding Bonds as
provided in this Section (the “Register”). Subject to the provisions of Section 4, the person in whose name a
Refunding Bond is registered on the
Register shall be regarded as the
absolute owner of that Refunding
Bond for all purposes of this Ordinance. Payment of or on account of
the debt charges on any Refunding
Bond shall be made only to or upon
the order of that person; neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the contrary, but
the registration may be changed as
provided in this Section. All such payments shall be valid and effectual to
satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the Refunding Bond,
including interest, to the extent of the
amount or amounts so paid.
Any Refunding Bond may be
exchanged for Refunding Bonds of
any authorized denomination upon
presentation and surrender at the
principal corporate trust office of the
Registrar, together with a request for
exchange signed by the registered
owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to
the Registrar. A Refunding Bond may
be transferred only on the Register
upon presentation and surrender of
the Refunding Bond at the principal
corporate trust office of the Registrar
together with an assignment signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in a
form satisfactory to the Registrar.
Upon exchange or transfer the Registrar shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Refunding Bond or
Refunding Bonds of any authorized
or
denominations
denomination
requested by the owner equal in the
aggregate to the unmatured principal
amount of the Refunding Bond surrendered and bearing interest at the
same rate and maturing on the same
date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Refunding Bonds only
after the new Refunding Bonds are
signed by the authorized officers of
the City. In all cases of Refunding
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall
authenticate
and
deliver
Refunding Bonds in accordance with
the provisions of this Ordinance. The
exchange or transfer shall be without
charge to the owner, except that the
City and Registrar may make a
charge sufficient to reimburse them
for any tax or other governmental
charge required to be paid with
respect to the exchange or transfer.
The City or the Registrar may require
that those charges, if any, be paid
before the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Refunding
Bonds issued and authenticated upon
any exchange or transfer shall be
valid obligations of the City, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
Ordinance, as the Refunding Bonds
surrendered upon that exchange or
transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the

1911

37
Refunding Bonds may be issued in
book entry form in accordance with
the provisions of this Section. As used
in this Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of beneficial interests in Refunding Bonds
and the principal of and interest on
the Refunding Bonds may be transferred only through a book entry, and
(ii) physical Refunding Bond certificates in fully registered form are
issued by the City only to a Depository or its nominee as registered owner,
with the Refunding Bonds “immobilized” in the custody of the Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the record that
identifies the owners of beneficial
interests in those Refunding Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited
purpose trust company), New York,
New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers,
banks and trust companies, and clearing corporations.
The Refunding Bonds may be
issued to a Depository for use in a
book entry system and, if and as long
as a book entry system is utilized: (i)
the Refunding Bonds may be issued
in the form of a single, fully registered Refunding Bond representing
each maturity and registered in the
name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository;
(ii) the beneficial owners in book
entry form shall have no right to
receive Refunding Bonds in the form
of physical securities or certificates;
(iii) ownership of beneficial interests
in book entry form shall be shown by
book entry on the system maintained
and operated by the Depository and
its Participants, and transfers of the
ownership of beneficial interests
shall be made only by book entry by
the Depository and its Participants;
and (iv) the Refunding Bonds as such
shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for transfer to another
Depository or to another nominee of a
Depository, without further action by
the City.
If any Depository determines not to
continue to act as a Depository for the
Refunding Bonds for use in a book
entry system, the Director of Finance
may attempt to establish a securities
depository/book entry relationship
with another qualified Depository. If
the Director of Finance does not or is
unable to do so, the Registrar, after
making provision for notification of
the beneficial owners by the then
Depository and any other arrangements deemed necessary, shall permit
withdrawal of the Refunding Bonds
from the Depository, and the Trustee
and Registrar shall authenticate and
deliver Refunding Bond certificates
in registered form to the assigns of
the Depository or its nominee, all at
the cost and expense (including any
costs of printing), if the event is not

38
the result of City action or inaction, of
those
persons
requesting
such
issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to the
extent necessary or required to enter
into any agreements determined necessary in connection with the book
entry system for the Refunding
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger the
funds or securities of the City and
after the approval of the form of any
such agreement by the Director of
Law.
Section 4. Sale of Refunding Bonds.
The Refunding Bonds shall first be
offered for purchase to the Trustees
of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by them, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased for
that Account, shall be sold to one or
more firms that have proposed to
underwrite the Refunding Bonds and
have been selected by the Director of
Finance based on an evaluation of the
qualifications of those firms (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”).
The Refunding Bonds shall be
awarded to the Original Purchaser in
the Certificate of Award which shall
specify the final terms of the Refunding Bonds in accordance with law, the
provisions of this Ordinance, the written advice of a financial advisor
retained under authority of Section 13
and the Original Purchaser’s offer to
purchase the Refunding Bonds,
including: the principal amount of the
Refunding Bonds, the purchase price
(which shall be not less than 97% of
the principal amount of the Refunding Bonds plus any accrued interest
to their date of delivery), interest rate
or rates, the amounts and years in
which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements),
the
Interest Payment Dates and the date
of the Refunding Bonds (if different
from those set forth in Section 2), and
any other matters required in this
Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. As appropriate under the
Charter, the Mayor, Director of
Finance, Director of Law, Clerk of
Council and other appropriate officers of the City are, and each of them
is, authorized to take such actions as
are necessary, appropriate and in the
best interest of the City to establish
the terms and requirements for delivery of the Refunding Bonds and to
make such arrangements as are necessary with the Original Purchaser in
order to establish the date, location,
procedure, and conditions for the
delivery of the Refunding Bonds to
the Original Purchaser, to give all
appropriate notices and certificates,
to cause a true transcript of proceedings with reference to the issuance of
the Refunding Bonds to be delivered
to the Original Purchaser, to sign any
transcript
certificates,
financial
statements and other documents and
instruments and to take such actions
as are necessary or appropriate to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take
all steps necessary to effect the due
execution, authentication and delivery of the Refunding Bonds. The
Director of Finance is further authorized to sign and deliver on behalf of
the City a bond purchase agreement
between the City and the Original
Purchaser (the “Bond Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form by

The City Record
the Director of Law, setting forth the
terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell the Refunding
Bonds and the Original Purchaser
agrees to buy the Refunding Bonds,
which shall be consistent with this
Ordinance, not substantially adverse
to the City, and approved by the Director of Finance and the Director of
Law on behalf of the City, all of which
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Bond Purchase
Agreement or amendments to the
Bond Purchase Agreement by the
Director of Finance. It is determined
that the terms of the Refunding
Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance
and as may be provided in or pursuant
to the Certificate of Award, are in the
best interest of the City and in compliance with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Director
of Finance, a disclosure document in
the form of an Official Statement is
appropriate or necessary in connection with the original issuance of the
Refunding Bonds, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare or
cause to be prepared on behalf of the
City an Official Statement and any
necessary supplements and to authorize the use and distribution of that
Official Statement and any supplements. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign on behalf of the
City that Official Statement and any
supplements. The Director of Finance
is authorized to sign and deliver, on
behalf of the City, such certificates in
connection with the accuracy of the
Official Statement and any supplements as may, in the Director’s judgment, be necessary or appropriate.
The Director of Finance is also authorized to determine and certify on
behalf of the City that such disclosure
document is “deemed final” by the
City within the meaning of Securities
and Exchange Commission Rule 15c212 (the “SEC Rule”). The Director of
Finance is authorized to contract for
services for the production and distribution of preliminary and final official statements, including by printed
and electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time of
the Refunding Bonds, the City agrees,
in accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Refunding Bonds under the SEC Rule,
to provide or cause to be provided
such financial information and operating data and notices, in such manner, as may be required for purposes
of the SEC Rule. In order to describe
and specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare or
cause to be prepared, and to sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of
the City, a continuing disclosure
agreement or certificate, which shall
constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Refunding Bonds in
accordance with the SEC Rule. The
performance of that Agreement shall
be subject to the availability of funds
and their annual appropriation to
meet costs the City would be required
to incur to perform it. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to
establish procedures in order to
ensure compliance by the City with
its continuing disclosure agreement,

1912

December 17, 2014
including the timely provision of
information and notices.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Refunding
Bonds promptly when and as the
same falls due, and also to provide for
the discharge of the Refunding Bonds
at maturity, there shall be and is
levied on all the taxable property in
the City, in addition to all other taxes,
a direct tax annually during the period the Refunding Bonds are outstanding, in an amount sufficient to provide for the payment of that interest,
when and as the same shall fall due,
and also to discharge the principal of
the Refunding Bonds at maturity,
which tax shall not be less than the
interest
and
sinking
fund
tax
required by Section 11 of Article XII
of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is ordered computed, certified, levied and extended
upon the tax duplicate and collected
by the same officers, in the same manner and at the same time that taxes
for general purposes for each of those
years are certified, extended and collected. The tax shall be placed before
and in preference to all other items
and for the full amount thereof. The
funds derived from those tax levies
shall be placed in the Unvoted Tax
Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund as required by the General Bond Ordinance and those funds,
together with the interest collected on
them shall be irrevocably pledged for
the payment of principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds when and
as the same fall due; provided, however, that, subject to the provisions of
Section 8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in each year to the extent that
revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the
Refunding Bonds and are appropriated for such purpose, the amount of
such tax shall be reduced by the
amount of such revenues so available
and appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25(B)(1) and 5705.51 of
the Revised Code, and in accordance
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the
General Bond Ordinance, that the City
will appropriate annually from the
proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt charges
for the Refunding Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds;
Notice of Redemption of Refunding
Bonds. Pursuant to Revised Code Section 133.34, the General Bond Ordinance and this Ordinance, the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds to be
applied to the refunding of the
Refunded Bonds shall be deposited in
a separate bank account within the
Unvoted Refunding Bond and Note
Redemption Account of the Sinking
Fund held by The Huntington National Bank, Cleveland, Ohio, as Escrow
Agent, in accordance with Section
179.08 of the Codified Ordinances of
the City and the Escrow Agreement
described below, and shall be applied
to the payment of debt service
charges on the Refunding Bonds from
and after the date of issuance of the
Refunding Bonds to and including
their respective maturity or prior
redemption dates. The amount to be
deposited in the Escrow Fund shall be
determined
by
the
Director
of

December 17, 2014
Finance in the Certificate of Award
and shall be the amount necessary,
together with money in the Unvoted
Tax Supported Obligations Account
of the Sinking Fund available for the
purpose, to provide for the refunding
of the Refunded Bonds. Any transfer
to the Escrow Fund of any money currently on deposit in the Unvoted Tax
Supported Obligations Account and
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance to be available for payment
of the Refunding Bonds, is authorized
by this Ordinance.
Money deposited in the Escrow
Fund shall be (a) held in cash or (b)
invested in direct obligations of the
United States of America that mature
or are subject to redemption by and at
the option of the holder, in amounts
sufficient, together with any uninvested cash in the Escrow Fund but
without further investment or reinvestment, for the payment of the principal of, and any redemption premium
and interest on, the Refunded Bonds
as provided in the Escrow Agreement.
Pursuant to the respective Ordinances authorizing the Refunded
Bonds, Section 133.34 of the Revised
Code and this Ordinance, money
deposited in the Escrow Fund, and
the investment income thereon, are
pledged to the payment of the Refunded Bonds.
Pursuant to Revised Code Chapter
133 and this Ordinance, and notwithstanding Chapter 179 of the Codified
Ordinances, any accrued interest
received from the sale of the Refunding Bonds and any original issue premium in excess of the amount deposited with the Escrow Agent under the
Escrow Agreement to accomplish the
refunding of the Refunded Bonds
shall be deposited in the Unvoted Tax
Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund to be applied to the payment of interest on the Refunding
Bonds. The proceeds of the Refunding
Bonds to be applied to pay costs of
any Credit Support Instruments
obtained pursuant to Section 12 shall
be paid to the provider or providers of
those Credit Support Instruments.
The proceeds of the Refunding Bonds
to be used to pay costs of issuing the
Refunding Bonds and refunding the
Refunded Bonds shall be deposited
with the Registrar in a separate
account under the Registrar Agreement pending their application to the
payment of such costs.
The Director of Finance is authorized to sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the Issuer, an agreement (the “Escrow Agreement”)
between the City and the Escrow
Agent, providing for the investment
and holding in escrow of the proceeds
of the Refunding Bonds to be applied
to the refunding of the Refunded
Bonds and for the application of the
moneys derived from such investments, in accordance with the General Bond Ordinance and this Ordinance
and as otherwise directed by law.
Notice of the advance refunding of
any of the Refunded Bonds and any
direction for the redemption of
Refunded Bonds prior to stated maturity shall be given in accordance with
the terms of the Refunded Bonds and
as further provided in the Escrow
Agreement. The Refunded Bonds

accordance with the ordinance authorizing the respective Refunded Bonds
and the Escrow Agreement. The

The City Record
Director of Finance shall provide for
the payment of the services rendered
and for reimbursement of expenses
incurred pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement from money lawfully
available and appropriated or to be
appropriated for that purpose. The
Director of Finance shall obtain the
services of an independent accounting firm of national reputation to provide a verification report as to the
adequacy of the escrow fund to pay
the Refunded Bonds on the dates set
forth in the Escrow Agreement. The
Director of Finance and other appropriate City officials shall execute all
documents and take all other actions
necessary or appropriate on the part
of the City to effect the refunding of
the Refunded Bonds in accordance

and discharged.

be purchased for the Escrow Fund,
the Escrow Agent is authorized to
file, on behalf of the City, subscriptions for the purchase and issuance of
those Securities. If those Securities
are not timely available for purchase,
or if in the judgment of the Director of
Finance, an open-market purchase of
direct obligations of the United States
of America for the Escrow Fund is in
the best interest of and financially
advantageous to the City, the Director of Finance may purchase and
deliver those obligations, engage the
services of a bidding agent or similar
entity for the purpose of facilitating
the bidding, purchase and delivery of
such obligations for, and any related
structuring of, the Escrow Fund, execute such instruments as are deemed
necessary to engage such services for
such purpose, and provide further for
the payment of the cost of obtaining
such services from the proceeds of the
Refunding Bonds to the extent available and otherwise from any other
funds lawfully available and that are
appropriated or shall be appropriated
for that purpose.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Refunding Bonds are secured by a
pledge and lien on a parity with the
pledges and liens authorized by the
General Bond Ordinance and, in addition to the taxes and revenues specifically pledged pursuant to this Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance and the other covenants, terms
and agreements provided hereunder
and in the General Bond Ordinance to
secure payment of the principal of
and interest on the Refunding Bonds,
the City hereby determines, declares,
warrants and covenants that the
Refunding Bonds are general obligations of the City and that the full faith
and credit of the City are hereby
pledged for the payment of the principal of and interest on the Refunding
Bonds in accordance with the laws
and Constitution of the State of Ohio,
this Ordinance and the General Bond
Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.

discharged
all
the
outstanding
Refunding Bonds, or there shall otherwise be paid to the holders of the
outstanding Refunding Bonds all
debt charges due or to become due
thereon, and provision shall also be
made for paying all other sums
payable hereunder, then and in that

1913

39
event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of
further effect, and the covenants,
agreements and other obligations of
the City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the request
of the City execute and deliver to the
City such instruments in writing as
shall discharge the lien hereof and
enter on the record such discharge of
the lien and such other instruments as
may be reasonably required by the
City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Refunding
Bonds.
Outstanding
Refunding Bonds shall be deemed to
have been paid and discharged within
the meaning of this Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a)
hereof, if:
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or sub-accounts, in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold in
special accounts or sub-accounts, in
trust for and irrevocably committed
solely thereto, direct obligations of
the United States certified by an independent public accounting firm of
national reputation to be of such
maturities and interest payment

thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held in trust and
committed, except as hereinafter provided), as will be sufficient, together
with moneys referred to in (i) above,
for the payment, at their maturities or
redemption dates, of all debt charges
on the Refunding Bonds to their date
of maturity or redemption, as the case
may be, or if default in such payment
shall have occurred on such date then
to the date of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Refunding
Bonds are to be redeemed prior to the
maturity thereof, notice of such
redemption shall have been duly
given or irrevocable provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall have been
duly made for the giving of such
notice. Any moneys held by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with the
provisions of this Section shall be

direct obligations of the United States
of America maturing, or redeemable
at the option of the holder, at times
and in amounts sufficient to meet
payment of debt charges on the
Refunding Bonds, as directed by the
Director of Finance. Any income or
interest earned by, or increment to,
the investments held under this Section shall, to the extent determined
from time to time by the Escrow
Agent to be in excess of the amount
required to be held by it for the purposes of this Section, be transferred at
the time of such determination as provided in Section 17(a) of the General
Bond Ordinance for unclaimed funds
held by a Paying Agent. In the event
of nonpresentment of any Refunding

be held and paid as provided in said
Section 17(a) for unclaimed funds
held by a Paying Agent.

that (a) the Refunding Bonds will not
(i) constitute private activity bonds
or arbitrage bonds under Sections 141

purposes, (b) it will not take or authorize to be taken any actions that
would adversely affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting for
it, will, among other acts of compliance, (i) apply the proceeds of the
Refunding Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing, (ii)
restrict the yield on investment property acquired with those proceeds,
(iii) make timely and adequate payments to the federal government, (iv)
maintain books and records and make
calculations and reports, and (v)
refrain from certain uses of those proceeds, and, as applicable, of property
financed with such proceeds, all in
such manner and to the extent necessary to assure such exclusion of that
interest under the Code.
Each covenant made in this section
with respect to the Refunding Bonds
is also made with respect to all issues
any portion of the debt service on
which is paid from proceeds of the
Refunding Bonds (and, if different,
the original issue and any refunding
issues in a series of refundings), to
the extent such compliance is necessary to assure exclusion of interest on
the Refunding Bonds from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, and the officers identified above
are authorized to take actions with
respect to those issues as they are
authorized in this section to take with
respect to the Refunding Bonds.

responsibility

or obviating those amounts or payments, as determined by that officer,
which action shall be in writing and
signed by the officer, (b) to take any
and all other actions, make or obtain
calculations, make payments, and

Ratings. If, in the judgment of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
the filing of an application for a rating on one or more Series of Refunding Bonds by one or more nationally
recognized rating agencies is in the
best interests of the City, the Director
of Finance is authorized to prepare
and submit those applications and to
provide to each such agency such
information as may be required for
the purpose. The Director of Finance

Ord. No. 1592-14.
By Council Member Kelley (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the issuance and sale of one or
more series of Subordinate Lien
Income Tax Refunding Bonds to
refund currently outstanding general
obligation and subordinate lien
income tax bonds of the City to obtain
debt service savings or restructure
the City’s outstanding debt and authorizing and approving related matters.
Whereas, the City has from time to
time issued general obligation bonds
in various series that are currently
outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $268,445,000 and issued
subordinate lien income tax bonds in
various series and subseries that are
currently outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $188,335,000;
and
Whereas, this Council has determined to authorize the City to issue
one or more series of Refunding
Bonds (as defined in Section 1) for the
purpose of obtaining debt service savings or restructuring the City’s outstanding debt with respect to all currently outstanding general obligation
and subordinate lien income tax
bonds of the City; and
Whereas, the Refunding Bonds
shall be payable from and secured by
income tax revenues of the City
remaining after deposits required
under the General Bond Ordinance
(as defined in Section 2) are made to
the escrow agent for the City’s general obligation bonds; and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of this City, has previously certified to this Council that
the estimated life or usefulness of
each of the Projects (as defined

The City Record
below) was, at the time the original
Bonds for each Project were issued, at
least five years, and that the maximum maturity of that portion of the
Refunding Bonds to be allocated to
each of the Projects financed by the
original Bonds to be refunded is
December 31 of the years determined
by the Director of Finance for each
Project based on each Project’s estimated life or usefulness; and
Whereas, the authorization for
issuance of Refunding Bonds is necessary to enable the City to take
advantage of favorable market conditions on a timely basis to obtain debt
service savings or to restructure its
outstanding debt service obligations
and thereby to protect and preserve
the credit of the City, and as a result,
this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the
immediate preservation of the public
peace, property, health and safety,
and for the usual daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. One or more
series of subordinate lien income tax
bonds of the City (“Refunding
Bonds”) are authorized to be issued
for the purpose of refunding one or
more series of the City’s outstanding
general obligation bonds and subordinate lien income tax bonds, or designated maturities thereof, issued to
provide funds to pay costs of various
projects of the City (the “Projects”)
and identified in the Certificate of
Award authorized in Section 4
(“Refunded Bonds”), including the
payment of any expenses relating to
the refunding of the Refunded Bonds
and the issuance of the Refunding
Bonds, including any financing costs
within the meaning of Revised Code
Section 133.01(K), provided that
either the aggregate net present
value debt service savings resulting
from the refunding of the Refunded

Finance and specified in the Certificate of Award, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor to be in
the best interest of the City.
The aggregate principal amount of
each respective series of Refunding
Bonds to be issued under this Ordinance shall be in an amount determined by the Director of Finance and
set forth in the Certificate of Award
as the amount required to be issued,
taking into account any original
issue discount and/or original issue
premium on the sale of the Refunding
Bonds, in order to refund the Refunded Bonds and pay any expenses relating to the refunding of the Refunded
Bonds and the issuance of the Refunding Bonds. The Refunding Bonds may
be issued in one or more separate
series, each bearing a distinctive designation, provided that the Refunding Bonds of each series satisfy the
requirements of this Ordinance and
either the aggregate net present
value debt service savings to the City
resulting from each series of Refunding Bonds is not less than three 3% or
the Refunding Bonds are issued to
restructure outstanding debt of the
City, as determined to be necessary
by the Director of Finance and specified in the Certificate of Award, based
on the written advice of a Financial

Section 2. Authority, Security and
Source of Payment. The Refunding
Bonds shall be issued pursuant to the
Ohio Constitution, Chapter 133 of the
Ohio Revised Code, the Charter of the
City, and this Ordinance for the purpose stated in Section 1. The Refunding Bonds shall be payable from and
secured by the income tax revenues of
the City on a basis subordinate to the

“Trustee”), as amended by Section 6.1
of the Second Supplemental Trust

2013 Bonds”), three series of Subordinate Lien Income Tax Bonds issued

Series 2013 Bonds, the Series 2014A
Bonds, the Series 2014B Bonds, the
Refunding Bonds and any additional
bonds issued under the Indenture are
collectively referred to in this Ordinance as the “Bonds.”
Section 3. Terms. The Refunding
Bonds may be issued in one or more
series or subseries. The Refunding
Bonds of each series shall be issued in
one lot as fully registered bonds in
denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. The Refunding
Bonds may be delivered only in bookentry form, and if so delivered, shall

42
be registered in the name of the
Depository (as defined in the Indenture) or its nominee, as registered
owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository, and shall not
be transferable or exchangeable
(except for transfer to another Depository or its nominee) without further
action by the City pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture (as identified in
Section 8). The Refunding Bonds
shall bear the designation and be
numbered as determined by the Director of Finance and specified in the
Certificate of Award. The Refunding
Bonds shall be signed by the officials
of the City and in the manner set forth
in the Indenture.
The Refunding Bonds shall be
dated the date and shall bear interest
at the rate or rates per year specified
in the Certificate of Award, provided
the weighted average of such rates
per series of Refunding Bonds (taking into account the principal amount
and maturity of each Refunding Bond
to which a rate applies) shall not
exceed 6% per year. Interest on the
Refunding Bonds shall be payable
when due, or until the principal
amount is paid, semiannually as specified in the Certificate of Award as
the dates on which interest on the
Refunding Bonds shall be payable
(the “Interest Payment Dates”),
beginning on the date specified in the
Certificate of Award as the first Interest Payment Date.
The Refunding Bonds shall mature
in the years and principal amounts as
shall be permitted by law and determined by the Director of Finance and
specified in the Certificate of Award,
based on (i) the written advice of a
Financial Advisor to be in the best
interests of the City given market
conditions at the time the Refunding
Bonds are sold and (ii) the objectives
of the plan of refunding to either
obtain aggregate net present value
debt service savings of not less than
three 3% or restructure outstanding
debt of the City.
The Director of Finance also shall
determine and certify, on or prior to
the date of delivery of the Refunding
Bonds to the Original Purchaser, that
portion of the aggregate principal
amount of the Refunding Bonds that
is allocable to each Project, and the
principal amount of Refunding Bonds
allocated to each Project that shall be
payable at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(as
defined below) on the applicable principal payment dates; provided, that
(i) the aggregate principal amount of
the Refunding Bonds allocable to a
Project shall be determined by the
Director of Finance on a pro rata
basis by reference to the respective
amount of funds that is required for
the refunding of the Refunded Bonds
that are allocable to that Project, taking into account any funds other than
the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds
that are available and appropriated
for that purpose, and (ii) no portion of
the aggregate principal amount of
Refunding Bonds allocated to a Project shall be payable later than the
maximum maturity for that portion of
the Refunding Bonds as certified by
the Director of Finance.
The Refunding Bonds stated to
mature in any year may be issued as
term bonds (the “Term Refunding
Bonds”), payable pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption

The City Record
Requirements as defined and further
described below. The Director of
Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award whether any of the
Refunding Bonds shall be issued as
Term Refunding Bonds, any dates
(the “Mandatory Redemption Dates”)
on which the principal amount of the
Term Refunding Bonds shall be
payable pursuant to mandatory sinking fund installments rather than at
stated maturity and the amount of
principal to be paid on each Mandatory Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements”).
The Refunding Bonds shall be subject to redemption prior to stated
maturity as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Refunding
Bonds are issued as Term Refunding
Bonds, the Term Refunding Bonds
shall be subject to mandatory sinking
fund redemption and be redeemed
pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements, at a
redemption price of 100% of the principal amount redeemed, plus interest
accrued to the redemption date, on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to be
deposited with the Escrow Agent, currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of and
interest on any Term Refunding
Bonds shall include amounts sufficient to redeem on the Mandatory
Redemption Dates the principal
amount of Term Refunding Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided in
the Supplemental Indenture).
(b) Optional Redemption. The
Refunding Bonds may be subject to
redemption prior to maturity by and
at the option of the City, in whole or in
part on any date, in whole multiples
of $5,000, on the optional redemption
dates and at the redemption prices
specified in the Certificate of Award,
plus, in each case, accrued interest to
the redemption date. Based on the
written advice of a financial advisor,
the Director of Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that
it is in the best interests of the City
(i) for some or all of the Refunding
Bonds not to be callable prior to their
stated maturity, and (ii) for a premium to be payable on the redemption of
any Refunding Bonds calculated in a
manner to make the bondholder
whole for the loss of the investment or
calculated as a percentage in excess
of 100% of the principal amount
redeemed.
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the City may
have the option to purchase any
Refunding Bond which is redeemable
by optional redemption at a purchase
price not less than the redemption
price that would be payable if that
Refunding Bond were called for
optional redemption on the date of the
proposed purchase. That election
shall be exercised as provided in the
Supplemental Indenture.
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the Refunding

Section 4. Sale of Refunding Bonds.
The Refunding Bonds shall first be
offered for purchase to the Trustees
of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by them, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account for

that Account, shall be sold to one or
more firms that have proposed to
underwrite the Refunding Bonds and
have been selected by the Director of
Finance based on an evaluation of the
qualifications of those firms (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”).
The Refunding Bonds shall be
awarded to the Original Purchaser in
the Certificate of Award which shall
specify the final terms of the Refunding Bonds in accordance with law, the
provisions of this Ordinance, the written advice of a financial advisor
retained under authority of Section 12
and the Original Purchaser’s offer to
purchase the Refunding Bonds,
including: the principal amount of the
Refunding Bonds, the purchase price
(which shall be not less than 97% of
the principal amount of the Refunding Bonds plus any accrued interest
to their date of delivery), interest rate
or rates, the amounts and years in
which principal installments are

Requirements),
the
Interest Payment Dates and the date

any other matters required in this
Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. As appropriate under the
Charter, the Mayor, Director of
Finance, Director of Law, Clerk of
Council and other appropriate officers of the City are, and each of them
is, authorized to take such actions as
are necessary, appropriate and in the
best interest of the City to establish
the terms and requirements for delivery of the Refunding Bonds and to
make such arrangements as are necessary with the Original Purchaser in
order to establish the date, location,
procedure, and conditions for the
delivery of the Refunding Bonds to
the Original Purchaser, to give all
appropriate notices and certificates,
to cause a true transcript of proceedings with reference to the issuance of
the Refunding Bonds to be delivered
to the Original Purchaser, to sign any
transcript
certificates,
financial
statements and other documents and
instruments and to take such actions
as are necessary or appropriate to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take
all steps necessary to effect the due
execution, authentication and delivery of the Refunding Bonds. The
Director of Finance is further authorized to sign and deliver on behalf of
the City a bond purchase agreement
between the City and the Original
Purchaser (the “Bond Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form by
the Director of Law, setting forth the
terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell the Refunding
Bonds and the Original Purchaser
agrees to buy the Refunding Bonds,
which shall be consistent with this
Ordinance and the Indenture, that are
not substantially adverse to the City,
and approved by the Director of
Finance and the Director of Law on
behalf of the City, all of which shall
be conclusively evidenced by the
signing of the Bond Purchase Agreement or amendments to the Bond Purchase Agreement by the Director of

December 17, 2014
Finance. It is determined that the
terms of the Refunding Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance and as may be
provided in or pursuant to the Certificate of Award, the Indenture and the
Supplemental Indenture, are in the
best interest of the City and in compliance with all legal requirements.
Section 5. Escrow Agreement. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of the Issuer, an agreement
(the “Escrow Agreement”) between
the City and the Escrow Agent, providing for the investment and holding
in escrow of the proceeds of the
Refunding Bonds to be applied to the
refunding of the Refunded Bonds and
for the application of the moneys
derived from such investments, in
accordance with the General Bond
Ordinance and this Ordinance and as
otherwise directed by law. Notice of
the advance refunding of any of the
Refunded Bonds and any direction for
the redemption of Refunded Bonds
prior to stated maturity shall be given
in accordance with the terms of the
Refunded Bonds and as further provided in the Escrow Agreement. The
Refunded Bonds shall be retired at
stated maturity or redeemed prior to
maturity as provided in the Certificate of Award and in accordance with

services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant
to the Escrow Agreement from money
lawfully available and appropriated
or to be appropriated for that purpose.

set forth in the Escrow Agreement.
The Director of Finance and other
appropriate City officials shall execute all documents and take all other
actions necessary or appropriate on
the part of the City to effect the
refunding of the Refunded Bonds in
accordance with the General Bond
Ordinance and this Ordinance and as
otherwise directed by law, and to
cause the Refunded Bonds to be
deemed paid and discharged.
If U.S. Treasury Securities State
and Local Government Series are to
be purchased for the Escrow Fund,
the Escrow Agent is authorized to
file, on behalf of the City, subscriptions for the purchase and issuance of
those Securities. If those Securities
are not timely available for purchase,
or if in the judgment of the Director of
Finance, an open-market purchase of
direct obligations of the United States
of America for the Escrow Fund is in
the best interest of and financially
advantageous to the City, the Director of Finance may purchase and
deliver those obligations, engage the
services of a bidding agent or similar
entity for the purpose of facilitating
the bidding, purchase and delivery of
such obligations for, and any related
structuring of, the Escrow Fund, execute such instruments as are deemed
necessary to engage such services for
such purpose, and provide further for
the payment of the cost of obtaining
such services from the proceeds of the
Refunding Bonds to the extent available and otherwise from any other
funds lawfully available and that are
appropriated or shall be appropriated
for that purpose.

Indenture, the City pledges the
municipal income taxes of the City
and grants a lien thereon, subordinate to the lien granted in the General Bond Ordinance as security for the
General Obligation Bonds of the City
issued and outstanding under the
General Bond Ordinance, to the full
extent required to meet debt charges
payable on the Bonds issued and outstanding, from time to time, under the
Indenture. The City covenants to
appropriate
annually
sufficient
amounts from the income taxes to pay
all debt charges on the General Obligation Bonds, the Bonds outstanding
under the Indenture, any Parity
Obligations and the Unrestricted
Income Tax Obligations (each as
defined in the Indenture). The City
further covenants that so long as any
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City shall not repeal or
amend, or suffer the repeal of, any
ordinance for the levy or collection of
its income taxes in any manner or to
such extent that the City would not be
able to meet its obligations to the
holders of the Bonds.
Section 7. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid and
all
the
outstanding
discharged
Refunding Bonds, or there shall otherwise be paid to the holders of the
outstanding Refunding Bonds all
debt charges due or to become due
thereon, and provision shall also be
made for paying all other sums
payable hereunder, then and in that
event this Ordinance (except for Section 7(b) hereof) shall cease to be of
further effect, and the covenants,
agreements and other obligations of
the City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the request
of the City execute and deliver to the
City such instruments in writing as
shall discharge the lien hereof and
enter on the record such discharge of
the lien and such other instruments as
may be reasonably required by the
City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Outstanding
Refunding
Bonds.
Refunding Bonds shall be deemed to
have been paid and discharged within
the meaning of this Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a)
hereof, if:
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or sub-accounts, in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold in
special accounts or sub-accounts, in
trust for and irrevocably committed
solely thereto, direct obligations of
the United States certified by an independent public accounting firm of
national reputation to be of such
maturities and interest payment
dates and to bear such interest, without further investment or reinvestment of either the principal amount
thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held in trust and
committed, except as hereinafter provided), as will be sufficient, together
with moneys referred to in (i) above,
for the payment, at their maturities or
redemption dates, of all debt charges
on the Refunding Bonds to their date
of maturity or redemption, as the case
may be, or if default in such payment
shall have occurred on such date then

1917

43
to the date of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Refunding
Bonds are to be redeemed prior to the
maturity thereof, notice of such
redemption shall have been duly
given or irrevocable provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall have been
duly made for the giving of such
notice. Any moneys held by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with the
provisions of this Section shall be
invested by the Escrow Agent in
direct obligations of the United States
of America maturing, or redeemable
at the option of the holder, at times
and in amounts sufficient to meet
payment of debt charges on the
Refunding Bonds, as directed by the
Director of Finance. Any income or
interest earned by, or increment to,
the investments held under this Section shall, to the extent determined
from time to time by the Escrow
Agent to be in excess of the amount
required to be held by it for the purposes of this Section, be transferred at
the time of such determination as provided in Section 17(a) of the General
Bond Ordinance for unclaimed funds
held by a Paying Agent. In the event
of nonpresentment of any Refunding
Bond as described in Section 17(a) of
the General Bond Ordinance, the moneys held pursuant to this Section shall
be held and paid as provided in said
Section 17(a) for unclaimed funds
held by a Paying Agent.

Refunding Bonds, payments under
any Credit Support Instrument authorized by Section 11, application of the
proceeds of the Refunding Bonds,
defeasance of the Refunding Bonds,
and other terms consistent with this
Ordinance and the Certificate of
Award and approved by the Director
of Finance as not substantially
adverse to the City. The Supplemental
Indenture shall be approved as to
form by the Director of Law. The
determination by the Director of
Finance that the provisions of the
Supplemental Indenture are not substantially adverse to the City shall be
conclusively evidenced by the Director’s signing of the Supplemental
Indenture. As appropriate under the
Charter, the Mayor, the Director of
Finance, the Director of Law, the
Clerk of Council and other appropriate officers of the City are, and each
of them is, authorized to sign,
acknowledge and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, such documents, certifications and instruments
in addition to the Indenture and Supplemental Indenture as may be necessary or appropriate to issue and sell
the Refunding Bonds and to consummate the transactions authorized by
this Ordinance.

Statement”) is appropriate or necessary in connection with the sale of the
Refunding Bonds, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare or
cause to be prepared on behalf of the
City an Official Statement with
respect to the Refunding Bonds, as
the case may be, and any necessary

44
supplements and to authorize the use
and distribution of each Official
Statement and any supplements. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign on behalf of the City and in her
official capacity each Official Statement and any supplements approved
by her. The Director of Finance is

behalf of the City and in her official
capacity such certificates in connection with the accuracy of each Official Statement and any supplements
as may, in her judgment, be necessary
or appropriate. The Director of
Finance is also authorized to determine and certify on behalf of the City
that such disclosure document is
“deemed final” by the City within the
meaning of Securities and Exchange
Commission Rule 15c2-12 the “SEC
Rule.” The Director of Finance is
authorized to contract for services for
the production and distribution of preliminary and final Official Statements, including by printed and electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time of
the Refunding Bonds, the City agrees,
in accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Refunding Bonds under the SEC Rule,
to provide or cause to be provided
such financial information and operating data and notices, in such manner as may be required for purposes of
the SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for that
purpose, and thereby to implement
that agreement, including provisions
for enforcement, amendment and termination, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare, or cause to be
prepared, and to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City, a
continuing disclosure agreement or
certificate, which shall constitute the
continuing

performance of that agreement shall
be subject to the availability of funds
and their annual appropriation to
meet costs the City would be required
to incur to perform it. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to
establish procedures in order to
ensure compliance by the City with
its continuing disclosure agreement,
including the timely provision of
information and notices.
Section 10. Federal Tax Considerations. The City covenants that it will
use, and will restrict the use and
investment of, the proceeds of the
Refunding Bonds in such manner and
to such extent as may be necessary so
that (a) the Refunding Bonds will not
(i) constitute private activity bonds
or arbitrage bonds under Sections 141
or 148 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the Code) or (ii) be

Section 103(a) of the Code applies,
and (b) the interest thereon will not
be an item of tax preference under
Section 57 of the Code.

it will take or cause to be taken such
actions that may be required of it for
the interest on the Refunding Bonds

would adversely affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting for

Refunding Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing, (ii)
restrict the yield on investment property acquired with those proceeds,
(iii) make timely and adequate payments to the federal government, (iv)
maintain books and records and make
calculations and reports, and (v)
refrain from certain uses of those proceeds, and, as applicable, of property
financed with such proceeds, all in
such manner and to the extent necessary to assure such exclusion of that
interest under the Code.
Each covenant made in this section
with respect to the Refunding Bonds
is also made with respect to all issues
any portion of the debt service on
which is paid from proceeds of the
Refunding Bonds (and, if different,

issues in a series of refundings), to

the Refunding Bonds from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, and the officers identified above
are authorized to take actions with
respect to those issues as they are

respect to the Refunding Bonds.

or obviating those amounts or payments, as determined by that officer,
which action shall be in writing and
signed by the officer, (b) to take any
and all other actions, make or obtain

make or give reports, covenants and
certifications of and on behalf of the
