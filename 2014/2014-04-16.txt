option of the Director of Public Utilities without the necessity of obtaining additional authority of this Council.
Section 2. That the costs of the contract or contracts shall be charged
against the proper appropriation

amount of the Term Bonds shall be

of the principal amount redeemed,

Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award, based on the written
advice of a financial advisor, that the

Finance so determines, then the
Director of Finance shall specify in
the Certificate of Award the method
and procedure by which the variable
rate of interest to be borne by the variable rate Notes shall be determined;
provided that the variable rate Notes
shall not bear interest at a rate in
excess of 25.00% per year. The Director of Finance is authorized to enter
into agreements in connection with
the delivery of the variable rate
Notes, and from time to time thereafter so long as the variable rate
Notes are outstanding, with providers
of Credit Support Instruments (as
defined in Section 11) and others as
may be determined by the Director of
Finance, based on the written advice
of a financial advisor, to be necessary
or appropriate to provide for the
method of determining the variable
interest rates, permitting holders the
right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support for the payment of
the variable rate Notes upon tender
for purchase or redemption, and providing for the repayment by the City
of any amounts drawn under the Credit Support Instrument. The Trustee
shall be the authenticating agent,
registrar, transfer agent and paying
agent for the Notes. The Notes shall

and in the manner set forth in the
Indenture. The Notes shall first be
offered for purchase to the Trustees
of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by them, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased for
that Account, shall be sold at not less
than par and accrued interest to one
or more firms that have proposed to
underwrite the Notes and have been
selected by the Director of Finance
based on an evaluation of the qualifications of those firms (the “Note Purchaser”) in the principal amount set
forth in a certificate of award to be
executed by the Director of Finance
(the “Note Certificate of Award”).
The proceeds of such sale shall be
paid into the proper fund or funds set
forth in the Note Certificate of Award
and used for the purpose for which
the Notes are being issued under the
provisions of this Ordinance.

and as the only obligated person with
respect to the Notes and the Series
2014B Bonds under the SEC Rule, to

purpose, and thereby to implement
that agreement, including provisions
for enforcement, amendment and termination, the Director of Finance is
authorized and directed to prepare, or
cause to be prepared, and to sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of
the City, a continuing disclosure
agreement or certificate, which shall

Finance is further authorized to
establish procedures in order to
ensure compliance by the City with
its continuing disclosure agreement,
including the timely provision of

therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed necessary to issue the Series 2014B Bonds
in an aggregate principal amount not
to exceed $7,000,000 for the purpose of
providing funds to improve municipal

be payable from income tax collections remaining after depositing with
the escrow agent under the General
Bond Ordinance the amount required
for the payment of debt service on the
City’s General Obligation Bonds
issued and outstanding, from time to
time, under the General Bond Ordinance. The Series 2014B Bonds shall
be issued and secured under the terms

by Section 6.1 of the Second Supplemental Trust Indenture, dated as of

Bonds, the Series 2014A Bonds, the
Series 2014B Bonds and any additional bonds issued under the Indenture

Section 3. Pledge and Covenant to
Maintain Income Tax. So long as
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City pledges the
municipal income taxes of the City
and grants a lien thereon, subordinate to the lien granted in the General Bond Ordinance as security for the
General Obligation Bonds of the City
issued and outstanding under the
General Bond Ordinance, to the full
extent required to meet debt charges
payable on the Bonds issued and outstanding, from time to time, under the
Indenture. The City covenants to
appropriate
annually
sufficient
amounts from the income taxes to pay
all debt charges on the General Obligation Bonds, the Bonds outstanding
under the Indenture, any Parity
Obligations and the Unrestricted
Income Tax Obligations (each as
defined in the Indenture). The City
further covenants that so long as any
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City shall not repeal or
amend, or suffer the repeal of, any
ordinance for the levy or collection of
its income taxes in any manner or to
such extent that the City would not be
able to meet its obligations to the
holders of the Bonds.
Section 4. Terms of the Series 2014B
Bonds. The Series 2014B Bonds shall
be issued in fully registered form.
The Series 2014B Bonds may be issued
in one or more series or subseries. The
Series 2014B Bonds may be delivered
only in book-entry form, and if so
delivered, shall be registered in the
name of the Depository (as defined in
the Indenture) or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the
custody of the Depository, and shall
not be transferable or exchangeable

10
(except for transfer to another Depository or its nominee) without further
action by the City pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture and the Sixth
Supplement identified in Section 7.
The Series 2014B Bonds shall be designated “Parks and Recreation Facilities Improvement Bonds, Series
2014B” and may contain such further
designation as provided in the Certificate of Award identified below. The
Series 2014B Bonds shall be issued in
one lot as fully registered Series
2014B Bonds in denominations of
$5,000 or any whole multiple thereof.
The Series 2014B Bonds shall be numbered as determined by the Director
of Finance. The Series 2014B Bonds
shall be signed by the officials of the
City and in the manner set forth in the
Indenture.
The Series 2014B Bonds shall be
dated the date of their issuance and
delivery or such other date specified
in the certificate of award providing
for the final terms of the Series 2014B
Bonds and the sale of the Series 2014B
Bonds in accordance with this Ordinance (the “Certificate of Award”).
The Series 2014B Bonds shall bear
interest from their date until the principal amount is paid at the rate or
rates per year specified in the Certificate of Award, provided that the yield
(determined in accordance with the
arbitrage provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) of
the Series 2014B Bonds shall not
exceed 6.00% per year. Interest on the
Series 2014B Bonds shall be payable
semi-annually on April 1 and October
1, or such other dates specified in the
Certificate of Award (the “Interest
Payment Dates”).
The Series 2014B Bonds shall
mature in the years and principal
amounts set forth in the Certificate of
Award, provided that (i) each principal payment shall occur on an Interest Payment Date, and (ii) the final
maturity date of the Series 2014B
Bonds shall be no later than August 1,
2036. The Series 2014B Bonds stated to
mature in any year may be issued as
serial Series 2014B Bonds or as term
Series 2014B Bonds payable prior to
stated maturity pursuant to sinking
fund redemption (the “Term Bonds”).
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Series 2014B
Bonds shall be issued as Term Bonds,
any dates (the “Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable pursuant to mandatory sinking fund installments rather than at
stated maturity and the amount of
principal to be paid on each Mandatory Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements”). If any of the Series 2014B
Bonds are issued as Term Series
2014B Bonds, the Term Bonds shall be
redeemed pursuant to the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements at a redemption price of 100%
of the principal amount redeemed,
plus interest accrued to the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates. The aggregate of the moneys to be deposited with the Trustee
for payment of principal of and interest on any Term Bonds shall include
amounts sufficient to redeem on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates the
principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided in

The City Record
the Indenture and the Sixth Supplement).
The Series 2014B Bonds may be subject to redemption prior to maturity
by and at the option of the City, in
whole or in part on any date, in whole
multiples of $5,000, on the redemption
dates and at the redemption prices
specified in the Certificate of Award,
plus, in each case, accrued interest to
the redemption date. Based on the
written advice of a financial advisor,
the Director of Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that
it is in the best interests of the City
(i) for some or all of the Series 2014B
Bonds not to be callable prior to their
stated maturity, and (ii) for a premium to be payable on the redemption of
any Series 2014B Bonds calculated in
a manner to make the bondholder
whole for the loss of the investment or
calculated as a percentage in excess
of 100% of the principal amount
redeemed.
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the City may
have the option to purchase any Bond
which is redeemable by optional
redemption at a purchase price not
less than the redemption price that
would be payable if that Bond were
called for optional redemption on the
date of the proposed purchase. That
election shall be exercised as provided in the Sixth Supplement.
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the Series 2014B
Bonds may be secured by a Debt Service Reserve Fund to be held by the
Trustee under the Indenture. The
principal amount of the Series 2014B
Bonds may include provision for funding the Debt Service Reserve Fund
from the proceeds of the Bonds, subject to compliance with applicable
federal tax laws.
Section 5. Sale of Series 2014B

first be offered for purchase to the
Trustees of the Sinking Fund and, if

the best interest of the City and in
compliance with all legal requirements.

may be issued in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $7,000,000
(the “Notes”) upon the direction of the

shall apply to the Notes and pursuant
to that authority and this Ordinance,
the Director of Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award,
based on the written advice of a financial advisor, that the City’s best interests will be served by causing all or a
portion of the Notes to be obligations
bearing interest at variable rates. If
the Director of Finance so determines, then the Director of Finance
shall specify in the Certificate of
Award the method and procedure by
which the variable rate of interest to
be borne by the variable rate Notes

The City Record
shall be determined; provided that the

interest at a rate in excess of 25.00%
per year. The Director of Finance is
authorized to enter into agreements
in connection with the delivery of the
variable rate Notes, and from time to
time thereafter so long as the variable rate Notes are outstanding, with
providers of Credit Support Instruments (as defined in Section 11) and
others as may be determined by the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a financial advisor,
to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the method of determining
the variable interest rates, permitting
holders the right of tender, providing
for liquidity or credit support for the
payment of the variable rate Notes
upon tender for purchase or redemption, and providing for the repayment
by the City of any amounts drawn
under the Credit Support Instrument.
The Trustee shall be the authenticating agent, registrar, transfer agent
and paying agent for the Notes. The
Notes shall be signed by the officials
of the City and in the manner set forth
in the Indenture. The Notes shall first
be offered for purchase to the

not purchased by them, shall be
offered to the Treasury Investment
Account for purchase and, if not purchased for that Account, shall be sold
at not less than par and accrued interest to one or more firms that have proposed to underwrite the Notes and
have been selected by the Director of
Finance based on an evaluation of the
qualifications of those firms (the
“Note Purchaser”) in the principal
amount set forth in a certificate of
award to be executed by the Director
of Finance (the “Note Certificate of
Award”). The proceeds of such sale
shall be paid into the proper fund or
funds set forth in the Note Certificate
of Award and used for the purpose for
which the Notes are being issued
under the provisions of this Ordinance.
Section 9. Official Statement; Continuing Disclosure. If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a disclosure document (each, an “Official
Statement”) is appropriate or necessary in connection with the sale of the
Notes or the Series 2014B Bonds, the
Director of Finance is authorized to
prepare or cause to be prepared on
behalf of the City an Official Statement with respect to the Notes or the
Series 2014B Bonds, as the case may
be, and any necessary supplements

beneficial owners from time to time of
the Notes or the Series 2014B Bonds,

respect to the Notes and the Series
2014B Bonds under the SEC Rule, to
provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner as
may be required for purposes of the

specify certain terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for that
purpose, and thereby to implement

for enforcement, amendment and termination, the Director of Finance is
authorized and directed to prepare, or
cause to be prepared, and to sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of
the City, a continuing disclosure
agreement or certificate, which shall
constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Notes or the Series
2014B Bonds, as the case may be, in
accordance with the SEC Rule. The
performance of that agreement shall
be subject to the availability of funds
and their annual appropriation to
meet costs the City would be required
to incur to perform it. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to
establish procedures in order to
ensure compliance by the City with
its continuing disclosure agreement,
including the timely provision of
information and notices.
Section 10. Federal Tax Considerations. The City covenants that it will
use, and will restrict the use and
investment of, the proceeds of the
Series 2014B Bonds and any Notes in
such manner and to such extent as
may be necessary so that (i)  the
Series 2014B Bonds and any Notes will
not (A) constitute private activity
bonds or arbitrage bonds under Sections 141 or 148 of the Internal Revenue Code of l986, as amended (the
“Code”) or (B) be treated other than
as bonds the interest on which is
excluded from gross income under
Section 103 of the Code, and (ii) the
interest on the Series 2014B Bonds
and any Notes will not be an item of
tax preference under Section 57 of the
Code.
The City further covenants that (i)
it will take or cause to be taken such
actions that may be required of it for
the interest on the Series 2014B Bonds
and any Notes to be and remain
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, (ii) it will not
take or authorize to be taken any
actions that would adversely affect
that exclusion, and (iii) it, or persons
acting for it, will, among other acts of
compliance, (A) apply the proceeds of
the Series 2014B Bonds and any Notes
to the governmental purpose of the
borrowing, (B) restrict the yield on
investment property, (C) make timely
and adequate payments to the federal
government, (D) maintain books and
records and make calculations and
reports and (E) refrain from certain
uses of those proceeds, and, as applicable, of property financed with such
proceeds, all in such manner and to
the extent necessary to assure such

Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed necessary to issue the Series 2014B Bonds

such other costs of the foregoing permanent improvements that may be
financed with the proceeds of securities as permitted by Section 133.15(B)
of the Ohio Revised Code and as otherwise permitted by law.
Section 2. Authority, Security and
Source of Payment. The Series 2014B

Ohio Revised Code, the Charter of the
City, and this Ordinance for the purpose stated in Section  1. The Series
2014B Bonds shall be payable from

be payable from income tax collections remaining after depositing with
the escrow agent under the General
Bond Ordinance the amount required
for the payment of debt service on the
City’s General Obligation Bonds
issued and outstanding, from time to

June 1, 2010, between the City and the
Trustee (together, the “Indenture”).
The Indenture currently secures five
series of Subordinate Lien Income

Section 3. Pledge and Covenant to
Maintain Income Tax. So long as
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City pledges the
municipal income taxes of the City
and grants a lien thereon, subordinate to the lien granted in the General Bond Ordinance as security for the
General Obligation Bonds of the City
issued and outstanding under the
General Bond Ordinance, to the full
extent required to meet debt charges
payable on the Bonds issued and outstanding, from time to time, under the
Indenture. The City covenants to
appropriate
annually
sufficient
amounts from the income taxes to pay
all debt charges on the General Obligation Bonds, the Bonds outstanding
under the Indenture, any Parity
Obligations and the Unrestricted
Income Tax Obligations (each as
defined in the Indenture). The City
further covenants that so long as any
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City shall not repeal or
amend, or suffer the repeal of, any
ordinance for the levy or collection of
its income taxes in any manner or to
such extent that the City would not be
able to meet its obligations to the
holders of the Bonds.
Section 4. Terms of the Series 2014B
Bonds. The Series 2014B Bonds shall
be issued in fully registered form.
The Series 2014B Bonds may be issued
in one or more series or subseries. The
Series 2014B Bonds may be delivered
only in book-entry form, and if so
delivered, shall be registered in the
name of the Depository (as defined in
the Indenture) or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the
custody of the Depository, and shall
not be transferable or exchangeable
(except for transfer to another Depository or its nominee) without further
action by the City pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture and the Sixth
Supplement identified in Section 7.
The Series 2014B Bonds shall be designated “Public Facilities Improvement Bonds, Series 2014B” and may
contain such further designation as
provided in the Certificate of Award
identified below. The Series 2014B
Bonds shall be issued in one lot as
fully registered Series 2014B Bonds in
denominations of $5,000 or any whole
multiple thereof. The Series 2014B
Bonds shall be numbered as determined by the Director of Finance. The
Series 2014B Bonds shall be signed by
the officials of the City and in the
manner set forth in the Indenture.
The Series 2014B Bonds shall be
dated the date of their issuance and
delivery or such other date specified

513

13
in the certificate of award providing
for the final terms of the Series 2014B
Bonds and the sale of the Series 2014B
Bonds in accordance with this Ordinance (the “Certificate of Award”).
The Series 2014B Bonds shall bear
interest from their date until the principal amount is paid at the rate or
rates per year specified in the Certificate of Award, provided that the yield
(determined in accordance with the
arbitrage provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) of
the Series 2014B Bonds shall not
exceed 6.00% per year. Interest on the
Series 2014B Bonds shall be payable
semi-annually on April 1 and October
1, or such other dates specified in the
Certificate of Award (the “Interest
Payment Dates”).
The Series 2014B Bonds shall
mature in the years and principal
amounts set forth in the Certificate of
Award, provided that (i) each principal payment shall occur on an Interest Payment Date, and (ii) the final
maturity date of the Series 2014B
Bonds shall be no later than August 1,
2030. The Series 2014B Bonds stated to
mature in any year may be issued as
serial Series 2014B Bonds or as term
Series 2014B Bonds payable prior to
stated maturity pursuant to sinking
fund redemption (the “Term Bonds”).
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Series 2014B
Bonds shall be issued as Term Bonds,
any dates (the “Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable pursuant to mandatory sinking fund installments rather than at
stated maturity and the amount of
principal to be paid on each Mandatory Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements”). If any of the Series 2014B
Bonds are issued as Term Series
2014B Bonds, the Term Bonds shall be
redeemed pursuant to the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements at a redemption price of 100%
of the principal amount redeemed,
plus interest accrued to the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates. The aggregate of the moneys to be deposited with the Trustee
for payment of principal of and interest on any Term Bonds shall include
amounts sufficient to redeem on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates the
principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided in
the Indenture and the Sixth Supplement).
The Series 2014B Bonds may be subject to redemption prior to maturity
by and at the option of the City, in
whole or in part on any date, in whole
multiples of $5,000, on the redemption
dates and at the redemption prices
specified in the Certificate of Award,
plus, in each case, accrued interest to
the redemption date. Based on the
written advice of a financial advisor,
the Director of Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that
it is in the best interests of the City
(i) for some or all of the Series 2014B
Bonds not to be callable prior to their
stated maturity, and (ii) for a premium to be payable on the redemption of
any Series 2014B Bonds calculated in
a manner to make the bondholder
whole for the loss of the investment or
calculated as a percentage in excess
of 100% of the principal amount
redeemed.

14
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the City may
have the option to purchase any Bond
which is redeemable by optional
redemption at a purchase price not
less than the redemption price that
would be payable if that Bond were
called for optional redemption on the
date of the proposed purchase. That
election shall be exercised as provided in the Sixth Supplement.
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the Series 2014B
Bonds may be secured by a Debt Service Reserve Fund to be held by the
Trustee under the Indenture. The
principal amount of the Series 2014B
Bonds may include provision for funding the Debt Service Reserve Fund
from the proceeds of the Bonds, subject to compliance with applicable
federal tax laws.
Section 5. Sale of Series 2014B
Bonds. The Series 2014B Bonds shall
first be offered for purchase to the
Trustees of the Sinking Fund and, if
not purchased by them, shall be
offered to the Treasury Investment

option of the City, the Interest Payment Dates and the date of the Series
2014B Bonds (if different from those
set forth in Section 3) and any other
matters required in this Ordinance to

the best interest of the City and in
compliance with all legal requirements.

Section 8. Bond Anticipation Notes.
For the purpose of raising money in
anticipation of the issuance of the
Series 2014B Bonds for the purpose set
forth in Section 1, notes of the City
may be issued in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $14,500,000
(the “Notes”) upon the direction of the
Director of Finance to be set forth in a
certificate providing for the final
terms of the Notes and the sale of the
Notes and signed by the Director of
Finance (the “Note Certificate of
Award”). The Notes, if sold as fixed
rate obligations, shall bear interest at
such rate, not exceeding 6.00% per
year, and shall be payable on the date
or dates, as shall be determined by the
Director of Finance of the City in the
Note Certificate of Award; shall be
dated their date of issuance; shall
mature on the date set forth in the
Note Certificate of Award; shall be
subject to redemption by the City at
any time prior to maturity without
penalty, unless the Director of
Finance, based on the advice of a
financial advisor, determines that it
is in the best interest of the City in
order to enhance the marketability of
the Notes, that the Notes not be
redeemable prior to maturity or that a
premium be paid on their prior
redemption; shall be designated “Public Facilities Improvement Bond
Anticipation Notes” or as otherwise
provided in the Note Certificate of
Award; shall be issued in such numbers and denominations as may be
requested by the Note Purchaser
(hereinafter defined); and shall be
issued in fully registered form (which
may be in a book entry only system).
The provisions of Sections 9.98 to 9.983
of the Revised Code shall apply to the
Notes and pursuant to that authority
and this Ordinance, the Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award, based on the written
advice of a financial advisor, that the
City’s best interests will be served by
causing all or a portion of the Notes to
be obligations bearing interest at
variable rates. If the Director of
Finance so determines, then the
Director of Finance shall specify in
the Certificate of Award the method
and procedure by which the variable
rate of interest to be borne by the variable rate Notes shall be determined;
provided that the variable rate Notes
shall not bear interest at a rate in
excess of 25.00% per year. The Director of Finance is authorized to enter
into agreements in connection with
the delivery of the variable rate
Notes, and from time to time thereafter so long as the variable rate
Notes are outstanding, with providers
of Credit Support Instruments (as
defined in Section 11) and others as
may be determined by the Director of
Finance, based on the written advice
of a financial advisor, to be necessary
or appropriate to provide for the
method of determining the variable
interest rates, permitting holders the
right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support for the payment of
the variable rate Notes upon tender
for purchase or redemption, and providing for the repayment by the City
of any amounts drawn under the Credit Support Instrument. The Trustee

April 16, 2014
shall be the authenticating agent,
registrar, transfer agent and paying
agent for the Notes. The Notes shall
be signed by the officials of the City
and in the manner set forth in the
Indenture. The Notes shall first be
offered for purchase to the Trustees
of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by them, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased for
that Account, shall be sold at not less
than par and accrued interest to one
or more firms that have proposed to
underwrite the Notes and have been
selected by the Director of Finance
based on an evaluation of the qualifications of those firms (the “Note Purchaser”) in the principal amount set
forth in a certificate of award to be
executed by the Director of Finance
(the “Note Certificate of Award”).
The proceeds of such sale shall be
paid into the proper fund or funds set
forth in the Note Certificate of Award
and used for the purpose for which
the Notes are being issued under the
provisions of this Ordinance.
Section 9. Official Statement; Continuing Disclosure. If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a disclosure document (each, an “Official
Statement”) is appropriate or necessary in connection with the sale of the
Notes or the Series 2014B Bonds, the
Director of Finance is authorized to
prepare or cause to be prepared on
behalf of the City an Official Statement with respect to the Notes or the
Series 2014B Bonds, as the case may
be, and any necessary supplements
and to authorize the use and distribution of each Official Statement and
any supplements. The Director of
Finance is authorized to sign on
behalf of the City and in her official
capacity each Official Statement and
any supplements approved by her.
The Director of Finance is authorized
to sign and deliver on behalf of the
City and in her official capacity such
certificates in connection with the
accuracy of each Official Statement
and any supplements as may, in her
judgment, be necessary or appropriate. The Director of Finance is also
authorized to determine and certify

not (A) constitute private activity
bonds or arbitrage bonds under Sections 141 or 148 of the Internal Revenue Code of l986, as amended (the
“Code”) or (B) be treated other than
as bonds the interest on which is
excluded from gross income under
Section 103 of the Code, and (ii) the

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 472-14.
By Council Member Dow and J.
Johnson.
An emergency resolution withdrawing objection to the renewal of a
D2, D2X, D3 and D6 Liquor Permit at
6201 St. Clair Avenue, 1st floor and
repealing Resolution No. 1060-13,
objecting to said renewal.
Whereas, this Council objected to
the renewal of a D2, D2X, D3 and D6
Liquor Permit to Dot & Beanies Tavern, Inc., 6201 St. Clair Avenue, 1st
floor, Cleveland, Ohio 44103, Permanent Number 2275179 by Resolution
No. 1060-13, adopted by the Council on
August 14, 2013; and
Whereas, this Council wishes to
withdraw its objection to the above
permit and consents to said permit;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That objection to the
renewal of a D2, D2X, D3 and D6
Liquor Permit to Dot & Beanies Tavern, Inc., 6201 St. Clair Avenue, 1st
floor, Cleveland, Ohio 44103, Permanent Number 2275179, be and the same

hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its

shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted April 7, 2014.
Effective April 8, 2014.

Res. No. 475-14.
By Council Members Kelley, Brancatelli, Cleveland, Brady, Mitchell,
Keane, Zone, Dow, Pruitt, Reed, J.
Johnson, Polensek, Cimperman, K,
Johnson, Conwell, Cummins and
Sweeney.
An emergency resolution supporting the Cuyahoga County Council’s
Ordinance No. O2014-0008 that enacts
the Cuyahoga County Voting Rights
Law to assist its citizens in exercising their right to vote through voter
registration, early voting, and voting
by mail programs; and urging the
County to send applications to vote by
mail with postage-prepaid return
envelopes to all registered voters in
Cuyahoga County.
Whereas, on March 11, 2014, the
Cuyahoga County Council introduced
Ordinance No. O2014-008 to enact the
Cuyahoga County Voting Rights Law
and update the Cuyahoga County
Equity Plan in Chapter 1101 of the
Cuyahoga County Code; and
Whereas, the Cuyahoga County
Voting Rights Law promotes voter
participation and access to the ballot
in Cuyahoga County by all citizens
through voter registration, early voting, and voting by mail programs,
including mailing applications to
vote by mail with postage-prepaid
return envelopes; and
Whereas, as recognized by the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit in
League of Women Voters of Ohio v.
Brunner, 548 F.3d 463 (6th Cir. 2008),
the citizens of Cuyahoga County
experienced substantial problems
and long lines trying to exercise their
constitutional right to vote during the
2004 general election; and,
Whereas, the voting problems experienced by the County’s citizens in
2004 are not a mere accident, but are
the byproduct of unique conditions
and needs of large, urban counties;
and,
Whereas, Cuyahoga County is
Ohio’s largest county with a population of 1,280,122, and home to approximately 11 percent of Ohio’s population
of 11,536,502, according to the 2010 U.S.
Census; and,
Whereas, a significant percentage
of the County’s citizens often change
residential addresses a number of
times in between elections. Almost 35
percent of Cuyahoga County’s citizenry reside in rental housing. Furthermore, the County’s Office of Homeless
Services estimates that approximately 5,157 homeless citizens above the
age of 18 live in the County who are
entitled to cast their ballots in accordance with Northeast Ohio Coalition
for the Homeless v. Husted, 2012 WL
2711393 (S.D. Ohio July 9, 2012); and,
Whereas, 94 percent of the voting
precincts in Cuyahoga County are in
multi-precinct locations, which significantly raises the possibility of relegating the County’s citizens to provisional ballots when they vote on Election Day; and,
Whereas, the County found a real
solution to these voting problems
through a combination of mechanisms working together, including
(1) the ability of its citizens, especially citizens who change residential
addresses multiple times in between
elections, to register to vote or update
their voting registration and cast
their vote on the same day during
early in person voting at the Board of
Elections; (2) early in person voting
at the Board of Elections during after

524

April 16, 2014
hours, the weekends, especially Sundays, and the Monday before the election; and (3) mailing the vote by mail
applications to its citizens with
postage-prepaid return envelopes to
promote early voting and voting by
mail; and,
Whereas, the citizens of Cuyahoga
County have come to expect and rely
on the fact that they automatically
receive their requests for ballots to
vote by mail, with postage-prepaid
return envelopes, for every election;
and,
Whereas, these solutions proved
successful, and the County reduced
the number of voting precincts available on Election Day; and,
Whereas, by the adoption of Ohio
Senate Bills 205, 216, and 238, and Secretary of State Directive 2014-06, the
State has jettisoned the very solutions that proved successful in resolving elections problems in Cuyahoga
County; and,
Whereas, Cuyahoga County has a
substantial interest in ensuring that
its citizens have adequate opportunities to cast their ballots in every election; and
Whereas, Cuyahoga County also
has a substantial interest in protecting the integrity of its own elections,
including elections for its elected
offices and issues that it places on the
ballot by ensuring that the County’s
citizens have adequate opportunities
to cast their ballot in elections that
can be very close and impacted by the
citizenry’s ability to have adequate
access to the ballot; and,
Whereas, In August 2012, Cuyahoga County adopted an Equity Plan,
codified in Chapter 1101 of the Cuyahoga County Code, that expressly provides that the County’s objective is to
remove barriers that stand in the way
of the County’s citizens; and
Whereas, the restrictions imposed
by the State have a disparate impact
on working men and women in Cuyahoga County; and,
Whereas, the County should do
everything possible to remove barriers in the way of its citizens’ constitutional right to vote to further its equity objectives; and,
Whereas, as federal courts have
recognized, the establishment of socalled “uniform” procedures across
the State that fail to take into account
the unique needs of individual counties results in inequity and hurts the
ability of citizens in large counties to
vote. See, e.g., Vanzant v. Brunner,
S.D.Ohio Case No. 1:10-cv-596; and,
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
supports the County Council’s determination, as a chartered county with
home rule powers, that it is necessary
to provide services to its citizens to
facilitate their ability to vote; and,
Whereas, as a chartered county,
Cuyahoga County is constitutionally
entitled to rights and privileges,
including a First Amendment right to
communicate with its citizens and
share information with them on how
to vote and what forms to use when
they want to apply to receive their
ballots by mail; and,
Whereas, Senate Bill 205 restricts
speech based on the identity of the
speaker by not prohibiting individuals and private corporations from
exercising their First Amendment
right to communicate through sending applications to vote by mail,
including postage-prepaid return
to
envelopes,
while
attempting

April 16, 2014
restrict the ability of home rule entities from exercising the very same
speech; and,
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
supports the County Council’s finding
that it is necessary to invoke the
County’s home rule powers and its
constitutional
First
Amendment
rights to establish a program to assist
its citizens in exercising their right to
vote through voter registration as
well as mailing applications for voting by mail to its citizens, with
postage-prepaid return envelopes;
and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
supports the County Council’s Voting
Rights Law that will assist all Cleveland and Cuyahoga County citizens in
exercising their right to vote; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the Cuyahoga County Council’s
Ordinance No. O2014-0008 that enacts
the Cuyahoga County Voting Rights
Law to assist its citizens in exercising their right to vote through voter
registration, early voting, and voting
by mail programs; and urges the
County to send applications to vote by
mail with postage-prepaid return
envelopes to all registered voters in
Cuyahoga County.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
resolution to the Cuyahoga County
Council,
County
Executive,
Ed
FitzGerald,
and
Councilmember
Sunny Simon.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted April 7, 2014.
Effective April 8, 2014.
