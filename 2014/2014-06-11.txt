Whereas, this Council has determined that the City may achieve further benefits by refunding certain
Outstanding Bonds through the
issuance and sale of Additional Bonds
(“Series 2014 Refunding Bonds”) and
thereby restructuring the Outstanding Bonds to better serve the purposes
of Cleveland Public Power and its
customers and the process for achieving those benefits may evolve over a
period of several years; and
Whereas, this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of a
municipal department and providing
for the immediate preservation of the
public peace, property, health or safety in that authorizing the Series 2014
Refunding Bonds to refund Outstanding Bonds is necessary to enable
Cleveland Public Power to take
advantage of favorable market conditions on a timely basis to achieve a
desirable debt restructuring; now,
therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

Section 2. Authority. This Series
2014 Refunding Bond Legislation is
adopted pursuant to Sections 3, 4 and
12 of Article XVIII of the Constitution
of the State, and the City’s Charter.
Section 3. Authorization of Series
2014 Refunding Bonds. This Council
finds and determines it is necessary
and proper and in the best interest of
the City to authorize the issuance of
the Series 2014 Refunding Bonds for
the purpose of refunding one or more
series of the Outstanding Bonds, or
designated maturities thereof, for the
purpose of restructuring the debt service on Outstanding Bonds in a manner that the Director of Finance determines, based on the written advice of
a Financial Advisor, to serve the
City’s best interests. The Series 2014
Refunding Bonds may be issued in
one or more separate series so long as
the one or more series issued in the
aggregate meet the requirements of
the preceding sentence. The principal
amount of each series of Series 2014
Refunding Bonds is to be the amount
set forth in the Series 2014 Refunding
Certificate of Award authorized in
Section 6 and shall be the amount
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, to be necessary (i) to refund the Refunded
Bonds, (ii) to fund any deposit to the
Bond Service Reserve Fund or the
Renewal and Replacement Fund
required under the Indenture, (iv) to
pay costs of any Credit Support
Instruments, (v) to pay identified
amounts owed under any Hedge
Agreements, and (vi) to pay costs of
issuing the Series 2014 Refunding
Bonds and refunding the Refunded
Bonds. The proceeds from the sale of
each series of Series 2014 Refunding
Bonds shall be allocated, deposited

30
and applied as provided in Section 7 of
this Ordinance.
The Series 2014 Refunding Bonds
may be issued in one or more separate
series, each bearing a distinctive designation, provided that the Series 2014
Refunding Bonds of each series satisfy the requirements of this Series 2014
Refunding Bond Legislation and the
Indenture. Separate series of Series
2014 Refunding Bonds may be issued
at the same or different times. The
Series 2014 Refunding Bonds of each
series shall be designated as provided
in the applicable Certificate of Award
(including replacing references to
2014 to the calendar year in which the
obligations are issued). A separate
Certificate of Award and a separate
Supplemental Indenture may be delivered for each series. Costs of issuance
of the Series 2014 Refunding Bonds
and any required deposit to the Bond
Service Reserve Fund attributable to
the Series 2014 Refunding Bonds
shall, in each case, be included in the
costs funded from the proceeds of the
Series 2014 Refunding Bonds. The
Series 2014 Refunding Bonds shall
constitute Bonds for all purposes of
the Indenture.
This Council finds and determines
that the issuance of the Series 2014
Refunding Bonds to restructure Outstanding Bonds serves a proper, public, municipal purpose by reducing
the cost at which Cleveland Public
Power can provide electric power.
Section 4. Authorization of Hedging
Arrangements. This Council finds
that by engaging in interest rate
hedging arrangements from time to
time, the City may reduce its cost of
borrowing by optimizing the relative
amounts of fixed and variable rate
obligations and minimizing the risk
of variations in its debt service costs.
Certain types of hedging arrangements (referred to in this Series 2014
Refunding
Bond
Legislation
as
“swaptions”) may enable the City to
obtain savings prior to the issuance of
Series 2014 Refunding Bonds by providing for an upfront payment to the
City by a financial institution or other
organization that is the counterparty
to the hedge arrangement in consideration of the City’s giving the counterparty the option to make effective at
a future date an interest rate
exchange transaction with the City.
To permit the City to have the flexibility to undertake interest rate swap,
swaption, rate cap, rate collar and
other hedging transactions from time
to time, and to establish the procedures for approving those transactions, this Council authorizes the
signing and delivery of one or more
agreements (each, a “Hedge Agreement”) and any related agreements
necessary for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by
each Hedge Agreement. The authorizations in this Section are supplemental to and not in derogation of any
authority provided by any other ordinance of this Council concerning
hedging arrangements, and are all
subject to the requirements and
restrictions of the Indenture.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
that it is to the financial advantage of
the City and in the City’s best interests that a hedging arrangement be
undertaken by the City with respect
to any Bonds issued or to be issued
under the Indenture, the Director of
Finance may authorize one or more

The City Record
interest rate hedge transactions in
accordance
with
the
applicable
Hedge Agreement; provided that (a)
the counterparty shall be rated at the
time of signing the Hedge Agreement
not lower than A+ or A1 by at least
one rating agency or its obligations
under the Hedge Agreement shall be
guaranteed or insured by an entity
rated at the time of signing the Hedge
Agreement not lower than A+ or A1
by at least one rating agency, and (b)
the term of each hedge transaction
shall not exceed the final maturity of
the Bonds to which the hedge relates
or (in the case of an option) will
relate. The requirements of this paragraph are in addition to, and not in
place or in derogation of, any other
applicable requirements of the Indenture.
The Director of Finance shall negotiate the terms of each Hedge Agreement with a counterparty satisfying
the credit criteria in this Series 2014
Refunding Bond Legislation and the
Indenture. The City shall receive a
written opinion of a Financial Advisor that the upfront payment or the
periodic payments, as the case may
be, to be made by the counterparty to
the City, or by the City to the counterparty, shall be fair value for the
Hedge Agreement, given the credit of
the counterparty and the terms and
conditions of the Hedge Agreement.
The Director of Finance shall determine the terms and conditions of the
Hedge Agreement, including without
limitation, the time or times and procedures for the exercise by the counterparty or the City, as the case may
be, of its option under the Hedge
Agreement, whether the obligations
of the City under the Hedge Agreement shall be secured by a Credit Support Instrument, and the rates to be
paid by the counterparty to the City
and by the City to the counterparty
under the Hedge Agreement in the
event of the exercise of the option.
The approval of each interest rate
hedge transaction by the Director of
Finance shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery of
the applicable Hedge Agreement by
the Director of Finance.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from the Net Revenues and the
Pledged Funds as permitted by the
Indenture, and may be payable also
from other funds permitted by law to
be used for the purpose, as identified
by the Director of Finance in the
Hedge Agreement. Those payments
may be secured by a pledge of the Net
Revenues and the Pledged Funds to
the extent permitted by the Indenture, all as determined by the Director
of Finance and set forth in the Hedge
Agreement. The obligation of the City
to make payments under any Hedge
Agreement does not and shall not represent or constitute a general obligation, debt, bonded indebtedness or a
pledge of the faith and credit of the
City or the State of Ohio. Nothing
gives any party to any Hedge Agreement the right to have excises, ad valorem or other taxes levied by the City
or the State of Ohio for the payment of
any amounts due under any Hedge
Agreement.
Section 5. Terms of Series 2014
Refunding Bonds. The Series 2014
Refunding Bonds shall contain the
terms provided in or determined pursuant to, the Indenture, this Series
2014 Refunding Bond Legislation, the
Series 2014 Refunding Certificate of

832

June 11, 2014
Award and the Twelfth Supplemental
Indenture. Each series of Series 2014
Refunding Bonds may be secured by a
separate Supplemental Indenture, or
a single Supplemental Indenture may
secure more than one series of Series
2014 Refunding Bonds, and the authorization in this Series 2014 Refunding
Bond Legislation for the Twelfth Supplemental Indenture shall encompass
the authorization for those one or
more
Supplemental
Indentures,
regardless of their designation.
(a) General. In the event that the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
determines that the City’s best interests will be served by causing a series
of Series 2014 Refunding Bonds to be
Variable Rate Bonds, then the Director of Finance is authorized to so
specify in the Series 2014 Refunding
Certificate of Award. If the Director
of Finance so determines, then the
method and procedure by which the
variable rate of interest to be borne
by the Series 2014 Refunding Bonds of
that series shall be determined as provided in the Twelfth Supplemental
Indenture, whether by reference to a
market index, by a remarketing
agent or otherwise, provided that no
series of variable rate Series 2014
Refunding Bonds shall bear interest
at a rate in excess of twenty-five percent (25%) per year (including any
Series 2014 Refunding Bonds held by
a provider of a Credit Support Instrument). The Director of Finance may
determine that the terms of a variable
rate series of Series 2014 Refunding
Bonds may or may not permit the
holders to tender their variable rate
Series 2014 Refunding Bonds for purchase by the City. If the Director of
Finance designates any series of
Series 2014 Refunding Bonds as Variable Rate Bonds, and if the Holders of
that series of Series 2014 Refunding
Bonds are to be entitled to tender
those Series 2014 Refunding Bonds for
purchase, then the Director of
Finance shall also designate for those
variable rate Series 2014 Refunding
Bonds (and may designate others,
from time to time, in substitution
therefor) the tender agent or agents
and the remarketing agent or agents,
which designations shall be based on
the determination of the Director of
Finance, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, that the parties so designated possess the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required of them and
that the terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide
such services are fair and commercially reasonable. The Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements in connection with the
delivery of the Series 2014 Refunding
Bonds, and from time to time thereafter so long as the Series 2014
Refunding Bonds are outstanding,
with providers of Credit Support
Instruments, tender agents (which
may be the Trustee), remarketing
agents (which may be any of the Original Purchasers) and others as may
be determined by the Director of
Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the method of determining the variable interest rates,
permitting holders the right of tender
and providing for payment of the purchase price of, or debt service on, the
variable rate Series 2014 Refunding
Bonds.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of any
series of Series 2014 Refunding

June 11, 2014
Bonds, and regardless of whether that
series of Series 2014 Refunding Bonds
bears interest at variable or fixed
rates, is authorized to contract for a
Credit Support Instrument, and to pay
the costs of it from proceeds of the
Series 2014 Refunding Bonds, if the
Director determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
that the Credit Support Instrument
will result in a savings in the cost of
the financing to the City.
In the event that the Director of
Finance, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, determines
that the City’s best interests will be
served by causing a series of Series
2014 Refunding Bonds to be Capital
Appreciation Bonds, then the Director
of Finance is authorized to so specify
in the Series 2014 Refunding Certificate of Award. If the Director of
Finance so determines, then the
authorizations and limitations in this
Section 5 and Section 6 shall be interpreted and applied in a manner that
the Director of Finance determines to
be consistent with the character of
Capital Appreciation Bonds.
(b) Form; Exchange and Transfer.
All Series 2014 Refunding Bonds shall
be issued in fully registered form.
The Series 2014 Refunding Bonds initially shall be delivered only in
book-entry form, shall be registered
in the name of the Depository or its
nominee, as registered owner, and
immobilized in the custody of the
Depository, and shall not be transferable or exchangeable (except for
transfer to another Depository or its
nominee) without further action by
the City pursuant to the provisions of
the Twelfth Supplemental Indenture.
No Series 2014 Refunding Bonds shall
be exchanged for or transferable into
a coupon Revenue Bond or Bonds
except to the extent that the Indenture permits such exchanges or transfers.
If any Depository determines not to
continue to act as a Depository for the
Series 2014 Refunding Bonds of any
series for use in a book entry system,
the Director of Finance and the
Trustee may attempt to establish a
securities depository/book entry relationship with another qualified
Depository. If the Director of Finance
and the Trustee do not or are unable
to do so, the Director of Finance and
the Trustee, after making provision
for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository and any
other arrangements deemed necessary, shall permit withdrawal of the
Series 2014 Refunding Bonds of any
series from the Depository, and
authenticate and deliver registered
Bond certificates to the assigns of the
Depository or its nominee, all at the
cost and expense (including any costs
of printing), if the event is not the
result of action or inaction of the City,
of those persons requesting such
issuance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into any agreements
determined by the Director to be necessary in connection with the book
entry system for the Series 2014
Refunding Bonds, after determining
that those agreements will not endanger the funds or securities of the City
under the Indenture (as evidenced by
the Director’s signing of those agreements).

series shall be dated as of the date or

restrict the yield on investment property, (iii) make timely and adequate
payments to the federal government,
(iv) maintain books and records and
make calculations and reports, and
(v) refrain from certain uses of those
proceeds and, as applicable, of property financed with such proceeds, all in
such manner and to the extent necessary to assure such exclusion of that
interest under the Code.
The Director of Finance, or any
other officer of the City having
responsibility for issuance of the TaxExempt Bonds, is hereby authorized
(a) to make or effect any election,
selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or waiver on behalf of
the City with respect to the TaxExempt Bonds as the City is permitted or required to make or give under
the federal income tax laws, including, without limitation thereto, any of

that purpose, reducing the burden or
expense of such compliance, reducing
the rebate amount or payments of
penalties, or making payments of special amounts in lieu of making computations to determine, or paying,

action shall be in writing and signed
by the officer, (b) to take any and all
other actions, make or obtain calculations, make payments, and make or
give reports, covenants and certifications of and on behalf of the City, as
may be appropriate to assure the
exclusion of interest from gross

June 11, 2014
income and the intended tax status of

Ord. No. 643-14.
By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency ordinance designating West 13th Street between Abbey
and University Roads with a secondary and honorary designation of
“Victoria and Michael Sokolowski
Way”.
Whereas, in 1923 Victoria and
Michael Sokolowski founded a Polish
restaurant on a bank of the Cuyahoga
in Cleveland; and,
Whereas, today, the family-owned
Sokolowski’s University Inn serves
edible homages to the city’s immigrant-driven industrial past, dishing
sturdy comfort foods like cabbage
rolls that once fueled the city’s
growth; and,
Whereas, what began as a tavern
when the Tremont neighborhood was
flush with blue-collar steelworkers,
expanded to cafeteria-style service in
the 50s, and has evolved, more recently into a touchstone restaurant for
Polish families in search of their culinary roots; and
Whereas, Sokolowski’s University
Inn was just named a 2014 winner of
the James Beard Foundation’s “American Classics” Award for its timeless
appeal and quality food that reflects
the character of the community; and
Whereas, the citizens of Cleveland
want to honor the legacy of Victoria
and Michael Sokolowski and the
Sokolowski family with a street sign
designation of “Victoria and Michael
Sokolowski Way”; and,
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure for the immediate preservation of public peace,
property, health or safety; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That West 13th Street
between Abbey and University Roads
is designated with a secondary and
honorary designation of “Victoria and
Michael Sokolowski Way”.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Passed June 2, 2014.
Effective June 4, 2014.

Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of Port

Subsidiary Additions
• Subgrade Stabilization
During the excavation for Taxiway
A, super-saturated subgrade was
encountered due to the blockage of
two (2) outfalls. Various methods
were employed to correct the soil
bearing issues associated with the
saturated subgrade. During the excavation of the east-side taxiway pavement, unsuitable subgrade in the
