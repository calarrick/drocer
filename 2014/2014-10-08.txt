FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES REFERRED
Ord. No. 1324-14.
By Council Members Keane and
Kelley (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Port Control to
employ one or more professional consultants to provide talent management support services and other related services, for a period of one year,
with three one-year options to renew,
the second of which requires additional legislative authority.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of Port
Control is authorized to employ by
contract or contracts one or more consultants or one or more firms of consultants for the purpose of supplementing the regularly employed staff
of the several departments of the City
of Cleveland in order to provide professional services necessary to provide talent management support services, including learning and development as well as performance management and enhancement services, for a
period of one year, with three oneyear options to renew, the second of
which requires additional legislative
authority. The first of the one-year
options to renew may be exercised by
the Director of Port Control, without
the necessity of obtaining additional
authority of this Council. The second
of the one-year options to renew may
not be exercised without additional
legislative authority. If such additional legislative authority is granted
and the second of the one-year options
to renew is exercised, then the third
of the one-year options to renew may
be exercisable at the option of the
Director of Port Control, without the
necessity of obtaining additional
authority of this Council.
The selection of the consultants for
the services shall be made by the
Board of Control on the nomination of
the Director of Port Control from a
list of qualified consultants available
for employment as may be determined
after a full and complete canvass by
the Director of Port Control for the
purpose of compiling a list. The compensation to be paid for the services
shall be fixed by the Board of Control.
The contract or contracts authorized
shall be prepared by the Director of
Law, approved by the Director of Port
Control, and certified by the Director
of Finance.
Section 2. That the cost of the contract or contracts authorized shall be
paid from Fund Nos. 60 SF 001, 60 SF
104, 60 SF 106, and 60 SF 141, Request
No. RQS 3001, RL 2014-113.
Section 3. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure

October 8, 2014
and, provided it receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take
effect and be in force immediately
upon its passage and approval by the
Mayor; otherwise it shall take effect
and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.

ramps, brick streets, and appurtenances and authorizing the Director
of Capital Projects to enter into one or
more public improvement requirement contracts for the making of the
improvement, for a period not to
exceed two years.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes

The City Record
curb ramps, brick streets, and appurtenances, for the Division of Engineering and Construction, Office of
Capital Projects, by one or more public improvement requirement contracts duly let to the lowest responsible bidder or bidders on a unit basis
for the improvement.
Section 2. That, provided this Council authorizes and the City sells subordinated lien income tax bonds in
2015 for the purposes that include the
improvement authorized in this ordinance, the Director of Capital Projects is authorized to make one or
more written requirement contracts
under the Charter and the Codified
Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
for the requirements for a period not
to exceed two years for the making of
the above public improvement with
the lowest responsible bidder or bidders after competitive bidding on a
unit basis for the improvement for a
period not to exceed the specified
term, purchased by the Commissioner
of Purchases and Supplies on a unit
basis for the Division of Engineering
and Construction, Office of Capital
Projects. Bids shall be taken in a manner that permits an award to be made
for all items as a single contract, or by
separate contract for each or any combination of the items as the Board of
Control determines. Alternate bids for
a period less than the specified term
may be taken if desired by the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies
until provision is made for the
requirements for the entire term.

Section 3. That the Director of Capital Projects is authorized to apply and
pay for permits, licenses, or other
authorizations required by any regulatory agency or public authority to
permit performance of the work
authorized by this ordinance.
Section 4. That the costs of the contract or contracts shall be paid from
Fund Nos. 20 SF 520, 20 SF 528, 20 SF
534, 20 SF 540, 20 SF 546, 20 SF 554, 20
SF 563, and from the fund or funds to
which are credited the proceeds of the
sale of subordinated lien income tax
bonds for 2015 if authorized by this
Council and sold by the City for a purpose which includes this improvement, and shall also be charged
against the proper appropriation
accounts and the Director of Finance
shall certify the amount of any purchase under the contract, each of
which purchases shall be made on
order of the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies by a delivery
order issued against the contract or
contracts and certified by the Director of Finance. (RQN 0103, RL 2014-48)
Section 5. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure
and, provided it receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take
effect and be in force immediately
upon its passage and approval by the
Mayor; otherwise it shall take effect
and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.
