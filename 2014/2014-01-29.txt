three separate days has been dispensed with by a two-thirds vote of
all members elected to Council. The
final reading shall be in full unless
a written or printed copy of the

reading ordinances and resolutions
to be introduced for passage and

as follows: “Shall the Charter and
statutory provisions and rule 43
requiring reading on three separate
days and rule 41 requiring reference
to committees be dispensed with and
Ordinance No. ... (Resolution No. ...)
be placed on final passage?” If twothirds of all the members elected to

of each member prior to the passage
of such ordinance under suspension
of Rule 43.
Rule 44. Appropriation Ordinances.
Ordinances making appropriations
shall be confined to the subject of
appropriation. No money shall be
appropriated except by ordinance.
All ordinances for fixing a tax rate,
the appropriation of money, the
issuance of bonds, the transfer of
money to any fund, or the payment
of claims; and all resolutions and
ordinances whereby the city shall
become liable for the payment of
any money, shall be referred without debate to the finance committee
for consideration and report; unless
this requirement shall be suspended
by two-thirds of all the members
elected. The vote of each suspension
shall be taken by yeas and nays and
entered on the record.
Rule 45. Substitute Legislation.
Legislation dealing with the same
subject matter may be substituted
for any pending ordinance or resolution by a majority vote of all the
members elected to Council, upon
the recommendation of any committee to which such legislation has
been referred. Substitute legislation
shall be subject to all the provisions
of the Charter and rules applying to
ordinances on first reading, and the
legislation for which such substitute
is offered shall be laid upon the
table as a final disposition thereof.
Before accepting for introduction
any
substitute
legislation,
the
author of the original legislation
shall be given notice thereof by the
Clerk of Council.
Rule 46. Ordinances Fixing Fines
and Penalties. All ordinances imposing fines, penalties, forfeiture or
imprisonment shall be referred to
the Committee on Legislation, and
the Director of Law shall be asked
to give an opinion thereon.
Rule 47. Amendments. It shall be
in order to amend an ordinance at
any time when not in the hands of
a committee; but if amended after
its second reading, it shall again be
read as the second reading thereof,
and laid over for further and final
action. A majority vote of all the
members elected to Council shall be
necessary for the adoption of an
amendment to any legislation pending before the Council.
Rule 48. Adoption. All ordinances
and resolutions shall require for
passage or adoption a majority vote
of all the members elected. The vote
on their adoption shall be taken by
yeas and nays and entered on the
records of the meeting except as
otherwise provided in these rules.
Rule 49. Signing Ordinances and
Resolutions. All ordinances passed
and resolutions adopted by Council
shall be signed by the President and
presented forthwith to the Mayor by
the Clerk.
Rule 50. Action on Mayor’s Veto.
When the Mayor refuses to sign an
ordinance or resolution or part
thereof and returns such ordinance
or resolution to the Council with
objections, pursuant to Section 37 of

106

January 29, 2014
the Charter, the Council shall after
the expiration of not less than one
week following the meeting at
which such vetoed ordinance or resolution is returned, proceed to reconsider the same. After the adoption
of the motion so to reconsider, the
question shall be stated as follows:
“Shall Ordinance No. (Resolution
No.) be passed (or adopted) notwithstanding the veto of the Mayor?
Those voting aye vote to override
the Mayor’s veto. Those voting nay
vote to sustain the Mayor’s veto.” If
two-thirds of all the members elected to Council vote aye, such ordinance or resolution vetoed by the
Mayor shall take effect without the
Mayor’s signature.
