Mathew Coolidge, owner, proposes
to erect a 24' x 20' 1 story frame

The

1. Section 337.23(a) which states
that an accessory garage shall be a
minimum of 18" from all property

main building on an adjoining lot in
a Residence District. 4 and 12 inches from the property lines are proposed.
2. Section 357.13(B)(c)(5) which

which
states that when a change of use is
proposed to a property that is nonconforming in required landscaping,
a Board of Zoning Appeals determination is required as to whether the

The City Record
non-conformity can continue. The
property is non-conforming in the
failure to provide an 8-foot wide
landscaped transition strip providing 75% year round opacity in the
rear where abutting a residential
district, and failure to provide a 6
foot wide landscaped frontage strip
providing 50% year round opacity
where the parking lot abuts the
street.
2. Section 343.18(d) which states
that the maximum permitted width
of a driveway is 30 feet and the
entire frontage on Rocky River
Drive is without landscaping, curb,
or other barrier and is used as a driveway.
3. Note: the proposed “playground
area” is on a separate parcel and
requires a separate permit application and is not part of this application. (Filed December 19, 2014)
