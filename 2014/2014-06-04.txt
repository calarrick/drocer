An emergency resolution declaring
June,
2014
Immigrant
Heritage
Month.
Whereas, generations of immigrants from every corner of the globe
have helped to build our country’s
economy and create the unique character of our nation; and
Whereas, immigrants continue to
grow businesses, innovate, strengthen our economy and create jobs for
Americans in the United States and
here in Cleveland; and
Whereas, immigrants have provided the United States with unique
social and cultural influences, fundamentally enriching the extraordinary
character of our nation; and
Whereas, immigrants have been
tireless leaders, not only in securing
their own rights and access to equal
opportunity, but also in campaigning
to create a more just society for all
Americans; and
Whereas, despite these and many
other contributions, the role of immigrants in building and enriching our
nation has been overlooked and
undervalued throughout history, continuing to this day; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
declares June, 2014 Immigrant Heritage Month.
