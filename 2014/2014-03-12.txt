FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS REFERRED
Res. No. 344-14.
By Council Members Cimperman
and Zone.
An emergency resolution urging
the United States Congress to pass the
Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act (PAMTA), H.R.

289

5
965, and the Preventing of Antibiotic
Resistance Act (PARA), S. 1256; and
supporting a statewide and national
ban on nontherapeutic uses of antibiotics in livestock production.
Whereas, eighty percent of the
antibiotics sold in the United States
are used in livestock production, and
the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention has reported that most of
those antibiotics are used irresponsibly; and
Whereas, low doses of antibiotics
are routinely fed to livestock for
growth promotion and disease prevention to compensate for crowded,
unsanitary conditions, in a practice
known as “nontherapeutic use”; and
Whereas, “nontherapeutic use” creates ideal conditions for the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria;
and
Whereas, antibiotic resistant bacteria on livestock operations are known
to spread to retail meat, farmers and
farmworkers, and rural environments; and
Whereas, antibiotic resistance in
pathogens due to nontherapeutic use
of antibiotics in livestock production
has been a public health concern
since the 1960s; and
Whereas, antibiotic resistant bacteria have been the cause of several
foodborne illness outbreaks, including a 2011 outbreak of antibiotic resistant Salmonella in ground turkey that
sickened 136 people, hospitalized 37,
and killed one and lead to the third
largest meat recall in the USDA’s
records and a 2013 outbreak of antibiotic resistant Salmonella in chicken
that sickened 416 people and hospitalized 162;
Whereas, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention reported that
at least two million Americans suffer
from antibiotic resistant bacterial
infections each year and twenty-three
thousand Americans die from those
infections; and
Whereas, the medical and social
costs of antibiotic-resistance infections in just one hospital for one year
have been estimated to be between
$13 million and $18 million; and
Whereas, the federal government
has limited nontherapeutic uses of
two classes of antibiotics, but otherwise largely relied on voluntary guidance to attempt to reduce overuse of
antibiotics in livestock production,
despite regular acknowledgements
that nontherapeutic use and the
development of antibiotic resistant
bacteria poses a significant public
health threat; and
Whereas, PAMTA and PARA preserve the effectiveness of medically
important antimicrobials used in the
treatment of human and animal diseases by limiting nontherapeutic uses
of antibiotics in livestock production;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the United States Congress to pass the
Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act (PAMTA), H.R.
965 and the Preventing of Antibiotic
Resistance Act (PARA), S. 1256; and
supports a statewide and national
ban on nontherapeutic uses of antibiotics in livestock production.

Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
resolution to the Ohio House of Representatives, Ohio Congressional Representatives Marcia Fudge and Marcy
Kaptur, and U.S. Senators Sherrod
Brown and Robert Portman.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed

An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Environmental Protection
Agency to deny the United States
Army Corps of Engineers’ (Corps)
application to dispose of contaminated dredge from the Cuyahoga River
federal shipping canal in Lake Erie;
and urging the Corps to continue the
current practice of using confined disposal facilities —or working with the
Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port
Authority on an environmentally
sound alternative.
Whereas, in a public notice last

and tow it out to dump sites in Lake

Whereas, the Corps applied to the
Protection
Ohio
Environmental
Agency for approval to dispose of contaminated dredge from the Cuyahoga
River federal shipping canal in Lake
Erie for the first time in forty years;
and
Whereas, this open-lake dumping
would discharge muck soiled with
contaminants, such as PCBs, just
west of the intakes for the municipal
drinking water treatment plants that
serve Greater Cleveland; and
Whereas, high levels of PCBs, plus
residual amounts of the pesticide
DDT, pose an unacceptable risk to
humans, wildlife, and birds that eat
fish from the lake, such as walleye
and perch; and
Whereas, the Ohio Environmental
Council and the Dike 14 Nature Preserve Committee oppose the openlake dumping plan; and
Whereas, the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency will host a public
meeting to solicit comments on this
application on Thursday, March 6,
2014 at 4:30 p.m. in the Martin Luther
King Jr. branch of the Cleveland Public Library, located at 1962 Stokes
Blvd. on the western edge of University Circle; and
Whereas, this Council encourages
Cleveland citizens to attend this public meeting and speak out against
open-lake dumping; and
Whereas, this Council urges the
Ohio
Environmental
Protection
Agency to deny the Corps’ application, and force the Corps to continue
the current practice of using confined
disposal facilities – or work with the
Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port
Authority on a workable and environmentally sound alternative to dumping; and

immediate preservation of public

An emergency resolution supporting Federal Senate Bill 394, the Metal
Theft Prevention Act of 2013.
Whereas, with the price of metal
increasing, metal theft in the United
States has jumped by 80%, costing
U.S. businesses $1 billion dollars a
year; and
Whereas, the state of Ohio is number one in the nation in metal theft,
with 3,200 reported claims between
2010 and 2012; and
Whereas, in Cleveland, between
2000 and 2008, 80,000 homes have been
foreclosed upon, causing property
values to plummet and leading to
entire blocks of vacant and abandoned houses that are quickly
stripped of all aluminum siding,
metal appliances, copper wire and
plumbing; and

307

23
Whereas, S. 394, the Metal Theft
Prevention Act of 2013, is bipartisan
federal legislation that would make
metal theft a federal crime, give state
attorneys general the power to bring
civil actions to enforce the bill’s provisions, open metal theft to potentially tougher sentences and make it significantly more difficult for criminals
to sell stolen metal to scrap metal
dealers; and
Whereas, the Metal Theft Prevention Act of 2013 will significantly
assist in improving prevention of
metal theft from critical infrastructure as well as crack down on criminals who commit this crime; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of

Whereas, in November 2013, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych
suspended preparations for signing
the Association Agreement and a
Free Trade Agreement with the European Union following several months

triggered peaceful demonstrations by
millions of Ukrainians in Kyiv and

Cleveland,
to
demand closer European integration;
and
Whereas, in response to these
peaceful protests, Ukrainian authorities have resorted to cruel brutality,
repression, censorship and violence;

of confirmed deaths and thousands of

on members of the media and medical
personnel; and

President Yanukovych fled the country and a warrant is out for his arrest
for “mass killings of civilians”; and

the crisis; and
Whereas, this Council supports
Ukrainians' aspirations for democracy, national sovereignty and association with Europe, in accordance with
their universal right to choose their
own future, free of fear, intimidation
and outside interference; and
Whereas, the United States government must continue to support the
desire of millions of Ukrainian citizens for democracy and human rights
with any all appropriate measures,
including targeted sanctions against
those who authorize or engage in the
use of force against protesters, targeted financial assistance for peopleto-people
cooperation
between
Ukraine and the United States, including Cleveland-based institutions, and
to use every appropriate international organization and agreement--e.g.
International Monetary Fund, the
United Nations, World Trade Organization, Organization for Security and
