Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the immediate preservation of the
public peace, property, health, and
safety in that it must be certified to
the election authorities immediately
in order for the question to appear at
a special election to be held on November 4, 2014, and providing for the
usual daily operation of a municipal

Be it ordained by the Council of

Charter to read as follows:

4
§203 Traffic Law Photo-Monitoring
Devices
(a) The City, including its various
Boards, agencies and departments,
shall not use any traffic law photomonitoring device for the enforcement of a qualified traffic law violation, unless a law enforcement officer
is present at the location of the device
and personally issues the ticket to the
alleged violator at the time and location of the violation.
(b) Definitions. As used in this Section 203:
(1) “Law enforcement officer”
means any law enforcement officer
employed by the City or any other
political jurisdiction in Ohio, including the State. The City may from time
to time and in its discretion, by ordinance or resolution, designate which
City employees are, “law enforcement
officers” for purposes of this Section
203.
(2) “Qualified law traffic violation”
means a violation of any of the following: (1) any state or local law
relating to complying with a traffic
control signal or a railroad crossing
sign or signal; or (2) any state or local
law limiting the speed of a motor
vehicle.
(3) “Ticket” means any traffic ticket, citation, summons, or other notice
of liability (whether civil or criminal) issued in response to an alleged
qualified traffic law violation detected by a traffic law photo-monitoring

device” means an electronic system
consisting of a photographic, video,
or electronic camera and a means of
sensing the presence of a motor vehicle that automatically produces photographs, videotape, or digital images
of the vehicle, its license plate or its
operator.
(c) Any ordinance enacted prior to
the passage of this Amendment that
contravenes any of the foregoing is
void. After the enactment of this
Amendment, the City shall not enact
or enforce any ordinance that contravenes any of the foregoing. In the
event that any provision of this Section 203 is found to be unconstitutional or impermissibly in conflict with
state or federal law, only such provision found to be unconstitutional or
impermissible will be stricken, and
the remainder of Section 203 will
remain in full force and effect.
Section 2. That the forgoing proposed amendment to the Charter, on
receiving at least a majority of the
votes cast at the November 4, 2014,

practice of bringing people together
to think together about how we can
improve our community, how we can
make government work better, how
we can strengthen our neighborhoods, and how we can respond to the
crises that emerge; and

so that voters can make informed
decisions; it is also the place where
constituents ask vital questions of
their elected leaders; and
Whereas, the citizens of Cleveland

An emergency ordinance authorizing the submission to the electors of
the City of Cleveland of an initiative
petition proposing to amend the Charter of the City of Cleveland by enacting new Section 203 in Chapter 40 of
the Charter, relating to traffic law
photo-monitoring devices.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the immediate preservation of the
public peace, property, health, and
safety in that it must be certified to
the election authorities immediately
in order for the question to appear at
a special election to be held on November 4, 2014, and providing for the
usual daily operation of a municipal
department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council authorizes the submission to the electors of
the City of Cleveland at a special election to be held at the usual places of
voting in the City of Cleveland on

of the City of Cleveland by enacting
new Section 203 in Chapter 40 of the
Charter to read as follows:
§203 Traffic Law Photo-Monitoring
Devices
(a) The City, including its various
Boards, agencies and departments,
shall not use any traffic law photomonitoring device for the enforcement of a qualified traffic law violation, unless a law enforcement officer
is present at the location of the device
and personally issues the ticket to the
alleged violator at the time and location of the violation.
(b) Definitions. As used in this Section 203:
(1) “Law enforcement officer”
means any law enforcement officer
employed by the City or any other
political jurisdiction in Ohio, including the State. The City may from time
to time and in its discretion, by ordinance or resolution, designate which
City employees are, “law enforcement
officers” for purposes of this Section
203.

The City Record
(2) “Qualified law traffic violation”
means a violation of any of the following: (1) any state or local law
relating to complying with a traffic
control signal or a railroad crossing
sign or signal; or (2) any state or local
law limiting the speed of a motor

consisting of a photographic, video,

(c) Any ordinance enacted prior to
the passage of this Amendment that
contravenes any of the foregoing is
void. After the enactment of this
Amendment, the City shall not enact
or enforce any ordinance that contravenes any of the foregoing. In the
event that any provision of this Section 203 is found to be unconstitutional or impermissibly in conflict with
state or federal law, only such provision found to be unconstitutional or
impermissible will be stricken, and
the remainder of Section 203 will
remain in full force and effect.
Section 2. That the forgoing proposed amendment to the Charter, on
receiving at least a majority of the
votes cast at the November 4, 2014,
