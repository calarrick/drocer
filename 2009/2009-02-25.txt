RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL

Res. No. 197-09.
By Council Member Sweeney (by
departmental request).
An emergency resolution declaring the intent of the City to reimburse certain costs in connection
with the improvement, acquisition,
construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, renovation, furnishing, and
equipping of the Cleveland Convention Center from the proceeds of a
future issue of notes of bonds.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
(the “City”) proposes to improve, acquire, construct, reconstruct, rehabilitate, renovate, equip and furnish the
Cleveland Convention Center (the
“Project”); and
Whereas, the City currently expects that it will reimburse certain
of the costs of such Project from the
proceeds of notes or bonds (“Bonds”),
in a principal amount not expected
to exceed $2,000,000, the terms of
which will be set forth in a future
Ordinance of this Council and a Certificate of Award provided for in
such Ordinance after certain legal
conditions are satisfied; and
Whereas, pending the authorization and issuance of the Bonds, the
City intends to incur and to pay certain of the costs of the Project in
expectation of the future reimbursement of such costs with proceeds of
the Bonds; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Declaration of Official
Intent. This resolution is a Declaration of Official Intent under U.S.
Treasury Regulations for purposes
of Sections 103 and 141 to 150 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. The City reasonably expects that certain of the costs of the
Project will be reimbursed with the

is expected not to exceed $2,000,000,
to be issued on terms set forth in a
future Ordinance of this Council.
Section 2. Compliance with Open

and determined that all formal

An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Senate and House of Representatives to support Representative Foley’s initiative for an emergency six month moratorium on all
foreclosures in Ohio to allow for
new foreclosure rules to be sought
by lawmakers and put into effect.
Whereas, a significant number of
Ohioans have received invaluable
help because of the Compact to Help
Ohioans Preserve Homeownership,
yet the servicing industry still needs
to do more to turn around Ohio’s
housing crisis; and
Whereas, statistics prove that servicers “good faith” efforts are not
working in Ohio making legislation
necessary; and
Whereas, the legislation coincides
with numerous themes of the Governor’s Foreclosure Prevention Task
Force report and recommendations;
and
Whereas, the Mortgage Bankers
Association reports that approximately one of every eight homeowners in Ohio were behind on their
mortgage payments (at least 30
days due) or in foreclosure at the
end of September 2008; and
Whereas, recent information indicates that in Ohio, 3.93 percent of
the 1.5 million mortgage holders
were in foreclosure, while 8.31 percent were behind on their payments
and Ohio is one of nine states that
had rates of foreclosure starts above
the national average by the end of
the third quarter 2008; and
Whereas, RealtyTrac recently reported that Ohio’s foreclosure rate
during 2008 was ranked 7th highest
among the states; and
Whereas, Governor Strickland, President Obama, and municipal leaders
have called for comprehensive policy initiatives to address the persistent crisis in mortgage foreclosures;
and
Whereas, the proposed legislation
by Representative Foley will address the foreclosure issues by providing for an emergency 6 month
moratorium on all home foreclosures
to allow the defense bar/courts/ser-

18
vicers to prepare for the new rules;
and
Whereas, the proposed legislation
will
clarify
the
Common
Pleas
Court’s right to modify mortgages
as an equitable remedy; and
Whereas, the legislation will provide for a $1,500 foreclosure filing
fee with no sunset on this provision;
and
Whereas, as foreclosures decline
in the state the amount of the fees
collected would decline allowing this
program to automatically adjust to
the need at any given time; and
Whereas, all lenders would be
required to provide a notice including specified information to the
homeowner 60 days prior to their
initial foreclosure filing on any residential foreclosure; and
Whereas, all servicers/lenders must
provide foreclosure information to a
statewide database prior to filing
any residential foreclosure; and
Whereas, the foreclosing lender/servicer must provide evidence to
the court at the time of initial foreclosure filing that this database submission has been completed; and
Whereas, the legislation will require that ownership of the note and
mortgage must be clear and unambiguous before action is filed, and
further, if the loan has been securitized, the specific mortgage backed
security that holds the loan must be
identified in addition to the MBS
trustee; and
Whereas, the legislation requires
the current appraisal of the home’s
value be filed with the complaint;
and
Whereas, the legislation will require an affidavit of plaintiff’s counsel that they directly represent and
are
authorized
to
negotiate
on
behalf of the responsible investor
representative, and no intermediary
representation is permitted; and
Whereas, this provision would not
postpone a foreclosure but would
postpone the post-foreclosure eviction, so a homeowner would have a
right to continue to occupy the home
at a court-determined market rent
until such time as the lender finds
a buyer for the home; and
Whereas, the legislation will limit
additional fees charged by servicers,
specifically targeting “junk fees”
such as fax fees, payoff demand
fees, and excessive property inspection fees; and
Whereas, all mortgage servicers
not otherwise pre-empted by federal
law must be licensed by the state,
and DFI-CF will have joint enforcement authority with the Attorney
General’s office; and
Whereas, this portion of the legislation will established minimum
eligibility
criteria
for
licensure
along with duties and prohibitions
similar to what was established
with S.B. 185; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Urging the Ohio Senate
and House of Representatives to

An emergency resolution urging
United States Attorney General Eric
Holder to repeal the Tiahrt Amendment restrictions on gun data from
the FY 2010 Department of Justice
Budget.
Whereas, President Obama promised
to repeal the Tiahrt Amendment
restrictions on gun data by removing these dangerous provisions from
the FY 2010 Department of Justice
budget; and
Whereas, for several years, Congress has been undermining police
work by passing the Tiahrt Amendments, which are annual appropriations riders that restrict the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and
Explosives (ATF) from releasing
crucial crime-fighting information to
cities and states; and
Whereas, when police recover a
gun used in crime, ATF uses the
gun’s serial number to trace it back
to its original point of sale and
keeps track of crime gun trace
requests from police departments
throughout the country; and
Whereas, the Tiahrt restrictions
prevent state and local police from
accessing and using gun trace data
in various ways, which would help
them to identify gun dealers and
individuals who may be involved in
illegal gun trafficking operations in
communities; and
Whereas, this Council also urges
support for a solution to this problem by replacing the Tiahrt Amendments with the language in S.2769,
the Firearms Information Use Act of
2008, introduced by Senator Robert
Menendez, co-sponsored by President
Obama when he was a Senator; and
Whereas, this Council also urges
support for the removal of other
damaging restrictions within the
Tiahrt Amendments, such as the

216

February 25, 2009
requirement that the FBI destroy
certain
NICS
background
check
records after just 24 hours, which
can hamper critical investigations;
and
Whereas, another restriction that
must be removed is that ATF remains blocked from requiring gun
dealers to check their inventories to
detect lost and stolen guns, which
only serves to create a law enforcement blind spot that helps criminals
get guns; and
Whereas, the Tiahrt Amendments
restrict police ability to access and
use ATF’s crime gun trace data to
analyze trafficking patterns and
solve gun crimes, prevent the use of
trace data in civil proceedings, restrict the ATF from publishing information about federally licensed
gun dealers who traffic guns to
criminals, limit state and local law
enforcement to data pertaining to a
specific crime gun or criminal investigation, prevent law enforcement
from using trace data in gun dealer license reviews, require FBI to
destroy criminal background check
records of gun buyers within 24
hours, prevent ATF from requiring
dealers to conduct inventory checks
to detect lost and stolen guns, and
prevent the ATF from updating and
modernizing files on gun dealers;
and
Whereas, this Council joins Mayors Against Illegal Guns, Citizens
for Safety, law enforcement associations, and community groups around
the country to urge repealing Tiahrt
Amendment restrictions from the FY
2010 Department of Justice budget;
and
Whereas, with gun crime on the
rise, Cleveland Police and the local,
state and federal law enforcement
agencies with whom they work need
access to all the data available to
trace crime guns back to those who
make firearms available to criminals and juveniles illegally; and
Whereas, it is critical that law
enforcement once again gain access
to this information, which can serve
as a key tool in their efforts to protect the public safety; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
