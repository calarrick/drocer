Section 341.06
Local Design Review Advisory Committees
The City Planning Commission
shall establish Local Design Review
Advisory Committees to advise the
Commission on applications received
pursuant to the regulations of this
Chapter. The following provisions
shall govern the establishment and
operation of each such committee:
(a) Appointment of Members. The
City Planning Commission shall
appoint the members of each Local
Design Review Advisory Committee.
In making these appointments, the
City Planning Commission shall
solicit nominations from Community
Development Corporations operating
within each committee’s geographic
area of jurisdiction and the Council
members representing each such
area.
Each
Advisory
Committee
shall be composed of not less than
five (5) and not more than eleven
(11) members, except that the City
Planning Commission may increase
membership on a particular committee if necessary to incorporate relevant perspectives and areas of
expertise. A maximum of three (3)
alternate members may be appointed to each committee. The alternate
members may vote in place of members not in attendance at a particular meeting, as determined by the
Committee’s chairperson.
(b) Committee Composition. A
majority of the members appointed
to each Advisory Committee shall be
architects
or
other
recognized
design professionals, with the remaining members representing businesses or other organizations with
operations in the local area or being
residents of the local area. The term
“recognized
design
professionals”
shall refer to individuals with documented expertise in such fields as
architecture, landscape architecture,
urban design, graphic design, or historic preservation.
(c) Committee Jurisdiction and
Name. Each Local Design Review
Advisory Committee shall review
applications received pursuant to
this Chapter for properties located
within the boundaries of its area of
jurisdiction, as established by the
City Planning Commission. All areas
of the City shall be included in the
jurisdiction of an Advisory Committee. The City Planning Director
shall assign each Local Design
Review Advisory Committee a name
identified with the area of the City
served by the Committee.
(d) Term of Appointment. Each
Advisory Committee member shall
be appointed for an initial term of
one (1) year and thereafter for a
term of two (2) years. After expiration of the initial one-year term,
an individual’s membership shall
continue until the City Planning
Commission takes action to replace

185

13
the member with a new appointment
or until the member resigns. The
City Planning Commission shall
replace members whose attendance
is poor or who fail to act in accordance with the regulations of this
Chapter.
(e) Quorum and Voting. A majority of the Advisory Committee’s
membership shall constitute a quorum, without which no votes may be
taken. Approval of an application
shall require the affirmative vote of
a majority of the members present
at a meeting.
(f) Meetings and Records. The
Advisory Committee shall meet at

no business to conduct. The staff
representative of the City Planning
Commission shall be designated as
the Advisory Committee’s Secretary

Commission.
Section 341.07 Design Guidelines
In reviewing applications subject
to provisions of this Chapter, the
Local
Design
Review
Advisory
Committee and the City Planning
Commission shall follow the design
guidelines set forth in the succeeding sections as well as any
supplemental
design
guidelines
adopted by Commission for a particular district.
(a) Design Compatibility. Alterations, additions and new development shall be compatible in scale,
material, color, placement and character with the design of the subject
property as well as the design of
properties that are representative of
the area’s most valued architectural
and environmental qualities. In evaluating compatibility, consideration
shall also be given to the value of
diversity
and
individuality
in
design.
(b) Contemporary Design. All buildings are recognized as products of
their own time. Alterations, additions and new developments which
have no historical basis and which
seek to create an appearance characteristic of an earlier time are not
required. Conversely, compatible contemporary design is encouraged except where such design would clearly detract from the architectural
unity of a grouping of architecturally significant structures.
(c) Preservation of Features. The
distinguishing original qualities of
a property should not be diminished
through alteration or removal of distinctive architectural features.
(d) Replacement of Features. In
the event that replacement of significant architectural features is
necessary, the new material should
closely match the original material
in composition, design, color, texture
and all other visual qualities.
(e) Cleaning. The cleaning of
exterior wall surfaces should be
undertaken by the gentlest means
possible. Sandblasting and other
cleaning methods that will damage
facing materials and architectural
features shall not be undertaken.
(f) Fences and Other Accessory
Structures. Fences, walkways, lighting, benches, landscaping and other

14
accessory structures should be compatible in design with adjoining
buildings and with the most valued
aspects of an area’s character. Use
of chain-link fences along street
frontages is discouraged unless otherwise specified in guidelines for a
district.
(g) Parking Lots. Use of evergreen shrubbery and trees in combination with low ornamental fences
is encouraged in screening parking
lots from streets. Use of curbed,
planted islands is encouraged to provide visual relief in large parking
areas and to control traffic circulation. For districts characterized by
buildings set along the street line,
parking lots shall be located behind
buildings whenever possible, with
entrances located off of adjoining
side streets.
(h) Sustainability. Buildings and
properties should be designed and
constructed to minimize energy consumption and to promote conservation
of
materials
and
natural
resources.
(i) Signs. In addition to meeting
Zoning Code and Building Code
requirements for signs in applicable
zoning districts, signs subject to
approval under the provisions of
this Chapter shall also meet the following design guidelines. In the
case of a conflict between these regulations and the Zoning Code regulations, these regulations prevail.
(1) Placement. Wall signs should
be designed to fit within the architectural space intended for signage
and should not cover distinctive
architectural features.
(2) Compatibility. Signs to be seen
as a series should be designed with
compatibility in terms of location,
size, shape, style, material, illumination and color. As a general rule,
uniformity should be maintained in
certain characteristics while other
characteristics are varied to permit
individual expression and identification.
(3) Color. The colors of a sign
should complement the color of the
building facade to which the sign
relates. If a raceway or similar
device is used for attachment of a
sign’s letters or characters, the color
of the raceway should match the
color of the wall surface.
(4) Lettering and Symbols. The
lettering and symbols on a sign
should be large enough to be easily
read but not overly large or out of
scale with the building on which the
sign is displayed. An excessive
amount of information on signs, creating an image of visual clutter,
should be avoided. Use of distinctive
symbols or logos on signs is encouraged.
(5) Projecting Signs. Where permitted, projecting signs should be
no larger than necessary for readability by nearby pedestrians and
should contain no internal illumination unless other than in use of
exposed neon and similar treatments. Spacing between projecting
signs should be sufficient to prevent
an image of clutter.
(6) Wall Signs. For signs mounted flat against the wall of a building, use of individual letters or characters is preferable to use of panel

The City Record
or cabinet signs in instances where
individual letters or characters are
less likely to detract from a building’s architectural character. Such
letters
or
characters
should
be
attached in a manner that will minimize damage to the wall surface
after removal. For buildings lacking
appropriately designed wall space
for placement of a sign, consideration should be given to use of a projecting sign, window sign or canopy
sign as an alternative to a wall
sign.
(7) Billboards. Billboards or “advertising signs”, as defined in Section 325.64(b) of the Zoning Code,
shall not be permitted in any Design
Review District.
(8) Design Exceptions. In accordance with standards of Section
350.16 of the Zoning Code, the City
Planning Commission, may vary the
sign regulations of Chapter 350 as
necessary to permit signs that are
better suited to the design of the
subject property or nearby properties of architectural or historic significance.
Section 341.08
Demolition and
Moving
For applications proposing the
demolition or moving of a building
in a Design Review District, other
than
for
emergency
demolition
activities ordered by the Director of
the Building and Housing to remedy conditions that pose immediate
danger to human life or health, the
following provisions shall apply:
(a) Criteria for Action. In considering a request to demolish or move
a building or other structure located within a Design Review District,
the City Planning Commission and
its Local Design Review Advisory
Committee shall consider the following factors in making its decision to approve or disapprove the
request:
(1) the architectural and historic
significance of the subject building
or structure;
(2) the significance of the building or structure in contributing to
the architectural or historic character of its environs;
(3) in the case of a request to
move a building or other structure,
the relationship between the location of the subject building or structure and its overall significance;
(4) the present and potential economic viability of the subject building or structure, given its physical
condition and marketability;
(5) the presence of conditions on
the subject property that are dangerous or are detrimental to the
immediate area and cannot be reasonably remedied other than by the
proposed demolition;
(6) the degree to which the applicant proposes to salvage and facilitate re-use of structures proposed
for demolition; and
(7) the design quality and significance and the appropriateness of
the proposed re-use of the property.
(b) Nature of Action. The City
Planning Commission may delay
action, for a period of not more
than six (6) months, on the demolition or moving of a building in
order to allow economic viability

186

February 18, 2009
studies to be conducted, as well as
to allow interested parties the
opportunity to explore alternatives
to the proposed action. At the end
of such period, the Commission
shall either approve or disapprove
the request to demolish or move, or
may choose to delay action for a
second and final period of not
more than six (6) months if the
Commission determines that this
additional time period may be useful in securing an alternative to
the proposed demolition or moving.
At the end of such second and
final period, the Commission shall
either approve or disapprove the
request.
Section 3. That this Council shall
review this legislation one year
after its passage to evaluate its
effectiveness and determine whether
any changes are warranted.
Section 4. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
