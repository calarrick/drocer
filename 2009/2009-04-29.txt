Westbrook, Conwell, Coats, Kelley,
Cleveland, Keane, Brady, Sweeney,
Brancatelli, Dow, Johnson, Mitchell,
Pierce Scott, Polensek, Pruitt, Reed,
Santiago and Wilkes.
An emergency resolution supporting “The RESCUE”, a rally to be
held on April 25, 2009 at Willard
Park and in cities across the country to bring attention to the plight
of the children abducted and forced
to fight as soldiers in Central East
Africa.
Whereas, for the past 23 years, the
Lord’s Resistance Army (“LRA”) and
the government of Uganda have
been waging war that has left nearly two million innocent civilians
caught in the middle; and
Whereas, during these past 23
years, the Lord’s Resistance Army
has abducted children and forced
them to be soldiers in the LRA and
fight with them in Central East
Africa; and
Whereas, governments and international bodies must develop a
strategy and support existing efforts to rescue child soldiers from
the LRA; and
Whereas, the activist group Invisible Children is hosting “The RESCUE” on April 25, 2009 in Cleveland
and in 100 other cities across the
country in order to bring attention
to the plight of children abducted
and forced to fight in Central East
Africa; and
Whereas, during “The RESCUE”,
supporters will draw attention to
the plight of the abducted by
“abducting” themselves and remaining “abducted” until persons of influence or cultural significance arrive and rescue them by making a
public statement on behalf of the
child soldiers; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports “The RESCUE”, a rally to be
held on April 25, 2009 at Willard
Park and in cities across the country to bring attention to the plight
of the children abducted and forced
to fight as soldiers in Central East
Africa
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Joshua

Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency

By Council Members Santiago and
Conwell.
An emergency resolution urging a
moratorium on home foreclosures
and calling upon the United States
Congress to enact a homeowners
and bank protection plan.
Whereas, a financial crisis involving home mortgages, debt instruments and the United States banking system threatens economic stability; and
Whereas,
the
financial
crisis
threatens the integrity of Federal
and State chartered banks such that
consumer deposits and life savings
are jeopardized; and
Whereas, financial investments and
home ownership are the fabric of
economic stability and the stability
of financial institutions; and
Whereas, millions of Americans,
and thousands of Cleveland residents have lost their homes to foreclosure in the past year; and
Whereas, historically the federal
government has intervened to protect financial institutions and home
ownership to provide guarantees of
social and economic stability; and
Whereas, the quality of life in any
community can be directly related to
the responsiveness of government
and its ability to meet the needs and
expectations of its citizens; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges a moratorium on home
foreclosures and calls upon the United States Congress to enact a homeowners and bank protection plan
specifically to:
(A) Create a federal agency to
place Federal and State chartered
banks under protection, freezing all
existing home mortgages for a
period of however many months or
years are required, thereby allowing
mortgages values to adjust to fair
prices, and restructuring existing
mortgages at appropriate interest
rates and writing off speculative
debt obligations of mortgage-backed
securities, financial derivatives and
other forms of financial schemes
that have brought the banking system to the point of bankruptcy;
(B) Declare a moratorium on all
home foreclosures for the duration
of the transitional period, allowing
families to retain their homes;
(C) Require affordable monthly
home
mortgages
payments,
the
equivalent of “rental payments,” to
be made to designated banks for use
as collateral in normal lending practices for recapitalization of the
banking industry and to factor such
affordable payments into new mortgages thereby deflating the housing
bubble,
establishing
appropriate
property valuation and reducing
fixed mortgage interest rates. In the
interim period, no homeowner shall
be evicted be evicted from their
property and the Federal and State
chartered banks shall be protected,
so they can resume their traditional
banking functions, including serving local communities and facilitating credit for investment in produc-

755

25
tive industries, agriculture, infrastructure etc.;
(D) Authorize state governors to
assume the administrative responsibilities for implementing the programs,
including
provisions
for
“rental” assessments payable to specific banks, and with provisions for
necessary federal guarantees and
credits to assure successful transition.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby directed to transmit a copy of
this
resolution
to
Ohio
Senator
George
Voinovich,
Ohio
Senator
Sherrod Brown and U.S. House Representative Marcia Fudge, and also
be delivered to President Barack
Obama and Ohio Governor Ted
Strickland.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Jackson and Council Members Brady,
Brancatelli, Cimperman, Cleveland,
Coats, Conwell, Dow, Johnson, Kelley, Mitchell, Pierce Scott, Polensek,
Pruitt, Reed, Santiago, Westbrook
and Wilkes.
An emergency resolution expressing Council’s belief that the will of
the City’s voters should be respected when the voters overwhelmingly
approved amending the Charter to
expand the testing period from 90
days to one year and “grandfathering in” temporarily appointed employees who met certain requirements, that the voter-approved Charter amendments should be implemented, and that the City should
suffer no penalty for not complying
with Charter provisions that the voters repealed.
Whereas, for fifteen years the
City has been involved in a lawsuit
brought by the Civil Service Employees Association (CSEA) concerning several City Civil Service Charter provisions; and
Whereas, included with other civil
service requirements, the Charter
requires that employees who were
temporarily appointed to their positions must be tested within 90 days
of hire or promotion; and

28
Whereas, historically this City has
been unable to comply with this
requirement causing the number of
temporary appointments to sometimes be in the thousands; and
Whereas, in recent years, the
Jackson administration has worked
to comply with the Charter by testing the temporary appointments to
bring the number down from 2400 to
about 700;
Whereas, many of the temporary
appointments are competent and
highly skilled employees who have
worked for the City of Cleveland for
many years;
Whereas, they are temporary appointments through no fault of their
own and as temporary appointments
they risk losing their jobs;
Whereas,
the
Charter
Review
Commission appointed by this Council recommended changing the requirement that temporary appointments be tested in 90 days to one
year;
Whereas, to address the remaining temporary appointments, the
Charter Review Commission recommended granting regular status to
temporary appointments who met
certain conditions; and
Whereas, recognizing that the 90
day requirement was onerous, this
Council agreed with the Charter
Review Commission’s recommendation that the Charter’s civil service
provisions be changed and approved
placing amendments to the Charter
on the ballot for the election in
November of 2008; and
Whereas, at that election, the
City’s voters overwhelmingly approved amending the Charter to
expand the testing period from 90
days to one year and “grandfathering in” temporarily appointed employees who have satisfactorily performed in their positions and met
certain other requirements; and
Whereas, in spite of the City’s voters
expressing
their
desire
to
expand the testing period and grandfather temporary appointments, the
Court in the 15-year-old lawsuit
recently ruled against the City levying a substantial fine, imposing a
hiring freeze, and appointing a
“special master” to control the Civil
Service Commission in pursuit of
having the City test temporary
appointments
within
a
90
day
period; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health,
or safety in that the Court’s ruling
threatens to undermine the City’s
operations and ignores the will of
the voters; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council believes that the will of the City’s voters should be respected, that the
voter-approved Charter amendments
should be implemented, and that the
City should suffer no penalty for not
complying with Charter provisions
that the voters repealed.
Section 2. That this resolution is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

shall take effect and be in force

Ord. No. 463-09.
By Mayor Jackson and Council
Members Cimperman and Sweeney.
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Finance to apply
for and accept American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act funds from
Federal, State, or other public entities for various City improvements,
projects, and programs eligible for
this funding; and authorizing the
Director to apply for and accept
other grants, loans, and gifts from
Federal, State, or other public and
private entities to implement ARRAfunded projects.
Whereas, The American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act (“ARRA”) is
the first spending bill (H.R. 1)
signed by President Obama on February 17th, 2009. The ARRA is an
extraordinary effort to jumpstart
our economy, create or save millions
of jobs, and put a down payment on
addressing
long-neglected
challenges so our country can thrive in
the 21st century. The Recovery and
Reinvestment Act is an extraordinary response to a crisis unlike any
since the Great Depression. With
much at stake, the Act provides for
unprecedented levels of transparency and accountability; and
Whereas, spearheaded by a new Recovery, Accountability and Transparency Board (“RAT Board”), this
Act contains built-in measures to
root out waste, inefficiency, and unnecessary spending. The website,
Recovery.gov, will be the main vehicle to provide each and every citi-

April 29, 2009
zen with the ability to monitor the
progress of the recovery; and
Whereas, this legislation will allow the City of Cleveland to implement the ARRA in a way that will
uphold the spirit of the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act, by
maintaining the “transparency, accountability and a common sense approach” that both the President and
Vice President directed Mayors and
Governor’s to carry out. The Stimulus Bill’s mission is to:
• Create or save more than 3.5
million jobs over the next two years;
• Take a big step toward computerizing Americans’ health records,
reducing medical errors, and saving
billions in health care costs;
• Revive the renewable energy
industry and provide the capital
over the next three years to eventually double domestic renewable
energy capacity;
• Undertake the largest weatherization program in history by modernizing 75 percent of federal building space and more than one million
homes;
• Increase college affordability
for seven million students by funding the shortfall in Pell Grants,
increasing
the
maximum
award
level by $500, and providing a new
higher education tax cut to nearly
four million students;
• As part of the $150 billion
investment in new infrastructure,
enact the largest increase in funding of our nation’s roads, bridges,
and mass transit systems since the
creation of the national highway
system in the 1950s;
• Provide an $800 Making Work
Pay tax credit for 129 million working households, and cut taxes for
the families of millions of children
through an expansion of the Child
Tax Credit; require unprecedented
levels of transparency, oversight,
and accountability; and
Whereas, in the face of an economic crisis, the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act represents a
strategic
—
and
significant
—
investment in our country’s future.
This legislation will allow the City
Administration to implement ARRAfunded projects in compliance with
the time requirements of the Federal, State, or other public entity
responsible for administering the
funds; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department and for
the public peace, property, health,
and safety in order to immediately
use these funds to combat the current economic crisis; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Finance or the Director responsible
for the improvements, projects, and
programs funded under this ordinance (“Appropriate Director”) is
authorized to apply for and accept
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds from Federal, State,
or other public entities for various
