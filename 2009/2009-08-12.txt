An emergency resolution urging
the
Greater
Cleveland
Regional
Transit Authority to reconsider eliminating Community Circulators and
to meet with City Council and other
community leaders in order to determine ways to save money without
negatively
impacting
Community
Circulator riders and neighborhood
routes.

The City Record
Whereas, last week, the Greater
Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (“RTA”) decided to eliminate all
12 of its Community Circulator bus
routes and raise most fares 25cents
to save approximately $5 million
dollars; and
Whereas, Community Circulators
are an extremely popular mode of
transportation for hundreds of people in Cleveland and the surrounding areas; and
Whereas, thousands of people in
our community depend on Community Circulator buses to get to work,
the grocery store, school, doctor’s
appointments and shopping because
they do not drive; and
Whereas, Community Circulators
are a life-line to many seniors who
would otherwise be stranded in their
own homes without transportation;
and
Whereas, most RTA riders would
say they would rather pay increased
fares than see the Community Circulator routes be eliminated; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges

185th Street in Cleveland.
Whereas, the U.S. Postal Service
has recently announced they plan to
close possibly 24 area post offices in
northern Ohio by October 1, 2009;
and
Whereas, one post office they
could close is the Beachland Station,
located at 891 East 185th Street, in
Cleveland; and
Whereas, the cities of Cleveland
and Euclid have worked extremely
hard over the years to improve the
East 185th Street corridor and keep
it a thriving, community-oriented
business neighborhood; and

1498

August 12, 2009
Whereas, if the Beachland Station
post office were to close, this would
devastate the East 185th Street commercial corridor and the adjacent
residential communities in Cleveland’s Ward 11 and the City of
Euclid; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,

the urges the United States Postmaster General to keep open the

An emergency resolution supporting Western Reserve Land Conservancy’s application to the Clean
Ohio Conservation Fund for the
Dunham Tavern Museum Expansion
and Preservation Project.
Whereas,
the
Dunham
Tavern
Museum (the “Museum”) and its
partner Western Reserve Land Conservancy seek to pursue the Dunham Tavern Museum Expansion and
Preservation Project (the “Project”);
and
Whereas, as part of the Project
the Museum desires to expand its
current land holdings by purchasing
the vacant 6611 Euclid building
adjacent to the Museum’s property;
and
Whereas, this acquisition would
result in the beneficial re-use of a
vacant property located along the
Euclid Corridor, where the City of
Cleveland
has
made
significant
investment to encourage sustainable
economic redevelopment; and
Whereas, the 2005 MidTown Master Plan identifies the Museum site
as
the
MidTown
neighborhood’s
“central green,” providing a major
amenity and sense of identity within the neighborhood; and
Whereas, the Museum property
currently provides much needed publicly accessible open space, passive
recreation, and educational opportunities through its Heritage Trail
and Learning Gardens; and
Whereas, the Project would increase the Museum’s open space,
passive recreation and educational
offerings; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
seeks to coordinate with nonprofits
such as the Museum to increase the

August 12, 2009
availability of high-quality recreation opportunities and facilities
that meet the needs of Clevelanders
