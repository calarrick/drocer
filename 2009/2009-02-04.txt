By Council Member Brady.
An emergency ordinance to amend
Section 630.02 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as
amended by Ordinance No. 1250-A-05,
passed October 9, 2006, criminal
activity nuisances.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 630.02 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended by
Ordinance No. 1250-A-05, passed October 9, 2006, is hereby amended to
read as follows:
Section 630.02
Action to Abate
Nuisances; Costs of Enforcement
(a) Notice of Declaration of Nuisance. The Director of Public Safety or his or her designee, upon finding that three (3) or more nuisance
activities as defined in Section
630.01 have occurred on separate
occasions within any sixty (60) day
period on the same property, may
cause a written notice and order to
be served on the owner of the property declaring that the property is a
nuisance property. This notice and
order shall identify the nuisance
activities, and the estimated costs to
abate any future nuisance activity;
shall state that the owner may
avoid being charged the costs of
abatement by taking steps to prevent any further nuisance activity
as set forth in division (d) of this
Section; and shall state the appeal
process. The notice shall further
state that if a fourth or subsequent
nuisance activity as defined in Section 630.01 occurs later than thirteen
(13) days after the date of the written nuisance declaration notice and
within twelve (12) months of the
date of the third or any subsequent
nuisance activity, the City may
abate the nuisance by responding to
the activities using administrative
and law enforcement actions, and
the costs of the abatement shall be
charged to the owner of the nuisance property and may be certified

The City Record

February 4, 2009
as a lien on the nuisance property.
Notice shall be deemed properly
delivered by delivering it personally to the owner or leaving it at the
owner's usual place of business or
residence, or by mailing it to the
owner, or, if it cannot be served in
any of the other ways mentioned
above, by publishing it once in a
newspaper of general circulation
within the City, or by posting it in
a conspicuous place on the real
estate involved.
(b) Abatement. If the Director of
Public Safety or his or her designee
determines that a fourth or subsequent nuisance activity as defined
in Section 630.01 occurs later than
thirteen (13) days after the date of
the initial written nuisance declaration notice and within twelve (12)
months after the date of the third
or any subsequent nuisance activity,
the City may abate the nuisance
activity by using administrative and
law enforcement actions, and the
costs of the abatement shall be
charged to the owner of the property and, if not paid, may be certified
by the Commissioner of Assessments
and Licenses to the County Auditor
to be placed on the nuisance property as a lien to be collected as
other taxes and returned to the City.
The cost to abate the nuisance activity shall be calculated as set forth
in division (c). The City shall provide notice to the owner of the nuisance property of the City's decision
to charge the cost of abatement. If
the costs are not paid by the owner,
the City shall notify the owner at
least thirty (30) days before the
costs are certified to the County
Auditor. The notice shall contain a
street address or legal description of
the property, a description of the
nuisance activities and the cost to
abate. Notices shall be served as set
forth in division (a) of this section.
The Director of Law may take any
other action necessary to collect the
costs of abatement.
(c) Costs of Abatement. Costs of
abatement
shall
be
determined
based on the time required to
respond to the nuisance activity
multiplied by an hourly rate based

upon the wages and benefits of a
police officer, dispatch costs, vehicle
and equipment costs, and supervisory and administrative costs. The
hourly rate may be adjusted based
on the number of police officers
required to abate the nuisance.
(d) Nuisance Abatement Plan. The
owner of a nuisance property may
avoid being charged the cost of
abating future nuisances if the
owner meets with the Director of
Public Safety or his or her designee;
presents a plan to prevent further
nuisance activity and that plan is
approved by the Director of Public
Safety or his or her designee; and
implements the plan.
(e) Appeal. The owner of a nuisance
property
who
receives
a
notice declaring the owner's property to be a nuisance property, a
notice charging the cost of abating
nuisance activity, or a notice that
the cost of abatement shall be certified to the County Auditor, may
appeal the notice by submitting a
written request to the City official
who issued the notice within ten
(10) days of the date of the notice.
If, after a decision on that appeal,
the owner disagrees with the decision, the owner may appeal the decision of the City official to the Board
of Zoning Appeals. An appeal to the
Board of Zoning Appeals shall be
made within fifteen (15) days of the
postmark date of the decision from
the City official denying the appeal.
The Board shall conduct a hearing
and render a decision in accordance
with City ordinances and regulations governing its conduct and procedure. An appeal to the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall not stay any
actions by the City to abate any subsequent nuisance activity. In an
appeal to the Board of Zoning
Appeals of a nuisance declaration
notice, the City must show by a preponderance of the evidence that
there was probable cause to believe
that each nuisance activity stated in
the
notice
being
appealed
has
occurred, and that the declaration of
the property as a nuisance property
is justified. In an appeal to the
Board of Zoning Appeals of a notice

5
charging the cost of abating nuisance activity, or a notice that the
cost of abatement shall be certified
to the County Auditor, the City must
show by a preponderance of the evidence that the charging of abatement costs or the certification of
abatement costs is justified. The
owner may prevail on appeal of any
notice if the owner demonstrates by
a preponderance of the evidence
that:
(1) He or she was not the owner
at the time of any of the nuisance
activity that is the basis of the
notice; or
(2) He or she had knowledge of
the nuisance activity, but promptly
and vigorously took all actions necessary to abate the nuisance activity
including,
without
limitation,
compliance with the requirements of
division (C) of Section 5321.17 and
division (A)(9) of Section 5321.04 of
the Revised Code; or
(3) He or she had no knowledge
of the nuisance activity and could
not, with reasonable care and diligence, have known of the nuisance
activity; and upon receipt of the
notice of the declaration of the property as a nuisance property, he or
she promptly took all actions necessary to abate the nuisance including, without limitation, compliance
with the requirements of division
(C) of Section 5321.17 and division
(A)(9) of Section 5321.04 of the
Revised Code.
Section 2. That existing Section
630.02 of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended
by Ordinance No. 1250-A-05, passed
October 9, 2006, is hereby repealed.

An emergency resolution urging
that the proposed U. S. Office of
Urban Policy in President Obama’s
administration have an advisory
group to help guide that office in its
efforts to provide assistance to our
nation’s urban areas.
Whereas, urban areas now house
over 80 percent of our population
with close to 20% of our nation’s
total population residing in cities
with populations above 200,000; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
and its metropolitan area is one of
the largest in the United States,
with a metropolitan area population
of about 2 million; and
Whereas, large cities in the United States face many of the same
challenges in planning an urban
infrastructure that meets the future
work and living requirements of
growing populations; and
Whereas, there is a wealth of expertise and experience in cities,
such as Cleveland, among their public officials and administrators, urban planners, academic and research professionals, and community activists who are engaged in trying to identify solutions for these
challenges; and
Whereas, a newly created U.S.
Office of Urban Policy could greatly assist cities, like Cleveland, in
identifying common challenges that
face large, urban populations; in
sharing their experience and expertise; and in facilitating solutions to
those common challenges; and
Whereas, by adopting this Resolution, Council is joining the Seattle
City Council which has already
adopted a resolution to this effect,
as
well
as
other
large
cities
throughout the country that are con-

February 4, 2009

An emergency resolution supporting the Cleveland school board in its
consideration to require uniforms
for students in all district high
schools.
Whereas, since 2007, the Cleveland
school board has required students
in its elementary schools to wear
uniforms; and
Whereas, five city high schools —
Collinwood, Garrett Morgan, John
Hay, Ginn Academy and Martin
Luther King Jr. — already require
uniforms; and
Whereas, the 19 other schools in
the district follow a dress code, but
do not require uniforms; and
Whereas, uniforms make schools
safer by preventing display of gang
colors and making intruders stand
out; and
Whereas, children will not be
ridiculed because their families are
unable to afford the latest trend in
teen-aged fashion; and
Whereas, a committee of administrators, teachers, parents and students has recommended expanding
the
uniform
requirement
to
all
schools in the district; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the Cleveland school board in

An emergency resolution urging
our federal representatives from
Northeast Ohio to insist that the U.
S.
Department
of
Housing
and
Urban Development demolish its
condemned and distressed properties
found throughout the City of Cleveland.
Whereas, the U. S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development
(“HUD”) has in its inventory hundreds of homes in our community,
yet it continues to put its distressed
properties on the market regardless
of their condition, and with complete disregard to the city’s own
laws for disclosure upon sale of
homes; and
Whereas, much to this Council’s
alarm,
HUD
has
systematically
failed to inform buyers, investors
and speculators that the properties
they are purchasing are condemned,
disregarding the City’s Certificate
of Disclosure requirement; and
Whereas, HUD has failed to repair
vacant and abandoned properties for
which they are currently responsible, adding to the blighted conditions in the City; and
Whereas, in June, 2007, the zip
code 44105, in which the City’s
Slavic Village neighborhood is located, was declared to have the highest foreclosure rate in the United
States; currently Slavic Village averages two foreclosures a day; and
Whereas, recently, the largest
mortgage fraud case in the history
of Cuyahoga County was filed based
on fraud occurring in Slavic Village;
and
Whereas, it has come to this Council’s attention that HUD is now
attempting to dump its “low value”
inventory, making it necessary for
the City to use Neighborhood Stabilization
Plan
funds
and
other
sources to demolish those properties;
and
Whereas, however, the federal
government has allocated millions
of dollars to local brokers to use for
property repairs, maintenance and
preservation which also could be
used to demolish these distressed
properties; and
Whereas, it is incumbent upon our
federal officials to try and save our
neighborhoods
by
insisting
that
HUD use the funds they already
have to demolish its condemned and
distressed properties that are devastating our city; and

125

Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges our federal representatives
from Northeast Ohio to insist that
the U. S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development demolish its
condemned and distressed properties
found throughout the City of Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Sherrod
Brown and George Voinovich, U.S.
Senators of Ohio, U.S. Representative Marcia Fudge and Jorgelle
Lawson, Director, Ohio HUD Office.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it

create jobs, transform our economy
with science and technology, lower
healthcare costs, promote clean, efficient American energy, save public
sector jobs and protect vital services; and
Whereas, the Recovery and Reinvestment Bill will include over $43
billion for infrastructure, among
other initiatives; and
Whereas, the State of Ohio would
receive over $1.527 billion for infrastructure projects under the bill as
currently proposed; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
like all cities in the country, has a
large array of ready-to-go infrastructure projects that could put
people to work immediately and

26
leave much needed improvements in
our local infrastructure; and
Whereas, mayors of all cities will
be held accountable by their citizens
for successful implementation of
projects and employment of their
citizens through the use of these
