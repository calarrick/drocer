WRITTEN EXAMINATION

This examination will consist of a
written test. If you receive a passing grade on the examination, you
will be placed on the eligibility list
for Patrol Officer. Your examination

the eligibility list.
ADDITIONAL SELECTION
PROCEDURES

grade on the written examination
and rank high enough on the eligible list for Patrol Officer and
receive Civil Service Certification
will be subject to the following
examinations:
Physical Abilities Examination: The

a pass/fail basis, based on the time
required for you to complete the
