The City Record
new Section 433.09 prohibiting the
use of wireless handsets to text message while driving.
Whereas, according to the Governors Highway Safety Association,
four states — Alaska, Minnesota,
New Jersey and Washington — outlaw text messaging while driving
and legislation is being considered
in 16 other states; and
Whereas, mobile texters in the
United States sent 158 billion messages in 2006, up 95 percent from
2005, according to industry statistics
cited by the New York Times; and
Whereas, according to a 2006
study by Nationwide Insurance, 19
percent of drivers use text messaging while at the wheel and that
number jumped to 37 percent among
drivers aged 18 to 27; and
Whereas, a national American
Automobile Association survey of
1,000 16 and 17-year-old drivers
found that 46 percent send text messages with their cell phones while
driving; and
Whereas, each year, 21% of fatal
car crashes involving teenagers between the ages of 16 and 19 were
the result of cell phone use and this
result is expected to grow as much
as 4% every year; and
Whereas, in one tragic accident in
Canandaigua,
New
York,
police
found that text messages were sent
and received on a 17-year-old driver’s cell phone moments before the
vehicle slammed head-on into a
truck, killing her and four other
recent high school graduates; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that regulation of text messaging
while driving is necessary for the
health and safety of Ohio citizens;

a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

shall be rebuttable by evidence
showing that the driver was not
composing, sending or reading a

section shall be fined one hundred

hundred and fifty dollars for a second offense, and no more than five

By Council Member Reed.
An emergency resolution urging
the Governor of the State of Ohio
and General Assembly of the State
of Ohio to examine other states’ regulation of cell phone use and text
messaging while driving and consider passing similar legislation.
Whereas,
The
National
Safety
Council said using a cell phone
while driving quadruples drivers’
risk of getting into an accident; and
Whereas, the safety council cites
statistics from the Harvard Center
for Risk Analysis that show 2,600
deaths a year are caused by drivers
distracted by cell phones, and another 330,00 injuries; and
Whereas, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company’s 2007 survey of
dangerous driver behavior found
that 73 percent of 1,200 drivers talk
on cell phones while driving, and
use was the highest among young
drivers; and
Whereas,
some
studies
have
shown that driving while on the
phone is the same as being legally
drunk or having a blood-alcohol
level of .08 percent; and
Whereas, the safety council encourages states to regulate cell
phone use while driving and to
include text messaging technology
in any regulation; and
Whereas, many states, including
New York, New Jersey, Connecticut,
and California ban the use of cell
phones while driving or require a
hands-free device; and
Whereas, The Public Policy Institute of California’s study concluded
that the ban on using hand-held cell
phones will reduce traffic deaths by
about 300 a year in adverse conditions, such as on wet or icy roads;
and
Whereas, as many as 40 countries
may restrict or prohibit the use of
cell phones while driving, including
Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil,
Botswana, Chile, the Czech Republic,
Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France,
Germany, Greece, Hungary, India,

An emergency resolution urging
that the proposed U. S. Office of
Urban Policy in President Obama’s
administration have an advisory
group to help guide that office in its
efforts to provide assistance to our
nation’s urban areas.
Whereas, urban areas now house
over 80 percent of our population
with close to 20% of our nation’s
total population residing in cities
with populations above 200,000; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
and its metropolitan area is one of
the largest in the United States,
with a metropolitan area population
of about 2 million; and
Whereas, large cities in the United States face many of the same
challenges in planning an urban
infrastructure that meets the future
work and living requirements of
growing populations; and
Whereas, there is a wealth of expertise and experience in cities,
such as Cleveland, among their public officials and administrators, urban planners, academic and research professionals, and community activists who are engaged in trying to identify solutions for these
challenges; and
Whereas, a newly created U.S.
Office of Urban Policy could greatly assist cities, like Cleveland, in
identifying common challenges that
face large, urban populations; in
sharing their experience and expertise; and in facilitating solutions to
those common challenges; and
Whereas, by adopting this Resolution, Council is joining the Seattle
City Council which has already
adopted a resolution to this effect,

well
as
other

and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the

An emergency resolution supporting the Cleveland school board in its
consideration to require uniforms
for students in all district high
schools.
Whereas, since 2007, the Cleveland
school board has required students
in its elementary schools to wear
uniforms; and
Whereas, five city high schools —
Collinwood, Garrett Morgan, John
Hay, Ginn Academy and Martin
Luther King Jr. — already require
uniforms; and
Whereas, the 19 other schools in
the district follow a dress code, but
do not require uniforms; and
Whereas, uniforms make schools
safer by preventing display of gang
colors and making intruders stand
out; and
Whereas, children will not be
ridiculed because their families are
unable to afford the latest trend in
teen-aged fashion; and
Whereas, a committee of administrators, teachers, parents and students has recommended expanding
the
uniform
requirement
to
all
schools in the district; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,

An emergency resolution urging
our federal representatives from
Northeast Ohio to insist that the
U. S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development demolish its condemned and distressed properties
found throughout the City of Cleveland.

16
Whereas, the U. S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development
(“HUD”) has in its inventory hundreds of homes in our community,
yet it continues to put its distressed
properties on the market regardless
of their condition, and with complete disregard to the city’s own
laws for disclosure upon sale of
homes; and
Whereas, much to this Council’s
alarm,
HUD
has
systematically
failed to inform buyers, investors
and speculators that the properties
they are purchasing are condemned,
disregarding the City’s Certificate
of Disclosure requirement; and
Whereas, HUD has failed to repair
vacant and abandoned properties for
which they are currently responsible, adding to the blighted conditions in the City; and
Whereas, in June, 2007, the zip
code 44105, in which the City’s
Slavic Village neighborhood is located, was declared to have the highest foreclosure rate in the United
States; currently Slavic Village averages two foreclosures a day; and
Whereas, recently, the largest
mortgage fraud case in the history
of Cuyahoga County was filed based
on fraud occurring in Slavic Village;
and
Whereas, it has come to this Council’s attention that HUD is now
attempting to dump its “low value”
inventory, making it necessary for
the City to use Neighborhood Stabilization
Plan
funds
and
other
sources to demolish those properties;
and
Whereas, however, the federal
government has allocated millions
of dollars to local brokers to use for
property repairs, maintenance and
preservation which also could be
used to demolish these distressed
properties; and
Whereas, it is incumbent upon our
federal officials to try and save our
neighborhoods
by
insisting
that
HUD use the funds they already
have to demolish its condemned and
distressed properties that are devastating our city; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges our federal representatives
from Northeast Ohio to insist that

Res. No. 109-09.
By Council Members Kelley, Brady
and Mitchell.
An emergency resolution declaring
that
members
of
Congress
should not allow the states to distribute funds from the Recovery and
Reinvestment Bill without ensuring
that cities and counties in each
state receive their fair share of the
funding and strongly supporting the
direct
transfer
of
infrastructure
funding by the federal government
to cities and counties, or at least the
inclusion by Congress of a mechanism to discourage discretionary
decisions by states as to what
amounts cities receive.
Whereas, the Congress is currently reviewing an $835 billion dollar
bill containing economic recovery
tax cuts and targeted investment
spending
called
the
“American
Recovery and Reinvestment Bill of
2009” (“Recovery and Reinvestment
Bill”); and
Whereas, the Recovery and Reinvestment Bill endeavors to modernize roads, bridges and waterways,
create jobs, transform our economy
with science and technology, lower
healthcare
costs,
promote
clean,
efficient American energy, save public sector jobs and protect vital services; and
Whereas, the Recovery and Reinvestment Bill will include over $43
billion for infrastructure, among
other initiatives; and
Whereas, the State of Ohio would
receive over $1.527 billion for infrastructure projects under the bill as
currently proposed; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
like all cities in the country, has a
large array of ready-to-go infrastructure projects that could put
people to work immediately and
leave much needed improvements in
our local infrastructure; and
Whereas, mayors of all cities will
be held accountable by their citizens
for successful implementation of
projects and employment of their
citizens through the use of these
federal funds; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council declares that members of Congress
should not allow the states to distribute funds from the Recovery and
Reinvestment Bill without ensuring
that cities and counties in each
state receive their fair share of the
funding.
Section
2.
That
this
Council
strongly supports the direct transfer of infrastructure funding by the

78

January 28, 2009
federal government to cities and
counties, or at least the inclusion
by Congress of a mechanism to discourage discretionary decisions by
states as to what amounts cities
receive.
Section 3. That the Clerk is directed to transmit certified copies of
this resolution to all members of the
House Appropriations Committee, all
federal representatives representing
northeast Ohio and to Governor Ted
Strickland.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Motion to suspend rules, Charter,
