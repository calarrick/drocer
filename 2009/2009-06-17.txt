The City Record
(b) “Wind turbine hub” means an
electric power generator to which
the blade or rotor of a wind turbine
is attached.
(c) “Wind energy facility” means
a wind turbine and such associated
structures as substations, transmission lines and meteorological towers.
(d) “Rotor radius” means the distance between the center point of
the rotor or the outermost point on
the rotor or blade.
(e) “Turbine height” means the
distance between the base of the
tower or other supporting structure,
whether mounted on the ground or
on a rooftop, and the outermost
point of the rotor or blade at its
maximum vertical extension.
(f) “Lattice Tower” means a tower
constructed of vertical metal struts
and cross braces forming a square
or triangular structure that tapers
from the foundation.
(g) “Monopole Tower” means a
tower constructed of a single, selfsupporting metal tube, anchored to
a foundation.
Section 354A.03 Applicability
(a) General Applicability. No “wind
energy facility” shall be erected,
enlarged or extended without conformance to the provisions of this
chapter, and other applicable regulations, as evidenced by the issuance of a Building Permit by the
Department of Building and Housing and, where required, approval
by the City Planning Commission.
(b) City Planning Commission
Approval. Approval by the City
Planning Commission in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter
shall be required for all groundmounted wind turbines that exceed
the height limit for main buildings
on the subject property and for
rooftop-mounted wind turbines that
exceed the height limit set in Section 354A.04, for wind energy facilities not subject to such City Planning Commission approval by the
provisions of this chapter but located in a Design Review District,
review and approval by the City
Planning Commission or its Director
shall be made in accordance with
the provisions of Chapter 341 regarding Design Review Districts.
(c) Landmarks Commission Approval. For wind energy facilities
proposed for locations in Landmark
Districts or on individually designated
Landmark
properties,
the
Landmarks Commission shall substitute for the City Planning Commission in all responsibilities assigned to the City Planning Commission by the provisions of this
chapter.
Section 354A.04 Location, Setbacks
and Height
(a) Zoning Districts. Wind energy
facilities may be located in any Zoning District as either an accessory
use or a principal use, subject to the
restrictions and requirements of this
Chapter.
(b) Setbacks for Ground-Mounted
Wind Turbines.
(1) General. A ground-mounted
wind turbine shall be set back from
all property lines, street right-ofway lines, and overhead utility lines
a minimum distance equal to 1.1

1155

31
times the height of the wind turbine. Turbine setbacks shall be measured from the center of the wind
turbine base. With respect to an
overhead utility line that provides
service only to a single building or
a single parcel of land, the setback
requirement shall be met if the turbine is placed so that no portion of
a rotor blade extends closer than
five (5) feet to the utility line.
(2) Residential. With respect to
proximity to Residential District
lines, a wind turbine, including a
wind turbine located in a Residential District, shall be set back from
Residential District lines of adjoining or nearby properties a minimum
distance equal to two (2) times the
height of the wind turbine. In the
case of a wind turbine that does not
exceed thirty-five (35) feet in height
and is located in a Residential District, the wind turbine shall be set
back at least fifteen (15) feet from
all property lines, and no portion of
a rotor blade shall extend closer
than five (5) feet to any lot line.
(c) Height. The height of a
ground-mounted wind turbine shall
be limited by the setback requirements of this section. The height of
a rooftop or other building-mounted
wind turbine shall not exceed the
maximum permitted building height
for the property by more than twenty percent (20%). For a rooftop or
other building-mounted wind turbine
that exceeds the maximum permitted building height by more than
20%, the City Planning Commission,
after a public hearing, may approve
a greater height if the Commission
determines that the placement of
the turbine and context of the turbine site will mitigate any significant
negative
visual
or
safety
impacts on nearby properties.
Section 354A.05 Lighting, Design
and Noise
(a) Lighting. Wind turbines shall
not be illuminated except as required by the Federal Aviation
Administration or other applicable
authority or by the provisions of
Chapter 633 of these Codified Ordinances. The City Planning Commission may, however, approve lighting
in other instances if it determines
that the proposed lighting will
enhance the appearance of the wind
turbine and will not result in nuisances or hazards on nearby properties or streets. If lighting is
required, a design that minimizes
disturbances to nearby residences
shall be utilized.
(b) Structural Design. Wind turbines shall be designed to meet all
requirements of the Building Code
of the City of Cleveland and all
applicable state and federal regulations.
(c) Aesthetic Design. Wind turbines shall be designed in a manner
that makes them as visually unobtrusive as possible, while meeting
safety requirements. To this end,
towers shall be monopole rather
than lattice design, wherever feasible. With respect to color, wind turbines, shall be white or off-white or
unpainted metal, unless other colors
are required by federal regulations
or the provisions of Chapter 633 or
unless another color is approved by
the City Planning Commission as

32
being more effective or more appropriate in a particular instance.
(d) Signs. No signs shall be located on or around a wind turbine
except for necessary warning signs
or informational signs located at or
near ground level. Such signs may
include information of an educational nature or information identifying the manufacturer or installer
of the wind turbine but shall not
include any off-premise advertising
or any advertising for businesses or
other
activities
located
on
the
premises. No more than two permitted signs shall be located on or
around each wind turbine. The total
area of such signs shall not exceed
twenty (20) square feet, except that
no sign shall exceed four (4) square
feet if located on a property in a
Residential
District,
unless
that
property is occupied by a community facility use, in accordance with
the regulations of Chapter 350.
Free-standing signs shall not exceed
a height of five (5) feet, and the setback of such signs shall be in accordance with the regulations of Chapter 350 for the zoning district in
which the turbine is located.
(e) Noise. No wind turbine shall
produce noise that violates the provisions of Section 605.10 by unreasonably disturbing the quiet, comfort or repose of neighboring inhabitants.
