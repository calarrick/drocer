An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Finance to apply
for and accept American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act funds from
Federal, State, or other public entities for various City improvements,
projects, and programs eligible for
this funding; authorizing the Director to apply for and accept other
grants, loans, and gifts from Federal, State, or other public and private
entities to implement ARRA-funded
projects; authorizing various contracts, contract amendments, and
grant agreement amendments, and
other agreements necessary; authorizing the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies to acquire for
right-of-way
purposes
such
real
property and easements that are
necessary to implement the ARRAfunded projects; to pay or reimburse
other entities for related costs,
including the City share of improvements; to pay for permits, licenses,
fees, charges, and other authorizations required for any ARRA project; and to enter into contracts that
are necessary.
Whereas, The American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act (“ARRA”) is
the first spending bill (H.R. 1)
signed by President Obama on February 17th, 2009. The ARRA is an
extraordinary effort to jumpstart
our economy, create or save millions

12
of jobs, and put a down payment on
addressing
long-neglected
challenges so our country can thrive in
the 21st century. The Recovery and
Reinvestment Act is an extraordinary response to a crisis unlike any
since the Great Depression. With
much at stake, the Act provides for
unprecedented levels of transparency and accountability; and
Whereas, spearheaded by a new
Recovery, Accountability and Transparency Board (“RAT Board”), this
Act contains built-in measures to
root out waste, inefficiency, and
unnecessary spending. The website, Recovery.gov, will be the
main vehicle to provide each and
every citizen with the ability to
monitor the progress of the recovery; and
Whereas, this legislation will allow the City of Cleveland to implement the ARRA in a way that will
uphold the spirit of the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act, by
maintaining the “transparency, accountability and a common sense
approach” that both the President
and Vice President directed Mayors
and Governor’s to carry out. The
Stimulus Bill’s mission is to:
• Create or save more than 3.5
million jobs over the next two years;
• Take a big step toward computerizing Americans’ health records,
reducing medical errors, and saving
billions in health care costs;
• Revive the renewable energy
industry and provide the capital
over the next three years to eventually double domestic renewable
energy capacity;
• Undertake the largest weatherization program in history by modernizing 75 percent of federal building space and more than one million
homes;
• Increase college affordability
for seven million students by funding the shortfall in Pell Grants,
increasing
the
maximum
award
level by $500, and providing a new
higher education tax cut to nearly
four million students;
• As part of the $150 billion
investment in new infrastructure,
enact the largest increase in funding of our nation’s roads, bridges,
and mass transit systems since the
creation of the national highway
system in the 1950s;
• Provide an $800 Making Work
Pay tax credit for 129 million working households, and cut taxes for
the families of millions of children
through an expansion of the Child
Tax Credit; require unprecedented
levels of transparency, oversight,
and accountability; and
Whereas, in the face of an economic crisis, the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act represents a
strategic
—
and
significant
—
investment in our country’s future.
This legislation will allow the City
Administration to implement ARRAfunded projects in compliance with
the time requirements of the Federal, State, or other public entity
responsible for administering the
funds; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department and for
the public peace, property, health,
and safety in order to immediately

Bill No. 2, passed by the Ohio Senate on March 19, 2009, by removing
the requirement for municipal reimbursement of utility relocations
from ARRA-funded projects and
including goals for participation of
minority
and
female
business
enterprises, local businesses, and
local residents in eligible contracts.
Whereas, under provisions of the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, also known as the
Stimulus Bill, Pub.L. 111-5, 123 Stat.
115 (“ARRA”), states are eligible to
receive federal funding for various
infrastructure projects in order to
create private sector jobs and to
rebuild our highways, bridges, and
infrastructures; and
Whereas,
Amended
Substitute
House Bill No. 2, passed by the
Ohio Senate on March 19, 2009
(“Am. Sub. H.B. 2”), among other
things, amends Revised Code Section 5501.51 (now requiring only
the state to reimburse a utility for
the cost of relocation and adjustment necessitated by the construction of a state highway project,
provided the utility can present
detailed evidence of its costs, as
required by statute) by including
whichever
governmental
entity,
such as municipalities, among others, that is directing an improvement financed in whole or in part
by federal ARRA funds, as an entity required to reimburse utilities
for the cost relocation and adjustment in such case; and
Whereas, Am. Sub. H.B. 2 also provides that cities must bear the full
cost of utility relocation, even if the
project is only partially funded by
ARRA funds; and
Whereas,
Ohio
Department
of
Transportation (“ODOT”) representatives have indicated that if utility
facilities are located in a construction project area under a local permit, local communities may unable
to
obtain
reimbursement
from

622

April 8, 2009
ARRA federal funds for the costs of
relocation, which would face municipalities with the burden of paying
all costs of utility relocations from
local monies, not federal dollars;
and
Whereas, utilities’ payments of
local permit fees for operating in
public rights-of-way are completely
insufficient, if not insignificant,
compared to the cost of relocating
and adjusting utilities’ facilities;
and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland, as
well as other municipalities’ applications for ARRA funding of their
important infrastructure projects had
been submitted and their project
applications already had been accepted before Am. Sub. H.B. 2 without
opportunity to include or compensate
for the amounts of utilities relocation
and adjustment payment obligations
that would be imposed by H.B. 2, a
fact never addressed by proponents
of H.B. 2; and
Whereas, further, Am. Sub. H.B. 2
has no provisions for meeting goals
of equitable local participation, such
as minority and female business
enterprises, local businesses, and
local residents, in the significant
contracting opportunities which will
be possible under the ARRA plan
and if passed, we are calling on the
Governor to line item veto this
Amendment; and
Whereas, because of the complexity and severity of these issues, the
HB 2 Conference Committee was
formed to deliberate the above-stated and other issues presented to
them; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health,
or safety in that Am. Sub. H.B. 2
places such an enormous economic
obligation on the City of Cleveland
that it will jeopardize the City’s
ability to fund, partially or wholly,
Cleveland’s approved infrastructure
projects envisioned under ARRA
because of this additional unforeseen and unfunded expense; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the H.B. 2 Conference Committee to
improve Amended Substitute House
Bill No. 2, passed by the Ohio Senate on March 19, 2009, by removing
municipal reimbursement of utility
relocations from ARRA-funded projects and also be amended to include
participation of minority and female
business enterprises, local businesses, and local residents in eligible
contracts.
Section 2. That this resolution is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

and Zone.
An emergency resolution urging
the Governor and legislature of the
State of Ohio to use federal economic recovery funds to promote
goods and services made or performed by American citizens and
companies.
Whereas, the economic downturn is
having a critical impact on everyday
Americans who are struggling to
maintain or find jobs in an increasingly difficult environment; and
Whereas, those same Americans
are the taxpayers that provide the
revenue needed to operate essential
government services; and
Whereas, Congress has approved
and President Obama has signed
into law a taxpayer-sponsored economic recovery package that will
provide billions of dollars to help
economically devastated cities and
states immediately provide jobs to
millions of out-of-work Americans
through considerable infrastructure
rebuilding, green energy projects
and other projects that will require
manufactured components; and
Whereas, our taxpayer dollars
should be spent to maximize the creation of American jobs and restoring the economic vitality of our communities; and
Whereas, any domestically produced products that are purchased
with economic recovery plan monies
will immediately help struggling
American families and will help stabilize our greater economy; and
Whereas, any economic recovery
plan spending should – to every
extent possible – include a commitment from the Governor to buy
goods and services for projects from
companies that are produced within
the United States, thus employing
the very workers that pay the taxes
for the economic recovery plan
spending in the first place; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that Ohio’s Governor and legislature
must maximize the creation of
American jobs, and restore economic growth and opportunity by spending economic recovery plan funds on
products and services that both create jobs and help keep Americans
employed; and
Whereas, the State of Ohio’s Governor and legislature should commit
to purchasing only products and
services that are made or substantially made, or performed in the
United States, and wherever and
whenever possible made or performed in Ohio, with any economic
recovery monies provided to Ohio by
the American taxpayers; and
Whereas, this Council strongly
encourages the Governor and the
state legislature to commit to publish any requests to waive these procurement priorities so as to give
American workers and producers
the opportunity to identify and provide the American products and services that will maximize the success

The City Record
of our nation’s economic recovery
program; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the Governor and legislature of the State of Ohio to use federal economic recovery funds to promote goods and services made or
performed by American citizens and
companies.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Governor
Ted Strickland and all members of
the Ohio legislature.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

An emergency resolution urging
President Obama to form a National
Commission on Fatherhood.
Whereas, 80% of children who
were born in the “post-war generation” could expect to grow up with
two biological parents who were
married to each other; and
Whereas, today, only about 50% of
America’s children will spend their
entire childhood in an intact family;
and
Whereas, in the United States, 24
million children, or 34%, live without their biological father; and
Whereas, nearly 20 million children (27%) in the United States live
in single parent households; and
Whereas, in 2006, a single parent
headed 26.2% of households in Ohio
with minor children; and
Whereas, in 2006, in Ohio, 40.4%
of newborns were born to unmarried
parents; in several counties, this
rate was even higher; and
Whereas, divorce and non-marital
childbearing have become commonplace in the United States, dramatically altering children’s lives; and
Whereas, nationally, about 40% of
children
in
father-absent
homes
have not seen their father at all during the past year; about 50% of children living without their father
have never set foot in their father’s
home; and
Whereas, children who live without their biological fathers are, on
average, at least two to three times
more likely to be poor, to use drugs,

623

21
to experience health, educational,
emotional and behavioral problems,
to be victims of child abuse and to
engage in criminal behavior than
their peers who live with their married, biological, or adoptive parents;
and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
and Cuyahoga County have groups
that address the above issues on a
local level and the Ohio Commission
of Fatherhood has been reestablished in order to address fatherhood at the state level; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that the above concerns are so pervasive in the U.S., that they should
also be addressed on the national
level as well; and
Whereas, Council member Kevin
Conwell was named 2001 National
Father of the Year; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
President Obama to form a National
Commission on Fatherhood.
Section 2. That the Clerk is directed to transmit certified copies of
this resolution to President Barack
Obama, Governor Ted Strickland,
the Cuyahoga County Commissioners and the National League of
Cities.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period

The City Record
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 630.02 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended by
Ordinance No. 1250-A-05, passed October 9, 2006, is hereby amended to
read as follows:
Section 630.02
Action to Abate
Nuisances; Costs of Enforcement
(a) Notice of Declaration of Nuisance. The Director of Public Safety or his or her designee, upon finding that three (3) or more nuisance
activities as defined in Section
630.01 have occurred on separate
occasions within any sixty (60) day
period on the same property, may
cause a written notice and order to
be served on the owner of the property declaring that the property is a
nuisance property. This notice and
order shall identify the nuisance
activities, and the estimated costs to
abate any future nuisance activity;
shall state that the owner may
avoid being charged the costs of
abatement by taking steps to prevent any further nuisance activity
as set forth in division (d) of this
Section; and shall state the appeal
process. The notice shall further
state that if a fourth or subsequent
nuisance activity as defined in Section 630.01 occurs later than thirteen
(13) days after the date of the written nuisance declaration notice and
within twelve (12) months of the
date of the third or any subsequent
nuisance activity, the City may
abate the nuisance by responding to
the activities using administrative
and law enforcement actions, and
the costs of the abatement shall be
charged to the owner of the nuisance property and may be certified
as a lien on the nuisance property.
Notice shall be deemed properly
delivered by delivering it personally to the owner or leaving it at the
owner’s usual place of business or
residence, or by mailing it to the
owner, or, if it cannot be served in
any of the other ways mentioned
above, by publishing it once in a
newspaper of general circulation
within the City, or by posting it in
a conspicuous place on the real
estate involved.
(b) Abatement. If the Director of
Public Safety or his or her designee
determines that a fourth or subsequent nuisance activity as defined
in Section 630.01 occurs later than
thirteen (13) days after the date of
the initial written nuisance declaration notice and within twelve (12)
months after the date of the third
or any subsequent nuisance activity,
the City may abate the nuisance
activity by using administrative and
law enforcement actions, and the
costs of the abatement shall be
charged to the owner of the property and, if not paid, may be certified
by the Commissioner of Assessments
and Licenses to the County Auditor
to be placed on the nuisance property as a lien to be collected as

626

April 8, 2009
other taxes and returned to the City.
The cost to abate the nuisance activity shall be calculated as set forth
in division (c). The City shall provide notice to the owner of the nuisance property of the City’s decision
to charge the cost of abatement. If
the costs are not paid by the owner,
the City shall notify the owner at
least thirty (30) days before the
costs are certified to the County
Auditor. The notice shall contain a
street address or legal description of
the property, a description of the
nuisance activities and the cost to
abate. Notices shall be served as set
forth in division (a) of this section.
The Director of Law may take any
other action necessary to collect the
costs of abatement.
(c) Costs of Abatement. Costs of
abatement shall be determined based
on the time required to respond to
the nuisance activity multiplied by
an hourly rate based upon the
wages and benefits of a police officer, dispatch costs, vehicle and
equipment costs, and supervisory
and administrative costs. The hourly rate may be adjusted based on
the number of police officers required to abate the nuisance.
(d) Nuisance Abatement Plan. The
owner of a nuisance property may
avoid being charged the cost of
abating future nuisances if the
owner meets with the Director of
Public Safety or his or her designee;
presents a plan to prevent further
nuisance activity and that plan is
approved by the Director of Public
Safety or his or her designee; and
implements the plan.
(e) Appeal. The owner of a nuisance
property
who
receives
a
notice declaring the owner’s property to be a nuisance property, a
notice charging the cost of abating
nuisance activity, or a notice that
the cost of abatement shall be certified to the County Auditor, may
appeal the notice by submitting a
written request to the City official
who issued the notice within ten
(10) days of the date of the notice.
If, after a decision on that appeal,
the owner disagrees with the decision, the owner may appeal the decision of the City official to the Board
of Zoning Appeals. An appeal to the
Board of Zoning Appeals shall be
made within fifteen (15) days of the
postmark date of the decision from
the City official denying the appeal.
The Board shall conduct a hearing
and render a decision in accordance
with City ordinances and regulations governing its conduct and procedure. An appeal to the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall not stay any
actions by the City to abate any subsequent nuisance activity. In an
appeal to the Board of Zoning
Appeals of a nuisance declaration
notice, the City must show by a preponderance of the evidence that
there was probable cause to believe
that each nuisance activity stated in
the
notice
being
appealed
has
occurred, and that the declaration of
the property as a nuisance property
is justified. In an appeal to the
Board of Zoning Appeals of a notice
charging the cost of abating nuisance activity, or a notice that the

April 8, 2009
cost of abatement shall be certified
to the County Auditor, the City must
show by a preponderance of the evidence that the charging of abatement costs or the certification of
abatement costs is justified. The
owner may prevail on appeal of any
notice if the owner demonstrates by
a preponderance of the evidence
that:
(1) He or she was not the owner
at the time of any of the nuisance
activity that is the basis of the
notice; or
(2) He or she had knowledge of
the nuisance activity, but promptly
and vigorously took all actions necessary to abate the nuisance activity
including,
without
limitation,
compliance with the requirements of
division (C) of Section 5321.17 and
division (A)(9) of Section 5321.04 of
the Revised Code; or
(3) He or she had no knowledge
of the nuisance activity and could
not, with reasonable care and diligence, have known of the nuisance
activity; and upon receipt of the
notice of the declaration of the property as a nuisance property, he or
she promptly took all actions necessary to abate the nuisance including, without limitation, compliance
with the requirements of division
(C) of Section 5321.17 and division
(A)(9) of Section 5321.04 of the
Revised Code.
Section 2. That existing Section
630.02 of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended
by Ordinance No. 1250-A-05, passed
October 9, 2006, is hereby repealed.

Discovery Program and Audit Initiative, for a period up to two years and
two one-year options to renew, the
first of which is exercisable through

one-year options to renew may not

The Parking Network will, among
other things, identify all revenue
generating parking facilities in the
City of Cleveland. From that, The
Parking
Network
will
discover
which parking facilities have not
reported any parking revenue, and
therefore, have paid no Parking
Facility Tax to the City. They will
also identify which parking facilities, although reporting, are underreporting parking revenues collected and therefore, have underpaid
the correct amount of Parking
Facility Tax to the City. The Parking Network will also educate
parking providers about the requirements of the Parking Facility
Tax Program.
Section 2. That the agreement shall
provide that the City will pay The
Parking Network contingency fees of
thirty percent (30%) of qualified revenue assessed and received by the
City of Cleveland. Qualified revenue
is defined as additional tax receipts,
including penalties and interest, over
and above such amounts already
being collected by the City of Cleveland that are clearly and directly
attributable to the performance of
The Parking Network and not subject to further appeal under law.
Qualified revenue shall be limited to
the period of three (3) years before
and three (3) years after the identification of additional tax receipts as
such identification may be defined by
mutual agreement.
Section 3. That the contingency
fees shall be paid from Fund No. 01150301-632000, Request No. 183321.

(d) The exemption from tax provided in this section shall not be
allowed to any institution, society or

other items.
(e) The limitation contained in
this section, upon the exemption
from tax in case of admissions to
wrestling matches, prize fights or
boxing, sparring or other pugilistic

Arena for Games, and plus (c) in
the event that the City increases the
taxes payable under this Chapter
from 6% to a higher rate, the percentage equal to such increase times
all admissions charges for all admissions during such Collection Year to

interest and on such other terms and
in such form as are consistent with
Gateway’s
obligations
under
the
trust indentures and related agreements securing Gateway’s bonds and
the Arena Bonds and as the City’s

April 8, 2009
Director of Finance and Director of
Law deem acceptable in the interests
of the City.
(5) Gateway shall make or cause
to be made such other assurances
and commitments as the City’s Director of Finance and Director of Law
deem necessary, and appropriate to
protect the City’s entitlements under
this division (f) and provide copies
of such other assurances and commitments to the Clerk of the Council.
(g)(1) Except as otherwise provided in division (b), and notwithstanding anything else in this chapter to the contrary, no tax shall be
levied
under
this
chapter
with
respect to any admission to live theater, live opera, live ballet, or live
exhibition of dance, musical performance, or monologue productions
which are sponsored by an institution, society or organization that
has received a determination from
the Internal Revenue Service that
the organization is exempt from federal income tax under s. 501(c)(3) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended; provided that the institution,
society
or
organization
actively participates in planning
and conducting the event, is responsible for the safety and success of
the event, is organized for the purpose of sponsoring live theater, live
opera, live ballet, or live exhibition
of dance, musical performance, or
monologue
productions

among the stated purposes in its
charter the promotion of arts education in the communities which it
serves, and will receive at least 20
percent of the net profits, if any, of
the events which the institution,
society or organization sponsors and
will bear the risk of at least 20 percent of the losses, if any, from the
events which the institution, society
or organization sponsors.
(2) The exemption from tax provided in this subsection shall not be
allowed to any institution, society or
organization which does not control

which an exemption from admission
tax has been allowed pursuant to
this subsection (g), the treasurer of
the institution, society or organization shall file an itemized statement
with the Commissioner setting forth

money
actually
received by such treasurer together

demonstrates a failure to qualify in
accordance with paragraph (1) of
this subsection (g), no such exemption shall thereafter be allowed to
such institution, society or organization.
Section 2. That existing Section
195.03 of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as enacted by
Ordinance No. 1955-07, passed December 3, 2007, is repealed.
