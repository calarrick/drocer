Res. No. 1450-09.
By Council Member Keane.
An emergency resolution urging
the United States Postal Service and
the Postal Regulatory Commission
to consider the potential impact of
closing 15 postal stations in the City
of Cleveland that would be undeniably detrimental to our neighborhoods, our seniors, and our businesses who count on these stations
to be anchors in our community.

Service (USPS) is currently undertaking the Station and Branch Optimization and Consolidation initiative. As part of this initiative USPS
must submit the names of the facilities under review to the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC); and
Whereas, On September 2, 2009,
USPS
announced
“Fewer
Retail
Offices Remain Under Review for
Consolidation”. Of the 37,000 Post
Offices, stations, branches and community post offices nationwide 413
remain for possible closure. Of those
413, 15 are in the City of Cleveland;
and
Whereas, The 15 stations under
review in the City of Cleveland
stand as the most in any single city
in The United States; and
Whereas, on September 16, 2009
Postmaster
John
E.
Potter
announced in his annual address to the
mailing industry, “There’s no other
business that has such an active,
collaborative and productive partnership with so many great customers in so many great communities,” said Potter. “And we’re going
to keep working to make that even
stronger.”; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
supplements the testimony of Councilman Martin Keane and Councilman Terrell Pruitt before the Postal
Regulatory Commission on September 16, 2009 by urging the Postmaster General to recognize that we are
a great community deserving of
more dialogue before such a drastic
decision be made; and
Whereas, this Council supports
the concept of great communities in
which the USPS is an active partner
and fully recognizes the invaluable
asset a post office provides to a
neighborhood and its people; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the United States Postal Service and

Conwell, Cummins, Johnson, Keane,
Polensek, Reed, Westbrook, Wilkes
and Zone.
An emergency resolution supporting the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County
Port Authority’s Port Relocation
Project; and urging the Congress
and President of the United States
to fully support all efforts by the
Port Authority to enhance domestic
and international trade and redevelop the Lake Erie waterfront and
downtown by relocating its international dock and developing an international trade district.
Whereas, Lake Erie, Cleveland’s
and Ohio’s Great Lake, benefits not
just the multitude of Cleveland citizens who depend on the lake for
their jobs and way of life, but the
entire state of Ohio and the Midwest
region of the United States; and
Whereas, with careful vision and
planning, the Lake Erie waterfront
has the potential to support expanded domestic and international development, enriching surrounding communities without endangering this
unique asset; and
Whereas, the Cleveland-Cuyahoga
County Port Authority (“Port Authority”) has developed a project to
relocate its international dock and
form an international trade district
that has the potential to transform
the Cleveland lakefront and surrounding areas, creating a gateway
to international markets while attracting transportation-dependent manufacturers, logistics and alternative
energy businesses; and
Whereas, the Port Authority’s relocation plan presents an opportunity
not only for maritime and multimodal transportation expansion, but
also for the redevelopment of its
existing property into mixed use commercial, retail, housing, and green
space with waterfront access; and
Whereas, the plan is born out of
the Cleveland community’s desire to
reclaim its downtown waterfront
through Cleveland’s 2004 Waterfront
Development Plan, as well as the
commercial necessity and federal
mandate to maintain Cleveland Harbor’s federal navigational channel
at depths requisite to promote maritime related transport; and
Whereas, the Port Authority and
the United States Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) have worked
together diligently on planning, testing, and designing the relocated
facilities to convert the Confined
Disposal Facility (CDF) required to
hold contaminated dredging into a
usable maritime facility; and
Whereas, relocating the Port Authority’s maritime operations onto
the new CDF allows USACE to meet
their Congressional mandate and
represents the necessary beneficial
reuse that justifies significant community capital investment; and
Whereas, the level of local community investment is significant,
accordingly the Port Authority is
seeking changes to the USACE CDF
project
scope
(including
marina
relocation, breakwall extension and
a possible cost share adjustment)
that would increase the federal
share; and

The City Record
Whereas, the Port Relocation Project will create a state-of-the-art
maritime facility that Ohio businesses can leverage to compete in
the global marketplace, transform
its current downtown Cleveland site
into a world-class waterfront district, and develop an International
Trade District within approximately
1,200 acres to become the next generation manufacturing and logistics
business district; and
Whereas, each of these areas of
development represent an opportunity to provide Cleveland residents
with a large quantity of new, high
paying, permanent jobs, thereby
increasing the City’s tax base and
providing a true opportunity to
drive the region’s economic rebirth;
and
Whereas, Ohio is leading the
effort on the Great Lakes to establish short sea shipping through the
St. Lawrence Seaway with vessels
that would bring diversified cargoes
directly into Cleveland and Toledo;
and
Whereas, Cleveland is the first
major U.S. Port on the Great Lakes,
and with the new port site doubling
size, Cleveland could establish itself
as a Gateway to the Midwest and
reap the benefits of being a major
logistics center for manufactured
goods moving to and from key
world markets; and
Whereas, according to the St.
Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation, the maritime operations
within the Port of Cleveland are currently responsible for creating annual economic value of 11,000 jobs,
$572 Million in Personal Incomes,
$883 Million in Business Revenue,
and $202 Million in Tax Revenues,
and the Port Relocation Project has
the economic impact potential of creating approximately 20,000 plus new
high paying jobs within Ohio; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority’s Port Relocation
Project; and urges the Congress and
President of the United States to
fully support all efforts by the Port
Authority to enhance domestic and
international trade and redevelop
the Lake Erie waterfront by relocating its international dock and
developing an international trade
district.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
the President of the United States,
the Speaker and Clerk of the United
States House of Representatives, the
President and Secretary of the United States Senate, the members of the
Ohio Congressional delegation, the
128th General Assembly, the Cleveland-Cuyahoga Port Authority, and
Mayor Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is

and Wilkes.
An emergency resolution joining
Mayor Jackson in supporting Issue
5, which would elect a County Charter Commission and urging the Governor of Ohio and the State Democratic Party Chairman to join the
Council and the Mayor in supporting
Issue 5.
Whereas, there are two competing
County Government reform issues
on the November 2009 General Election Ballot; and
Whereas, Issue 5 proposes to reform county government by developing an open, inclusive, deliberate
and participatory process to identify the problems and consider solutions; and
Whereas, Issue 5 achieves such a
process by the County Commissioners placing the question before the
voters and allowing the voters to
elect a County Charter Commission
(“Charter
Commission
Plan”)
in
order to guarantee transparency in
the process; and
Whereas, this Council joins the
Mayor in supporting Issue 5 which
elects a County Charter Commission;
and
Whereas, County reform creates
an opportunity to improve the way
county government serves all residents of Cuyahoga County; and
Whereas, Issue 5 seeks to bring
the best ideas to county government
— increasing efficiency and reducing bureaucratic red-tape — so county government can do a better job
serving all residents; and
Whereas, Issue 5 will create an
open, transparent process to thoughtfully develop a real county reform
plan; and
Whereas, Issue 5 is an opportunity to streamline government and
promote real job creation and economic development; and
Whereas, Issue 5 makes it possible to set real rules to prevent abuses and corruption — and prohibit
officials from soliciting political
contributions from county employees; and
Whereas, Issue 5 creates a charter review commission of 15 members who will seek expert opinions,
review best practices and hold public
meetings
in
neighborhoods
across the county to listen to residents; and
Whereas, a county charter will be
developed by the commission and
placed on the November 2010 ballot
for voter approval; and
Whereas, Issue 5 supporters have
assembled a Real Reform Done
Right slate of highly educated and
respected candidates from broad

October 7, 2009
backgrounds for the charter review
commission; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health,
or safety in that support of Issue 5
will provide for a more transparent
form of County government; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council joins

5, which would elect a County Charter Commission and urges the Governor of Ohio and the State Democratic Party Chairman to join the
Council and the Mayor in supporting

Westbrook, Wilkes and Zone.
An emergency resolution declaring this Council’s support of State
Issue 3 and urging citizens to vote
“Yes” on Issue 3 to bring casinos to
the State of Ohio.
Whereas, Ohio’s economy is struggling and unemployment remains
above 10%; and
Whereas, local governments continue to face difficult financial
issues, putting strain on local services and public safety; and
Whereas, studies show that State
Issue 3 — the Ohio Jobs and Growth
Plan — will create 19,000 construction jobs beginning next year and
15,000 permanent jobs beginning in
2012
by
authorizing
casinos
in
Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati and
Toledo; and
Whereas, studies also show that
Issue 3 will produce $651 million in
tax revenue every year, with the
vast majority of the funds going to
local governments and every school
district in the state; and
Whereas, further, studies confirm
that the casinos will bring a man-

The City Record
dated minimum of $1 billion in new
economic development — $250 million for each of the four casinos;
and
Whereas, it has been shown that
more than $1 billion in Ohio money
leaves the state every year when
Ohioans travel to casinos in neighboring states; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council declares its support of State Issue 3
and urges citizens to vote “Yes” on
Issue 3 to bring casinos to the State
of Ohio.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
