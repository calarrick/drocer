An emergency resolution in support of S.B. 172 and H.B. 305 which
re-instate the waiver of the application and test fees for the GED test
for certain applicants.
Whereas, the GED is a test of general educational development required for issuance of a high school
equivalence diploma by the State
Board of Education; and
Whereas, obtaining a GED can be
the first step onto the road to becoming a productive, civically engaged citizen; and
Whereas, SB 172 and HB 305 provide that certain applicants may
have the GED application and test
fees waived; and
Whereas, as taxpayers, we will
pay now by re-instating the waiver through SB 172 and HB 305 thus
giving people the opportunity to
get their GED, where they might
not have been financially able to
take the GED; or pay later by footing the bill for antisocial and criminal behavior by those who couldn’t find jobs because they were
financially unable to take the GED;
and

The City Record
Whereas, more than 18,000 people
will be negatively affected if the
waiver is removed; and

and waiving the fees will promote
a more educated workforce, making it more likely that people will
seek and obtain gainful employment; and

immediate preservation of public

An emergency resolution urging
voters to vote ‘NO” on Ohio Issue 2
which would change the Ohio Constitution to establish an appointed
“Livestock Care Standards Board”.

8
Whereas, if passed, Ohio Issue 2
would make permanent in the Ohio
Constitution
the
Livestock
Care
Standards Board (the “Board”) with
unchecked power to develop guidelines for raising livestock and with
the potential to reshape regulations
on how animals in Ohio are raised,
tracked or traced; and
Whereas, this 13 member Board of
political appointees would have farreaching and unchecked authority
to establish standards governing the
care and well-being of livestock and
poultry in Ohio; and
Whereas, the Board established
under Ohio Issue 2, would have the
power to override any act by the
Ohio Department of Agriculture or
the state legislature, or any other
initiative or referendum brought
before the Ohio public other than a
constitutional amendment; and
Whereas, this Board would have
the power to create all policies in
Ohio related to animals in agriculture, affecting not just welfare concerns but also a wide variety of animal-related issues including the regulation of organic meat production,
animal identification and concentrated
animal feeding operations (“factory
farms”); and
Whereas, it is generally recognized that the Board will most likely be comprised of people with corporate agri-business and factory
farming interests, at the expense of
family farmers; and
Whereas, the Board could potentially implement standards that would
make raising food in an organic or
sustainable manner excessively expensive or burdensome, driving small
farmers out of business and hurting
local economies; and
Whereas, the US Department of
Agriculture states that 98% of all
farms in the US are technically
family farms, however, Ohio has
nearly 200 factory farms — which
number would increase if an industry-led board decides to ease regulations on animal production; and
Whereas,
voters
should
reject
Ohio Issue 2 because it would create a permanent place for special
interests in the Ohio Constitution,
with no formal process for public
input, review, evaluation or appeal
of decisions made related to animal
agriculture in Ohio; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges voters to vote ‘NO” on Ohio
Issue 2 which would change the
Ohio Constitution to establish an
appointed “Livestock Care Standards
Board”.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

An emergency resolution objecting to the transfer of ownership of
a C1 Liquor Permit to 5009 Detroit
Avenue.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Department of Liquor
Control of an application for the
transfer of ownership of a C1 Liquor
Permit from 5015 Detroit Avenue,
Inc., DBA Amy Food Market, 5009
Detroit Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44102,
Permanent Number 65493340001 to
Detroit Beverage, Inc., DBA Detroit
Beverage, 5009 Detroit Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44102, Permanent Number
21013480005; and
Whereas, the granting of this application for a liquor permit to this
high crime area, which is already
saturated with other liquor outlets,
is contrary to the best interests of
the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to
Section 4303.26 of the Ohio Revised
Code. Council’s objection to said
permit must be received by the
Director of Liquor Control within
30 days of notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby record its objection to the transfer of ownership of a C1 Liquor
Permit from 5015 Detroit Avenue,

EXTENSION OF TIME:
Docket A-197-09 — Rockefeller
Building Associates — 621 Frankfort Avenue:
This case was heard August 19,
2009, at which time the Appellant
was granted two (2) weeks in
which to safely, as a result of an
engineering report, blockade any
areas that are considered unsafe by
the engineer’s report and to present
a plan to the City within thirty (30)
days of the means and methods of
continuing the existence of or the
demolition of the garage.
The Appellant request additional
time to determine the feasibility of
having work done, which would
depend on financing, which at this
time the climate is not favorable,
maybe in six (6) months the situation will change; and to tear down
the garage is impossible, because
all of the main exhaust ducts from
the heating system in the basement
are connected and supported by the
garage structure; that the Appellant is maintaining the two (2)
lower floors, the upper floor is
closed. If the Appellant can’t get
finance, he will just close the
garage, which unfortunately eliminates 120 parking spaces and the
only garage available in the warehouse district. Therefore, an additional six (6) months is requested
to obtain financing to completely
renovate the garage or renovate
the first and second floors, and
that maintaining two (2) floors
will cause no harm to anyone.
BE IT RESOLVED, a motion is in
order at this time to DENY the
Appellant’s request for additional
time. The property is REMANDED
at this time to the Department of
Building and Housing for supervision and any required further action. Motion so in order. Motioned by
Mr. Saunders and seconded by Mr.
