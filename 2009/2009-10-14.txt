healthy lifestyle choices; and
Whereas, early detection is vital
in winning the fight against breast
cancer and teaching early detection
is one of the best forms of protection; and
Whereas, it is important to raise
public awareness on this devastating disease and work towards developing new technologies and treatments; and
Whereas, the University Hospitals
Ireland Cancer Center is a national
leader in treating this aggressive
disease and dedicated to finding a
cure for it; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of

Res. No. 1450-09.
By Council Member Keane.
An emergency resolution urging
the United States Postal Service
and the Postal Regulatory Commission to consider the potential
impact of closing 15 postal stations
in the City of Cleveland that would
be undeniably detrimental to our
neighborhoods, our seniors, and our
businesses who count on these stations to be anchors in our community.
Whereas, The United States Postal
Service (USPS) is currently undertaking the Station and Branch Optimization and Consolidation initiative. As part of this initiative USPS
must submit the names of the facilities under review to the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC); and

The City Record

Post
Offices, stations, branches and community post offices nationwide 413
remain for possible closure. Of those
413, 15 are in the City of Cleveland;
and
Whereas, The 15 stations under
review in the City of Cleveland
stand as the most in any single city
in The United States; and
Whereas, on September 16, 2009
Postmaster John E. Potter announced
in his annual address to the mailing
industry, “There’s no other business
that has such an active, collaborative and productive partnership with
so many great customers in so many
great communities,” said Potter. “And
we’re going to keep working to make
that even stronger.”; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
supplements the testimony of Councilman Martin Keane and Councilman Terrell Pruitt before the Postal
Regulatory Commission on September 16, 2009 by urging the Postmaster General to recognize that we are
a great community deserving of
more dialogue before such a drastic
decision be made; and
Whereas, this Council supports
the concept of great communities in
which the USPS is an active partner
and fully recognizes the invaluable
asset a post office provides to a
neighborhood and its people; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the United States Postal Service
and the Postal Regulatory Commission to consider the potential
impact of closing 15 postal stations
in the City of Cleveland that would
be undeniably detrimental to our

An emergency resolution supporting the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County

1906

October 14, 2009
Port Authority’s Port Relocation
Project; and urging the Congress
and President of the United States
to fully support all efforts by the
Port Authority to enhance domestic
and international trade and redevelop the Lake Erie waterfront and
downtown by relocating its international dock and developing an international trade district.
Whereas, Lake Erie, Cleveland’s
and Ohio’s Great Lake, benefits not
just the multitude of Cleveland citizens who depend on the lake for
their jobs and way of life, but the
entire state of Ohio and the Midwest region of the United States;
and
Whereas, with careful vision and
planning, the Lake Erie waterfront
has the potential to support expanded domestic and international development, enriching surrounding communities without endangering this
unique asset; and
Whereas,
the
Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority (“Port
Authority”) has developed a project
to relocate its international dock
and form an international trade
district that has the potential to
transform the Cleveland lakefront
and surrounding areas, creating a
gateway to international markets
while
attracting
transportationdependent manufacturers, logistics
and alternative energy businesses;
and
Whereas, the Port Authority’s relocation plan presents an opportunity not only for maritime and multimodal transportation expansion, but
also for the redevelopment of its
existing property into mixed use
commercial,
retail,
housing,
and
green space with waterfront access;
and
Whereas, the plan is born out of
the Cleveland community’s desire
to reclaim its downtown waterfront
through Cleveland’s 2004 Waterfront Development Plan, as well as
the commercial necessity and federal mandate to maintain Cleveland Harbor’s federal navigational
channel at depths requisite to promote maritime related transport;
and
Whereas, the Port Authority and
the United States Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) have worked
together diligently on planning,
testing, and designing the relocated facilities to convert the Confined Disposal Facility (CDF) required to hold contaminated dredging into a usable maritime facility;
and
Whereas, relocating the Port Authority’s maritime operations onto
the new CDF allows USACE to
meet their Congressional mandate
and represents the necessary beneficial reuse that justifies significant community capital investment;
and
Whereas, the level of local community investment is significant,
accordingly the Port Authority is
seeking changes to the USACE CDF
project
scope
(including
marina
relocation, breakwall extension and
a possible cost share adjustment)
that would increase the federal
share; and

October 14, 2009
Whereas,
the
Port
Relocation
Project will create a state-of-the-art
maritime facility that Ohio businesses can leverage to compete in
the global marketplace, transform
its current downtown Cleveland
site into a world-class waterfront
district, and develop an International Trade District within approximately 1,200 acres to become
the next generation manufacturing and logistics business district;
and
Whereas, each of these areas of
development represent an opportunity to provide Cleveland residents
with a large quantity of new, high
paying, permanent jobs, thereby
increasing the City’s tax base and
providing a true opportunity to
drive the region’s economic rebirth;
and
Whereas, Ohio is leading the
effort on the Great Lakes to establish short sea shipping through the
St. Lawrence Seaway with vessels
that would bring diversified cargoes
directly into Cleveland and Toledo;
and
Whereas, Cleveland is the first
major U.S. Port on the Great Lakes,
and with the new port site doubling
size, Cleveland could establish itself
as a Gateway to the Midwest and
reap the benefits of being a major
logistics center for manufactured
goods moving to and from key
world markets; and
Whereas, according to the St.
Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation, the maritime operations
within the Port of Cleveland are
currently responsible for creating
annual economic value of 11,000
jobs, $572 Million in Personal Incomes, $883 Million in Business
Revenue, and $202 Million in Tax
Revenues, and the Port Relocation
Project has the economic impact
potential of creating approximately 20,000 plus new high paying jobs
within Ohio; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority’s Port Relocation
Project; and urges the Congress and
President of the United States to
fully support all efforts by the Port
Authority to enhance domestic and
international trade and redevelop
the Lake Erie waterfront by relocating its international dock and
developing an international trade
district.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
the President of the United States,
the Speaker and Clerk of the United
States House of Representatives, the
President and Secretary of the United States Senate, the members of the
Ohio Congressional delegation, the
128th General Assembly, the Cleveland-Cuyahoga Port Authority, and
Mayor Jackson.

Cummins, Dow, Johnson, Mitchell,
Polensek, Pruitt, Reed, Westbrook
and Wilkes.
An emergency resolution joining
Mayor Jackson in supporting Issue
5, which would elect a County Charter Commission and urging the Governor of Ohio and the State Democratic Party Chairman to join the
Council and the Mayor in supporting
Issue 5.
Whereas, there are two competing
County Government reform issues
on the November 2009 General Election Ballot; and
Whereas, Issue 5 proposes to reform county government by developing an open, inclusive, deliberate
and participatory process to identify the problems and consider solutions; and
Whereas, Issue 5 achieves such a
process by the County Commissioners placing the question before the
voters and allowing the voters to
elect a County Charter Commission
(“Charter
Commission
Plan”)
in
order to guarantee transparency in
the process; and
Whereas, this Council joins the
Mayor in supporting Issue 5 which
elects a County Charter Commission;
and
Whereas, County reform creates
an opportunity to improve the way
county government serves all residents of Cuyahoga County; and
Whereas, Issue 5 seeks to bring
the best ideas to county government
— increasing efficiency and reducing bureaucratic red-tape — so county government can do a better job
serving all residents; and
Whereas, Issue 5 will create an open,
transparent process to thoughtfully
develop a real county reform plan;
and
Whereas, Issue 5 is an opportunity to streamline government and
promote real job creation and economic development; and
Whereas, Issue 5 makes it possible to set real rules to prevent abuses and corruption — and prohibit
officials from soliciting political
contributions from county employees; and
Whereas, Issue 5 creates a charter review commission of 15 members who will seek expert opinions,
review best practices and hold public
meetings
in
neighborhoods
across the county to listen to residents; and
Whereas, a county charter will be
developed by the commission and
placed on the November 2010 ballot
for voter approval; and

1907

15
Whereas, Issue 5 supporters have
assembled a Real Reform Done
Right slate of highly educated and
respected candidates from broad
backgrounds for the charter review
commission; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health,
or safety in that support of Issue 5
will provide for a more transparent
form of County government; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council joins
Mayor Jackson in supporting Issue
5, which would elect a County Charter Commission and urges the Governor of Ohio and the State Democratic Party Chairman to join the
Council and the Mayor in supporting
Issue 5.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit a copy of
this resolution to the Governor of
Ohio and the State Democratic Party
Chairman.
Section 3. That this resolution is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period

Cloud, Conwell, Dow, Johnson, Keane,
Kelley, Mitchell, Polensek, Pruitt,
Westbrook, Wilkes and Zone.
An emergency resolution declaring this Council’s support of State
Issue 3 and urging citizens to vote
“Yes” on Issue 3 to bring casinos to
the State of Ohio.
Whereas, Ohio’s economy is struggling and unemployment remains
above 10%; and
Whereas, local governments continue to face difficult financial
issues, putting strain on local services and public safety; and
Whereas, studies show that State
Issue 3 — the Ohio Jobs and Growth
Plan — will create 19,000 construction jobs beginning next year and
15,000 permanent jobs beginning in
2012
by
authorizing
casinos
in
Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati and
Toledo; and
Whereas, studies also show that
Issue 3 will produce $651 million in
tax revenue every year, with the
vast majority of the funds going to
local governments and every school
district in the state; and
Whereas, further, studies confirm
that the casinos will bring a mandated minimum of $1 billion in new
economic development — $250 million for each of the four casinos;
and
Whereas, it has been shown that
more than $1 billion in Ohio money
leaves the state every year when

16
Ohioans travel to casinos in neighboring states; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council declares its support of State Issue 3
and urges citizens to vote “Yes” on
Issue 3 to bring casinos to the State
of Ohio.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives

all the members elected to Council,

sponsorship services, for the various divisions of the Department of
Port Control, for a period of two
years, with two one-year options to
renew, the first of which is exercisable through additional legislative authority.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of

Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
