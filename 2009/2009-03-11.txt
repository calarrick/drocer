operator to stop at a traffic signal
displaying a steady red light indication or for the failure of an operator to comply with a speed limitation.
(b) Red light offense - liability

vehicle’s direction is emitting a
steady red light.

The Director of Public Safety
shall cause the general public to be
notified by means of a press release
issued at least thirty days before
any given camera is made fullyoperational and is used to issue tickets to offenders. Before a given camera issues actual tickets, there shall
be a period of at least two weeks,
which may run concurrently with
the 30-day public-notice period, during which only “warning” notices
shall be issued.
At each site of a red light or fixed
speed camera, the Director of Public
Service shall cause signs to be posted to apprise ordinarily observant
motorists that they are approaching
an area where an automated camera
is monitoring for red light or speed
violators. Mobile speed units shall be
plainly marked vehicles.
(h) Notices of liability. Any ticket for an automated red light or
speeding system violation under this
section shall:
(1) Be reviewed by a Cleveland
police officer;
(2) Be forwarded by first-class
mail or personal service to the vehi-

The City Record
cle’s registered owner’s address as
given on the state’s motor vehicle
registration, and
(3) Clearly state the manner in
which the violation may be appealed.
(i) Penalties. Any violation of
division (b) or division (c) of this
section shall be deemed a noncriminal violation for which a civil penalty shall be assessed and for which
no points authorized by Section
4507.021 of the Revised Code (“Point
system
for
license
suspension”)
shall be assigned to the owner or
driver of the vehicle.
(j) Ticket evaluation, public service, and appeals. The program
shall include a fair and sound ticket-evaluation process that includes
review by the vendor and a police
officer, a strong customer-service
commitment, and an appeals process
that accords due process to the ticket respondent and that conforms to
the
requirements
of
the
Ohio
Revised Code.
(k) Appeals. A notice of appeal
shall be filed with the Hearing Officer within twenty-one (21) days
from the date listed on the ticket.
The failure to give notice of appeal
or pay the civil penalty within this
time period shall constitute a waiver of the right to contest the ticket
and shall be considered an admission.
Appeals shall be heard by the
Parking Violations Bureau through
an administrative process established by the Clerk of the Cleveland Municipal Court. At hearings,
the strict rules of evidence applicable to courts of law shall not
apply. The contents of the ticket
shall constitute a prima facie evidence of the facts it contains. Liability may be found by the hearing
examiner based upon a preponderance of the evidence. If a finding
of liability is appealed, the record
of the case shall include the order
of the Parking Violations Bureau,
the Ticket, other evidence submitted by the respondent or the City
of Cleveland, and a transcript or
record of the hearing, in a written
or electronic form acceptable to
the court to which the case is appealed.
Liability shall not be found where
the evidence shows that the automated camera captured an event is
not an offense, including each of the
following events and such others as
may be established by rules and regulations issued by the Director of
Public Safety under the authority of
division (n) of this section:
(1) The motorist stops in time to
avoid violating a red light indication;
(2) The motorist proceeds through a
red light indication as part of funeral procession;
(3) The motorist is operating a
City-owned emergency vehicle with
its emergency lights activated and
proceeds through a red light indication or exceeds the posted speed limitation;
(4) The motorist is directed by a
police officer on the scene contrary
to the traffic signal indication.
Liability shall also be excused if
a vehicle is observed committing an
offense
where
the
vehicle
was
stolen prior to the offense and the
owner has filed a police report.

March 11, 2009
The Director of Public Safety, in
coordination with the Parking Violations Bureau, shall establish a
process by which a vehicle owner
who was not the driver at the time
of the alleged offense may, by affidavit, name the person who the
owner believes was driving the vehicle at the time. Upon receipt of such
an affidavit timely submitted to the
Parking
Violations
Bureau,
the
Bureau shall suspend further action
against the owner of the vehicle and
instead direct notices and collection
efforts to the person identified in
the affidavit. If the person named in
the affidavit, when notified, denies
being the driver or denies liability,
then the Parking Violations Bureau
shall resume the notice and collection process against the vehicle
owner, the same as if no affidavit
had been submitted, and if the violation is found to have been committed by a preponderance of evidence, the owner shall be liable for
any
penalties
imposed
for
the
offense.
A decision in favor of the City of
Cleveland
may
be
enforced
by
means of a civil action or any other
means provided by the Revised
Code.
(l) Evidence of operation. It is
prima facie evidence that the person
registered as the owner of the vehicle with the Ohio Bureau of Motor
Vehicles, or with any other State
vehicle registration office, or in the
case of a leased or rented vehicle,
the “lessee” as defined in division
(p), was operating the vehicle at the
time of the offenses set out in divisions (b) and (c) of this section.
(m)
Program
oversight.
The
Director of Public Safety shall oversee the program authorized by this
Section. The Director of Public Service shall oversee the installation
and maintenance of all automated
cameras. An encroachment permit
shall be authorized in the legislation in which locations are selected.
(n) Rules and Regulations. The
Director of Public Safety may issue
rules and regulations to carry out
the provisions of these sections,
which shall be effective thirty (30)
days after publication in the City
Record.
(o) Establishment of Penalty. The
penalty imposed for a violation of
division (b) or (c) of this section
shall be follows:

413.031(b)
All violations
413.031(c)
Up to 24 mph over the
speed limit
25 mph or more over
the speed limit

Res. No. 283-09.
By Council Member Cleveland.
An emergency resolution declaring this Council’s support of the proposed St. John’s West Family Homes
project which will provide for the
development and construction of affordable housing using low-income
tax credits from the Ohio Housing
Finance Agency.
Whereas, each year the Ohio
Housing Finance Agency allocates
low-income
housing
credits
for
affordable
housing
developments
throughout Ohio using a competitive
proposal process; and
Whereas,
the
Cleveland
City
Council has recognized the need to
maintain
affordable
housing
in
Cleveland’s neighborhoods; and
Whereas, Burten, Bell, Carr Development, Inc. is the local community
development corporation and has
applied for low income tax credits
for the St. John’s West Family
Homes project; and
Whereas, the proposed project will
contain up to 40 three and four-bedroom single family homes on scattered sites located at and around
East 37th, East 38th, and East 39th
Streets and Stanley Tolliver Avenue,
all in the city of Cleveland; and
Whereas, all of these homes will
be for residents earning 60% or less
of the median local income in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, adjusted for
household size; and
Whereas, none of these units are
targeted for a special needs population as defined in the 2007 Qualified
Allocation Plan; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
supports the proposed St. John’s
West Family Homes project for the
benefit the citizens of the City of
Cleveland; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the proposed St. John’s West
Family Homes project for the development of affordable housing using
low-income
housing
tax
credits

An emergency resolution supporting the City’s Appeal and Cuyahoga
County’s Local Emergency Planning
Committee’s opposition to the Final
Rule by the U.S Department of
Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administrator regarding transportation of hazardous materials by rail.
Whereas, on November 26, 2008,
the U.S. Department of Transportation, through its Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administrator (“PHMSA”), issued a Final Rule
regarding the transporting of hazardous materials by rail; and
Whereas, on December 19, 2008,
the City of Cleveland, filed an
Appeal to the Final Rule and the
Local Emergency Planning Committee (“LEPC”) of Cuyahoga County
has written a letter in opposition to
the Final Rule; and
Whereas, one of the City of Cleveland’s chief concerns is that the
PHMSA has not adequately considered the risks associated with the
transportation of different types and
classes of hazardous materials warranting enhanced safety and security measures; and
Whereas, the City’s Appeal further argues that the Final Rule did
not define and establish an unambiguous, expeditious and direct process for local government officials
to promptly obtain commodity data
or affect routing decisions in a timely manner to prevent a catastrophic
release or explosion of hazardous
materials; and
Whereas, the LEPC is concerned
that the Final Rule does not provide
for direct input or exchange of
information between the railroads,
the federal agencies and local and
state governments; that local and
state governments have no practical
method of appeal if they take issue
with the railroads about alternative
routes and there is no requirement
for cooperation between the railroad
companies; and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
the City’s interest in the transportation of hazardous materials by
rail because of concerns over local
safety and security of its rail lines,
especially the Lakefront Rail line
that runs through heavily populated
areas of the City and along the
City’s main water source, Lake Erie;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the City’s Appeal and Cuya-

The City Record
hoga County’s Local Emergency
Planning Committee’s opposition to
the Final Rule by the U.S Department of Transportation’s Pipeline
and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administrator regarding transportation of hazardous materials by rail.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
the U.S Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administrator, Office of
the Administrator, and to the Cuyahoga County Local Emergency Planning Committee.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

allowed by law.

An emergency resolution in support of restoring the Ohio Urban
University Program in the Ohio
State budget.
Whereas, the Ohio Urban University Program (UUP) was created by
the Ohio General Assembly and the
Board of Regents in 1979 to link the
resources of Ohio’s urban universities with the revitalization efforts of
its urban communities; and
Whereas, the Urban University
Program is the oldest statewide
inter-university program in the United States and a national model; and
Whereas, the Ohio Urban University Program and the Levin College
of Urban Affairs are the State’s
foremost urban public policy and
economic development resources;
and
Whereas, between 2000 and 2009
the UUP budget was reduced by 37
percent, from $8.2 to $5.2 million;
and
Whereas, the impact of the previous reductions on the Levin College
alone has forced it to cut $1.5 million in operating costs including
more than 20 positions; and
Whereas, now the program has
been removed entirely from the Governor’s budget, putting at risk the
capacity to respond to State needs
that has been built up over the past
30 years; and
Whereas, the research products of
the UUP have addressed nearly
every major economic development
initiative of the State, including
Business Tax Reform, Tax Code
Restructuring,
Program
Development
and
Evaluation,
Economic
Development Strategy, and Land
Reuse and Redevelopment; and

328

March 11, 2009
Whereas, restoring funding will
enable the Levin College and the
seven other urban university research centers across the state –
The University of Akron, the University of Cincinnati, Kent State
University, The Ohio State University, the University of Toledo, Wright
State University, and Youngstown
State University – to maintain the
high level of economic development,
public management and community
development services the State has
come to rely on;
Whereas, the Cleveland State University Board of Trustees and this
Council strongly support funding
the UUP at $3.5 million, a one-third
reduction from its FY 2009 amount,
and eliminating all non-UUP related
line items from the UUP budget line;
and
Whereas, on March 6, 2009, the
Cleveland City Planning Commission voted to express support for
continued full funding for Ohio’s
Urban University Program; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports restoring the Ohio Urban University Program in the Ohio State
Budget.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
Governor Strickland, Ohio General
Assembly, Cleveland State University Board of Trustees, Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs,
and Mayor Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio General Assembly to authorize the Ohio Department of Transportation’s budget request for investments in the Ohio Hub and 3C
Corridor passenger rail to leverage
its application for federal funding
from the $8 billion economic stimulus package for high-speed passenger rail.
Whereas, the 3C Corridor is a passenger rail line connecting Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati and
is part of the larger Ohio Hub plan
to connect 44 of Ohio’s cities to each
other and the rest of the nation; and
Whereas, federal economic stimulus funds are being sought to connect Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton

March 11, 2009
and Cincinnati in a passenger rail
system serving 60% of the state’s
population, and to enhance existing
Amtrak services via new or expanded stations in the Ohio cities of
Toledo, Sandusky, Elyria, Cleveland,
Ravenna and Youngstown; and
Whereas, with 35 other states
developing or implementing statewide passenger rail projects, support for the Ohio Hub is critical for
securing a competitive advantage
for our state; and
Whereas, economic stimulus requests need to be submitted to the
U.S. Department of Transportation
(USDOT) well in advance of April
18th, when the USDOT must report
to Congress its strategic plan for
the use of passenger rail stimulus
funding, and state dollars invested
in the hub will leverage federal
funding; and
Whereas, the proposed 3C Corridor
would create thousands of new construction jobs, permanent operating
jobs and indirect jobs, increase demand for U.S. manufactured concrete and steel materials, and increase transit-oriented development
and tourism; and
Whereas, 80.2% of Ohioans when
polled support state efforts to develop passenger train services in Ohio;
and
Whereas, Ohio’s airports and roadways are congested, the world faces
a dwindling supply of oil, and trains
are among the most energy efficient
way to move people; and
Whereas, as a result of climate
change we need to take every possible step towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions into our endangered atmosphere; and
Whereas, the Ohio Hub invests in
the railroads to achieve public benefits and to generate significant
local economic development activity;
and
Whereas, the 3C Corridor ceased
operation in 1971 and Cleveland
would be greatly enhanced by restoring passenger rail service to
these areas; and
Whereas, the Ohio Hub will increase Cleveland Hopkins Airport
traffic by 5% and create a $0.5 to $1
billion economic benefit; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio General Assembly to authorize the Ohio Department of Transportation’s budget request for investments in the Ohio Hub and 3C
Corridor passenger rail to leverage
its application for federal funding
from the $8 billion economic stimulus package for high-speed passenger rail.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit

An emergency resolution declaring the intent to vacate a portion of
Simms Street N.W. (50 feet wide),
Sanders Court N.W. and turnouts
(width varies) and Kramer Court

Whereas, this Council is satisfied

The City Record
portion of Simms Street N.W. (50
feet wide), Sanders Court N.W. and
turnouts (width varies) and Kramer
Court N.W. (15 feet wide) as described; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council declares its intent to vacate a portion
of the following described real property:
SIMMS STREET N.W.
Being all that portion of Simms
Street N.W. (50 feet wide) extending
from the Southerly right of way line
of Merwin Street N.W. (60 feet wide)
to the Northerly right of way line of
Fall Street N.W. (60 feet wide).

KRAMER COURT N.W.

Southerly to the Northerly right of

Section 2. That this resolution is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the

the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted March 2, 2009.
Effective March 6, 2009.

Res. No. 235-09.
By Council Members Brady, Keane,
Kelley, Sweeney, Cleveland, Polensek, Cimperman, Coats, Pierce Scott,
Westbrook, Mitchell, Dow, Zone,
Brancatelli, Wilkes, Pruitt, Conwell,
Cummins, Johnson and Reed.
An emergency resolution urging
the United States Congress to pass
the Employee Free Choice Act to
protect and preserve for America’s
workers their freedom to choose for
themselves whether or not to form
a union.
Whereas, in 1935, the United States
established, by law, that workers
must be free to form unions; and
Whereas, the freedom to form or
join a union is internationally recognized by the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a fundamental human right; and
Whereas, freedom of choice to join
with others and bargain for better
wages and benefits is essential to
economic opportunity and good living standards; and

347

31
Whereas, unions benefit communities by strengthening living standards, stabilizing tax bases, promoting equal treatment and enhancing civic participation; and
Whereas, states in which more
people are union members have
higher wages, better benefits and
better schools; and
Whereas, unions help raise workers’ pay and narrow the income gap
for
minorities
and
women,
by
increasing median weekly earnings
by 31 percent for women, 36 percent
for African Americans, 46 percent
for Latinos and 8 percent for Asian
Americans; and
Whereas, union workers are more
likely to have health coverage and
guaranteed defined benefit pensions
(80 percent of private-sector union
workers have employer-provided health
insurance, as compared to only 49
percent of nonunion workers, and 68
percent of union workers have
defined-benefit pension plans, as
compared to 14 percent of nonunion
workers); and
Whereas, workers across the nation are routinely denied the freedom to form unions and bargain for
a better life; and
Whereas, 25 percent of private-sector employers illegally fire at least
one worker for union organizing
activity; and
Whereas, 77 percent of the public
believes it is important to have
strong laws protecting the freedom
of workers to make their own decision about having a union, while 60
percent of workers would join a
union if they had the chance; and
Whereas, employers often refuse
to bargain fairly after workers form
a union by dragging out first contract bargaining for up to two years
in 45 percent of successful campaigns; and
Whereas, each year millions of
dollars are spent to thwart workers’
efforts to form unions and 92 percent
of
private-sector
employers
force employees to attend mandatory anti-union meetings; and
Whereas, when the right of workers to form a union is violated,
wages fall, race and gender pay
gaps widen, workplace discrimination increases and job safety standards disappear; and
Whereas, a worker’s fundamental
right to choose a union free from
coercion and intimidation is a public issue that requires public policy
solutions, including legislative remedies; and
Whereas,
the
Employee
Free
Choice Act received majority support in both houses of Congress in
2007 but was defeated by a minority of senators; and
Whereas,
the
Employee
Free
Choice Act will safeguard workers’
ability to make their own decisions
about forming a union, provide for
first contract mediation and arbitration and establish meaningful penalties when employers violate workers’ rights; and
Whereas, this Council supports
the Employee Free Choice Act,
which would authorize the National
Labor Relations Board to certify a
union as the bargaining representative when a majority of employees
voluntarily sign authorization cards
designating that union to represent

32
them; provide for first contract
mediation
and
arbitration;
and
establish meaningful penalties for
violations of a worker’s freedom to
choose a union; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
Congress to pass the Employee Free
Choice Act to protect and preserve
for America’s workers their freedom
to choose for themselves whether or
not to form a union.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to the United States House of Representatives,
the United States Senate, Communications Workers of America, and
Mayor Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted March 2, 2009.
Effective March 6, 2009.

An emergency resolution supporting the Cuyahoga County Board of
Commissioners’
and
MMPI’s
site

March 11, 2009
selection
and
encouraging
quick
movement towards site control and
construction of the new Cleveland
Medical Mart and Convention Center.
Whereas, Greater Cleveland is
home to several nationally recognized hospitals; and
Whereas, the Greater Cleveland
area is home to many medical suppliers and manufacturers; and
Whereas, a Cleveland Medical
Mart and Convention Center would
capitalize on Cleveland’s tremendous healthcare industry and further Cleveland’s position as the
leader in this field; and
Whereas, Merchandise Mart Properties, Inc. (MMPI) is committed to
applying their extensive knowledge
and experience in the trade show
and convention business to the
Cleveland area market; and
Whereas, the Cuyahoga County
Board of Commissioners passed a
quarter of a cent sales tax increase
to collect funds to support the development of a new state-of-the-art
medical mart and convention center;
and
Whereas, MMPI has worked diligently to identify ways in which the
Medical Mart and Convention Center
could be built within the anticipated funds provided by the .25% tax
increase passed in July, 2007; and
Whereas, MMPI engaged a team
of architects, estimators, engineers
and consultants to evaluate all plausible sites; and
Whereas, these exhaustive studies
have concluded that positioning the
new Cleveland Medical Mart and
Convention Center at the site of the
existing convention center is the
most advantageous location for this
premier facility; and
Whereas, this Council welcomes
the addition of this economic engine
to our region; and
Whereas, this Council welcomes
the adaptive reuse of our historic
public auditorium and convention
