An emergency resolution urging
the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority to reconsider eliminating Community Circulators and to
meet with City Council and other community leaders in order to determine
ways to save money without negatively impacting Community Circulator riders and neighborhood routes.
Whereas, last week, the Greater
Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (“RTA”) decided to eliminate all
12 of its Community Circulator bus
routes and raise most fares 25cents
to save approximately $5 million
dollars; and
Whereas, Community Circulators
are an extremely popular mode of
transportation for hundreds of people in Cleveland and the surrounding areas; and
Whereas, thousands of people in
our community depend on Community Circulator buses to get to work,
the grocery store, school, doctor’s
appointments and shopping because
they do not drive; and
Whereas, Community Circulators are
a life-line to many seniors who would
otherwise be stranded in their own
homes without transportation; and
Whereas, most RTA riders would
say they would rather pay increased
fares than see the Community Circulator routes be eliminated; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the
