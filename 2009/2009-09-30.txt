upon which the vehicle stands.
(b) Notwithstanding any provision
of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the
operator of a vehicle being operated
upon a street or highway within

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 1393-09.
By Council Members Sweeney,
Cloud,
Pruitt,
Brancatelli,
Westbrook, Keane and Cummins.
An emergency resolution urging
the U.S. Department of Transportation
and the Federal Rail Administration
to support the State of Ohio’s stimulus funding request for Ohio’s 3C
“Quick Start” Passenger Rail Plan.”
Whereas, Ohio’s 3C “Quick Start”
Passenger Rail Plan — connecting
Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, and
Cincinnati as part of the nationallyprioritized Chicago Hub in Presi-

20
dent Obama’s Vision for High Speed
Rail in America — is a strong contender for federal funding through
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act; and
Whereas, Ohioans are demanding
safer and greener travel choices, as
proven in a March 2009 Quinnipiac
University
statewide
poll
which
showed that 64% of Ohioans want
passenger rail and that among
Ohioans 18-35 years old, 73% support
the 3C “Quick Start” plan; and
Whereas, nearly 6 million Ohioans
live within 15 miles of the 3C Corridor, a federally-designated high
speed rail corridor and one of the
most densely-populated corridors in
the U.S. without passenger rail service; and
Whereas, Ohio’s “Quick Start” plan
would have initial conventionalspeed service running as early as
2011, using the safest, most efficient
and cost-effective route, generating
jobs and economic development, and
putting travel choice in reach of
more than 60% of Ohio’s population;
and
Whereas, Ohio’s 3C “Quick Start”
Service would offer 3-4 trains running daily in each direction, traveling at 79 miles per hour, offering
fares and travel times that are competitive with other forms of transportation along this 250-mile corridor, with times constantly improving as tracks are upgraded and
freight
coordination
issues
are
resolved; and
Whereas, Ohio’s 3C “Quick Start”
Plan builds a foundation for economic competitiveness in some of
our state’s most economically-distressed cities, where these urban
cores represent Ohio’s centers of
commerce, education and research,
all of which can be better connected to a ready and mobile workforce
with passenger rail; and
Whereas, train stations are magnets for real estate development,
with land values around stations
increasing as much as 30%, and
station stops provide place-making
opportunities by creating comfortable, well-connected, and memorable destinations, which leads to
new opportunities for small business growth and vibrant urban
cores that are able to attract and
retain today’s talented professionals; and
Whereas, Ohio’s 3C “Quick Start”
Plan will bring new travel opportunities and promote economic development in cities along the rail line
by creating jobs, promoting regional connectivity, and creating an
infrastructure to help spur greener
and safer transportation options,
including light rail growth and
other connectors, such as green
buses and street cars; and
Whereas, Ohio’s 3C “Quick Start”
Plan will augment Ohio’s existing
passenger rail service along the
Chicago - Toledo - Cleveland - Pittsburgh and Chicago-Cincinnati corridors, which currently carry three
of Amtrak’s long-distance trains
through Ohio but offer limited service, with trains departing and
arriving in the middle of the night;
and
Whereas, the State of Ohio is
working with Amtrak to improve

The City Record
this limited service, which saw
121,019 Ohio riders in 2008, up nearly 10% from the prior year; and
Whereas, Ohio’s 3C “Quick Start”
Plan will leverage new public-private partnership, such as Amtrak’s
annual investment of more than
$12.6 million for goods and services
in Ohio, from more than a dozen
Ohio companies, and Amtrak’s direct
employment of 56 Ohioans with total
annual wages of more than $3.9 million; and
Whereas, in addition to expanded passenger rail-related business
growth,
freight
rail
operations
would
benefit
from
Ohio’s
3C
“Quick Start” Passenger Rail Plan
from increase relief at congested
rail choke points, at a value of
more than $3 to $6 billion in
improved productivity; and
Whereas, Ohioans need greater
travel choices and reliable mobility
options, as evidenced by data in the
U.S. Census showing nearly 8 percent of Ohio households without a
motor vehicle, and 20-25 percent of
households without cars in Cleveland, Dayton and Cincinnati, and
showing that Ohioans age 65 years
and older will account for over 16
percent of the total state population
by the year 2015 and 20 percent by
2030; and
Whereas, a modern transportation
system that includes passenger rail
service enhances the quality of life
for those in its proximity, revitalizes
our cities and boosts the economic
development and growth potential
of a region; and
Whereas, future expansions of Ohio’s
passenger rail service, beyond startup levels, may include establishing
“local” and “express” train service,
opening opportunities for more station stops and increased economic
development potential at locations
across the state; and
Whereas, fourteen other states
with state-sponsored passenger rail
service are already realizing the
dramatic economic development potential and return on investment
from passenger rail, such as the
Downeaster Service which is expected to generate $3.3 billion in
construction investment and create
8,000 new jobs in Maine over the
next two decades; and
Whereas, Ohio’s 3C “Quick Start”
Plan must win federal dollars to go
forward and the ORDC and ODOT
will formally apply on October 2,
2009, for federal stimulus funding of
up to $400 million under the Recovery Act (ARRA) to invest in infrastructure improvements, station development and operating train sets
to initiate service along the 3C Corridor; therefore,
Whereas, this Council believes
that a modern transportation system
that includes passenger rail service
will enhance the quality of life for
those in its proximity, revitalize our
cities and boost the economic development and growth potential of a
region; and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
that Ohio and the Nation are faced
with an array of urgent economic,
environmental, and mobility challenges that require bold, effective
action to be taken to implement
strategic and essential investment

1836

September 30, 2009
in our rail transportation system;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Federal Rail Administration to support the State of Ohio’s
stimulus funding request for Ohio’s
3C “Quick Start” Passenger Rail
Plan.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal
Rail Administration and Ohio Governor Ted Strickland.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted September 21, 2009.
Effective September 25, 2009.

Res. No. 1394-09.
By
Council
Members
Mitchell,
Keane, Reed, Sweeney, Westbrook,
Kelley, Brady, Conwell, Pruitt, Santiago, Cleveland and Cummins.
An emergency resolution supporting the Declaration to the Right to
Literacy, and urging Mayor Jackson
to sign the declaration when Literacy Powerline sends it to Cleveland.
Whereas, Right to Literacy Convention delegates from across the
country determined and voted on the
first United States Declaration for
the Right to Literacy at the Right
to Literacy Conference in Buffalo,
New York on June 13, 2009; and
Whereas, the Declaration for the
Right to Literacy proclaims that all
Americans have a right to literacy
and calls on communities and leaders in all sectors to work together
to expand literacy in the United
States so that all citizens can participate fully and equitably in our
democracy; and
Whereas, the Declaration supports
five pillars of literacy: Building the
Community, Strengthening the Family, Ensuring People’s Self-Determination, Improving the Workforce,
and Transforming the Literacy System; and
Whereas, Literacy Powerline, the
organization that organized the conference, believes that tens of millions of adults and children do not
have the skills needed to succeed in
life, and literacy is the number one
tool to change that plight, and thus
must be a national priority; and
Whereas, Literacy Powerline hopes
to gain signatures from public figures, leaders and mayors as it sends
the Declaration “on the road” around
the country from Texas to Arkansas
and on to New York and Indiana
this Fall; and

September 30, 2009
Whereas,
Literacy
Powerline
urges every mayor to sign the Declaration, and to include basic education,
workforce
literacy
and
vocational English as a Second
Language in all appropriate applications requesting funding under
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) to meet the
needs of job seekers and incumbent
workers who read below an eighth
grade reading level; and
Whereas, Literacy Powerline calls
on cities to pay extra attention to
citizens reading below an eighth
grade level as more than 90 million
people in the United States have limited literacy skills, a fact that, if not
properly addressed, will limit cities’
efforts to improve workforce performance and economic development;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the Declaration to the Right
to Literacy, and urges Mayor Jackson to sign the declaration when Literacy Powerline sends it to Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Clerk of
Council is directed to send copies
of this resolution to Literacy Powerline founder Margaret Doughty and
Mayor Frank G. Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

An emergency resolution supporting the United Nations International Day of Peace (Peace Day) on

of global ceasefire and non-violence.
Whereas, in 2001 the member
states of the United Nations (UN)
unanimously adopted General Assembly 55/282 that established the
United Nations International Day of
Peace (Peace Day)

21st every year is not only about
creating peace between nations, but
about non-violence in our homes,
communities, and schools, and is
therefore relevant to every human
being on the planet; and
Whereas, as we support Peace
Day in 2009, we recognize that the
next major objective is to introduce
3 billion people to Peace Day by

Whereas, the attainment of global
peace as promoted by Peace Day
will greatly benefit the people of
Cleveland and all citizens of the
world; and
Whereas, Peace One Day is the
non-profit organization founded by
filmmaker Jeremy Gilley that envisioned and helped establish Peace
Day; and
Whereas, the mission of Peace
One Day is to engage all sectors of
society, including governments, organizations of the United Nations system,
regional and non-governmental organizations and individuals to observe
September 21st through the practical
manifestation of non-violence and
ceasefire in accordance with UN
General Assembly 55/282, and encourage action on Peace Day that
creates a united and sustainable
world; and
Whereas, by 2007, the UN estimated that over 100 million people from
all walks of life actively supported
Peace Day around the world; and
Whereas, on Peace Day in 2007

three million children in Afghanistan alone were treated with polio
vaccinations; and
