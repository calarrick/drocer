SECTION 5: IDENTIFICATION OF
RED FLAGS
A: Covered accounts
A covered account includes any
account that involves or is designed
to permit multiple payments or
transactions. Every new and existing customer account that meets the
following criteria is covered by this
program:
1. Business, personal and household accounts for which there are a

2. Business, a personal and household account for which there is a
reasonably foreseeable risk to the
safety or soundness of the City of
Cleveland from identity theft, including financial, operational, compliance,
reputation,
or
litigation
risks.
B: Red flags
1: The following red flags are
potential indicators of fraud. Any
time a red flag, or a situation closely resembling a red flag, is apparent, it should be investigated for
verification. The appropriate response
depends on the particular red flag
and the level of perceived risk.
a. Alerts, notifications or warnings from a consumer reporting
agency;

included with a consumer report;
c. A notice of credit freeze from a

altered or forged.
2: The photograph or physical
description on the identification is
not consistent with the appearance
of the applicant or customer presenting the identification.
3: Other information on the identification is not consistent with
information provided by the person
opening a new covered account or
with the customer presenting the
identification.
4: Other information on the identification is not consistent with
readily accessible information that
is on file with the municipality,
such as a signature card or a recent
check.
5: An application appears to have
been altered or forged, or gives the
appearance of having been destroyed and reassembled.

b. The Social Security number
(SSN) has not been issued or is listed on the Social Security Administration’s Death Master File; or

social security number range and
date of birth.

sources used by the City of Cleveland. For example, the address on

34

opening the covered account fails to
provide all required personal identifying information on an application
or in response to notification that
the application is incomplete.
7: Personal identifying information provided is not consistent with
personal
identifying
information
that is on file with the municipality.
8: When answering security questions (mother’s maiden name, pet’s
name, etc.), the customer, or the person opening the covered account
cannot provide authenticating information beyond that which generally
would be available from a wallet or
consumer report.
E: Unusual use of, or suspicious
activity related to, the covered
account
1: Shortly following the notice of
a change of address for a covered
account,
the
City
of
Cleveland
receives a request for new, additional, or replacement goods or services, or for the addition of authorized users on the account.
2: A new revolving credit account
is used in a manner commonly associated with known patterns of fraud
patterns. For example, the customer
fails to make the first payment or
makes an initial payment but no
subsequent payments
3: A covered account is used in a
manner that is not consistent with
established patterns of activity on
the account. There is, for example:
a. Nonpayment when there is no
history of late or missed payments;
b. A material change in purchasing or usage patterns
4: A covered account that has
been
inactive
for
a
reasonably
lengthy period of time is used (taking into consideration the type of
