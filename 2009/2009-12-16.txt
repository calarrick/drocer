necessary modification of the Division’s facilities; and payment of the

distribution system.
The Division may limit interconnected distributed generation to 15%
of the peak load of the line or line
segment, or such other limit as the
Division deems appropriate for reliability purposes.
(d) Standby power charge. Distributed generation installations of
any kind totaling 10 kilowatts or
less at a single premise shall not be
subject to standby power charges.
There shall be no standby power
charge for wind or solar distributed generation of any size. All

by the rated capacity of the distributed generation.
(e) Liability. The City shall not
be liable directly or indirectly for
permitting or allowing the connection of customer’s distributed generation to the Division’s distribution
system or for the acts or omissions
of the customer generator that cause
property damage, loss, injury, or

resources.
(2) “Net energy” is the difference,
positive or negative, between the
amount of electricity supplied by
the Division to the customer through
the Division’s electric distribution
system and the amount of electricity generated by the customer’s distributed generation which is fed
back into the Division’s electric distribution system.
(3) “Net metering” is a method of
measuring the difference, positive or
negative,
between
the
kilowatt

hours of electricity supplied by the
Division to the customer through the
Division’s electric distribution system and the kilowatt hours of electricity generated by the customer’s
distributed generation which is fed
back into the Division’s electric distribution system.

used in accordance with the following rules:
(1) For electricity supplied by the
Division to the customer in excess
of the electricity generated by the
customer during any billing period,
the customer shall pay the rates and
charges under the applicable rate
schedule.
(2) The customer shall receive a
credit in kilowatt hours for electricity generated by the customer in
excess of the kilowatt hours of electricity supplied by the Division during any billing period. Such credit

offset the customer’s consumption
during subsequent months until termination of customer’s service.
(3) If a customer terminates service, any remaining credit balance
in favor of the customer shall be
zeroed out with no liability to the
Division.
Participating customers shall be
subject to all other charges, rates,

An emergency ordinance to approve the form and authorize the
execution of power sales contracts
with American Municipal Power,
Inc. and taking other actions in connection therewith regarding Meldahl
and Greenup Hydroelectric Project
participation.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
Ohio
(“Municipality”)
owns
and
operates an electric utility system
for the sale of electric power and
associated energy for the benefit of
its citizens and taxpayers; and
Whereas, in order to satisfy the
electric power and energy requirements of its electric utility system,
Municipality has heretofore purchased, or desires to purchase in the
future,
economical
and
reliable
power and energy from, or arranged
by, American Municipal Power, Inc.
(“AMP”), of which Municipality is a
member; and
Whereas, AMP is an Ohio nonprofit corporation, organized to own
and operate facilities, or to provide
otherwise, for the generation, transmission or distribution of electric
power and energy, or any combination thereof, and to furnish technical services on a cooperative, nonprofit basis, for the mutual benefit
of AMP members (“Members”), such
Members, including Municipality,
being, as of the date hereof, political subdivisions that operate municipal electric utility systems in Ohio,
Kentucky, Michigan, Pennsylvania,
Virginia and West Virginia; and
Whereas, Municipality, acting individually and through AMP with
other political subdivisions of this
and other states that own and operate electric utility systems, jointly,
endeavors to arrange for reliable,
reasonably priced supplies of electric power and energy for ultimate
delivery to its customers; and
Whereas, it is efficient and economical to act jointly in such regard; and
Whereas, certain Members, including the Municipality (“Participants”),
have determined they require additional, very long-term sources of
reliable and environmentally sound
base load electric power and energy
at reasonable costs and have requested that AMP arrange for the
same by developing or otherwise
acquiring interests in certain hydroelectric facilities located at locks
and dams along the Ohio River; and
Whereas, in furtherance of this
purpose, AMP and the City of Hamilton (“Hamilton”) have entered into
agreements under the terms of
which (i) AMP is to own, finance
and construct and Hamilton is to
operate the Meldahl Hydroelectric
Project, FERC License No. 12667
(“Meldahl Project”), projected to
have a net rated electric generating
capacity
of
one
hundred
five
megawatts (105 MW); and (ii) AMP
has agreed to purchase from Hamilton, contingent on the Meldahl Project being declared in Commercial
Operation, a forty-eight and six-

tenths percent (48.6%) undivided
ownership interest in the currently
operating
Greenup

with a net rated electric generating
capacity of seventy and two-tenths
megawatts (70.2 MW) (the “Greenup Project” and, collectively with
the Meldahl Project, the “Hydroelectric Projects”); and
Whereas, because AMP’s acquisition of an ownership interest in the
Greenup Project is contingent upon
the Meldahl Project being declared
in Commercial Operation, AMP has
determined to make available the
Hydroelectric Projects as a package
such that each Participant will participate in both the Meldahl Project
and Greenup Project, although the
Participant will execute separate
power sales contracts for each project (individually the “Greenup PSC”
and “Meldahl PSC” and, collectively,
“Project PSCs”); and
Whereas, Members now have the
right, but not the obligation, by the
enactment of this ordinance (i) to
authorize and request AMP to own,
finance, construct and provide for
the operation of the Meldahl Project
(ii) to authorize and request AMP
to purchase an undivided ownership
interest in the Greenup Project from
Hamilton and to own, finance and
provide for the operation of the
Greenup Project, and (iii) to execute the Project PSCs authorized
below; and
Whereas, prior to the passage of
this ordinance, AMP has (i) informed the Municipality regarding
the Meldahl developmental process
and efforts undertaken by AMP to
further its interests in the Hydroelectric Projects; (ii) provided the
Municipality with a Feasibility Report regarding the Hydroelectric
Projects; and (iii) afforded representatives of the Municipality the
opportunity to ask such questions,
review such data and reports, conduct such inspections and otherwise
perform such investigations with
respect to, as applicable, the planning, engineering, acquisition, construction and operation of the Hydroelectric Projects and the terms
and conditions of the Project PSCs
authorized below as the Municipality deems necessary or appropriate
in connection herewith; and
Whereas, after consideration of
the potential risks and benefits of
participating in Hydroelectric Projects and the respective Project
PSCs authorized below, the Municipality has determined it is reasonable and in its best interests to proceed as authorized herein and hereby requests and authorizes AMP (i)
to own, finance, construct and provide for the operation of the Meldahl
Project, on behalf of the Municipality and the other Participants in
accordance with the Meldahl PSC
authorized below and in conjunction
with similar authorizations by other
AMP Members, as Participants and
(ii) to purchase from Hamilton a
48.6% undivided ownership interest
in the Greenup Project, the closing
of such purchase being contingent

to be paid to the City (“RZEDB

of applications for that purpose. The
cost of obtaining each such rating,
except to the extent paid by the
Original Purchasers in accordance
with the Bond Purchase Agreement,
shall be paid from the proceeds of
the Bonds to the extent available
and then from other money made
available by the Port Authority.

applicable redemption price, which
shall be not greater than 102% of
the principal amount redeemed, except that in the event of a RZEDB
Redemption or a redemption due to
a failure to timely close the purchase of the Property the premium
may be up to an amount agreed to
by the Director of Finance that is
calculated to make the bond holders
fully whole for such prepayment;
(c) the title and series designation for the Bonds;
(d) whether any Bonds are to be
secured by or payable from a Credit Support Instrument.
It is determined that the terms of
