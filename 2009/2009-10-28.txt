An emergency resolution celebrating National Pro Bono Week, proclaiming October 24 – 31, 2009 to be
Pro Bono Week in the City of Cleveland, and urging all residents to recognize the contributions of our legal
community to help those most in
need.
Whereas, thousands of Northeastern Ohioans lack access to legal
assistance that is often critical to
their safety and independence, forcing them to resolve complex legal
problems on their own, including
domestic violence, divorce, child custody, evictions, mortgage foreclosures and the physical and financial
abuse of the elderly; and
Whereas, despite the recent economic crisis, The Legal Aid Society
of Cleveland did not cut programs,
client services or staff; and
Whereas,
Legal
Aid
increased
capacity to represent disadvantaged
citizens, and in response to the
recession put more resources into
representing homeowners in foreclosure and those who need bankruptcy for a fresh start; and
Whereas, Legal Aid continues to
aid in building strong communities
by securing safety for domestic violence victims, retaining decent and
affordable housing for clients, and
increasing access to health care; and
Whereas, Legal Aid’s Volunteer
Lawyers Program, Brief Advice and
Referral Clinics and numerous other
programs provide easily accessible
legal advice and assistance to meet
a growing demand for free legal services; and
Whereas, the 55 staff attorneys
and more than 1400 volunteer attorneys in Northeastern Ohio donate
substantial hours to provide free
legal services to those in need; and
Whereas, despite thousands of
supporters’ generous financial contributions to legal aid organizations
in Northeastern Ohio, a huge unmet
need for legal assistance remains
for our disadvantaged citizens; and
Whereas, the National Pro Bono
Celebration is being observed across
the country during the week of October 24-31, 2009, to recognize the valuable work lawyers do throughout
the year, without fee, to represent
those who cannot afford civil legal
assistance;
Whereas, the Pro Bono Week celebration in Cleveland includes many
free legal advice clinics and legal
workshops at all Legal Aid’s offices,
and aims to raise awareness of the
need for available legal assistance
for all Northeastern Ohioans; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,

1978

October 28, 2009

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
____________
Res. No. 1517-09.
By Council Members Miller, Kelley, Mitchell, Cimperman, Sweeney,
Dow, Cloud, Westbrook, Brady, Zone,
Reed, Cleveland, Brancatelli, Santiago, Polensek and Cummins.
An emergency resolution in support of S.B. 172 and H.B. 305 which
re-instate the waiver of the application and test fees for the GED test
for certain applicants.
Whereas, the GED is a test of general educational development required for issuance of a high school
equivalence diploma by the State
Board of Education; and
Whereas, obtaining a GED can be
the first step onto the road to becoming a productive, civically engaged citizen; and
Whereas, SB 172 and HB 305 provide that certain applicants may
have the GED application and test
fees waived; and
Whereas, as taxpayers, we will
pay now by re-instating the waiver through SB 172 and HB 305 thus
giving people the opportunity to
get their GED, where they might
not have been financially able to
take the GED; or pay later by footing the bill for antisocial and criminal behavior by those who couldn’t find jobs because they were
financially unable to take the GED;
and
Whereas, more than 18,000 people
will be negatively affected if the
waiver is removed; and
Whereas, SB 172 and HB 305 promote the importance of education
and waiving the fees will promote
a more educated workforce, making it more likely that people will
seek and obtain gainful employment; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the

Res. No. 1518-09.
By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency resolution withdrawing objection to the transfer of
liquor license of a D5 Liquor Permit
at 724 and 728 Prospect Avenue and
repealing Resolution No. 1281-09,
objecting to said transfer.
Whereas, this Council objected to
the transfer of liquor license of a D5
Liquor Permit to PDPL Hospitality
Group, LLC, DBA R J Bolands Martini Suite, 724 & 728 Prospect Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44115, Permanent No. 6620327, adopted by the
Council on September 14, 2009; and
Whereas, this Council wishes to
withdraw its objection to the above
transfer and consents to said transfer; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That objection to a D5
Liquor Permit to PDPL Hospitality
Group, LLC, DBA R J Bolands Martini Suite, 724 & 728 Prospect Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44115, Permanent No. 6620327 be and the same is
hereby withdrawn and Resolution
No. 1281-09, containing such objection, be and the same is hereby
repealed and that this Council consents to the immediate transfer
thereof.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

Whereas, this Council objected to

Mart, Inc., 11334 Miles Avenue,
Cleveland, Ohio 44105, Permanent
No. 5951324, by Resolution No. 110609 adopted by the Council on August
5, 2009; and
Whereas, this Council wishes to
withdraw its objection to the above
transfer and consents to said transfer; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That objection to a C2
and C2X Liquor Permit to Miles Mini
Mart, Inc., 11334 Miles Avenue,
Cleveland, Ohio 44105, Permanent

By Council Members Cimperman,

Brady,
Mitchell,
Sweeney,
Dow,
Cloud, Zone, Polensek, Santiago and
Cummins.
An emergency resolution urging
voters to vote ‘NO” on Ohio Issue 2
which would change the Ohio Constitution to establish an appointed
“Livestock Care Standards Board”.
Whereas, if passed, Ohio Issue 2
would make permanent in the Ohio
Constitution
the
Livestock
Care
Standards Board (the “Board”) with
unchecked power to develop guidelines for raising livestock and with
the potential to reshape regulations
on how animals in Ohio are raised,
tracked or traced; and
Whereas, this 13 member Board of
political appointees would have farreaching and unchecked authority
to establish standards governing the
care and well-being of livestock and
poultry in Ohio; and
Whereas, the Board established
under Ohio Issue 2, would have the
power to override any act by the
Ohio Department of Agriculture or
the state legislature, or any other
initiative or referendum brought
before the Ohio public other than a
constitutional amendment; and

24
Whereas, this Board would have
the power to create all policies in
Ohio related to animals in agriculture, affecting not just welfare concerns but also a wide variety of animal-related issues including the regulation of organic meat production,
animal identification and concentrated
animal feeding operations (“factory
farms”); and
Whereas, it is generally recognized that the Board will most likely be comprised of people with corporate agri-business and factory
farming interests, at the expense of
family farmers; and
Whereas, the Board could potentially implement standards that would
make raising food in an organic or
sustainable manner excessively expensive or burdensome, driving small
farmers out of business and hurting
local economies; and
Whereas, the US Department of
Agriculture states that 98% of all
farms in the US are technically
family farms, however, Ohio has
nearly 200 factory farms — which
number would increase if an industry-led board decides to ease regulations on animal production; and
Whereas,
voters
should
reject
Ohio Issue 2 because it would create a permanent place for special
interests in the Ohio Constitution,
with no formal process for public
input, review, evaluation or appeal
of decisions made related to animal
agriculture in Ohio; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges voters to vote ‘NO” on Ohio
Issue 2 which would change the
Ohio Constitution to establish an
appointed “Livestock Care Standards
Board”.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Res. No. 1521-09.
By Council Member Zone.
An emergency resolution objecting to the transfer of ownership of
a C1 Liquor Permit to 5009 Detroit
Avenue.
Whereas, Council has been notified
by the Department of Liquor Control
of an application for the transfer of
ownership of a C1 Liquor Permit
from 5015 Detroit Avenue, Inc., DBA
Amy Food Market, 5009 Detroit
Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44102, Permanent Number 65493340001 to Detroit Beverage, Inc., DBA Detroit Beverage, 5009 Detroit Avenue, Cleveland,
Ohio
44102,
Permanent
Number
21013480005; and

The City Record
Whereas, the granting of this application for a liquor permit to this
high crime area, which is already
saturated with other liquor outlets,
is contrary to the best interests of
the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to
Section 4303.26 of the Ohio Revised
Code. Council’s objection to said
permit must be received by the
Director of Liquor Control within
30 days of notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby
record its objection to the transfer
of ownership of a C1 Liquor Permit
from 5015 Detroit Avenue, Inc., DBA
Amy
Food
Market,
5009
Detroit
Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44102, Permanent Number 65493340001 to Detroit Beverage, Inc., DBA Detroit

Number 21013480005; and requests
the Director of Liquor Control to
set a hearing for said application
in accordance with provisions of
Section 4303.26 of the Revised Code
of Ohio.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she is hereby directed to
transmit two certified copies of this
resolution, together with two copies
of a letter of objection and two
copies of a letter requesting that the
hearing be held in Cleveland, Cuyahoga County.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
