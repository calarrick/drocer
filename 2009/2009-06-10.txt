tax records, (2) a sampling of the
operator’s business activity for a
representative period, (3) previous
tax remittance returns submitted by
the operator, and/or (4) other information relating to the business
activity of such operator. The net
receipts for the representative period will be projected for all periods
under review.

requirement shall be met if the turbine is placed so that no portion of
a rotor blade extends closer than

proximity to Residential District
lines, a wind turbine, including a
wind turbine located in a Residential District, shall be set back from
Residential District lines of adjoining or nearby properties a minimum
distance equal to two (2) times the
height of the wind turbine. In the

rooftop or other building-mounted
wind turbine that exceeds the maximum permitted building height by

An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Senate to reinstate the necessary funding to the Closing the
Achievement Gap initiative and supporting the Governor in his effort to
restore those funds.
Whereas, the Governor’s Initiative
for Closing the Achievement Gap
focuses on the promotion of at risk
ninth grade male students to the
tenth grade; and
Whereas, the Closing the Achievement Gap initiative endeavors to
reach young men early in their high
school careers in order to “socially
construct hope” by providing mentors, personal attention for academic learning, social service intervention to improve attitudes and behavior, family support, modified instruction by teachers to reflect innovative learning and exposure to experiences that will expand the horizons and expectations of these students; and
Whereas, the Closing the Achievement Gap initiative has reached
hundreds of young men across the
state, including in 13 area high
schools, and has empowered parents
and educators to help these young
men achieve success and graduate
from high school; and
Whereas, it has come to the
attention of this Council that the
Ohio Senate Finance Committee
deleted funding for the Governor’s
Initiative for Closing the Achievement Gap in its recent budget
amendment; and
Whereas, this initiative has made
great strides in keeping young men
in school and helping ensure they
matriculate to the 10th grade; and
Whereas, statistics show that boys
who reach 10th grade on solid footing typically graduate from high
school; and

The City Record
Whereas, it would be destructive
to the lives of these young men and
their families to eliminate the funding for this vital program; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the Ohio Senate to reinstate the necessary funding to the
Closing the Achievement Gap initiative and supports the Governor in
his effort to restore those funds.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Governor
Ted Strickland, C. J. Prentiss, Special Representative to the Governor
for the Closing the Achievement
Gap initiative, all members of the
Senate Finance Committee and all
members of the State of Ohio Senate
representing residents of the City of
Cleveland.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

shall take effect and be in force

Res. No. 823-09.
By Council Member Keane.
An emergency resolution respectfully requesting the Catholic Diocese of Cleveland, and Bishop Richard Lennon to reconsider the decision to close St. Patrick, West Park
and to implement the recommendations as outlined in the final cluster
proposal.
Whereas, St. Patrick, West Park
was the dream of some 40 families
of Rockport Township in the year
1847. The hard work and tireless
commitment of these Irish and German immigrants persuaded Bishop
Rappe to hold the first Sunday services on 17 March 1848. This date is
even more significant considering it
was less than one year after the formation of the Catholic Diocese of
Cleveland and was the first church
that the first Bishop of the Diocese
started; and
Whereas,
Saint
Patrick,
West
Park has provided the Catholic roots
and
foundation
to
support
15
“daughter parishes” throughout the
west side of Cleveland. Spreading
from St. Patrick’s came St. Angela
Merici, St. Christopher, St. James,
Our Lady of Angels, and St. Mark to
name a few. St. Patrick, West Park
has also nurtured and developed 19
“Ordained Sons of St. Patrick” many
of whom remain in the Diocese; and
Whereas, The St. Patrick, West
Park Parish Cemetery is the final
resting place of several of the original families and builders of this
beautiful institution. Beginning in

1056

June 10, 2009
1861 with the burial of Elizabeth
Adams and Daniel Doyle, the cemetery
has
remained
sacred
and
respected primarily due to its location in the shadows of Saint Patrick’s Church; and
Whereas,
West
Park
Catholic
Academy (WPCA) is historically
completing it’s first school year.
WPCA was formed by the merger of
St. Patrick and Ascension Schools on
the campus of St. Patrick, West
Park. Hundreds of families and
nearly 400 students had the commitment and bravery to make this
difficult transition and make the
first school year a success; and
Whereas, The Saint Patrick, West
Park Hunger Center has been providing those in need, beyond parish
boundaries, with food and sustenance for over 30 years. This program is run completely on a volunteer basis from those committed
parishioners who care as much for
others as themselves. What began
as a holiday food pantry has expanded to provide thousands of families over the years with necessary
and otherwise unattainable social
services; and
Whereas,
Saint
Patrick,
West
Park has served as the Catholic
base on the west side of Cleveland
for over 160 years. The history and
significance of this prestigious institution have and continue to deeply
impact our community, our city and
our region; and
Whereas, the cluster planning
and coordination team worked tirelessly at reaching a recommendation which was acceptable to a
majority of those participants. Originally, the cluster team recommended to Bishop Lennon that St.
Patrick and Our Lady of Angels
remain, while Ascension and Annunciation
merge.
The
Vibrant
Parish
Lifes
initiative
was
designed to strengthen the presence
and pastoral care of the Catholic
Church across the entire Diocese.
The participants appreciated this
directive and proudly served, despite much difficulty, to reach consensus and propose exactly what
they felt would accomplish this
goal; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
respectfully requests the Catholic
Diocese of Cleveland, and Bishop
Richard Lennon to reconsider the
decision to close St. Patrick, West
Park and to implement the recommendations as outlined in the final
cluster proposal.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to Bishop Richard
Lennon, Catholic Diocese of Cleveland
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force

June 10, 2009
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
