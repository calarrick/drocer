ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 861-09.
By Council Members Brady, Cimperman and Sweeney (by request).
An emergency resolution declaring the intent to vacate a portion of
East 73rd Place (width varies) and
a portion of Klonowski Avenue S.E.
(40 feet wide).
Whereas, this Council is satisfied
that there is good cause to vacate a
portion of East 73rd Place (width
varies) and a portion of Klonowski
Avenue S.E. (40 feet wide), as
described; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,

July 15, 2009
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council declares its intent to vacate a portion
of the following described real property: Situated in the City of Cleveland, County of Cuyahoga and State
of Ohio and known as being part of
original Newburgh Heights Township lot number 319,
East 73rd Place
Being all that portion of East 73rd
Place
(width
varies)
extending
southerly and southwesterly from
the southerly right of way line of
Aetna Road S.E. (40 feet wide) to
its most southwesterly terminus.
Klonowski Avenue S.E.
Being all that portion of Klonowski Avenue S.E. (40 feet wide) extending westerly from the westerly

Legal Description approved by
Greg Esber, Section Chief, Plats,

Section 2. That this resolution is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the

Res. No. 927-09.
By Council Members Cimperman,
Pruitt, Cleveland, Mitchell, Dow, Cloud,
Miller, Polensek, Cummins, Zone, Westbrook, Keane, Brancatelli, Brady,
Wilkes, Sweeney and Reed.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio General Assembly to reject
Governor Strickland’s proposed budget cuts of state funding to Ohio’s
public libraries.
Whereas, Ohio’s public libraries
provide vital services to Ohio citizens, including career counseling,
computer training, Internet access,
financial literacy and health information, in addition to the provision of traditional library services;
and,
Whereas, Ohio’s libraries are experiencing
record-breaking
usage
among families and individuals who
are struggling with the effects of
the economic downturn; and,
Whereas, Ohio public libraries
have already seen state revenue
decline by 20 percent since the
beginning of 2009; and,
Whereas, the budget cuts announced last week by Governor
Strickland include an additional
$200 million reduction in the Public
Library Fund over the next biennium; and,
Whereas, the combination of the
latest announced cuts and the cuts
already in place will result in a 50
percent reduction in state funding
for Ohio’s public libraries; and,
Whereas, these cuts would have
devastating consequences to our

The City Record
communities if local libraries are
forced to close branches and cut services; and,
Whereas, Ohio’s public libraries
consistently rank among the best
libraries in the nation; and,
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio General Assembly to reject
Governor Strickland’s proposed budget cuts of state funding to Ohio’s
public libraries.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
the Ohio General Assembly, Governor Strickland, and Mayor Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is

all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

tax records, (2) a sampling of the

and
Whereas, under the Trust Agreement, Additional Certificates (as

July 15, 2009
Certificates and corresponding Base
Rent payments and to authorize

interest rates or to minimize risks
of increased interest expense on, or
risks, burdens, or other costs associated with, hedging arrangements
or credit support instruments relating to Certificates bearing interest
at variable rates and corresponding
Base Rent payments, as provided in
this Ordinance; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the refinancing of securities of the City and providing for
the immediate preservation of the
public peace, property, health or
safety in that authorizing the refunding and restructuring of the
outstanding Certificates and related credit support, hedging arrangements and other agreements is necessary
to
enable
the
City
to
respond to market conditions on a
timely basis to obtain debt service
savings or to stabilize interest
rates or to minimize risks of
increased
interest
expense
or
increased risks, burdens, or other
costs
associated
with
hedging

Section 2. Determinations by Council. This Council finds and determines as follows:

1401

39
(a) Public Purpose. The acquisition, financing and refinancing by
the City of the Cleveland Stadium
pursuant to the Ground Lease, the
Facility Lease and the Trust Agreement and the use of the Cleveland
Stadium as a source of public relaxation and entertainment served
and serves a proper public municipal purpose.
(b) Supplemental Ground Lease,
Supplemental Lease, Supplemental
Trust Agreement and Refunding
Certificates. It is necessary, proper
and in the best interest of the City
to authorize one or more Supplemental Ground Leases, Supplemental Leases and Purchase Agreements and approve one or more Supplemental Trust Agreements and the
issuance of Refunding Certificates
in one or more series for the purpose of refunding (i) one or more
series of the Outstanding Certificates or designated maturities (or
portions of maturities) thereof, to
obtain aggregate net present value
savings in Certificate Payments and
corresponding Base Rent payments
of not less than three percent (3%),
or (ii) one or more series of Outstanding Certificates, or designated
maturities (or portions of maturities) thereof, that are short-term or
variable-rate obligations and that
the Director of Finance has determined, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, are subjecting the City to Base Rent payments
the interest components of which
include undesirably high rates of
interest or undesirable fluctuations
in rates of interest, or are the subject of hedging arrangements or
credit support instruments that are
subjecting the City to increased
risks, burdens, or costs, and that
those effects can economically be
avoided or mitigated through refinancing.
Separate series of Refunding Certificates may be issued at the same
or
different
times.
A
Purchase
Agreement, Supplemental Lease and
Supplemental Trust Agreement shall
be delivered for each series and may
be delivered for multiple series. A
Supplemental Ground Lease shall be
delivered for any series of Refunding Certificates with a final maturity later than the final maturity of
the then Outstanding Certificates.
This Council finds and determines
that the issuance of the Refunding
Certificates and signing and delivery
of Supplemental Ground Leases, Supplemental
Leases
and
Purchase
Agreements and approval of Supplemental Trust Agreements in connection with such issuance for the
purpose provided in this Ordinance
serves a proper, public, municipal
purpose by reducing or stabilizing
or minimizing risks of increasing
the costs to the City of the leasepurchase of the Cleveland Stadium
which is a source of public relaxation and entertainment for the people of the City of Cleveland.
(c) Leased Premises. The Council
of the City found and determined at
the time of the authorization of the
Existing Facility Lease and approval of the Existing Trust Agreement and the Outstanding Certificates, and hereby reaffirms, that the

40
Leased Premises are essential to the
proper, efficient and economic operation of the City.
Section 3. Hedging Arrangements.
This Council finds that by engaging
in interest rate hedging arrangements with respect to the Facility
Lease and Certificates the City may
reduce its financing costs by optimizing the relative amounts of fixed
and variable rate obligations, or
minimizing the risk of variations in
its financing costs or minimizing
any risks, burdens, or costs associated with existing hedging arrangements, or obtaining savings by confirming rates of interest on Certificates in advance of their issuance.
To permit the City to have the flexibility to undertake with respect to
the Facility Lease and Certificates
interest rate swap, swaption, rate
cap, rate collar and other hedging
transactions, from time to time, and
to establish the procedures for approving
those
transactions,
this
Council authorizes the signing and
delivery of one or more instruments,
including amendments or supplements to or replacement of, through
assignment, transfer or novation,
the Existing Hedge Agreement or
other
then
existing
instruments
(each, a “Hedge Agreement”), and
any related agreements necessary
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by each Hedge
Agreement. Those instruments may
be in the form of a master agreement of the International Swaps and
Derivatives Association, Inc., as supplemented and amended by a confirmation, schedule and credit support annex, as further amended to
conform to laws applicable to the
City and to contain terms recommended by a Financial Advisor as
in the City’s best interests, and as
approved by the Director of Law.
Those instruments may vary from
the terms of any existing Hedge
Agreements. The authorizations in
this Section are supplemental to and
not in derogation of any authority
provided by any other ordinance of
this Council concerning hedging
arrangements.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be subject
to appropriation and certification as
provided in the Facility Lease.
Those payments may be secured by
the Facility Lease, to the extent permitted by the Trust Agreement, all
as determined by the Director of
Finance and set forth in the Hedge
Agreement. The obligation of the
City to make payments under any
Hedge Agreement does not and
shall not represent or constitute a
general obligation, debt, bonded
indebtedness or a pledge of the faith
and credit of the City or the State
of Ohio. Nothing gives any party to
any Hedge Agreement the right to
have excises, ad valorem or other
taxes levied by the City or the State
of Ohio for the payment of any
amounts due under any Hedge
Agreement.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is to the financial advantage of the City and in the City’s
best interests that a hedging ar-

The City Record
rangement be undertaken by the
City with respect to the Facility
Lease or any Outstanding Certificates, the Director of Finance may
authorize one or more interest rate
hedge transactions in accordance
with the applicable Hedge Agreement; provided that (a) the counterparty shall be rated at the time
of signing the Hedge Agreement not
lower than A or its equivalent by at
least one rating agency or its obligations under the Hedge Agreement
shall be guaranteed or insured by
an entity rated at the time of signing the Hedge Agreement not lower
than A or its equivalent by at least
one rating agency, and (b) the term
of each hedge transaction shall not
exceed the final maturity of the Certificates to which the hedge relates.
The Director of Finance shall
negotiate the terms of each Hedge
Agreement with a counterparty satisfying the credit criteria in this
Ordinance. The City shall receive a
written opinion of a Financial Advisor that the payments made or to be
made by the counterparty to the City,
or by the City to the counterparty,
shall be fair value for the Hedge
Agreement, considering, among other
things, the credit of the counterparty and the terms and conditions of
the Hedge Agreement. The Director
of Finance shall determine the
terms and conditions of the Hedge
Agreement, including without limitation, the rates to be paid by the
counterparty to the City and by the
City to the counterparty under the
Hedge Agreement, the time or times
and procedures for the exercise by
the counterparty or the City, as the
case may be, of any option under
the Hedge Agreement, and whether
the obligations of the City under the
Hedge Agreement shall be secured
by a Credit Support Instrument and,
if so, the terms and conditions of
such Credit Support Instrument. The
approval of each interest rate hedge
transaction
by
the
Director
of
Finance shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery
of the applicable Hedge Agreement
by the Director of Finance. The
Director of Finance is further authorized to terminate any Hedge Agreements or any Credit Support Instrument securing a Hedge Agreement
if the Director of Finance determines, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, that the
City’s best interests will be served
by such termination. Any payments
owed by the City upon termination
of a Hedge Agreement may be paid
from the proceeds of Refunding Certificates or from Fund Nos. 67 SF
600 and 01 SF 001 or from other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose, as determined by the
Director of Finance.
In the event the Director of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is necessary to supplement or amend the Facility Lease or
the Trust Agreement in connection
with any Hedge Agreement or termination of any Hedge Agreement,
the Mayor and the Director of
Finance are authorized to sign and
deliver a Supplemental Lease and to

1402

July 15, 2009
signify approval of the Supplemental Trust Agreement, approved as to
form by the Director of Law.
Section 4. Credit Support Instruments. The Director of Finance is
authorized to contract from time to
time for one or more Credit Support
Instruments for any series of Outstanding Certificates or any Hedge
Agreement if the Director determines, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, that the
Credit
Support
Instruments
will
result in savings to the City, will
stabilize interest rates or minimize
the risk of increased interest expense on or increased risks, burdens, or other costs associated with
hedging arrangements relating to
those Certificates. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to
agree to the amendment, replacement, assignment or termination of
any such contract if the Director of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the City’s best interests
will be served by such amendment,
replacement, assignment or termination. In the event the Director of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is necessary to supplement or amend the Ground Lease,
Facility Lease or the Trust Agreement in order to permit the use of
or to amend, replace, assign or terminate a Credit Support Instrument,
the Mayor and the Director of
Finance are authorized to sign and
deliver
a
Supplemental
Ground
Lease or a Supplemental Lease or
both and to signify approval of the
Supplemental Trust Agreement, approved as to form by the Director of
Law. The cost of obtaining, amending, replacing, assigning or terminating
each
Credit
Support
Instrument, except to the extent paid
by the Original Purchasers in accordance with the Purchase Agreement
or the remarketing agent in accordance with a remarketing agreement, shall be paid from the proceeds of Refunding Certificates or
the proceeds of remarketing or from
Fund Nos. 67 SF 600 and 01 SF 001
or from other money lawfully available and appropriated or to be
appropriated for that purpose.
Section 5. Refunding of Certificates;
Escrow
Agreements.
The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign and deliver, in the name and
on behalf of the City, one or more
escrow agreements between the City
and the Trustee, as escrow trustee,
providing for, among other matters:
the
investment
and
holding
in
escrow of the proceeds of Refunding
Certificates to be applied to the
refunding of Refunded Certificates;
the
application
of
the
moneys
derived from those investments to
the payment of the Certificate Payments on Refunded Certificates, and
the irrevocable call for redemption
of Refunded Certificates to be called
for redemption prior to maturity.
The Director of Finance shall provide for the payment of the services
rendered and for reimbursement of
expenses incurred pursuant to each
escrow agreement from proceeds of
Refunding Certificates to the extent
available and then from Fund Nos.

July 15, 2009
67 SF 600 and 01 SF 100 or from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose, as determined by
the Director of Finance. Provision
shall be made in each escrow agreement to give the Trustee any written notice of redemption required
under the Trust Agreement. The
Director of Finance and other appropriate City officials shall sign all
documents
and
take
all
other
actions necessary or appropriate on
the part of the City to effect each
such refunding in accordance with
the Trust Agreement and to cause
the Refunded Certificates to be
deemed paid and discharged, including without limitation, the retention
of an independent public accounting
firm to verify the mathematical
accuracy of the calculations relating
to the escrow. Upon the issuance
and delivery of a series of Refunding Certificates, the Trustee and the
City are authorized to disburse from
the Funds established and maintained under the Trust Agreement
such amounts of moneys as are in
excess of the balances required by
the Trust Agreement to then be
maintained in those Funds. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
give written notice to the Trustee of
the call for redemption of the
Refunded Certificates on the earliest redemption date following the
issuance of the Refunding Certificates, pursuant to the Trust Agreement and the applicable escrow
agreement.
Section 6. Determination of Base

(a) Principal Components and
Term. Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is to the financial advantage of the City and in the City’s
best interests that one or more
series of Refunding Certificates be
issued to refund Outstanding Certificates, the Director of Finance is
authorized to negotiate and provide
for the terms of the Refunding Certificates and the Base Rent, as
amended pursuant to a Supplemental Lease, including the final Lease
Term, which shall end not later than
the final maturity of the Outstanding Certificates, and the annual and
aggregate principal components of
Base Rent. The principal amount of
each series of Refunding Certificates and the corresponding principal component of Base Rent is to be
the amount set forth in the Purchase Agreement for that series and
shall be the amount determined by
the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, to be necessary (i) to pay
the costs of refunding the Refunded
Certificates,
(ii)
to
fund
any
reserves required under the Trust
Agreement, (iii) to pay costs of any
Credit Support Instruments, (iv) to
pay identified amounts owed under
Hedge Agreements, and (v) to pay
costs of issuing the Refunding Certificates. The Refunding Certificates
of each series shall mature on the
dates and in the respective principal
amounts set forth in the Purchase
Agreement for that series, consis-

The City Record
tent with this Ordinance and the
Trust Agreement.
(b) Interest. The Refunding Certificates may be issued as obligations bearing interest at fixed or
variable interest rates, based on the
determination of the Director of
Finance as to the financial advantage to, and best interests of, the
City, as specified in the Purchase
Agreement.
If
the
Director
of
Finance so determines, then the
method and procedure by which the
variable rate of interest to be borne
by the Refunding Certificates shall
be determined as provided in the applicable Supplemental Trust Agreement, whether by reference to a
market index, by a remarketing
agent or otherwise; provided that no
Refunding Certificates shall bear
interest at a rate in excess of twenty-five
percent
(25%)
per
year
(including any Refunding Certificate held by a provider of a Credit
Support Instrument). The Director
of Finance may determine that the
terms of a variable rate series of
Refunding Certificates may or may
not permit the holders to tender
their variable rate Refunding Certificates for purchase by the City. If
the Director of Finance designates
any series of Refunding Certificates
as variable rate Certificates, and if
the holders of that series of Refunding Certificates are to be entitled to
tender those Certificates for purchase, then the Director of Finance
shall also designate in the Purchase
Agreement for those variable rate
Certificates (and may designate others, from time to time, in substitution therefor), the tender agent or
agents and the remarketing agent
or agents, which designations shall
be based on the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the parties so designated
possess the requisite resources and
experience to provide the services
required of them and that the terms
on which the designated parties
have agreed to provide such services are fair and commercially reasonable.
(c) Optional and Mandatory Redemption. The Refunding Certificates of each series, and the corresponding principal component of
Base Rent, may be subject to redemption prior to maturity at the
option of the City, if and to the
extent set forth in the Purchase
Agreement for that series. Any
Refunding
Certificates
so
determined to be subject to optional
redemption and maturing by their
stated
terms
after
the
earliest
optional redemption date shall be
subject to redemption at the option
of the City on or after the earliest
optional redemption date in whole
or in part on any date at the redemption prices set forth in the Purchase Agreement and in accordance
with the applicable Supplemental
Trust Agreement. The Refunding
Certificates designated in the Purchase Agreement as term Certificates subject to mandatory sinking
fund redemption shall be redeemed
prior to maturity on each mandatory redemption date designated in
the Purchase Agreement in the

1403

41
aggregate amount of the sinking
fund installment to be paid on such
mandatory redemption date, all as
provided in the Purchase Agreement
and in accordance with the Supplemental Trust Agreement.
(d) Credit Support and Other Instruments. The Director of Finance,
regardless of whether a series of
Refunding Certificates bears interest at variable or fixed rates, is
authorized to contract for one or
more Credit Support Instruments, if
the Director of Finance determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the Credit
Support Instruments will result in a
savings in the cost of the financing
to the City or will stabilize interest
rates or minimize the risk of increased interest expense in connection with the Facility Lease and the
Certificates. The costs of such Credit Support Instruments may be paid
from proceeds of Refunding Certificates or from Fund Nos. 67 SF 600
and 01 SF 001 or from other money
lawfully available and appropriated
or to be appropriated for that purpose, as determined by the Director
of Finance. The Director of Finance
is authorized to enter into agreements in connection with the delivery of the Refunding Certificates,
and from time to time thereafter so
long as the Refunding Certificates
are outstanding, with providers of
Credit Support Instruments, tender
agents (which may be the Trustee),
remarketing agents (which may be
any of the Original Purchasers) and
others as may be determined by the
Director of Finance to be necessary
or appropriate to provide for the
method of determining the variable
interest rates, permitting holders
the right of tender and providing for
payment of the purchase price of, or
Certificate Payments on, the variable rate Refunding Certificates.
(e) Base Rent. The City acknowledges that the aggregate principal
amount of Outstanding Certificates
shall be based on the aggregate
principal component of Base Rent
under the Facility Lease and that
the interest on the Certificates shall
be based on the interest components
of Base Rent. The Base Rent to be
payable under and in accordance
with the Facility Lease during any
Lease Term shall be an amount sufficient to cover the amount of Certificate Payments on the Outstanding Certificates that are due and
payable during that Lease Term,
and such Base Rent shall be specified or determined in an exhibit to
the Facility Lease; provided, however, that the City’s payment of Base
Rent and Additional Rent is Subject
to Appropriation and Certification
as provided in the Facility Lease
and nothing in the Facility Lease,
the Certificates, the Trust Agreement, or any Hedge Agreement constitutes or shall constitute a pledge
by the City, or an obligation of the
City, of any taxes or other moneys
to the payments due thereunder.
(f) Primary Offering Disclosure.
If, in the judgment of the Director
of Finance after consultation with
the Original Purchasers, a disclosure document is appropriate relating to the initial offering of one or

42
more series of Refunding Certificates, the Director of Finance, on
behalf of the City and in that officer’s official capacity, is authorized
to (i) cooperate with the Original
Purchasers in the preparation of,
and the making of modifications,
completions or changes of or supplements to, such a disclosure document, (ii) determine, and certify or
otherwise represent when the disclosure document is to be deemed
final or is final, (iii) authorize the
use and distribution of that disclosure document and any supplements
thereto in connection with the initial offering of the applicable series
of Refunding Certificates, and (iv)
sign certificates, statements or other
documents in connection with the
finality, accuracy and completeness
of that disclosure document. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
contract for services for the production and distribution of any disclosure statements, including by printed and electronic means.
(g) Continuing Disclosure. If and
to the extent required by Rule 15c212 promulgated by the Securities
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
or by a Purchase Agreement in connection with the sale of one or more
series of Refunding Certificates or
by a remarketing agreement in connection with remarketed Certificates, the City shall enter into continuing disclosure agreements, approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, between the
City and the Trustee, with terms not
inconsistent with this Ordinance and
as may be approved by the officers
signing those agreements on behalf
of the City, all of which shall be
conclusively evidenced by that signing. In each such continuing disclosure agreement, the City shall agree
to provide, or cause to be provided,
financial information and operating
data,
financial
statements
and
notices in such manner as may be
required for purposes of that Rule.
The Director of Finance is authorized to sign and deliver each continuing disclosure agreement and
any related agreements, certificates
and other instruments, and to deliver such information, as may be necessary or appropriate to comply
with the requirements of the Rule.
The City understands and agrees
that those commitments are intended to be for the benefit of the holders from time to time of the applicable series of Refunding Certificates, including holders of bookentry interests in those Certificates.
(h) Application for Ratings. If, in
the judgment of the Director of
Finance, the filing of applications
for one or more ratings on Refunding Certificates by one or more
nationally-recognized rating agencies is necessary or desirable for
marketing purposes, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare
and submit those applications, and
to provide information as may be
required in support of those applications for the purpose. The cost of
obtaining each such rating, except
to the extent paid by the Original
Purchasers in accordance with the
Purchase Agreement, shall be paid

The City Record
from the proceeds of the Refunding
Certificates to the extent available
and then from other money lawfully available and appropriated or to
be appropriated for that purpose.
(i) Application of Proceeds; Costs
of Issuance. The proceeds from the
sale of the Refunding Certificates
shall be deposited and applied as
provided in the Supplemental Indenture and for the purposes stated in
this Ordinance and are appropriated
for those purposes. Costs of issuing
the Refunding Certificates that are
not paid from those proceeds may be
paid from Fund Nos. 67 SF 600 and
01 SF 001 or from other money lawfully available and appropriated or
to be appropriated for that purpose,
as determined by the Director of
Finance.
Section 7. Sale of the Refunding
Certificates; Purchase Agreements.
The Director of Finance shall sign
and deliver Purchase Agreements
for Refunding Certificates setting
forth the conditions for delivery of
the Refunding Certificates that are
consistent with this Ordinance and
the Trust Agreement and that are
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
customary for lease certificates of
participation issued by governmental entities, including, without limitation, representations as to the
accuracy and completeness of information contained in the disclosure
document described in Section 6 of
this Ordinance. In the event the
Refunding Certificates are issued in
more than one series sold at different times, a separate Purchase
Agreement shall be signed and
delivered for each separately delivered series. The Purchase Agreement shall provide for the sale of
the applicable series of Refunding
Certificates to the Original Purchasers selected by the Director of
Finance and identified in the Purchase Agreement, based on an evaluation of the qualifications of firms
that have proposed to underwrite
the Refunding Certificates.

written advice of a Financial Advisor, consistent with this Ordinance
and the Trust Agreement:
(a) the aggregate principal amount
of Refunding Certificates issued;
(b) the Purchase Price for the Refunding Certificates;
(c) whether any Refunding Certificates are to be subject to optional redemption prior to maturity, and,
if so, the earliest optional redemption date for those Refunding Certificates subject to prior redemption,
which shall be not later than ten
years from the first interest payment date of the applicable series,
and the applicable redemption price,
which shall be not greater than
102%
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed;
(d) the dates on which principal
of the Refunding Certificates is to
be paid, which shall be not later
than thirty (30) years from their
respective dates of issuance, with an
identification of whether the payment is due by stated maturity or

1404

July 15, 2009
by mandatory sinking fund redemption of Refunding Certificates of a
particular maturity;
(e) the interest rates to be borne
by Refunding Certificates bearing
interest at a fixed rate, the weighted
average of which shall not exceed
eight percent (8%) as to Refunding
Certificates of any series, and the
method by which the interest rate is
to be determined for Refunding Certificates bearing interest at variable
rates, consistent with Section 6;
(f) the particular Outstanding
Certificates or portions thereof to be
Refunded Certificates;
(g) the title and series designation for the Refunding Certificates;
(h) the amount, if any, of proceeds of the sale of the Refunding
Certificates to be deposited in the
Reserve Account in order to cause
the balance therein to equal the
Reserve Requirement, if and to the
extent required by the applicable
Supplemental Trust Agreement, and
any determination as to whether
there shall be a special reserve fund
for the Refunding Certificates of
any series, separate from the common Reserve Account, or a surety or
insurance policy, bank letter or line
of credit, or other form of credit or
liquidity
facility
enhancing
the
security for Refunding Certificates
of that series in lieu of a funded
reserve fund;
(i) whether any Refunding Certificates are to be secured by or

It is determined that the terms of
the Refunding Certificates and the
corresponding terms of Base Rent as
so determined within the limitations
set forth in this Ordinance and as
so specified and set forth in the Purchase Agreement will be in the best
interest of the City and consistent
with all legal requirements.
Section 8. Remarketing. In the
event that the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
it is advantageous to the City to
convert the interest on any Outstanding Certificates bearing interest at variable rates to fixed interest rates for a period of time or to
maturity or to convert to a different
variable rate period or mode, or to
terminate or take other actions with
respect to any existing Credit Support Instrument that will require a
tender and remarketing of any Outstanding
Certificates
under
the
Trust Agreement (such conversion
or other actions and the tender and
remarketing being collectively referred to in this Section as “remarketing”), the City shall undertake the remarketing of those Certificates in accordance with the
Trust
Agreement.
In
connection
with any remarketing of Certificates, the Director of Finance is
authorized to obtain one or more
Credit Support Instruments if the
Director determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the Credit Support Instrument will facilitate the remarketing
of the Certificates. In the event the
Director
of
Finance
determines,
based on the written advice of a

July 15, 2009
Financial Advisor, that it is necessary in connection with the remarketing to supplement or amend the
Facility Lease, the Ground Lease or
the Trust Agreement in order to
address current market conditions
or to permit the use of or to terminate a Credit Support Instrument or
to otherwise obtain financing arrangements advantageous to the
City, the Mayor and the Director of
Finance are authorized to sign and
deliver a Supplemental Lease and a
Supplemental Ground Lease and to
signify approval of the Supplemental Trust Agreement, approved as to
form by the Director of Law. The
Director

series of Certificates to be remarketed, by the deposit of a Credit
Support Instrument in lieu of cash,
as permitted and more specifically
provided in the Trust Agreement,
and to apply cash released from
such special reserve fund to the payment of costs of remarketing. To the
extent the costs of remarketing are
not paid from any cash released
from such special reserve fund,
those costs may be paid, as determined by the Director of Finance,
from the proceeds of remarketing or
from Fund Nos. 67 SF 600 and 01 SF
001 or from other money lawfully
available and appropriated or to be
appropriated for that purpose. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
prepare one or more disclosure documents in connection with any
remarketing under the same terms
and conditions as set forth in Section 6 of this Ordinance with respect
to the issuance of Refunding Certificates. The Director of Finance or any
other officer of the City having
responsibility for the remarketing of
Certificates is authorized to take
such actions or cause to be taken
such actions as are necessary to
obtain and maintain the desired tax
status of any Outstanding Certificates, and the covenants and authorizations in Section 10 of this Ordinance shall apply to any converted
Certificates.
The
Director
of
Finance and other City officials are
authorized to sign and deliver such
instruments, certificates and documents as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions
authorized by this Section. The

arrangements
on
behalf of the City to establish the
date, location, procedure and conditions for the remarketing of Certificates and to take all actions necessary to effect the remarketing of
Certificates under the terms of this
Ordinance, the Facility Lease and
the Trust Agreement. The Clerk of
Council or other appropriate official
of the City shall furnish the Trustee
a true transcript of proceedings certified by the Clerk or other official,
of all proceedings had with reference to the remarketing of Certificates along with such information
for the records as is necessary to
determine the validity of the remarketing.

officers. Subject to the Facility

Section 10. Tax Covenants. Upon
the determination of the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
it is to the financial advantage of
the City and in the City’s best interests that all or a portion of a series
of Refunding Certificates or remarketed
Certificates
be
issued
or
remarketed as obligations the interest on which is excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, the Director of Finance, as
the fiscal officer, or any other officer having responsibility for the
issuance of Refunding Certificates
or remarketing of Certificates, is,
alone or in conjunction with any of
the foregoing or with any other officer or employee of the City, authorized to cooperate with the Original
Purchasers or remarketing agents
and the Trustee by making, on
behalf of the City, such covenants
and representations in the Facility
Lease as are appropriate and necessary so that (a) the Facility Lease
and the Certificates of any series
will not (i) constitute private activity bonds, arbitrage bonds or hedge
bonds under Sections 141, 148 or 149
of the Code or (ii) be treated other
than as obligations to which Section
103(a) of the Code applies, and (b)
the interest components of Base
Rent and interest on the Certificates
will not be treated as an item of tax
preference under Section 57 of the
Code.
The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer of
the City having responsibility for
the issuance of Refunding Certificates or remarketing of Certificates
is hereby authorized (a) to make or
effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or
waiver on behalf of the City with
respect to the Facility Lease and the
Certificates as the City is permitted
to or required to make or give under
the federal income tax laws for the
purpose of assuring, enhancing or
protecting favorable tax treatment
or status of the Facility Lease and
the Certificates or the interest components thereof or assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose,
reducing
the
burden
or
expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or payments
or penalties, or making payments of
special amounts in lieu of making
computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as rebate, or
obviating those amounts or payments, as determined by that officer,
which action shall be in writing and
signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf
of the City, as may be appropriate

44
reasonable expectations of the City
regarding the amount and use of all
the proceeds from the sale of the
Certificates, the facts, circumstances
and estimates on which they are
based, and other facts and circumstances relevant to the tax status of
the Facility Lease and the Certificates.
The City hereby covenants it will
take or cause to be taken such
actions that may be required of it
for the interest components of Base
Rent and interest on the Certificates
to achieve and maintain the intended treatment and status for federal
income tax purposes and that it will
not take or authorize to be taken
any actions that would adversely
affect that treatment and status.
Each covenant made pursuant to
this Section with respect to a series
of Certificates is also made with
respect to all issues any portion of
the principal of or interest on which
is paid from proceeds of that series
of Certificates (and, if different, the
original issue and any refunding
issues in a series of refundings), to
the extent such compliance is necessary to assure the tax status of
the Certificates of that series, and
the officers identified above are
authorized to take actions with
respect to those issues as they are

with respect to the Certificates of
that series.
