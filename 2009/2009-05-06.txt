RE: Retirement
Dear Council President Sweeney:
This letter serves as notice of my
retirement
from
Cleveland
City
Council, effective April 30, 2009. I
would like to sincerely thank you
for your leadership that has taken
us to new levels.
I would like to acknowledge my
Council colleagues who are some of
this nation’s finest leaders. I am
proud to have served with these
great visionaries, I am confident
that these men and women will continue to effectively lead with vision
and compassion. They will continue
to fight for the citizens who deserve
to be heard; this Council is their
voice.
I cannot say enough wonderful
things about all the people I’ve
encountered during my years in public service. I would be remiss if I did
not say how grateful I am to have
worked with the Council staff, who
are a team of true professionals.
I am eternally grateful to the citizens of ward 10 for their faith in
me. During my 21 years of service
I have always been able to rely
upon the trust and support of the
citizens of ward 10. They have
demonstrated their commitment to
my vision for this community. I will
miss being their councilman but I
will carry with me a life time of
cherished
memories
and
I
will
always and forever be a servant to
the people.
Thank you again for the opportunity to serve.
Sincerely,
Roosevelt Coats

cab stand service, both operated by
Standard Parking Corporation, shall
expire when Contract No. 48042
expires, and to adjust the method of
computing compensation regarding
the taxi cab stand service.
Whereas, under Ordinance No.
1190-94, passed June 13, 1994, this
Council authorized the Director of
Port Control to enter into Contract
No. 48042, as amended, with Standard
Parking
Corporation,
fka
APCOA, Inc. (“Standard Parking”)
to operate both the public and
employee parking facilities at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport

two
separate
amendments to Contract No. 48042 authorized Standard Parking to provide
shuttle service to the Federal Inspection Facility (“FIS”) to the traveling
public and to operate the taxi cab
stand both at Cleveland Hopkins
International Airport in addition to
the parking facilities; and
Whereas, the taxi cab stand service
amendment, as authorized by Ordinance No. 1761-A-06, passed December
4, 2006, included among other things,
a provision that the Director of Port
Control would be allowed to assess a
$3.00 per-fare-fee to vendors to cover
facility maintenance and taxi stand

Whereas, Standard Parking is currently operating a taxi cab stand service in a manner which is not in violation of the injunction, but the ability of the Director of Port Control to
assess the per-fare-fee to cover facility maintenance and taxi stand management has been stayed due to the

provide that the Federal Inspection
Facility shuttle shall expire when
Contract No. 48042 expires; and
Whereas, it is also the desire of
Standard Parking and the City of

derived from operation of the taxi
stand as an operating expense of
the parking facilities and to deduct
the expenses from revenue generated under that contract; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,

the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That notwithstanding
any provision of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, to
the contrary, the Director of Port
Control is authorized to enter into

with Standard Parking Corporation,
fka APCOA, Inc to have the temporary services of providing shuttle
service to the Federal Inspection
Facility (“FIS”) to the traveling
public and operating the taxi cab
stand both at Cleveland Hopkins
International Airport to expire at
the same time as Contract No. 48042
expires, or in the alternative for the
taxi cab stand only, to have it
expire when Case No. U.S.D.C. 1:07CV-3128 has been resolved. The
amendment shall also include a provision that authorizes that the cost
of the shuttle and taxi cab stand
services
performed
under
this
amendment to be treated as operating expenses and deducted from
gross revenues collected by Standard Parking on behalf of the Airport, under Contract No. 48042.

Ord. No. 1826-08.
By Council Members Kelley and
Sweeney (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Port Control to
enter into one or more agreements
with the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and the Northeast
Ohio Regional Sewer District, or
their designees, to pay or reimburse
directly related costs incurred by
them for the purpose of implementing projects required to mitigate
adverse consequences on Abram
Creek.
Whereas, the capital improvement
program
for
Cleveland
Hopkins
International Airport required that
Abram Creek be put into a culvert,
and in response to that, the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency
(“Ohio EPA”) Director issued Findings and Orders dated April 2001,
that directed the restoration of Doan
Brook
and
other
wetlands
and
streams
as
mitigation
for
the
adverse impact to Abram Creek; and
Whereas, twice in 2005, the Department of Port Control solicited
construction
bids
for
the
Doan
Brook mitigation project, but in
both instances, the bids came back
greatly exceeding authorized funding and so were rejected; and
Whereas, in 2006, the City contacted the Northeast Ohio Regional
Sewer District (“NEORSD”) regarding a potential joint project for the
Doan
Brook
mitigation
project.

The City Record
NEORSD’s examination resulted in a
re-design of the project that will
substantially reduce the cost; and
Whereas, the re-design required
modifications to the Ohio EPA’s
April 2001 Findings and Orders
which, after lengthy negotiations
concluding in September 2008, will
be issued shortly and are agreeable
to both the Ohio EPA and the City;
and
Whereas, the modifications to the
April 2001 Findings and Orders require additional legislative authority; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Port Control is authorized to enter
into one or more agreements with
the Ohio EPA and the NEORSD, or
their designees, to pay or reimburse
directly related costs incurred by
them for the purpose of implementing projects required to mitigate
adverse consequences on Abram
Creek, including but not limited to
various water quality and stream
restoration and mitigation projects
within Cuyahoga County, mitigation
construction on Doan Brook, stream
monitoring for a period up to five
years after the mitigation construction is completed, as required by the
Ohio EPA and Section 106 Memorandum of Agreement dated January 13, 2005.
Section 2. That the cost of the payments and the contract or contracts
authorized shall be paid from Fund
Nos. 60 SF 130, 60 SF 128, and 60 SF
141, Request No. 175233.
Section 3. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and

shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
