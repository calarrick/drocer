Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That, notwithstanding
Section 183.03 or any other provision
of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, to the contrary, the
Director of Port Control is authorized

the Charter of the City of Cleveland.
The Leases By Way of Concession
shall not exceed a term of two years,
with two one year options to renew.
The first of the one-year options to

the purposes described in the Lease
or Leases by Way of Concession.
Section 3. That the Lease or Leases By Way of Concession shall be
prepared by the Director of Law.
Section 4. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the

Section 557.03 Designation of Burial Areas
The Commissioner of Park Maintenance and Properties shall have
power to designate areas within
which headstones, monuments and
other structures may be erected, and
shall have power to control and regulate the erection thereof in or upon
cemetery lots. No headstone, monument or other structure shall be so
erected unless approved by him.
Section 557.04 Hours
The Commissioner of Park Maintenance and Properties shall by general rule determine at what hours
and for what purposes the cemeteries shall be open to pedestrians and
to vehicles.
Section 557.06 Plat Required; Contents; Approval
The Commissioner of Park Maintenance and Properties shall prepare
a plat of every cemetery owned or
established by the City. Such plat
shall show all drives, walks or other
thoroughfares; all sewers, drains or

December 9, 2009
watercourses; all lots reserved for
buildings necessary in the administration of such cemetery; all areas
reserved as parks or open spaces; all
burial lots; all areas reserved for
future platting. The Commissioner
may, with the approval of the directors of the departments concerned,
requisition the services of any office
or division which may be needed in
the preparation of such plat. In
every such case the value of such
services shall be paid from the
Cemetery Operating Fund to the
General Fund. Such plat shall be
subject to the approval of the Platting Commissioner as to all drains
and sewers shown thereon, and subject to the approval of the Director
of Parks, Recreation and Properties
in all respects. When so approved it
shall be filed as public record in the
office of the Commissioner, subject
to alterations, amendment, supplement or supersession only by a plat
similarly prepared and approved
which shall specifically state the
plat or particular items of a particular plat intended to be altered,
amended, supplemented or superseded. No interment shall be permitted except in a burial lot or site
shown as such upon the plat herein
required.
Section 557.07 Lot Prices
Prices at which cemetery lots, or
parts thereof, may be sold shall be
fixed by the Commissioner of Park
Maintenance and Properties, at the
time of platting any cemetery or
part of any cemetery hereinafter
acquired by the City, or not heretofore platted. The prices so fixed for
all the lots shown on any plat shall
be included in a single schedule,
which shall clearly identify each lot
shown on such plat, and the price
thereof. No schedule or amendment
thereto shall be valid until the
approval of the Director of Parks,
Recreation and Properties and the
Director of Finance are endorsed
thereon, and until it is filed as a
public record in the office of the
Commissioner. Whenever any prices
so fixed are to be changed, it shall
be done only by amending such
schedule, or by adopting a new
schedule, which shall supersede all
prior schedules applicable to such
plat.
Section 557.08 Items Determining
Lot Prices
The price of each lot shall be the
sum of three items determined as
provided in Sections 557.09 to 557.11:
(a) The land cost, in which term
is included the cost to the City of
the land and general improvements
represented by such lot or site;
(b) The endowment cost, being
the contribution required to be made
to the Cleveland City Cemetery
Endowment Fund; and
(c) The operation cost, being the
amount required for the care and
upkeep of the lot, as shall be determined by the Commissioner of Park
Maintenance and Properties, and
which sum shall be the balance
remaining after deductions of divisions (a) and (b) of this section
from the selling price of each lot.
The Commissioner of Parks Maintenance and Properties may amend
this cost as the Commissioner deems

The City Record
necessary. Each such item and the
total price shall be shown on the
schedule required by Section 557.07.
Section 557.09 Lot Prices on Cemeteries Hereafter Acquired
In the case of cemeteries hereafter acquired, the Commissioner of
Park Maintenance and Properties
shall determine an amount which
shall be the sum of the amounts
paid for the entire tract acquired for
cemetery purposes, plus an amount
determined to be required for general improvements of whatever character, plus any amounts to be paid
as interest on bonds or other obligations of the City issued to pay for
the acquisition or improvement of
such cemetery. The sum so determined shall be divided into as many
portions as there are lots laid out on
such plat, and each portion shall be
determined to be the land cost of
some particular lot; provided, that
when such tract is not all platted at
once, only a proper proportion of the
sum determined as provided shall be
apportioned to the lots platted at
any one time. In determining the
portion of land cost to be fixed upon
any one lot, consideration shall be
taken of area, location and any
other factors affecting the relative
value of the several lots.
Section 557.11 Endowment Cost
The Director of Finance shall
declare the amount of the endowment cost, which amount shall be
held in a permanent fund of the
cemetery known as the Cleveland
City Cemetery Endowment Fund.
The
Director
may
change
this
amount as deemed necessary by the
Director.
Section 557.12 Sale of Lots or Burial Sites
When the plat and schedule provided for in Sections 557.06 and
557.07 have been approved and filed,
the Commissioner of Park Maintenance and Properties shall have
power on behalf of the City to sell
lots, parts of lots or burial sites, at
the respective prices shown in such
schedule. No burial lot or site shall
be sold unless it is platted, nor at
any price not shown on such schedule.
Section 557.13
Purchase of Lots
on Deferred Payments
The Commissioner of Park Maintenance and Properties may at his
discretion accept an initial payment
on the price of such lot in an
amount not less than half the total
price, nor in any case less than the
land cost apportioned to such lot.
Payment of the remainder of such
price shall be secured by such
agreement as the Commissioner,
with the approval of the Director of
Parks, Recreation and Properties,
deems reasonable. Such agreement
shall be in form prescribed and
approved by the Director of Law,
and shall require the payment to the
City for the benefit of the Cemetery
Operating Fund of interest at the
rate of six percent per annum upon
the deferred portion of such price,
and for the reduction from time to
time of such deferred portion by
payments not less frequent than
semi-annually, nor shall the pay-

2263

27
ment of any portion be deferred
longer than five years. The entire
amount unpaid shall become due
and payable before any interment is
permitted in such lot, but such payment may be waived, and the agreement continued upon terms approved by the Directors named in
this section.
Section 557.14 Certificate of Purchase Issued after Payment in Full
No certificate of purchase for any
cemetery lot shall be issued until
the price therefor is paid in full.
Whenever any deferred payment on
such price is in default for more
than thirty days, the entire amount
unpaid shall at once become due,
and unless the same is paid forthwith, the Commissioner of Park
Maintenance and Properties shall
cancel the agreement and tender to
the purchaser a certificate of purchase for so many burial sites therein as the Commissioner shall determine to have been paid for in full.
Section 557.15 Transfer or Assignment of Lots
The person to whom a certificate
of purchase as an agreement to purchase has been issued or the successor in interest of such person,
may transfer or assign such certificate or agreement, as to the whole
or any portion of the lot described
therein, subject in every case to the
approval and consent of the Commissioner of Park Maintenance and
Properties, which shall be recited in
and endorsed upon the instrument
evidencing such transfer, in form
prescribed by the Director of Law,
and no such transfer or assignment
shall be valid unless so endorsed
and unless approved by the Director.
Section 557.18
Cleveland City
Cemetery Endowment Fund
That portion of the price of any
cemetery lot which is designated as
the endowment cost shall upon its
receipt be paid forthwith into the
principal account of a perpetual
trust fund, hereby established and
designated as the Cleveland City
Cemetery Endowment Fund. The
principal of such Fund shall be forever inviolate; it shall be invested
by the Director of Finance, or by his
successor designated for such purpose by ordinance, in securities in
which sinking funds or municipal
trust
funds
are
authorized
by
statute or ordinance to be invested.
Any portions at any time uninvested shall be kept on deposit, at interest, in regular City depositaries. The
earnings from the Cleveland City
Cemetery Endowment Fund shall be
used to defray the cost of maintaining and caring for the cemeteries, including any common structures, any structures erected on lots
or burial sites, the drives, walks,
and general improvements to the
cemeteries.

funds, the City is authorized to
receive from trustees, executors or
other custodians of trust funds
under wills or agreements providing
for the upkeep of lots and monuments and headstones in cemeteries
belonging to or under the control of
the City, such annual payments as
such custodians of the trust fund
are able and willing to make. The
funds so received shall be expended
by the Commissioner of Park Maintenance and Properties in the maintenance and beautification of the
particular lot and the maintenance
and repair of any headstone and
monument
standing
thereon
for
which such contribution is made.
The Commissioner is authorized to
issue receipts for such funds stipulating
that
the
same
shall
be
expended solely for the improvements of the lots, headstones and
monuments designated by such custodian of the trust fund.
Section 557.21
Trust Funds Deposited in City Cemetery Endowment Fund
Trust funds heretofore established
for the perpetual care of cemetery
lots heretofore sold may be turned
in whole or in part into the Cleveland
City
Cemetery
Endowment
Fund with the concurrence of the
Commissioner of Park Maintenance
and Properties and of the purchaser
of any such lot or his representative
or successor in interest having
power to assent thereto. In case
trust funds are not so turned into
such Fund, the original trust agreement
shall
continue
in
force
unchanged.
Section 557.22
Funds for Additional Care of Beautification
Purchasers of cemetery lots may
create and the City may accept the
custody and administration of perpetual trust funds for the purpose of
providing care or beautification of
such lots in addition to the care provided from the Cemetery Operating

be evidenced by an agreement in
form prescribed and approved by the
Director of Law, executed by the
purchaser in his own behalf and by
the Commissioner of Park Maintenance and Properties and the Director of Finance in behalf of the City.
For the purpose of custody and
investment, but not otherwise, the
principal
amount
of
such
trust
funds, whether created prior to the
enactment of this section or pursuant to its terms, shall be treated
as part of the Cleveland City Cemetery Endowment Fund. The earnings of each such trust fund shall
be applied exclusively to the care
and beautification of the lot for
which such trust fund was established. Such expenditure may be
made each year as the earnings
accrue, or a reserve may be accumulated of such earnings in such
amount as the Commissioner may
deem necessary to meet emergencies
and unanticipated requirements.
Section 557.23
Cemetery Operating Fund
(a) The income from the Cleveland
City
Cemetery
Endowment

Operating Fund hereby established.
Moneys in the Cemetery Operating
Fund shall be available each year
for appropriation for the purpose of
operating, maintaining, caring for,
improving and beautifying cemeteries of the City, or parts thereof.
(b) No moneys in the Cemetery
Operating Fund derived from the
Cleveland City Cemetery Endowment Fund or from trust funds or
from earnings attributable to the
cemeteries shall ever be transferred
or diverted to any other fund, or expended for any other purpose than
those specified in this section.
(c) The salaries of the employees
necessary for the cemeteries and
other expenses necessary for the
cemeteries, shall be payable from
the Cemetery Operating Fund.
Section 557.25
Plan of Mausoleums
The Commissioner of Park Maintenance and Properties shall at all
times keep in his office as a public
record a plan of every City mausoleum, which plan shall show and
clearly identify every crypt and
niche intended for use as a repository of human remains. Such plan
shall not be of any force or effect
for the purposes of this chapter
until and unless it is approved by
the Director of Parks, Recreation
and Properties. Such plan may be
altered, amended, supplemented or
superseded by only a like plan similarly approved, which shall specifically state the plan or particular
items of the plan intended to be
altered, amended, supplemented or
superseded.
Section 557.26
Vaults or Crypts
for Temporary Use
The Commissioner of Park Maintenance and Properties may designate upon the plan provided for in
Section 557.25 a sufficient number of
vaults or crypts for the purpose of

permanent burial or placement in a
private crypt. No human remains not
intended for immediate burial or
placement in a private crypt shall
be placed or kept in any other place
in any City cemetery or mausoleum
than in the vaults or crypts designated as provided in this section.
The Commissioner shall have power
in each case to fix the rental for the
use of such temporary vault or
crypt, and to require the permanent
burial or placement in a private
crypt or other disposal of such
remains after a period deemed by
such Commissioner to be reasonable
in each case.
Section 557.27
Schedule of Mausoleum Prices
Prices at which crypts and niches
of City mausoleums shall be sold
shall be fixed by the Commissioner
of Park Maintenance and Properties
not later than the first offering of
any such crypt or niche for sale, in

erected. The prices so fixed for all
of the crypts and niches shown on

2264

December 9, 2009
any plan shall be included in a single schedule, which shall clearly
identify each crypt or niche and the
price thereof. No schedule or amendment thereto shall be valid until the
approval of the Director of Parks,
Recreation and Properties and the
Director of Finance are endorsed
thereon, and until it is filed as a
public record in the office of the
Commissioner. Whenever any prices
so fixed are to be changed, it shall
be done only by amending such
schedule, or by adopting a new
schedule which shall supersede all
prior schedules applicable to such
plan.
Section 557.28
Determination of
Crypt or Niche Price
The price of each crypt or niche
shall be the sum of two items, namely:
(a) The land and capital cost,
which shall be determined upon a
basis corresponding in principal to
the basis established in Sections
557.09 and 557.10 for the determination of land cost in the case of cemetery lots; and

the contribution required to be made

and regulations not inconsistent
with any provisions of this chapter,
for the management and conduct of
the cemeteries and of any matters
relating to the administration thereof.
Section 557.35 Determining Costs
of Mausoleums
Wherever a City mausoleum is
combined in the same building with
a chapel, a crematory or other facilities not solely required for the mausoleum, the Commissioner of Park
Maintenance and Properties shall
have power in determining the land
and capital cost of such mausoleum
to exclude such portion of the total
cost of such entire building as may
represent the cost of such crematory, chapel and other facilities not
solely required for such mausoleum.

December 9, 2009
Section 557.36 Power to Decrease
Prices
Wherever the Commissioner of
Park Maintenance and Properties
determines that cemetery lots, mausoleum crypts or niches cannot be
sold at prices determined as provided in the foregoing sections of this
chapter, he shall have power, with
the approval of the Director of
Parks, Recreation and Properties, to
fix such less price as shall represent
the highest price reasonably obtainable, not less than the endowment
cost fixed as determined in this
chapter, and to diminish the land
cost or the land and capital cost in
such proportion as may be required.
No sale shall be made for less than
the determined endowment cost, and
the full amount of the endowment
cost shall in every case be paid into
the respective endowment funds as
in cases where the price is the full
sum required by this chapter.

a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council determines that the within commodities
are non-competitive and cannot be
secured from any source other than
Sprint Nextel Corporation. Therefore, the Director of Finance is
authorized to make one or more

defined in the Trust Agreement)
may, with the approval of the City,
be issued to pay the cost of refunding outstanding Certificates; and
Whereas, this Council has determined to authorize the issuance of
Additional Certificates (“Refunding
Certificates”) under the Trust Agreement or the conversion of the interest rate on outstanding Certificates
to refund or restructure outstanding
Certificates and corresponding Base
Rent payments, as provided in this
Ordinance; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the refinancing of securities
of the City and providing for the
immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health or safety
in that authorizing the refunding

obtain debt service savings or to
stabilize interest rates or to minimize risks of increased interest
expense or increased risks, burdens,
or other costs associated with hedging arrangements or credit support
instruments in connection with the
lease-purchase of the Cleveland Stadium, to mitigate burdensome schedules of Certificate Payments and

Section 2. Determinations by Council. This Council finds and determines as follows:
(a) Public Purpose. The acquisition, financing and refinancing by
the City of the Cleveland Stadium
pursuant to the Ground Lease, the

2266

December 9, 2009
Facility Lease and the Trust Agreement and the use of the Cleveland
Stadium as a source of public relaxation and entertainment served and
serves a proper public municipal
purpose.
(b) Supplemental Ground Lease,
Supplemental Lease, Supplemental
Trust Agreement and Refunding
Certificates. It is necessary, proper
and in the best interest of the City
to authorize one or more Supplemental Ground Leases, Supplemental Leases and Purchase Agreements and approve one or more Supplemental Trust Agreements and the
issuance of Refunding Certificates
in one or more series for the purpose of refunding (i) one or more
series of the Outstanding Certificates or designated maturities (or
portions of maturities) thereof, to
obtain aggregate net present value
savings in Certificate Payments and
corresponding Base Rent payments
of not less than three percent (3%),
(ii) one or more series of Outstanding Certificates, or designated maturities (or portions of maturities)
thereof, that are short-term or variable-rate obligations and that the
Director of Finance has determined,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, are subjecting
the City to Base Rent payments the
interest components of which include undesirably high rates of
interest or undesirable fluctuations
in rates of interest, or are the subject of hedging arrangements or
credit support instruments that are
subjecting the City to increased
risks, burdens, or costs, and that
those effects can economically be
avoided or mitigated through refinancing, or (iii) one or more series
of Outstanding Certificates, or designated maturities (or portions of
maturities) thereof, that the Director of Finance has determined,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, are subjecting
the City to burdensome schedules of
Certificate
Payments
and
corresponding Base Rent payments or
burdensome covenants or costs of
funding or maintaining required
reserves, and that those burdens or
costs can be mitigated, removed or
avoided through refinancing
Separate series of Refunding Certificates may be issued at the same
or
different
times.
A
Purchase
Agreement, Supplemental Lease and
Supplemental Trust Agreement shall
be delivered for each series and may
be delivered for multiple series. A
Supplemental Ground Lease shall be
delivered for any series of Refunding Certificates with a final maturity later than the final maturity of
the then Outstanding Certificates.
This Council finds and determines
that the issuance of the Refunding
Certificates and signing and delivery of Supplemental Ground Leases,
Supplemental Leases and Purchase
Agreements and approval of Supplemental Trust Agreements in connection with such issuance for the
purpose provided in this Ordinance
serves a proper, public, municipal
purpose by reducing or stabilizing
or minimizing risks of increasing
the costs to the City of the leasepurchase of the Cleveland Stadium
which is a source of public relaxation and entertainment for the people of the City of Cleveland.
(c) Leased Premises. The Council
of the City found and determined at
the time of the authorization of the
Existing Facility Lease and approval of the Existing Trust Agreement and the Outstanding Certificates, and hereby reaffirms, that the
Leased Premises are essential to the
proper, efficient and economic operation of the City.

December 9, 2009
Section 3. Hedging Arrangements.
This Council finds that by engaging
in interest rate hedging arrangements with respect to the Facility
Lease and Certificates the City may
reduce its financing costs by optimizing the relative amounts of fixed
and variable rate obligations, or
minimizing the risk of variations in
its financing costs or minimizing
any risks, burdens, or costs associated with existing hedging arrangements, or obtaining savings by confirming rates of interest on Certificates in advance of their issuance.
To permit the City to have the flexibility to undertake with respect to
the Facility Lease and Certificates
interest rate swap, swaption, rate
cap, rate collar and other hedging
transactions, from time to time, and
to
establish
the
procedures
for
approving those transactions, this
Council authorizes the signing and
delivery of one or more instruments,
including amendments or supplements to or replacement of, through
assignment, transfer or novation,
the Existing Hedge Agreement or
other
then
existing
instruments
(each, a “Hedge Agreement”), and
any related agreements necessary
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by each Hedge
Agreement. Those instruments may
be in the form of a master agreement of the International Swaps and
Derivatives Association, Inc., as supplemented and amended by a confirmation, schedule and credit support annex, as further amended to
conform to laws applicable to the
City and to contain terms recommended by a Financial Advisor as
in the City’s best interests, and as
approved by the Director of Law.
Those instruments may vary from
the terms of any existing Hedge
Agreements. The authorizations in
this Section are supplemental to and
not in derogation of any authority
provided by any other ordinance of
this Council concerning hedging
arrangements.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be subject
to appropriation and certification as
provided in the Facility Lease.
Those payments may be secured by
the Facility Lease, to the extent permitted by the Trust Agreement, all
as determined by the Director of
Finance and set forth in the Hedge
Agreement. The obligation of the
City to make payments under any
Hedge Agreement does not and
shall not represent or constitute a
general
obligation,
debt,
bonded
indebtedness or a pledge of the faith
and credit of the City or the State
of Ohio. Nothing gives any party to
any Hedge Agreement the right to
have excises, ad valorem or other
taxes levied by the City or the State
of Ohio for the payment of any
amounts due under any Hedge
Agreement.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is to the financial advantage of the City and in the City’s
best
interests
that
a
hedging
arrangement be undertaken by the
City with respect to the Facility
Lease or any Outstanding Certificates, the Director of Finance may
authorize one or more interest rate
hedge transactions in accordance
with the applicable Hedge Agreement; provided that (a) the counterparty shall be rated at the time
of signing the Hedge Agreement not
lower than A or its equivalent by at
least one rating agency or its obligations under the Hedge Agreement
shall be guaranteed or insured by

The City Record
an entity rated at the time of signing the Hedge Agreement not lower
than A or its equivalent by at least
one rating agency, and (b) the term
of each hedge transaction shall not
exceed the final maturity of the Certificates to which the hedge relates.
The Director of Finance shall
negotiate the terms of each Hedge
Agreement with a counterparty satisfying the credit criteria in this
Ordinance. The City shall receive a
written opinion of a Financial Advisor that the payments made or to be
made by the counterparty to the
City, or by the City to the counterparty, shall be fair value for the
Hedge
Agreement,
considering,
among other things, the credit of
the counterparty and the terms and
conditions of the Hedge Agreement.
The Director of Finance shall determine the terms and conditions of the
Hedge Agreement, including without limitation, the rates to be paid
by the counterparty to the City and
by the City to the counterparty
under the Hedge Agreement, the
time or times and procedures for the
exercise by the counterparty or the
City, as the case may be, of any
option under the Hedge Agreement,
and whether the obligations of the
City under the Hedge Agreement
shall be secured by a Credit Support
Instrument and, if so, the terms and
conditions of such Credit Support
Instrument. The approval of each
interest rate hedge transaction by
the Director of Finance shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing
and
delivery
of
the
applicable
Hedge Agreement by the Director of
Finance. The Director of Finance is
further authorized to terminate any
Hedge Agreements or any Credit
Support
Instrument
securing
a
Hedge Agreement if the Director of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the City’s best interests
will be served by such termination.
Any payments owed by the City
upon termination of a Hedge Agreement may be paid from the proceeds
of Refunding Certificates or from
Fund Nos. 67 SF 600 and 01 SF 001
or from other money lawfully available and appropriated or to be
appropriated for that purpose, as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance.
In the event the Director of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is necessary to supplement or amend the Facility Lease or
the Trust Agreement in connection
with any Hedge Agreement or termination of any Hedge Agreement,
the Mayor and the Director of
Finance are authorized to sign and
deliver a Supplemental Lease and to
signify approval of the Supplemental Trust Agreement, approved as to
form by the Director of Law.
Section 4. Credit Support Instruments. The Director of Finance is
authorized to contract from time to
time for one or more Credit Support
Instruments for any series of Outstanding Certificates or any Hedge
Agreement if the Director determines, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, that the
Credit Support Instruments will result in savings to the City, will stabilize interest rates or minimize the
risk of increased interest expense
on or increased risks, burdens, or
other costs associated with hedging
arrangements or reserve requirements relating to those Certificates.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized to agree to the amendment, replacement, assignment or
termination of any such contract if
the Director of Finance determines,

2267

31
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the City’s
best interests will be served by such
amendment,
replacement,
assignment or termination. In the event
the Director of Finance determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that it is necessary to supplement or amend the
Ground Lease, Facility Lease or the
Trust Agreement in order to permit
the use of or to amend, replace,
assign or terminate a Credit Support
Instrument,
the
Mayor
and
the
Director of Finance are authorized
to sign and deliver a Supplemental
Ground Lease or a Supplemental
Lease or both and to signify approval of the Supplemental Trust
Agreement, approved as to form by
the Director of Law. The cost of
obtaining, amending, replacing, assigning or terminating each Credit
Support Instrument, except to the
extent paid by the Original Purchasers in accordance with the Purchase Agreement or the remarketing
agent in accordance with a remarketing agreement, shall be paid
from the proceeds of Refunding Certificates or the proceeds of remarketing or from Fund Nos. 67 SF 600
and 01 SF 001 or from other money
lawfully available and appropriated
or to be appropriated for that purpose.
Section 5. Refunding of Certificates;
Escrow
Agreements.
The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign and deliver, in the name and
on behalf of the City, one or more
escrow agreements between the City
and the Trustee, as escrow trustee,
providing for, among other matters:
the
investment
and
holding
in
escrow of the proceeds of Refunding
Certificates to be applied to the
refunding of Refunded Certificates;
the
application
of
the
moneys
derived from those investments to
the payment of the Certificate Payments on Refunded Certificates, and
the irrevocable call for redemption
of Refunded Certificates to be called
for redemption prior to maturity.
The Director of Finance shall provide for the payment of the services
rendered and for reimbursement of
expenses incurred pursuant to each
escrow agreement from proceeds of
Refunding Certificates to the extent
available and then from Fund Nos.
67 SF 600 and 01 SF 001 or from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose, as determined by
the Director of Finance. Provision
shall be made in each escrow agreement to give the Trustee any written notice of redemption required
under the Trust Agreement. The
Director of Finance and other appropriate City officials shall sign all
documents
and
take
all
other
actions necessary or appropriate on
the part of the City to effect each
such refunding in accordance with
the Trust Agreement and to cause
the Refunded Certificates to be
deemed paid and discharged, including without limitation, the retention
of an independent public accounting
firm to verify the mathematical
accuracy of the calculations relating
to the escrow. Upon the issuance
and delivery of a series of Refunding Certificates, the Trustee and the
City are authorized to disburse from
the Funds established and maintained under the Trust Agreement
such amounts of moneys as are in
excess of the balances required by
the Trust Agreement to then be
maintained in those Funds. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
give written notice to the Trustee of
the call for redemption of the
Refunded Certificates on the earli-

32
est redemption date following the
issuance of the Refunding Certificates, pursuant to the Trust Agreement and the applicable escrow
agreement.
Section 6. Determination of Base
Rent and Terms of Refunding Certificates; Application of Proceeds.
(a) Principal Components and
Term. Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is in furtherance of one
or more of the purposes set forth in
Section 2(b) of this Ordinance that
one or more series of Refunding Certificates be issued to refund Outstanding Certificates, the Director of
Finance is authorized to negotiate
and provide for the terms of the
Refunding Certificates and the Base
Rent, as amended pursuant to a Supplemental Lease, including the final
Lease Term, which shall end not
later than the final maturity of the
Outstanding Certificates, and the
annual
and
aggregate
principal
components of Base Rent. The principal amount of each series of
Refunding Certificates and the corresponding principal component of
Base Rent is to be the amount set
forth in the Purchase Agreement for
that series and shall be the amount
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
necessary (i) to pay the costs of
refunding the Refunded Certificates,
(ii) to fund any reserves required
under the Trust Agreement, (iii) to
pay costs of any Credit Support
Instruments, (iv) to pay identified
amounts owed under Hedge Agreements, and (v) to pay costs of issuing the Refunding Certificates. The
Refunding
Certificates
of
each
series shall mature on the dates and
in the respective principal amounts
set forth in the Purchase Agreement
for that series, consistent with this
Ordinance and the Trust Agreement.
(b) Interest. The Refunding Certificates may be issued as obligations bearing interest at fixed or
variable interest rates, based on the
determination of the Director of
Finance as to the financial advantage to, and best interests of, the
City, as specified in the Purchase
Agreement.
If
the
Director
of
Finance so determines, then the
method and procedure by which the
variable rate of interest to be borne
by the Refunding Certificates shall
be determined as provided in the
applicable
Supplemental
Trust
Agreement, whether by reference to
a market index, by a remarketing
agent or otherwise; provided that no
Refunding Certificates shall bear
interest at a rate in excess of twenty-five
percent
(25%)
per
year
(including any Refunding Certificate held by a provider of a Credit
Support Instrument). The Director
of Finance may determine that the
terms of a variable rate series of
Refunding Certificates may or may
not permit the holders to tender
their variable rate Refunding Certificates for purchase by the City. If
the Director of Finance designates
any series of Refunding Certificates
as variable rate Certificates, and if
the holders of that series of Refunding Certificates are to be entitled to
tender those Certificates for purchase, then the Director of Finance
shall also designate in the Purchase
Agreement for those variable rate
Certificates (and may designate others, from time to time, in substitution therefor), the tender agent or
agents and the remarketing agent
or agents, which designations shall
be based on the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the

The City Record
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the parties so designated
possess the requisite resources and
experience to provide the services
required of them and that the terms
on which the designated parties
have agreed to provide such services are fair and commercially reasonable.
(c) Optional and Mandatory Redemption. The Refunding Certificates of each series, and the corresponding principal component of
Base Rent, may be subject to redemption prior to maturity at the
option of the City, if and to the
extent set forth in the Purchase
Agreement for that series. Any Refunding Certificates so determined
to be subject to optional redemption
and maturing by their stated terms
after the earliest optional redemption date shall be subject to redemption at the option of the City on or
after the earliest optional redemption date in whole or in part on any
date at the redemption prices set
forth in the Purchase Agreement
and in accordance with the applicable Supplemental Trust Agreement.
The Refunding Certificates designated in the Purchase Agreement as
term Certificates subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption shall
be redeemed prior to maturity on
each mandatory redemption date
designated in the Purchase Agreement in the aggregate amount of
the sinking fund installment to be
paid on such mandatory redemption
date, all as provided in the Purchase
Agreement and in accordance with
the Supplemental Trust Agreement.
(d) Credit Support and Other Instruments. The Director of Finance,
regardless of whether a series of
Refunding Certificates bears interest at variable or fixed rates, is
authorized to contract for one or
more Credit Support Instruments, if
the Director of Finance determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the Credit
Support Instruments will result in a
savings in the cost of the financing
to the City or will stabilize interest
rates
or
minimize
the
risk
of
increased interest expense in connection with the Facility Lease and
the Certificates. The costs of such
Credit Support Instruments may be
paid from proceeds of Refunding
Certificates or from Fund Nos. 67 SF
600 and 01 SF 001 or from other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose, as determined by the
Director of Finance. The Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements in connection with the
delivery of the Refunding Certificates, and from time to time thereafter so long as the Refunding Certificates
are
outstanding,
with
providers of Credit Support Instruments, tender agents (which may be
the Trustee), remarketing agents
(which may be any of the Original
Purchasers) and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the method of
determining the variable interest
rates, permitting holders the right
of tender and providing for payment
of the purchase price of, or Certificate Payments on, the variable rate
Refunding Certificates.
(e) Base Rent. The City acknowledges that the aggregate principal
amount of Outstanding Certificates
shall be based on the aggregate
principal component of Base Rent
under the Facility Lease and that
the interest on the Certificates shall
be based on the interest components
of Base Rent. The Base Rent to be
payable under and in accordance

2268

December 9, 2009
with the Facility Lease during any
Lease Term shall be an amount sufficient to cover the amount of Certificate Payments on the Outstanding Certificates that are due and
payable during that Lease Term,
and such Base Rent shall be specified or determined in an exhibit to
the Facility Lease; provided, however, that the City's payment of Base
Rent and Additional Rent is Subject
to Appropriation and Certification
as provided in the Facility Lease
and nothing in the Facility Lease,
the Certificates, the Trust Agreement, or any Hedge Agreement constitutes or shall constitute a pledge
by the City, or an obligation of the
City, of any taxes or other moneys
to the payments due thereunder.
(f) Primary Offering Disclosure.
If, in the judgment of the Director
of Finance after consultation with
the Original Purchasers, a disclosure document is appropriate relating to the initial offering of one or
more series of Refunding Certificates, the Director of Finance, on
behalf of the City and in that officer's official capacity, is authorized
to (i) cooperate with the Original
Purchasers in the preparation of,
and the making of modifications,
completions or changes of or supplements to, such a disclosure document, (ii) determine, and certify or
otherwise represent when the disclosure document is to be deemed
final or is final, (iii) authorize the
use and distribution of that disclosure document and any supplements
thereto in connection with the initial offering of the applicable series
of Refunding Certificates, and (iv)
sign certificates, statements or other
documents in connection with the
finality, accuracy and completeness
of that disclosure document. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
contract for services for the production and distribution of any disclosure statements, including by printed and electronic means.
(g) Continuing Disclosure. If and
to the extent required by Rule 15c212 promulgated by the Securities
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
or by a Purchase Agreement in connection with the sale of one or more
series of Refunding Certificates or
by a remarketing agreement in connection with remarketed Certificates, the City shall enter into continuing
disclosure
agreements,
approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, between the
City and the Trustee, with terms not
inconsistent with this Ordinance and
as may be approved by the officers
signing those agreements on behalf
of the City, all of which shall be
conclusively evidenced by that signing. In each such continuing disclosure agreement, the City shall agree
to provide, or cause to be provided,
financial information and operating
data,
financial
statements
and
notices in such manner as may be
required for purposes of that Rule.
The Director of Finance is authorized to sign and deliver each continuing disclosure agreement and
any related agreements, certificates
and other instruments, and to deliver such information, as may be necessary or appropriate to comply
with the requirements of the Rule.
The City understands and agrees
that those commitments are intended to be for the benefit of the holders from time to time of the applicable series of Refunding Certificates, including holders of bookentry interests in those Certificates.
(h) Application for Ratings. If, in
the judgment of the Director of
Finance, the filing of applications

December 9, 2009
for one or more ratings on Refunding Certificates by one or more
nationally recognized rating agencies is necessary or desirable for
marketing purposes, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare
and submit those applications, and
to provide information as may be
required in support of those applications for the purpose. The cost of
obtaining each such rating, except
to the extent paid by the Original
Purchasers in accordance with the
Purchase Agreement, shall be paid
from the proceeds of the Refunding
Certificates to the extent available
and then from other money lawfully available and appropriated or to
be appropriated for that purpose.
(i) Application of Proceeds; Costs
of Issuance. The proceeds from the
sale of the Refunding Certificates
shall be deposited and applied as
provided in the Supplemental Indenture and for the purposes stated in
this Ordinance and are appropriated
for those purposes. Costs of issuing
the Refunding Certificates that are
not paid from those proceeds may be
paid from Fund Nos. 67 SF 600 and
01 SF 001 or from other money lawfully available and appropriated or
to be appropriated for that purpose,
as determined by the Director of
Finance.
Section 7. Sale of the Refunding
Certificates; Purchase Agreements.
The Director of Finance shall sign
and deliver Purchase Agreements
for Refunding Certificates setting
forth the conditions for delivery of
the Refunding Certificates that are
consistent with this Ordinance and
the Trust Agreement and that are

Director
of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
customary for lease certificates of
participation issued by governmental entities, including, without limitation, representations as to the
accuracy and completeness of information contained in the disclosure
document described in Section 6 of
this Ordinance. In the event the
Refunding Certificates are issued in
more than one series sold at different times, a separate Purchase
Agreement shall be signed and
delivered for each separately delivered series. The Purchase Agreement shall provide for the sale of
the applicable series of Refunding
Certificates to the Original Purchasers selected by the Director of
Finance and identified in the Purchase Agreement, based on an evaluation of the qualifications of firms
that have proposed to underwrite

written advice of a Financial Advisor, consistent with this Ordinance
and the Trust Agreement:
(a) the aggregate principal amount
of Refunding Certificates issued;
(b) the Purchase Price for the Refunding Certificates;
(c) whether any Refunding Certificates are to be subject to optional redemption prior to maturity, and,
if so, the earliest optional redemption date for those Refunding Certificates subject to prior redemption,
which shall be not later than ten
years from the first interest payment date of the applicable series,
and the applicable redemption price,
which shall be not greater than
102% of the principal amount redeemed;
(d) the dates on which principal
of the Refunding Certificates is to

The City Record
than thirty-five (35) years from
their respective dates of issuance,
with an identification of whether
the payment is due by stated maturity or by mandatory sinking fund
redemption of Refunding Certificates of a particular maturity;
(e) the interest rates to be borne
by Refunding Certificates bearing
interest at a fixed rate, the weighted average of which shall not exceed eight percent (8%) as to Refunding Certificates of any series,

at variable rates, consistent with
Section 6;
(f) the particular Outstanding
Certificates or portions thereof to be
Refunded Certificates;
(g) the title and series designation for the Refunding Certificates;
(h) the amount, if any, of proceeds of the sale of the Refunding
Certificates to be deposited in the
Reserve Account in order to cause
the balance therein to equal the
Reserve Requirement, if and to the
extent required by the applicable
Supplemental Trust Agreement, and
any determination as to whether
there shall be a special reserve fund
for the Refunding Certificates of
any series, separate from the common Reserve Account, or a surety or
insurance policy, bank letter or line
of credit, or other form of credit or
liquidity
facility
enhancing
the
security for Refunding Certificates
of that series in lieu of a funded
reserve fund;
(i) whether any Refunding Certificates are to be secured by or
payable
from
a
Credit
Support
Instrument.
It is determined that the terms of
the Refunding Certificates and the
corresponding terms of Base Rent as
so determined within the limitations
set forth in this Ordinance and as
so specified and set forth in the Purchase Agreement will be in the best
interest of the City and consistent
with all legal requirements.
Section 8. Remarketing. In the
event that the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
it is advantageous to the City to
convert the interest on any Outstanding Certificates bearing interest at variable rates to fixed interest rates for a period of time or to
maturity or to convert to a different
variable rate period or mode, or to
terminate or take other actions with
respect to any existing Credit Support Instrument that will require a
tender and remarketing of any Outstanding
Certificates
under
the
Trust Agreement (such conversion
or other actions and the tender and
remarketing being collectively referred to in this Section as “remarketing”), the City shall undertake
the remarketing of those Certificates in accordance with the Trust
Agreement. In connection with any
remarketing
of
Certificates,
the

and the Certificates of any series
will not (i) constitute private activity bonds, arbitrage bonds or hedge
bonds under Sections 141, 148 or 149

than as obligations to which Section
103(a) of the Code applies, and (b)
the interest components of Base

will not be treated as an item of tax
preference under Section 57 of the

purpose of assuring, enhancing or
protecting favorable tax treatment

based, and other facts and circumstances relevant to the tax status of
the Facility Lease and the Certificates.
The City hereby covenants it will
take or cause to be taken such
actions that may be required of it
for the interest components of Base
Rent and interest on the Certificates
to achieve and maintain the intended treatment and status for federal
income tax purposes and that it will
not take or authorize to be taken
any actions that would adversely
affect that treatment and status.
Each covenant made pursuant to
this Section with respect to a series
of Certificates is also made with
respect to all issues any portion of
the principal of or interest on which
is paid from proceeds of that series
of Certificates (and, if different, the
original issue and any refunding
issues in a series of refundings), to
the extent such compliance is necessary to assure the tax status of
the Certificates of that series, and

Amount and Purpose. This Council

interests of the City to authorize the
issuance of Refunding Bonds as
Additional Bonds under the Trust
Indenture, subject to satisfaction of
the requirements of Section 165.07 of
the Ohio Revised Code, for the purpose of refunding one or more series
of Outstanding Bonds, or designated
portions thereof, to obtain debt service savings or to obtain a more
favorable debt service schedule, or
to eliminate or modify covenants in
agreements
securing
Outstanding
Bonds that are unduly restrictive, or
to eliminate or modify burdensome
reserve requirements, or, in the case
of Outstanding Bonds that are variable rate bonds, to stabilize interest
rates
or
to
minimize
risks
of
increased interest expense on those
Bonds, including costs associated
with related Credit Support Instruments. The principal amount of the
Refunding Bonds is to be the
amount set forth in the Certificate
of Award authorized in Section 3
and shall be the amount determined
by the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, to be necessary (i) to refund the Outstanding Bonds being
refunded, (ii) to fund any deposit to
the Bond Reserve Fund, (iii) to pay
costs of any Credit Support Instruments, and (iv) to pay costs of issuing the Refunding Bonds and refunding the Outstanding Bonds being refunded. The proceeds from the
sale of the Refunding Bonds shall
be deposited and applied as provided in the Supplemental Trust Indenture for the Refunding Bonds and
for the purposes stated in this Ordinance, and those proceeds are appropriated for those purposes.
Section 3. Terms of Refunding
Bonds. The final terms of the Refunding Bonds shall be set forth in
a written certificate to be signed
and delivered by the Director of
Finance upon the sale of the Refunding Bonds upon terms and conditions consistent with this Ordinance and that in her opinion, based
on the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, are in the best interests
of the City (the “Certificate of
Award”).
The
Refunding
Bonds
shall be dated the date of issuance
or such other date as is designated
in the Certificate of Award. The
Refunding Bonds shall mature on
the dates and in the respective principal amounts determined in the

36
Certificate of Award, provided that
the final maturity date shall be not
later than 30 years from the date of
issuance of the Refunding Bonds.
The Refunding Bonds shall bear
interest from their date at the rate
or rates per year set forth in the
Certificate of Award, or if any
Refunding Bonds bear interest at a
variable rate, at the rate determined
from time to time pursuant to the
method identified in the Certificate
of Award and set forth in the Trust
Indenture, and the Refunding Bonds
shall bear interest at those rates
until the principal amount of the
Refunding Bonds is paid or payment
is provided for. Interest on the
Refunding Bonds shall be payable
on the dates determined or provided
for in the Certificate of Award and
the Trust Indenture. If any Refunding Bonds bear interest at a fixed
rate, that rate shall not exceed eight
percent (8%) per year. If any Refunding Bonds bear interest at a
variable rate or rates, those rates
shall not exceed that set forth
below.
In the event that the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, determines that the City’s best interests
will be served by causing all or a
portion of the Refunding Bonds to
be obligations bearing interest at
variable rates, redeemable by the
City without penalty or premium on
interest adjustment dates, then the
Director of Finance is authorized to
so specify in the Certificate of
Award. If the Director of Finance so
determines, then the Director of
Finance shall specify in the Certificate of Award the method and procedure by which the variable rate of
interest to be borne by the variable
rate Refunding Bonds shall be determined, whether by reference to a
market index, by a remarketing
agent or otherwise; provided that
the variable rate Refunding Bonds
shall not bear interest at a rate in
excess of twenty-five percent (25%)
per year (including any Refunding
Bonds held by a provider of a Credit Support Instrument). Holders of
variable rate Refunding Bonds may
be given the right to tender their
variable rate Refunding Bonds for
purchase by the City at the times,
on the terms, and subject to the conditions set forth in the Certificate of
Award and the Trust Indenture. If
the Director of Finance designates
any Refunding Bonds as variable
rate Refunding Bonds, and if the
holders of the variable rate Refunding Bonds are to be entitled to tender the variable rate Refunding
Bonds for purchase, then the Director of Finance shall also designate
in the Certificate of Award for those
variable rate Refunding Bonds the
provider or providers for any Credit Support Instrument, the tender
agent or agents and the remarketing agent or agents, which designations shall be based on the determination of the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the parties
so designated possess the requisite
resources and experience to provide
the services required of them and
that the terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide
such services are fair and commercially reasonable. The Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements in connection with the
delivery of the variable rate Refunding Bonds, and from time to time
thereafter so long as the variable
rate Refunding Bonds are outstand-

The City Record
ing, with providers of Credit Support
Instruments, tender agents (which
may be the Trustee), remarketing
agents, and others as may be determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, to be necessary
or appropriate to provide for the
method of determining the variable
interest rates, permitting holders
the right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support for the payment of the variable rate Refunding
Bonds upon tender for purchase or
redemption, and providing for the
repayment by the City of any
amounts drawn under the Credit
Support Instrument.
The Director of Finance shall further determine and specify in the
Certificate of Award whether any of
the Refunding Bonds are subject to
optional redemption prior to maturity, the earliest date on which redeemable Refunding Bonds shall be
subject to prior redemption, and the
applicable redemption premium for
the redeemable Refunding Bonds.
The Refunding Bonds may be subject to purchase by the City in lieu
of optional redemption if and to the
extent provided in the Certificate of
Award and the Trust Indenture.
Section 4. Form; Exchange; Execution. The Refunding Bonds shall
be issued in fully registered form.
The Refunding Bonds initially shall
be delivered only in book entry
form, shall be registered in the
name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository, and shall not be transferable
or exchangeable (except for transfer to another Depository or its nominee) without further action by the
City pursuant to the provisions of
the Trust Indenture. The principal
and any redemption premium and
the interest payable on each Refunding Bond shall be payable at the
times, to the persons and in the
manner set forth in, or referenced
by, the Trust Indenture, including,
without limitation, provisions thereof permitting special arrangements
for payments to the Depository. The
Refunding Bonds shall be signed by
the persons and in the manner set
forth in the Trust Indenture. The
Refunding Bonds shall be numbered
as determined by the Director of
Finance.
Section
5.
Sale
of
Refunding
Bonds. The Refunding Bonds shall
be sold at not less than (i) 97% of
par plus aggregate original issue
premium and minus aggregate original issue discount plus (ii) accrued
interest at private sale by the Director of Finance to one or more financial institutions selected by the
Director of Finance based on an
evaluation of the qualifications of
firms that have proposed to underwrite the Refunding Bonds (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”) in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance and the Certificate
of Award. The Director of Finance
shall cause the Refunding Bonds to
be prepared, and have the Refunding Bonds signed and delivered,
together with a true transcript of
proceedings with reference to the
issuance of the Refunding Bonds if
requested by the Original Purchaser, to the Original Purchaser upon
payment of the purchase price. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign and deliver, in the name and
on behalf of the City, a bond purchase agreement between the City
and the Original Purchaser, or representative thereof (the “Purchase

2272

December 9, 2009
Agreement”), containing terms consistent with this Ordinance and that
are determined by the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
customary for revenue bonds issued
by governmental entities, including,
without limitation, representations
as to the accuracy and completeness
of information contained in the official statement of the City described
in Section 11. The Director of
Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and
for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement from the proceeds of the
Refunding Bonds to the extent
available and then from the Program Funds or from other money
lawfully available and appropriated
or to be appropriated for that purpose, as determined by the Director
of Finance. The Mayor, the Director
of Finance, the Clerk, the Director
of Law, and other City officials, as
appropriate, are each authorized to
sign
any
transcript
certificates,
financial statements and other documents and instruments and to take
such actions as are necessary or
appropriate
to
consummate
the
transactions contemplated by this
Ordinance.
Section 6. Security for the Refunding Bonds. The Refunding Bonds
shall be special obligations of the
City, and the debt charges on the
Refunding Bonds shall be payable
solely from the Net Project Revenues and the Nontax Revenues.
The payment of debt charges on the
Refunding Bonds is secured by a
pledge of and lien on the Bond Fund
held by the Trustee under the Trust
Indenture and by any reserve fund
for which provision is made in the
Trust Indenture. The Refunding
Bonds are not and shall not be
secured by an obligation or pledge
of any money raised by taxation.
The Refunding Bonds do not and
shall not represent or constitute a
debt or pledge of the faith and credit or taxing power of the City, and
the owners thereof have and shall
have no right to have taxes levied
by the City for the payment of debt
charges thereon. The Refunding
Bonds shall contain a statement to
that effect and to the effect that the
Refunding Bonds are payable solely
from the Net Project Revenues and
the Nontax Revenues and are not
secured by an obligation or pledge
of any money raised by taxation.
The City covenants and agrees
that while the Refunding Bonds are
outstanding, it will appropriate and
maintain Nontax Revenues at such
times and in such amounts as will
be sufficient, together with the Net
Project Revenues and any other
funds available for the purpose, to
pay the debt charges on the Bonds
and will so restrict other obligations
payable from Nontax Revenues prior
to or on a parity with the Bonds as
will ensure the continuing availability for appropriation of sufficient Nontax Revenues to pay debt
charges when due.
Section
7.
Payment
of
Debt
Charges on the Refunding Bonds.
Nothing herein shall be construed as
requiring the City to use or apply to
the payment of debt charges on the
Refunding Bonds any funds or revenues from any source other than
Net Project Revenues and the Nontax Revenues. Subject to the requirements of Revised Code Section
176.04,
nothing
herein,
however,
shall be deemed to prohibit the City,
of its own volition, from using, to

December 9, 2009
the extent that it is authorized by
law to do so, any other resources for
the fulfillment of any of the terms,
conditions or obligations of this
Ordinance or of the Refunding
Bonds.
The City will, solely from the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds or
from the Net Project Revenues or
the Nontax Revenues, pay or cause
to be paid the debt charges on the
Refunding Bonds on the dates, at
the places and in the manner provided herein and in the Refunding
Bonds. For that purpose, in each
year while the Refunding Bonds are
outstanding, this Council, after providing for the payment of debt
charges payable on the City’s general obligation securities in that
year from sources available for that
purpose, will appropriate Nontax
Revenues required to pay, and for
the purpose of paying, the debt
charges due in that year on the
Bonds (less other money available
for the purpose) and any outstanding parity obligations payable from
Nontax
Revenues.
Further,
this
Council will give effect to such
appropriations in all Ordinances it
passes thereafter in that year appropriating money for expenditure and
encumbrance and limit the other
appropriations of Nontax Revenues
in that year to the amount available
after deducting the amount required
for the payment of debt charges
payable on the City’s general obligation securities and to pay those
debt charges. The City covenants
that, so long as any of the Refunding Bonds are outstanding, it shall
not issue any additional obligations
payable from the Nontax Revenues
on a parity with the Bonds and any
other outstanding parity obligations
payable
from
Nontax
Revenues,
unless, prior to passage of the Ordinance authorizing such parity obligations, the Director of Finance shall
have certified to this Council that
the Nontax Revenues during the preceding calendar year, adjusted to
reflect, if necessary, changes in the
rates or charges resulting in the
Nontax
Revenues,
aggregate
in
amount not less than 100% of the
highest amount of (a) debt charges
on the Bonds and (b) required payments on such proposed parity obligations and any other outstanding
parity obligations due in any succeeding calendar year.
Each obligation of the City required to be undertaken pursuant to
this Ordinance and the Refunding
Bonds is binding upon the City, and
upon each officer or employee of the
City as may from time to time have
the authority under law to take any
action on behalf of the City as may
be necessary to perform all or any
part of such obligation, as a duty of
the City and of each of those officers and employees resulting from
an office, trust or station within the
meaning of Section 2731.01 of the
Revised Code, providing for enforcement by writ of mandamus.
Section 8. Authorization of Supplemental Trust Indentures. The
Director of Finance is authorized, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
to sign and deliver to the Trustee,
in trust for the holders of the Refunding Bonds, one or more Supplemental Trust Indentures, approved
as to form and correctness by the
Director of Law, not inconsistent
with this Ordinance or the Certificate of Award, and not substantially adverse to the City as may be
approved by the Director of Finance.
The determination by the Director

The City Record
of Finance that a Supplemental
Trust Indenture is not substantially
adverse to the City shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing and
delivery of that Supplemental Trust
Indenture
by
the
Director
of
Finance. Any Supplemental Trust
Indenture may contain amendments
to the Trust Indenture, as theretofor
amended, or amend and restate the
Trust Indenture, to permit the City
to obtain a Credit Support Instrument, to eliminate the Land Sales
Fund and to release from the lien
of the Trust Indenture any money
on deposit in the Land Sales Fund,
or to permit increased flexibility for
the use of financial or credit structures and techniques determined by
the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, to be in the best interests
of the City.
Section 9. Refunding of Series 2004
Bonds;
Escrow
Agreement.
The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign and deliver, in the name and
on behalf of the City, an escrow
agreement between the City and the
Trustee, as escrow trustee, providing for, among other matters: the
investment and holding in escrow of
the
proceeds
of
the
Refunding
Bonds to be applied to the refunding of the Series 2004 Bonds; the
application of the moneys derived
from those investments to the payment of the debt service charges on
the Series 2004 Bonds; and the irrevocable call for redemption of the
Series 2004 Bonds. The Director of
Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and
for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the escrow agreement from proceeds of the Refunding Bonds to the extent available
and then from Program Funds or
from other money lawfully available
and appropriated or to be appropriated for that purpose, as determined
by the Director of Finance. Provision shall be made in the escrow
agreement to give the Trustee any
written notice of redemption required under the Trust Indenture.
The Director of Finance and other
appropriate City officials shall sign
all documents and take all other
actions necessary or appropriate on
the part of the City to effect such
refunding in accordance with the
Trust Indenture and to cause the
Series 2004 Bonds to be deemed paid
and discharged, including without
limitation, the retention of an independent firm of accountants to verify the mathematical accuracy of
the calculations relating to the
escrow.
Section 10. Conversion and Remarketing. In the event that the Director of Finance determines, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, that it is advantageous to
the City to convert the interest on
any Series 2008 Bonds to fixed interest rates for a period of time or to
maturity, or to convert the interest
on any Series 2008 Bonds to a different variable rate period or mode,
the City shall undertake the conversion and remarketing in accordance with the Trust Indenture. In
connection with any conversion and
remarketing of Series 2008 Bonds,
the Director of Finance is authorized to obtain one or more Credit
Support Instruments if the Director
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the Credit Support Instrument will
facilitate the remarketing of the
Series 2008 Bonds. In the event the
Director
of
Finance
determines,

2273

37
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that it is necessary to supplement or amend the
Trust Indenture or any Supplemental Trust Indenture in order to address current market conditions or
to permit the use of a Credit Support Instrument or to otherwise obtain financing arrangements advantageous to the City, the Director of
Finance is authorized to sign and
deliver an amendment of the Trust
Indenture or Supplemental Trust Indenture, or an amended and restated Trust Indenture or Supplemental
Trust Indenture, approved as to
form by the Director of Law. The
costs of any conversion and remarketing of the Series 2008 Bonds may
be paid, as determined by the Director of Finance, from the Program
Funds or, to the extent available,
from Fund 01 SF 001 and remarketing proceeds, or from other money
lawfully available and appropriated
or to be appropriated for that purpose. The Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare one or more
disclosure documents in connection
with any conversion and remarketing under the same terms and conditions as set forth in Section 11 of
this
Ordinance
with
respect
to
Refunding Bonds. The Director of
Finance and other City officials are
authorized to sign and deliver such
instruments, certificates and documents as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions
authorized by this Section. The
Director of Finance, the Director of
Law and other City officials, as
appropriate, are authorized to make
the
necessary
arrangements
on
behalf of the City to establish the
date, location, procedure and conditions for the conversion and remarketing of any Bonds and to take all
actions necessary to effect the conversion and remarketing of any
Bonds under the terms of this Ordinance and the Trust Indenture. The
Clerk of Council or other appropriate official of the City shall furnish
the Trustee a true transcript of proceedings certified by the Clerk or
other official, of all proceedings had
with reference to the conversion and
remarketing of any Bonds along
with
such
information
for
the
records as is necessary to determine
the validity of the conversion and
remarketing.
Section 11. Official Statements;
Continuing Disclosure. The Director
of Finance is authorized, on behalf
of the City and in her official capacity, to (i) prepare or cause to be prepared, and make or authorize modifications, completions or changes of
or supplements to, disclosure documents in the form of a preliminary
official statement relating to the
issuance of the Refunding Bonds,
and (ii) determine, and certify or
otherwise represent, when the preliminary official statement as so
prepared is a “deemed final” official
statement
(except
for
permitted
omissions) by the City as of its date
for
purposes
of
Securities
and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Rule
15c2-12(b)(1). The distribution and
use of a preliminary official statement is authorized and approved.
The Director of Finance is also
authorized, on behalf of the City
and in her official capacity, to complete the preliminary official statement
with
such
modifications,
changes and supplements as the
Director of Finance shall approve or
authorize for the purpose of preparing and determining, and to certify
or otherwise represent, that the offi-

38
cial statement as so revised is a
final official statement for purposes
of SEC Rule 15c2-12(b) (3) and (4).
The Director of Finance is further
authorized to use and distribute, or
authorize the use and distribution
of, a final official statement and
supplements thereto in connection
with the original issuance of the
Refunding Bonds as may, in her
judgment, be necessary or appropriate. The Director of Finance is further authorized to sign and deliver,
on behalf of the City and in her official capacity, a final official statement and such certificates in connection with the accuracy of the preliminary official statement and the
final official statement and any
amendments thereto as may, in their
judgment, also be necessary or appropriate. The Director of Finance
is authorized to contract for services
for the production and distribution
of preliminary and final official
statements, including by printed and
electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Refunding Bonds, the City
agrees, in accordance with, and as
an obligated person with respect to
the Refunding Bonds under, SEC
Rule 15c2 12, to provide or cause to
be provided such financial information and operating data and notices,
in such manner, as may be required
for purposes of SEC Rule 15c2 12. In
order to describe and specify certain
terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for that purpose,
and
thereby
to
implement
that
agreement, including provisions for
enforcement, amendment and termination, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare, or cause to be
prepared, and to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
a continuing disclosure agreement
or certificate, which shall constitute
the continuing disclosure agreement
made by the City for the benefit of
the holders and beneficial owners of
the Refunding Bonds in accordance
with SEC Rule 15c2 12. The performance of that agreement shall be
subject to the availability of funds
and their annual appropriation to
meet
costs
the
City
would
be
required to incur to perform it.
Section 12. Ratings; Credit Enhancement. If, in the judgment of
the Director of Finance, based on
written advice of a Financial Advisor, the filing of an application for
a rating on the Refunding Bonds by
one or more nationally recognized
rating agencies is in the best interests of the City, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare
and submit those applications and to
provide to each such agency such
information as may be required for
the
purpose.
The
Director
of

The City Record
Finance is authorized to contract for
one or more Credit Support Instruments for any Outstanding Bonds
bearing interest at variable rates or
for the Refunding Bonds if she
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the Credit Support Instruments will
result in debt service savings to the
City, or will stabilize interest rates
on those Bonds or will minimize the
risk of increased interest expense
on those Bonds. The cost of obtaining each rating and each Credit Support
Instrument,
except
to
the
extent paid by the Original Purchaser in accordance with the Purchase Agreement, shall be paid from
the
proceeds
of
the
Refunding
Bonds or the Program Funds or
from other money lawfully available
and appropriated or to be appropriated for that purpose, as determined
by the Director of Finance.
Section 13. Financial Advisor. The
Director of Finance may obtain the
services of one or more Financial
Advisors, from time to time, to
assist the Director of Finance in
making any of the determinations
required by this Ordinance to be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance. The Director of Finance
may rely on the written advice of
any Financial Advisor so retained.
Any Financial Advisor or consultant
employed under the authority of this
Ordinance shall be disinterested in
the transaction and be independent
of the underwriters and any other
party interested in the transaction.
Section 14. Captions, Headings,
and Section References. The captions and headings in this Ordinance
are solely for convenience of reference and in no way define, limit, or
describe the scope or intent of any
Sections, subsections, paragraphs,
subparagraphs, or clauses hereof.

Section 15. Severability. Each section of this Ordinance and each subdivision or paragraph of any section
is hereby declared to be independent
and the finding or holding of any
section or any subdivision or paragraph of any section to be invalid
or void shall not be deemed or held
to affect the validity of any other
section, subdivision or paragraph of
this Ordinance.
Section 16. Interpretation. Any provisions of the Codified Ordinances
of the City which are inconsistent
with the provisions of this Ordinance
shall not apply to the Bonds or matters authorized herein. Nothing in
this Ordinance is intended to, and no
provision hereof shall be applied in
any manner as would, impair the
obligation of contract of the City
with respect to any outstanding

December 9, 2009
bonds, certificates of indebtedness,
other obligations, Trust Indentures
or other agreements or contracts
made or entered into by the City.
Section 17. Validity. This Council
finds and determines that this Ordinance was passed in compliance
with all applicable provisions of the
City’s Charter and the rules of this
Council. This Council further finds
and determines that all acts and
conditions necessary to be done or
performed by the City or to have
been met precedent to and in the
issuing of the Refunding Bonds in
order to make them legal, valid, and
binding special obligations of the
City have been performed and have
been met, or will at the time of
delivery of the Refunding Bonds
have been performed and have been
met, in regular and due form as
required by law, and that no limitation of indebtedness or taxation,
either statutory or constitutional, is
applicable to the issuance of the
Refunding Bonds.
Section 18. Compliance with Open
Meeting Requirements. This Council
finds and determines that all formal
actions of this Council and any of
its committees concerning and relating to the passage of this Ordinance
were taken in an open meeting of
this Council or committees, and that
all deliberations of this Council and
any of its committees that resulted
in those formal actions were in
meetings open to the public, all in
compliance with the law.
Section 19. Sunset of Authorization. The authority granted by this
Ordinance shall expire two years
from the effective date of this Ordinance. If a preliminary official
statement with respect to the Refunding Bonds is distributed under
the authority of this Ordinance at
any time within the two-year period
following its effective date, then the
authority granted by this Ordinance
shall not expire as to those Refunding Bonds. The Director of Finance
shall notify the Chairman of the
Finance Committee and the Clerk of
this Council of the initiation of the
issuance of any Refunding Bonds
under the authority of this Ordinance.
Section 20. Emergency. This Ordinance is hereby declared to be an
emergency measure and, provided it
receives the affirmative vote of twothirds of all members elected to
Council, it shall take effect and be
in force immediately upon its passage and approval by the Mayor;
otherwise it shall take effect and be
in force from and after the earliest
period allowed by law.
