cities of Akron, Ohio and St. Louis,
Missouri,
and
other
local
and
national municipalities, community
leaders, politicians, donors, sponsors, and citizens to support Cleveland’s bid for the Gay Games 2014;
and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
and its partners have already contributed approximately $500,000 in
funding and in-kind services in
preparation to prepare and secure
the bid to host the Gay Games 2014
and under this legislation the City
of Cleveland is contributing an additional $700,000 in grant funding plus

Conservation Fund for a $2,000,000
grant for acquisition of the approximately 2.73-acre Rivergate parcel,
located at 1758 Merwin Avenue in
the Downtown Cleveland Flats District, related to the Rivergate Project.
Whereas, The City of Cleveland is
engaged and active with the Cleveland Rowing Foundation and other
stakeholders in the planning of the
Rivergate Project; and
Whereas, the Rivergate Project
presents a unique opportunity to reunite the residents of Greater Cleveland with the Cuyahoga River and
to reclaim 2.73 acres of currently
vacant
and
industrialized
area,
regenerating and revitalizing it as
a public space serving as a central
hub of human powered boating
activity on the Cuyahoga River with
rowing, kayaking, dragon boats,
and canoes, and riverside hiking,
bicycling, public art, fishing and
bird watching opportunities; and
Whereas, the Cleveland Rowing
Foundation
is
applying
for
a
$2,000,000 grant from the Clean Ohio
Conservation Fund for the acquisition of the approximately 2.73-acre
Rivergate parcel, located at 1758
Merwin Avenue in the Downtown
Cleveland Flats District; and
Whereas, the Rivergate Parcel is
a portion of a total approximately
6.5-acre property currently known as
the
Commodore’s
Club
Marina
(“CCM”); and
Whereas, with the acquisition of
the Rivergate Park property for
public purposes, the Cleveland Rowing Foundation will purchase the
remaining 3.70 acres of the CCM
property, utilizing its own private
funding (an estimated $1,200,000
investment), and will relocate its
operations to the adjoining parcel
allowing it the ability to steward
and maintain the Rivergate Park
parcel for public use, enjoyment,
and riverfront access; and

September 16, 2009
Whereas, the vision to re-imagine
Cleveland as a Green City on a Blue
Lake has included plans to restore
and make accessible Cleveland’s
waterfront, and the Rivergate project is unprecedented in its immediate effect in implementing this
vision; and

immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

An emergency resolution urging

Whereas, the U. S. Postal Service
has recently announced they plan to
close possibly 24 area post offices in

Whereas, the City of Cleveland
and the Southeast side have worked
extremely hard over the years to

and
Whereas, if the Cranwood Station

devastate the Harvard Avenue commercial corridor and the adjacent
residential communities and especially seniors in Cleveland’s Ward 1

to the Clean Ohio Conservation Fund
for the acquisition of the approximately 6-acre St. Joseph Lakeshore
Conservation easement located at
18485 Lakeshore Boulevard, in the
North Shores Collinwood neighborhood.

The City Record
Whereas, the City of Cleveland is
engaged and active with the Northeast Shores Development Corporation and other stakeholders in planning the St. Joseph Lakeshore Conservation Easement, Lakefront Access & Habitat Restoration Project;
and
Whereas, the St. Joseph Lakeshore Conservation Easement is a
unique opportunity to reunite the
residents of Greater Cleveland with
Lake Erie and to preserve 6 acres
of currently vacant land on the historic site of the former St. Joseph
Retreat Center, a designated City of
Cleveland Landmark, regenerating
and revitalizing it as a public space
serving as a neighborhood park,
habitat restoration site and allowing
public access to the shores of Lake
Erie; and
Whereas, the Northeast Shores Development Corporation is applying
for a $651,500.00 grant from the
Clean Ohio Conservation Fund for
the acquisition of the approximately 6-acre St. Joseph Lakeshore Conservation Easement, located at 18485
Lakeshore Boulevard, in the North
Shores Collinwood neighborhood of
the City; and
Whereas, the St. Joseph Lakeshore Conservation Easement is a
portion of a total of approximately
12-acres of property currently owned
by the Hospice of the Western Reserve; and
Whereas, with the acquisition of
the St. Joseph Lakeshore Conservation Easement for public purposes,
the Northeast Shores Development
Corporation intends to transfer the
Conservation Easement to the City
of Cleveland to hold for public use,
enjoyment, habitat restoration and
lakefront access; and
Whereas, the Hospice of the Western Reserve, as fee owner, is committed to steward, maintain and
abide by the conditions of the conservation easement to facilitate its
use for public purposes and habitat
restoration objectives; and
Whereas, the vision to re-imagine
Cleveland as a Green City on a Blue
Lake has included plans to restore
and make accessible Cleveland’s
lakefront, the St. Joseph Conservation Easement project provides an
immediate result in implementing
this vision; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the Northeast Shores Development Corporation’s grant application

An emergency resolution supporting ParkWorks’ application to the
Clean Ohio Fund for $414,675 to
acquire two parcels for “Phase II of
the Lake Link Trail and Greenway
Corridor” on the West Bank of the
Flats, and provide public access to
Lake Erie for residents of contiguous neighborhoods in the City of
Cleveland.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has been a partner with ParkWorks
and other stakeholders in planning
the Lake Link Trail; and
Whereas, a previous Clean Ohio
Fund application in 2008 is allowing
ParkWorks to acquire most of the
land necessary for the Trail, while
certain additional parcels remain to
be acquired and design funding is
needed; and
Whereas, acquisition of the currently proposed parcels and associated design work is a critical step
toward transforming abandoned urban
infrastructure with a recreational
greenway and natural resource corridor connecting the Towpath Trail
and the future Canal Basin Park to
the Lake Erie shoreline at Whiskey
Island; and
Whereas, acquisition of the parcels at 75% of their appraised value
will allow ParkWorks to use the
25% discount as matching funds,
satisfying the Clean Ohio Fund’s
requirement for a match of local
resources; and
Whereas, the Lake Link will provide a connector to the Towpath
Trail, connecting Lake Erie to a 100mile trail that leads to the Cuyahoga Valley National Park and
beyond, and will also run adjacent
to several civic and cultural landmarks including the West Side Market, Tower City and the lower Flats
district; and
Whereas, the Lake Link will provide significant green space, recreational opportunities and exposure
to nature for residents of adjacent
neighborhoods including the Flats,
Ohio City, Tremont, Downtown, and
the nearly 1,200 residents of public
housing estates at Lakeview Terrace and Riverview; and
Whereas, the trail will support the
nearly $100 million investment that
has been made in new housing
development on the west bank of
the Flats; and
Whereas, the parcels will increase
habitat protection and preserve natural features in a heavily urbanized
area, contributing to the quality of
life of City of Cleveland residents;
and

28
Whereas, the parcels will be naturalized to collect and treat stormwater flowing toward the Cuyahoga
River, helping to reduce stormwater
run-off throughout the Flats; and
Whereas, ParkWorks, working in
cooperation with the City of Cleveland, will determine the best entity
to hold both the land following
acquisition and to provide maintenance for the trail; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports ParkWorks’ application to the
Clean Ohio Fund for $414,675 to
acquire two parcels for “Phase II of
the Lake Link Trail and Greenway

Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
certified copy of this resolution to
ParkWorks.
Section 3. That this resolution is

shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
