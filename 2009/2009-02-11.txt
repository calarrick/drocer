Public Health Director shall consider any evidence ascertained through
inspections
of
the
property
or
through the submission of evidence
regarding nuisances or conditions
that are unsafe or unsanitary relative to the subject property and, in
particular, any recorded violations.
The Director of Public Health may
deny a license on consideration of
such evidence.
(2) Notification in Residential Districts. Upon receipt of an initial
license application for a property
located in a Residential zoning district, the Department of Public
Health shall send a copy of the
license application, along with a
comment form, to the owner of each
property directly adjoining the property that is the subject of the
license application. A copy of these
notifications shall be transmitted to

(c)
License
Expiration.
Such
license shall expire at the end of a
