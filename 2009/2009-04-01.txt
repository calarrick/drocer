things,
amends Revised Code Section 5501.51
(now requiring only the state to
reimburse a utility for the cost of
relocation and adjustment necessitated by the construction of a state
highway project, provided the utility can present detailed evidence of
its costs, as required by statute) by
including whichever governmental
entity,
such
as
municipalities,
among others, that is directing an
improvement financed in whole or
in part by federal ARRA funds, as
an entity required to reimburse utilities for the cost relocation and
adjustment in such case; and
Whereas, Am. Sub. H.B. 2 also provides that cities must bear the full
cost of utility relocation, even if the
project is only partially funded by
ARRA funds; and
Whereas,
Ohio
Department
of
Transportation (“ODOT”) representatives have indicated that if utility
facilities are located in a construction project area under a local permit, local communities may unable
to
obtain
reimbursement
from
ARRA federal funds for the costs of
relocation, which would face municipalities with the burden of paying
all costs of utility relocations from
local monies, not federal dollars;
and
Whereas, utilities’ payments of
local permit fees for operating in
public rights-of-way are completely
insufficient, if not insignificant,
compared to the cost of relocating
and adjusting utilities’ facilities;
and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland, as
well as other municipalities’ applications for ARRA funding of their
important infrastructure projects had
been submitted and their project
applications already had been accepted before Am. Sub. H.B. 2 without
opportunity to include or compensate
for the amounts of utilities relocation
and adjustment payment obligations
that would be imposed by H.B. 2, a
fact never addressed by proponents
of H.B. 2; and

The City Record
Whereas, further, Am. Sub. H.B. 2
has no provisions for meeting goals
of equitable local participation, such
as minority and female business
enterprises, local businesses, and
local residents, in the significant
contracting opportunities which will
be possible under the ARRA plan
and if passed, we are calling on the
Governor to line item veto this
Amendment; and
Whereas, because of the complexity and severity of these issues, the
HB 2 Conference Committee was
formed to deliberate the above-stated and other issues presented to
them; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health,
or safety in that Am. Sub. H.B. 2
places such an enormous economic
obligation on the City of Cleveland
that it will jeopardize the City’s
ability to fund, partially or wholly,
Cleveland’s approved infrastructure
projects envisioned under ARRA
because of this additional unforeseen and unfunded expense; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the H.B. 2 Conference Committee to
improve Amended Substitute House
Bill No. 2, passed by the Ohio Senate on March 19, 2009, by removing
municipal reimbursement of utility
relocations from ARRA-funded projects and also be amended to include
participation of minority and female
business enterprises, local businesses, and local residents in eligible
contracts.
Section 2. That this resolution is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Motion to suspend rules, Charter,

An emergency resolution urging
the Governor and legislature of the
State of Ohio to use federal economic recovery funds to promote
goods and services made or performed by American citizens and
companies.
Whereas, the economic downturn is
having a critical impact on everyday
Americans who are struggling to
maintain or find jobs in an increasingly difficult environment; and
Whereas, those same Americans
are the taxpayers that provide the
revenue needed to operate essential
government services; and

550

April 1, 2009
Whereas, Congress has approved
and President Obama has signed
into law a taxpayer-sponsored economic recovery package that will
provide billions of dollars to help
economically devastated cities and
states immediately provide jobs to
millions of out-of-work Americans
through considerable infrastructure
rebuilding, green energy projects
and other projects that will require
manufactured components; and
Whereas, our taxpayer dollars
should be spent to maximize the creation of American jobs and restoring the economic vitality of our communities; and
Whereas, any domestically produced products that are purchased
with economic recovery plan monies
will immediately help struggling
American families and will help stabilize our greater economy; and
Whereas, any economic recovery
plan spending should – to every
extent possible – include a commitment from the Governor to buy
goods and services for projects from
companies that are produced within
the United States, thus employing
the very workers that pay the taxes
for the economic recovery plan
spending in the first place; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that Ohio’s Governor and legislature
must maximize the creation of
American jobs, and restore economic growth and opportunity by spending economic recovery plan funds on
products and services that both create jobs and help keep Americans
employed; and
Whereas, the State of Ohio’s Governor and legislature should commit
to purchasing only products and
services that are made or substantially made, or performed in the
United States, and wherever and
whenever possible made or performed in Ohio, with any economic
recovery monies provided to Ohio by
the American taxpayers; and
Whereas, this Council strongly
encourages the Governor and the
state legislature to commit to publish any requests to waive these procurement priorities so as to give
American workers and producers
the opportunity to identify and provide the American products and services that will maximize the success
of our nation’s economic recovery
program; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the Governor and legislature of the State of Ohio to use federal economic recovery funds to promote goods and services made or
performed by American citizens and
companies.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Governor
Ted Strickland and all members of
the Ohio legislature.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force

April 1, 2009
immediately upon its adoption and

An emergency resolution urging
President Obama to form a National
Commission on Fatherhood.
Whereas, 80% of children who
were born in the “post-war generation” could expect to grow up with
two biological parents who were
married to each other; and
Whereas, today, only about 50% of
America’s children will spend their
entire childhood in an intact family;
and
Whereas, in the United States, 24
million children, or 34%, live without their biological father; and
Whereas, nearly 20 million children (27%) in the United States live
in single parent households; and
Whereas, in 2006, a single parent
headed 26.2% of households in Ohio
with minor children; and
Whereas, in 2006, in Ohio, 40.4%
of newborns were born to unmarried
parents; in several counties, this
rate was even higher; and
Whereas, divorce and non-marital
childbearing have become commonplace in the United States, dramatically altering children’s lives; and
Whereas, nationally, about 40% of
children
in
father-absent
homes
have not seen their father at all during the past year; about 50% of children living without their father
have never set foot in their father’s
home; and
Whereas, children who live without their biological fathers are, on
average, at least two to three times
more likely to be poor, to use drugs,
to experience health, educational,
emotional and behavioral problems,
to be victims of child abuse and to
engage in criminal behavior than
their peers who live with their married, biological, or adoptive parents;
and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
and Cuyahoga County have groups
that address the above issues on a
local level and the Ohio Commission
of Fatherhood has been reestablished in order to address fatherhood at the state level; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that the above concerns are so pervasive in the U.S., that they should
also be addressed on the national
level as well; and
Whereas, Council member Kevin
Conwell was named 2001 National
Father of the Year; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,

The City Record
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
President Obama to form a National

Section 2. That the Clerk is directed to transmit certified copies of

Obama, Governor Ted Strickland,

being issued, or agency liquor contracts from being entered, if the
permit location or liquor agency
store is to be located within 500
feet from a school, church, library,

playground
or
township
park.
Whereas, the State of Ohio’s current process for issuing liquor permits and entering in agency liquor
contracts allows nearly twice as
many liquor establishments than
there are people residing in the city
of Cleveland; and
Whereas, state law now requires
only that a school, church, library,
public playground, or township park
be notified if a proposed agency
liquor store is to be located within
500 feet of it; and
Whereas, Senate Bill 62 would require that no agency permits would
be issued, or agency liquor contracts
be entered into, if the proposed location is within 500 feet of a school,
church, library, public playground,
or township park; and
Whereas, Senate Bill 62 would
help the City gain control over the
number of liquor establishments in
its neighborhoods, and be better
able to ensure that such establish-

ments are in appropriate locations
in the City; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the

An emergency resolution urging
the U.S. Congress to pass the
Youth
PROMISE
Act
to

Whereas, the Youth PROMISE
Act provides federal resources to

violence and crime at the local
level; and
Whereas, the Youth PROMISE Act
is supported by over 200 national

Whereas, new provisions of the
Youth PROMISE Act provide additional grants to high intensity
gang localities to reduce or alleviate the effects of gang violence,
