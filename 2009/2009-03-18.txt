Ord. No. 308-09.
By Council Member Sweeney (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Finance to enter
into one or more contracts with The
Parking Network for professional
services necessary to implement and
administer the Parking Facility Tax
Discovery Program and Audit Initiative, for a period up to two years.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
one or more contracts with The
Parking Network to implement and
administer the Parking Tax Discovery Program and Audit Initiative for
a period up to two years, on the
basis of their proposal dated November 7, 2008, for the Department of
Finance. Under this program The
Parking Network will, among other
things, identify all revenue generating parking facilities in the City of
Cleveland. From that, The Parking
Network will discover which parking facilities have not reported any
parking
revenue,
and
therefore,
have paid no Parking Facility Tax
to the City. They will also identify
which parking facilities, although
reporting, are underreporting parking revenues collected and therefore, have underpaid the correct
amount of Parking Facility Tax to
the City. The Parking Network will
also
educate
parking
providers
about the requirements of the Parking Facility Tax Program.
Section 2. That the agreement
shall provide that the City will pay
The Parking Network contingency
fees of thirty percent (30%) of qualified revenue assessed and received
by the City of Cleveland. Qualified
revenue is defined as additional tax
receipts, including penalties and
interest,
over
and
above
such
amounts already being collected by
the City of Cleveland that are clearly and directly attributable to the
performance of The Parking Network and not subject to further
appeal under law. Qualified revenue
shall be limited to the period of
three (3) years before and three (3)
years after the identification of

366

March 18, 2009
additional tax receipts as such identification may be defined by mutual
agreement.
Section 3. That the contingency
fees shall be paid from Fund No. 01150301-632000, Request No. 183321.
Section 4. The agreement shall be
prepared by the Director of Law.
Section 5. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Referred to Directors of Finance,
Law; Committee on Finance.
Ord. No. 309-09.
By Council Members Brancatelli,
Brady, Cimperman and Sweeney (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance to vacate
a portion of Morgana Avenue S.E.
Whereas, under Resolution No.
506-08, adopted June 9, 2008, this
Council declared its intent to vacate
a portion of Morgana Avenue S.E.;
and
Whereas, notice of the adoption of
the above vacation was served on
the abutting property owners affected by the resolution which stated a
time and place when objections
would be heard before the Board of
Revision of Assessments; and
Whereas, on February 10, 2009 the
Board of Revision of Assessments
approved the above vacation under
the provisions of Section 176 of the
Charter of the City of Cleveland;
and
Whereas, this Council is satisfied
that there is good cause for vacating a portion of the above and that
it will not be detrimental to the general interest and that it should be
made; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council declares that the following described
real property is vacated:
Being all that portion of Morgana
Avenue S.E. (60 feet wide) extending Easterly from the Easterly line
of East 55th Street (width Varies)
(projected Northerly to the Westerly line of Ackley Road S.E. (60 feet
wide).
Legal Description approved by
Greg Esber, Section Chief, Plats,
Surveys and House Numbering Section.
Section 2. That there is reserved
to the City of Cleveland a right of
way easement of full width as
described above for the Division of
Water Pollution Control.
That no structures shall be erected on the premises described in this
easement except those constructed
under the approval of, and in compliance with, plans approved by the
Division of Water Pollution Control
and the City of Cleveland.
Section 3. That provided all required approvals have been obtained, the Commissioner of Engi-

March 18, 2009
neering and Construction is directed
to record the vacation plat in the
office of the Recorder of Cuyahoga
County.
Section 4. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit a copy of
this ordinance to the Auditor of
Cuyahoga County.
Section 5. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

vicinity of 205 St. Clair and declaring the easement rights not needed
for public use; and authorizing the
Director of Public Service to issue
one or more permits to Cuyahoga
County and the Greater Cleveland
Regional Transit Authority to encroach into the public right-of-way
in and near the vicinity of 205 St.
Clair Avenue by installing, using,

City as a landmark or landmark district, the Commission shall apply the
following criteria with respect to
such property:
(1) Its character, interest or value
as part of the development, heritage
or cultural characteristics of the
City, State or the United States;

March 18, 2009
the culture and development of the
City;
(4) Its exemplification of the cultural, economic, social or historic
heritage of the City;

extension and enhancement of the
architectural character of the exterior of the building or structure and
is related to the exterior in a direct
manner.
(b) Designation of Interior Public
Spaces of Buildings or Structures.
(1) No interior public space, or
part or feature of any interior public space, shall be considered designated for preservation under this
chapter unless it has been specifically designated after the initial
effective date of this subsection.
(2) The designation of a building,
structure, or district shall not constitute designation of any interior
public space, or part or feature of
any interior public space, unless the
interior public space, or part or feature, is specifically identified in the
designation of the building, structure, or district.
(3) An interior public space of a
building or structure, or any part or
feature of the interior public space,
may be designated for preservation
regardless of whether the remainder
of the building, structure, site, or
appurtenances with which it is associated have been designated.
(c) If the Commission finds that
any area, place, building, structure,
interior public space, part or feature
of an interior public space, work of
art, or similar object in the City
meets the criteria in (a) above, it
shall propose its designation as a
landmark or landmark district, and

the event that the owner refuses or

The City Record
declines to give written consent to
the proposed designation, the Commission shall schedule a public hearing on the question of the proposed
designation, and shall cause written
notice to be given by regular mail
to the owner of record. The Commission also shall cause a legal
notice to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the
City setting forth the nature of the
hearing, the property involved and
the date, time and place of the
scheduled public hearing.
(2) For designation of an area as
a Landmark District, the Landmarks
Commission shall schedule a public

written notice of the hearing and
the proposed designation to be given

interior
public
spaces, parts or features of interior
public spaces, works of art, and
other similar objects as a landmark
or landmark district. Council may,
in its discretion, hold public hearings on any proposed designation,
whether designation is proposed
only with the consent of the owner,
or after public hearings before the
Commission. Before passage, the
ordinance
designating
an
area,
place, building, structure, interior
public space, part or feature of an
interior public space, work of art, or
similar object in the City as a landmark or landmark district shall be
submitted to the Planning Commission for report and recommendation.
(6) As soon as is reasonably possible after passage of an ordinance
designating an area, place, building,
structure, interior public space, part
or feature of an interior public space,
work of art, or similar object in the
City as a landmark or landmark district, the Commission shall notify the
Department of Building and Housing

of this chapter, Council may rescind
the designation of any area, place,
building, structure, interior public
space, part or feature of an interior
public space, work of art, or similar
object as a landmark or landmark
district by ordinance. Passage of
such an ordinance shall relieve the
owner of such area, place, building,
structure, interior public space, part
or feature of an interior public
space, work of art, or similar object
from any duties or penalties contained in this chapter.
161.05
Regulation of Environmental Changes; Certificate of Appropriateness
No person owning, renting or occupying property which has been designated a landmark or which is situated in a designated landmark district shall make any environmental
change in such property unless a
certificate of appropriateness has
been previously issued by the Commission with respect to such environmental change. The following
procedures shall apply to all alterations, demolitions, removals, or constructions of such property in the
City:
(a) Any application to the Department of Building and Housing for a
building permit for an environmental change shall also be deemed an
application
for
a
certificate
of
appropriateness, and shall be forwarded to the Commission, together
with copies of all detailed plans,
designs, elevations, specifications
and
documents
relating
thereto,
within seven days after receipt
thereof. An application for a certificate of appropriateness may be filed
by the applicant directly with the
Commission at the same time that
an application for a building permit
is filed or in lieu of filing for a
building permit, if no building permit is required for the proposed
environmental change.
(b) The Commission shall evaluate
applications
to
determine
whether or not the environmental
change proposed by the applicant
will adversely affect any significant
historical or aesthetic feature of the
property and to determine whether
or not the environmental change
proposed by the applicant is consistent with the spirit and purposes of
this chapter.
(1) In evaluating applications for
alterations or construction of property, the Commission shall consider
the following standards created by
the U.S. Department of the Interior:
A. A property shall be used for its
historic purpose or be placed in a

10
new use that requires minimal
change to the defining characteristics of the building and, its features,
spaces, site, and environment;
B. The historic character of a
property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic
materials or alteration of features
and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided;
C. Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its
time, place, and use. Changes that
create a false sense of historical
development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural
elements from other buildings, shall
not be undertaken;
D. Most properties change over
time;
those
changes
that
have
acquired historic significance in
their own right shall be retained
and preserved;
E. Distinctive features, finishes,
and
construction
techniques
or
examples
of
craftsmanship
that
characterize a property shall be preserved;
F. Deteriorated historic features
shall
be
repaired
rather
than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature
shall match the old in design, color,
texture, and other visual qualities
and,
where
possible,
materials.
Replacement of missing features
shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence;
G. Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that
cause damage to historic materials
shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate,
shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible;
H. Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall
be protected and preserved. If such
resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken;
I. New additions, alterations to
property, features, spaces, or related
new construction shall not destroy
historic materials that characterize
the property. The new work shall be
differentiated from the old and shall
be compatible with the massing,
size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment; and
J. New additions and adjacent or
related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that
if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment
would be unimpaired.
(2) In evaluating applications for
demolition or removal of property,
the Commission shall consider the
following standards:
A. The architectural and historic
significance of the subject building,
structure, interior public space, or
part of feature of the interior public space;
B. The significance of the building, structure, interior public space,
or part or feature of the interior
public space in contributing to the
architectural or historic character of
its environs;
C. In the case of a request to move
a building, structure, interior public
space, or part or feature of the interior public space, the relationship
between the location of the subject

The City Record
building or structure and its overall
significance;
D. The present and potential economic viability of the subject building, structure, interior public space,
or part or feature of the interior
public space, given its physical condition and marketability;
E. If the demolition will remedy
conditions imminently dangerous to
life, health, or property, which imminently dangerous conditions have
been determined in writing by the
Department of Building and Housing, the Division of Fire or the
Department of Public Health; and
F. The appropriateness of the proposed new structure, interior part or
feature, or use and its impact on the
surrounding community.
(c) If the Commission finds that
the environmental change proposed
by the applicant will not adversely
affect any significant historical or
aesthetic feature of the property and
is appropriate and consistent with
the spirit and purposes of this chapter,
or
that
the
environmental
change proposed by the applicant is
the only means to remedy conditions
imminently dangerous to life, health
or property, which imminently dangerous conditions have been determined in writing by the Department
of Building and Housing or the Division of Fire or the Department of
Public Health, then the Commission
shall issue a certificate of appropriateness.
(d) If the Commission finds that
the environmental change proposed
by the applicant will adversely
affect any significant historical or
aesthetic feature of the property or
is inappropriate or inconsistent with
the spirit and purposes of this chapter, the Commission may either deny
the application or delay action on
the application. Any decision to
delay action on the application shall
be by mutual agreement of the Commission and the applicant and shall
be for a period not to exceed six (6)
months. During the delay period, the
Commission shall conduct further
investigation with regard to the proposed environmental change, conduct negotiations with the applicant
and any other party in an effort to
find a means of preserving the property, or explore alternatives to the
proposed environmental change. The
Commission may also investigate
the feasibility of all available ways
and
means
of
preserving
the
improvement, interior public space,
or part or feature of the interior
public space, including without limitation, inducing by contract or
other consideration the creation of
covenants restricting the use of
property, leasing and subleasing the
property for the purposes of preservation and acquiring by eminent
domain or contract or conveyance
all or any part of or interest in the
property.
(e) At the end of the delay period, the Commission shall either
approve or deny the application, or
delay action. A decision to delay
action, at the end of one delay period, shall be by mutual agreement of
the Commission and the applicant
and shall be for a period not to
exceed six (6) months. The Commission shall only agree to a second
and final delay period if the Commission determines that this additional time period may be useful in

372

March 18, 2009
securing an alternative to the proposed environmental change. At the
end of the second and final delay
period, the Commission shall either
approve or deny the application for
a certificate of appropriateness.
(f) Upon the issuance, denial or a
delay in the issuance of a certificate
of appropriateness, the Commission
shall give written notices of the
issuance, denial or delay in the
issuance to the applicant and the
Department of Building and Housing. The Commission shall provide
written
notice
of
the
issuance,
denial or delay in the issuance of a
certificate of appropriateness to the
applicant and the Department of
Building and Housing within forty
five (45) days of the receipt by the
Commission of an application from
either the applicant or the Department of Building and Housing.
(g) If no action has been taken
by the Commission on an application for a certificate of appropriateness to approve, deny or delay
action within forty-five (45) days
after such application has been
received by the Commission, the certificate of appropriateness shall be
deemed issued.
161.06 Powers and Duties of Commission

following powers and duties in addition to those otherwise specified in
this chapter:
(a) The Commission shall conduct
a continuing survey of all areas,

March 18, 2009
Ord. No. 319-09.
By Council Members Brady, Cimperman and Sweeney (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Public Service to
apply to the Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency for various
infrastructure projects throughout
the City and accepting eligible funding; authorizing the director to enter
into one or more local project agreements with the State of Ohio to fund
and construct any portion of the
improvements; giving consent of the
City of Cleveland to the State of
Ohio to make the improvements;
authorizing the director to enter
into any agreements relative thereto; authorizing the director to employ one or more professional consultants to implement the improvements;
authorizing
the
Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies to
acquire for right-of-way purposes
such real property and easements as
are necessary to make the improvements; authorizing contracts with
railroads and the Greater Cleveland
Regional Transit Authority; to cause
payment to the State of Ohio, or
other entities, of the City’s share of
the cost of the improvements; and
authorizing the director to apply for
and accept gifts or grants from any
public or private entity for this purpose.
Whereas, one of the economic benefits under the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act of 2009, also
known as the Stimulus Bill, Pub.L.
111-5, H.R.1, S. 1 (“ARRA”), allowed
states to become eligible to receive
federal funding for various infrastructure projects; and
Whereas, Northeast Ohio projects
are being approved for this funding
through the Northeast Ohio Areawide
Coordinating Agency (“NOACA”); and
Whereas,
according
to
federal
law, projects selected for ARRA
funds must be on the State Fiscal
Years 2008–2011 Transportation Improvement Program (the “TIP”).
The TIP includes federal-aid highway, transit and bikeway projects
that are scheduled for implementation within a four-year period in the
NOACA region; and
Whereas, the West 77th Street
Bridge Project and the Aetna Road
Projects are already on the 20082011 TIP, and have been approved
by NOACA for funding by the
NOACA portion of the ARRA funds;
and
Whereas, it is the desire that, in
addition to the West 77th Street
Bridge Project and the Aetna Road
Project, seven other infrastructure
projects be included on the TIP in
order to receive ARRA funds and
also to collectively advance their
legislative authority to become as
close as possible to becoming “shovel-ready” projects; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Public Service is authorized to apply
to NOACA to pursue federal ARRA
economic assistance, on behalf of
the City of Cleveland, for the following projects in the following
approximate amounts:

The City Record
1. The Rehabilitation of Willow
Lift Bridge over Cuyahoga River,
in
the
approximate
amount
of
$2,500,000;
2. The Avenue District, Ph IV:

Superior Ave. to Chester Ave., in the
approximate amount of $800,000;
3. The Rehabilitation of Center

Res. No. 317-09.
By Council Member Kelley.
An emergency resolution objecting to the renewal of a D1, D2, D3
and D3A Liquor Permit at 4716 State
Road.
Whereas, the uniform date for
renewal of liquor permits in the
State of Ohio is October 1st; and
Whereas,
pursuant
to
Section
4303.271 of the Revised Code, the legislative authority of a municipal corporation may object to the renewal
of a permit based upon legal grounds
as set forth in division (A) of Revised Code Section 4303.292; and
Whereas, the applicant is unfit to
continue to engage in the liquor permit business in that he has operated his liquor permit business in a
manner that demonstrates a disre-

The City Record
gard for the laws, regulations or
local ordinances of the state, and
that this objection is based on other
legal grounds as set forth in Revised Code Section 4303.292; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.271 of the Ohio Revised Code,
objections to renewal of liquor permits shall be made no later than
thirty days prior to the expiration
date of the permit; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby record its objection to the renewal of a D1, D2, D3 and D3A Liquor
Permit, Permit No. 8440222 owned by
Sports Inn LLC, 4716 State Road, lst
floor and basement, Cleveland, Ohio
44109 and requests the Director of
Liquor Control to set a hearing for
said application in accordance with
provisions of Section 4303.271 of the
Revised Code of Ohio.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she is hereby directed to
transmit two certified copies of this
resolution, together with two copies
of a letter of objection and two
copies of a letter requesting that
the hearing be held in Cleveland,
Cuyahoga County, and a statement
by the Director of Law that, in the

Res. No. 318-09.
By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency resolution encouraging the Honorable Congresswoman
Fudge, Congressman Kucinich, Senator Brown, and Senator Voinovich to
assist Mr. Fred McGee in receiving a
Medal of Honor from the Department
of the Army for his heroism in the
Korean War.
Whereas, Fred McGee, now 78 is
a Korean War hero who received
the Silver Star, the United Nations
Service Medal, the Combat Infantry
Badge, two Purple Hearts, the Korean Service Medal, and the Bronze
Service Star; and
Whereas, Mr. McGee was passed
over for the Medal of Honor, which
his commanding officer promised to
nominate him for; and
Whereas, as a 22-year-old black
steelworker from Smithville, Ohio,
McGee fought with some of the first
integrated Army troops in the Korean War; and
Whereas, on June 16, 1952, in a
battle near Tang-Wan-Ni, Korea, cor-

383

21
poral McGee took command of his
platoon, even though not in line to
take the lead, after his squad leader
was wounded and the second in
command froze in the face of enemy
fire; and
Whereas, heroic McGee fired at
machine gun nests and held off the
enemy as his platoon continued
fighting up the hill, and ignored his
wounds when injured to continue
fighting until orders came to retreat; and
Whereas, his courage in battle
was immortalized in a 1953 issue of
Heroic Comics, a comic book dedicated to war heroes, but the comic
book honor came with a backhanded slight – the artist drew McGee as
a white man; and
Whereas, McGee’s anger over the
comic has long since cooled, but he
is still fighting for the Medal of
Honor; and
Whereas, McGee started trying to
get his Silver Star upgraded to the
Medal of Honor in 1955, but never
received it, and believes his race
had to do with being passed over,
as no black soldier had ever gotten
the award between the Civil War
and the Korean War; and
Whereas, in 1995, Department of
the Army officials denied McGee’s
request for the Medal of Honor
mainly because his commanding
officer had died 11 years earlier and
they claimed there was no firsthand
testimony about the promise of an
award; and
Whereas, McGee’s supporters include the Belmont County Council of
the Veterans of Foreign Wars,
which passed a 2001 resolution in
favor of the Medal of Honor, and
Congressman Charles Wilson Jr., a
Democrat from St. Clairsville, who is
trying to move the medal process
forward through the Army Review
Boards Agency that examines claims
before recommending them to members of Congress; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council encourages the Honorable Congresswoman Fudge, Congressman Kucinich, Senator Brown, and Senator
Voinovich to assist Mr. Fred McGee
in receiving a Medal of Honor from
the Department of the Army for his
heroism in the Korean War.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
Congresswoman Fudge, Congressman Kucinich, Senator Brown, Senator Voinovich, and Mr. Fred McGee.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

with plans, specifications and profiles, at the estimated cost of
$776,020, prepared and placed in File
No. 87-09-A, in the Office of the Clerk

Section
2.
That
fifty
percent
(50%) of the cost and expense of

after the passage of the assessing
ordinance.
Section 4. That the remainder of
the cost of the improvement not specially assessed, as provided, shall be
paid by the City of Cleveland out of
funds made available to it by other
sources and appropriated for such
purpose.

authorized to prepare and file in the
Office of the Clerk of Council an

of
the

Res. No. 283-09.
By Council Member Cleveland.
An emergency resolution declaring this Council’s support of the proposed St. John’s West Family Homes
project which will provide for the
development and construction of affordable housing using low-income
tax credits from the Ohio Housing
Finance Agency.
Whereas, each year the Ohio
Housing Finance Agency allocates
low-income
housing
credits
for
affordable
housing
developments
throughout Ohio using a competitive
proposal process; and
Whereas, the Cleveland City Council has recognized the need to maintain affordable housing in Cleveland’s neighborhoods; and
Whereas, Burten, Bell, Carr Development, Inc. is the local community
development corporation and has
applied for low income tax credits
for the St. John’s West Family
Homes project; and
Whereas, the proposed project will
contain up to 40 three and four-bedroom single family homes on scattered sites located at and around
East 37th, East 38th, and East 39th
Streets and Stanley Tolliver Avenue,
all in the city of Cleveland; and
Whereas, all of these homes will
be for residents earning 60% or less
of the median local income in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, adjusted for
household size; and

The City Record
Whereas, none of these units are
targeted for a special needs population as defined in the 2007 Qualified
Allocation Plan; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
supports the proposed St. John’s
West Family Homes project for the
benefit the citizens of the City of
Cleveland; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the proposed St. John’s West
Family Homes project for the development of affordable housing using
low-income
housing
tax
credits
awarded
by
the
Ohio
Housing
Finance Agency.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
one certified copies of this resolution to the Executive Director of

approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period

Effective March 10, 2009.

Res. No. 286-09.
By Council Members Zone, Coats,
Westbrook, Pierce Scott, Conwell,
Brancatelli, Cleveland, Brady and
Keane.
An emergency resolution supporting the City’s Appeal and Cuyahoga
County’s Local Emergency Planning
Committee’s opposition to the Final
Rule by the U.S Department of
Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administrator regarding transportation of hazardous materials by rail.
Whereas, on November 26, 2008,
the U.S. Department of Transportation, through its Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administrator (“PHMSA”), issued a Final Rule
regarding the transporting of hazardous materials by rail; and
Whereas, on December 19, 2008,
the City of Cleveland, filed an
Appeal to the Final Rule and the
Local Emergency Planning Committee (“LEPC”) of Cuyahoga County
has written a letter in opposition to
the Final Rule; and
Whereas, one of the City of Cleveland’s chief concerns is that the
PHMSA has not adequately considered the risks associated with the
transportation of different types and
classes of hazardous materials warranting enhanced safety and security measures; and
Whereas, the City’s Appeal further argues that the Final Rule did
not define and establish an unambiguous, expeditious and direct process for local government officials
to promptly obtain commodity data
or affect routing decisions in a timely manner to prevent a catastrophic
release or explosion of hazardous
materials; and
Whereas, the LEPC is concerned
that the Final Rule does not provide
for direct input or exchange of
information between the railroads,
the federal agencies and local and

398

March 18, 2009
state governments; that local and
state governments have no practical
method of appeal if they take issue
with the railroads about alternative
routes and there is no requirement
for cooperation between the railroad
companies; and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
the City’s interest in the transportation of hazardous materials by rail
because of concerns over local safety and security of its rail lines, especially the Lakefront Rail line that
runs through heavily populated areas
of the City and along the City’s main
water source, Lake Erie; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the City’s Appeal and Cuyahoga County’s Local Emergency
Planning Committee’s opposition to
the Final Rule by the U.S Department of Transportation’s Pipeline
and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administrator regarding transportation of hazardous materials by rail.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
the U.S Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administrator, Office of
the Administrator, and to the Cuyahoga
County
Local
Emergency
Planning Committee.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

By Council Members Cimperman,
Coats, Pierce Scott, Sweeney, Brady,
Brancatelli, Cleveland, Conwell, Cummins, Dow, Johnson, Keane, Kelley,
Mitchell, Polensek, Pruitt, Reed, Santiago, Westbrook, Wilkes and Zone.
An emergency resolution in support of restoring the Ohio Urban
University Program in the Ohio
State budget.
Whereas, the Ohio Urban University Program (UUP) was created by
the Ohio General Assembly and the
Board of Regents in 1979 to link the
resources of Ohio’s urban universities with the revitalization efforts of
its urban communities; and
Whereas, the Urban University
Program is the oldest statewide
inter-university program in the United States and a national model; and
Whereas, the Ohio Urban University Program and the Levin College
of Urban Affairs are the State’s foremost urban public policy and economic development resources; and
Whereas, between 2000 and 2009
the UUP budget was reduced by 37
percent, from $8.2 to $5.2 million; and
Whereas, the impact of the previous reductions on the Levin College
alone has forced it to cut $1.5 million in operating costs including
more than 20 positions; and
Whereas, now the program has
been removed entirely from the Governor’s budget, putting at risk the

March 18, 2009
capacity to respond to State needs
that has been built up over the past
30 years; and
Whereas, the research products of
the UUP have addressed nearly
every major economic development
initiative of the State, including
Business Tax Reform, Tax Code
Restructuring,
Program
Development
and
Evaluation,
Economic
Development Strategy, and Land
Reuse and Redevelopment; and
Whereas, restoring funding will
enable the Levin College and the
seven other urban university research centers across the state –
The University of Akron, the University of Cincinnati, Kent State
University, The Ohio State University, the University of Toledo, Wright
State University, and Youngstown
State University – to maintain the
high level of economic development,
public management and community
development services the State has
come to rely on;
Whereas, the Cleveland State University Board of Trustees and this
Council strongly support funding the
UUP at $3.5 million, a one-third reduction from its FY 2009 amount, and
eliminating all non-UUP related line
items from the UUP budget line; and
Whereas, on March 6, 2009, the
Cleveland City Planning Commission voted to express support for
continued full funding for Ohio’s
Urban University Program; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports restoring the Ohio Urban University Program in the Ohio State
Budget.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
Governor Strickland, Ohio General
Assembly, Cleveland State University Board of Trustees, Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs,
and Mayor Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Res. No. 288-09.
By Council Members Cimperman,
Kelley, Zone, Brady, Wilkes, Pruitt
and Mitchell.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio General Assembly to authorize the Ohio Department of Transportation’s budget request for investments in the Ohio Hub and 3C Corridor passenger rail to leverage its
application for federal funding from
the $8 billion economic stimulus package for high-speed passenger rail.
Whereas, the 3C Corridor is a passenger rail line connecting Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati and
is part of the larger Ohio Hub plan
to connect 44 of Ohio’s cities to each
other and the rest of the nation; and
Whereas, federal economic stimulus funds are being sought to connect Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton

The City Record
and Cincinnati in a passenger rail
system serving 60% of the state’s
population, and to enhance existing
Amtrak services via new or expanded stations in the Ohio cities of
Toledo, Sandusky, Elyria, Cleveland,
Ravenna and Youngstown; and
Whereas, with 35 other states
developing or implementing statewide passenger rail projects, support for the Ohio Hub is critical for
securing a competitive advantage
for our state; and
Whereas, economic stimulus requests need to be submitted to the
U.S. Department of Transportation
(USDOT) well in advance of April
18th, when the USDOT must report
to Congress its strategic plan for
the use of passenger rail stimulus
funding, and state dollars invested
in the hub will leverage federal
funding; and
Whereas, the proposed 3C Corridor
would create thousands of new construction jobs, permanent operating
jobs and indirect jobs, increase demand for U.S. manufactured concrete and steel materials, and increase transit-oriented development
and tourism; and
Whereas, 80.2% of Ohioans when
polled support state efforts to develop passenger train services in Ohio;
and
Whereas, Ohio’s airports and roadways are congested, the world faces
a dwindling supply of oil, and trains
are among the most energy efficient
way to move people; and
Whereas, as a result of climate
change we need to take every possible step towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions into our endangered atmosphere; and
Whereas, the Ohio Hub invests in
the railroads to achieve public benefits and to generate significant
local economic development activity;
and
Whereas, the 3C Corridor ceased
operation in 1971 and Cleveland
would be greatly enhanced by restoring passenger rail service to
these areas; and
Whereas, the Ohio Hub will increase Cleveland Hopkins Airport
traffic by 5% and create a $0.5 to $1
billion economic benefit; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio General Assembly to authorize the Ohio Department of Transportation’s budget request for investments in the Ohio Hub and 3C
Corridor passenger rail to leverage
its application for federal funding
from the $8 billion economic stimulus package for high-speed passenger rail.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
Governor Strickland, Ohio General
Assembly, the Ohio Department of
Transportation and Mayor Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and

March 18, 2009
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

The Director of Public Safety
shall cause the general public to be
notified by means of a press release
issued at least thirty days before
any given camera is made fullyoperational and is used to issue tickets to offenders. Before a given camera issues actual tickets, there shall
be a period of at least two weeks,
which may run concurrently with
the 30-day public-notice period, during which only “warning” notices
shall be issued.
At each site of a red light or fixed
speed camera, the Director of Public
Service shall cause signs to be posted to apprise ordinarily observant
motorists that they are approaching
an area where an automated camera
is monitoring for red light or speed
violators. Mobile speed units shall be
plainly marked vehicles.
(h) Notices of liability. Any ticket for an automated red light or
speeding system violation under this
section shall:
(1) Be reviewed by a Cleveland
police officer;
(2) Be forwarded by first-class
mail or personal service to the vehicle’s registered owner’s address as
given on the state’s motor vehicle
registration, and
(3) Clearly state the manner in
which the violation may be appealed.
(i) Penalties. Any violation of
division (b) or division (c) of this
section shall be deemed a noncriminal violation for which a civil penalty shall be assessed and for which
no points authorized by Section
4507.021 of the Revised Code (“Point
system
for
license
suspension”)
shall be assigned to the owner or
driver of the vehicle.
(j) Ticket evaluation, public service, and appeals. The program
shall include a fair and sound ticket-evaluation process that includes
review by the vendor and a police
officer, a strong customer-service
commitment, and an appeals process
that accords due process to the ticket respondent and that conforms to
the requirements of the Ohio Revised Code.
(k) Appeals. A notice of appeal
shall be filed with the Hearing Officer within twenty-one (21) days
from the date listed on the ticket.
The failure to give notice of appeal
or pay the civil penalty within this
time period shall constitute a waiver of the right to contest the ticket
and shall be considered an admission.
Appeals shall be heard by the
Parking Violations Bureau through

405

43
an administrative process established by the Clerk of the Cleveland Municipal Court. At hearings,
the strict rules of evidence applicable to courts of law shall not
apply. The contents of the ticket
shall constitute a prima facie evidence of the facts it contains. Liability may be found by the hearing
examiner based upon a preponderance of the evidence. If a finding
of liability is appealed, the record
of the case shall include the order
of the Parking Violations Bureau,
the Ticket, other evidence submitted by the respondent or the City
of Cleveland, and a transcript or
record of the hearing, in a written
or electronic form acceptable to
the court to which the case is appealed.
Liability shall not be found where
the evidence shows that the automated camera captured an event is
not an offense, including each of the
following events and such others as
may be established by rules and regulations issued by the Director of
Public Safety under the authority of
division (n) of this section:
(1) The motorist stops in time to
avoid violating a red light indication;
(2) The motorist proceeds through a
red light indication as part of funeral procession;
(3) The motorist is operating a
City-owned emergency vehicle with
its emergency lights activated and
proceeds through a red light indication or exceeds the posted speed limitation;
(4) The motorist is directed by a
police officer on the scene contrary
to the traffic signal indication.
Liability shall also be excused if
a vehicle is observed committing an
offense
where
the
vehicle
was
stolen prior to the offense and the
owner has filed a police report.
The Director of Public Safety, in
coordination with the Parking Violations Bureau, shall establish a
process by which a vehicle owner
who was not the driver at the time
of the alleged offense may, by affidavit, name the person who the
owner believes was driving the vehicle at the time. Upon receipt of such
an affidavit timely submitted to the
Parking
Violations
Bureau,
the
Bureau shall suspend further action
against the owner of the vehicle and
instead direct notices and collection
efforts to the person identified in
the affidavit. If the person named in
the affidavit, when notified, denies
being the driver or denies liability,
then the Parking Violations Bureau
shall resume the notice and collection process against the vehicle
owner, the same as if no affidavit
had been submitted, and if the violation is found to have been committed by a preponderance of evidence, the owner shall be liable for
any
penalties
imposed
for
the
offense.
A decision in favor of the City of
Cleveland
may
be
enforced
by
means of a civil action or any other
means provided by the Revised
Code.
(l) Evidence of operation. It is
prima facie evidence that the person
registered as the owner of the vehi-

and maintenance of all automated

Director of Public Safety may issue
rules and regulations to carry out
the provisions of these sections,
which shall be effective thirty (30)
days after publication in the City
Record.

penalty imposed for a violation of
division (b) or (c) of this section
