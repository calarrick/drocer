finance a portion of the costs of constructing the Flats East Development Project.
Whereas, the American Recovery
and
Reinvestment
Act
of
2009
(“ARRA”) revised the Internal Revenue Code (“Code”) to create Recovery Zone Economic Development
Bonds and Recovery Zone Facility
Bonds (collectively “Recovery Zone
Bonds”) which may only be issued
for projects located within a designated Recovery Zone; and
Whereas, the issuance of Recovery Zone Bonds can potentially promote job creation and economic
recovery in areas particularly affected by employment decline, significant poverty, increased home
foreclosures, or general economic
distress; and
Whereas,
under
Code
Sections
1400U-1 through 1400U-3, the City
has been allocated $16,590,000.00 for
the issuance of Recovery Zone Economic
Development
Bonds
and
$24,885,000.00 for the issuance of

September 23, 2009
Whereas, before the City issues
any Recovery Zone Bonds, this
Council must designate the area in
which a capital project is financed
by Recovery Zone Bonds as a Recovery Zone; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland, as
a whole, is currently economically
distressed as a result of the recent
economic conditions and (i) data for
June 2007 from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics shows that Cleveland’s
unemployment rate is 2.5 percentage
points above the national rate (12%
for Cleveland versus 9.5% for the
nation), (ii) approximately 8,000
foreclosure actions were filed in
2007 representing approximately 5.5
% of Cleveland’s housing stock, (iii)
data for 2007 from the Bureau of
Economic Analysis shows that per
capita income in the City is 42% of
the national figure ($16,197 in Cleveland versus $38,616 for the nation)
with 29.5% of the City’s residents
living in poverty, (iv) Cleveland’s
population dropped by 38,551 or
8.09% from a population of 476,793

Whereas, the Cleveland-Cuyahoga
Port Authority (“CCPA”), Summit
County Port Authority (SCPA”), and
the Treasurer of the State of Ohio
(“Treasurer”) are eligible issuers of
Recovery Zone Bonds; and
Whereas, this Council desires to
allocate its Recovery Zone Facility
Bond Volume Cap to help finance a
portion of the construction of the
Flats East Development; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,

and determines the following:
(a) The ARRA revised the Code
to create Recovery Zone Bonds,
which must be issued for projects in
a Recovery Zone.
(b) The issuance of Recovery
Zone Bonds can potentially provide
cost savings to the City to promote
job creation and economic recovery
in areas particularly affected by employment decline, significant poverty, increased home foreclosures, or
general economic distress.
(c) Before the City’s allocation of
Recovery Zone Bonds Volume Cap is
utilitized, this Council must designate the area in which a capital project is financed by Recovery Zone
Bonds as a Recovery Zone.
(d) This Council finds that the
following economic indicators of
economic distress are present in
City:
(1) Data for June 2007 from the

that Cleveland’s unemployment rate
is 2.5 percentage points above the
national rate (12% for Cleveland
versus 9.5% for the nation.)
(2) Approximately 8,000 foreclosure actions were filed in 2007 representing approximately 5.5% of

of proceeds of the Flats East Bonds
comply with the requirements of the

being provided with satisfactory

Westbrook, Keane and Cummins.
An emergency resolution urging
the U.S. Department of Transportation
and the Federal Rail Administration
to support the State of Ohio’s stimulus funding request for Ohio’s 3C
“Quick Start” Passenger Rail Plan.”

The City Record
Whereas, Ohio’s 3C “Quick Start”
Passenger Rail Plan — connecting
Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, and
Cincinnati as part of the nationallyprioritized Chicago Hub in President Obama’s Vision for High Speed
Rail in America — is a strong contender for federal funding through
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act; and
Whereas, Ohioans are demanding
safer and greener travel choices, as
proven in a March 2009 Quinnipiac
University
statewide
poll
which
showed that 64% of Ohioans want
passenger rail and that among
Ohioans 18-35 years old, 73% support
the 3C “Quick Start” plan; and
Whereas, nearly 6 million Ohioans
live within 15 miles of the 3C Corridor, a federally-designated high
speed rail corridor and one of the
most densely-populated corridors in
the U.S. without passenger rail service; and
Whereas, Ohio’s “Quick Start” plan
would have initial conventionalspeed service running as early as
2011, using the safest, most efficient
and cost-effective route, generating
jobs and economic development, and
putting travel choice in reach of
more than 60% of Ohio’s population;
and
Whereas, Ohio’s 3C “Quick Start”
Service would offer 3-4 trains running daily in each direction, traveling at 79 miles per hour, offering
fares and travel times that are competitive with other forms of transportation along this 250-mile corridor, with times constantly improving as tracks are upgraded and
freight
coordination
issues
are
resolved; and
Whereas, Ohio’s 3C “Quick Start”
Plan builds a foundation for economic competitiveness in some of
our state’s most economically-distressed cities, where these urban
cores represent Ohio’s centers of
commerce, education and research,
all of which can be better connected to a ready and mobile workforce
with passenger rail; and
Whereas, train stations are magnets for real estate development,
with land values around stations
increasing as much as 30%, and
station stops provide place-making
opportunities by creating comfortable, well-connected, and memorable destinations, which leads to
new opportunities for small business growth and vibrant urban
cores that are able to attract and
retain today’s talented professionals; and
Whereas, Ohio’s 3C “Quick Start”
Plan will bring new travel opportunities and promote economic development in cities along the rail line
by creating jobs, promoting regional connectivity, and creating an
infrastructure to help spur greener
and safer transportation options,
including light rail growth and
other connectors, such as green
buses and street cars; and
Whereas, Ohio’s 3C “Quick Start”
Plan will augment Ohio’s existing
passenger rail service along the
Chicago - Toledo - Cleveland - Pittsburgh and Chicago-Cincinnati corridors, which currently carry three
of Amtrak’s long-distance trains

1768

September 23, 2009
through Ohio but offer limited service, with trains departing and
arriving in the middle of the night;
and
Whereas, the State of Ohio is
working with Amtrak to improve
this limited service, which saw
121,019 Ohio riders in 2008, up nearly 10% from the prior year; and
Whereas, Ohio’s 3C “Quick Start”
Plan will leverage new public-private partnership, such as Amtrak’s
annual investment of more than
$12.6 million for goods and services
in Ohio, from more than a dozen
Ohio companies, and Amtrak’s direct
employment of 56 Ohioans with total
annual wages of more than $3.9 million; and
Whereas, in addition to expanded passenger rail-related business
growth,
freight
rail
operations
would
benefit
from
Ohio’s
3C
“Quick Start” Passenger Rail Plan
from increase relief at congested
rail choke points, at a value of
more than $3 to $6 billion in
improved productivity; and
Whereas, Ohioans need greater
travel choices and reliable mobility
options, as evidenced by data in the
U.S. Census showing nearly 8 percent of Ohio households without a
motor vehicle, and 20-25 percent of
households without cars in Cleveland, Dayton and Cincinnati, and
showing that Ohioans age 65 years
and older will account for over 16
percent of the total state population
by the year 2015 and 20 percent by
2030; and
Whereas, a modern transportation
system that includes passenger rail
service enhances the quality of life
for those in its proximity, revitalizes
our cities and boosts the economic
development and growth potential
of a region; and
Whereas, future expansions of Ohio’s
passenger rail service, beyond startup levels, may include establishing
“local” and “express” train service,
opening opportunities for more station stops and increased economic
development potential at locations
across the state; and
Whereas, fourteen other states
with state-sponsored passenger rail
service are already realizing the
dramatic economic development potential and return on investment
from passenger rail, such as the
Downeaster Service which is expected to generate $3.3 billion in
construction investment and create
8,000 new jobs in Maine over the
next two decades; and
Whereas, Ohio’s 3C “Quick Start”
Plan must win federal dollars to go
forward and the ORDC and ODOT
will formally apply on October 2,
2009, for federal stimulus funding of
up to $400 million under the Recovery Act (ARRA) to invest in infrastructure improvements, station development and operating train sets
to initiate service along the 3C Corridor; therefore,
Whereas, this Council believes
that a modern transportation system
that includes passenger rail service
will enhance the quality of life for
those in its proximity, revitalize our
cities and boost the economic development and growth potential of a
region; and

September 23, 2009
Whereas, this Council recognizes
that Ohio and the Nation are faced
with an array of urgent economic,
environmental, and mobility challenges that require bold, effective
action to be taken to implement
strategic and essential investment
in our rail transportation system;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Federal Rail Administration to support the State of Ohio’s
stimulus funding request for Ohio’s
3C “Quick Start” Passenger Rail
Plan.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal

the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

An emergency resolution supporting the Declaration to the Right to
Literacy, and urging Mayor Jackson
to sign the declaration when Literacy Powerline sends it to Cleveland.
Whereas, Right to Literacy Convention delegates from across the
country determined and voted on the
first United States Declaration for
the Right to Literacy at the Right
to Literacy Conference in Buffalo,
New York on June 13, 2009; and
Whereas, the Declaration for the
Right to Literacy proclaims that all
Americans have a right to literacy
and calls on communities and leaders in all sectors to work together
to expand literacy in the United
States so that all citizens can participate fully and equitably in our
democracy; and
Whereas, the Declaration supports
five pillars of literacy: Building the
Community, Strengthening the Family, Ensuring People’s Self-Determination, Improving the Workforce,
and Transforming the Literacy System; and
Whereas, Literacy Powerline, the
organization that organized the conference, believes that tens of millions of adults and children do not
have the skills needed to succeed in

The City Record
life, and literacy is the number one
tool to change that plight, and thus
must be a national priority; and
Whereas, Literacy Powerline hopes
to gain signatures from public figures, leaders and mayors as it sends
the Declaration “on the road” around
the country from Texas to Arkansas
and on to New York and Indiana
this Fall; and
Whereas,
Literacy
Powerline
urges every mayor to sign the Declaration, and to include basic education,
workforce
literacy
and
vocational English as a Second
Language in all appropriate applications requesting funding under
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) to meet the
needs of job seekers and incumbent
workers who read below an eighth
grade reading level; and
Whereas, Literacy Powerline calls
on cities to pay extra attention to
citizens reading below an eighth
grade level as more than 90 million
people in the United States have limited literacy skills, a fact that, if not
properly addressed, will limit cities’
efforts to improve workforce performance and economic development;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the Declaration to the Right
to Literacy, and urges Mayor Jackson to sign the declaration when Literacy Powerline sends it to Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Clerk of
Council is directed to send copies
of this resolution to Literacy Powerline founder Margaret Doughty and
Mayor Frank G. Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

of global ceasefire and non-violence.
Whereas, in 2001 the member
states of the United Nations (UN)
unanimously adopted General Assembly 55/282 that established the
United Nations International Day of
Peace (Peace Day)
Whereas, Peace Day on September
21st every year is not only about
creating peace between nations, but
about non-violence in our homes,
communities, and schools, and is
therefore relevant to every human
being on the planet; and
Whereas, as we support Peace
Day in 2009, we recognize that the
next major objective is to introduce
3 billion people to Peace Day by
2012 with the help of all people willing to stand up for peace, regardless of age, race, nationality, religion or gender; and

peace as promoted by Peace Day
will greatly benefit the people of

Day; and

September 23, 2009

society, including governments, organizations of the United Nations system,
regional and non-governmental organizations and individuals to observe
September 21st through the practical
manifestation of non-violence and
ceasefire in accordance with UN
General Assembly 55/282, and encourage action on Peace Day that
creates a united and sustainable
world; and

all walks of life actively supported
Peace Day around the world; and
Whereas, on Peace Day in 2007

September 23, 2009
Whereas, written objection to the

Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of

Res. No. 1277-09.
By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency resolution supporting the Cleveland Rowing Foundation’s application to the Clean Ohio
Conservation Fund for a $2,000,000
grant for acquisition of the approximately 2.73-acre Rivergate parcel,
located at 1758 Merwin Avenue in
the Downtown Cleveland Flats District, related to the Rivergate Project.
Whereas, The City of Cleveland is
engaged and active with the Cleveland Rowing Foundation and other
stakeholders in the planning of the
Rivergate Project; and
Whereas, the Rivergate Project
presents a unique opportunity to reunite the residents of Greater Cleveland with the Cuyahoga River and
to reclaim 2.73 acres of currently
vacant
and
industrialized
area,
regenerating and revitalizing it as
a public space serving as a central
hub of human powered boating
activity on the Cuyahoga River with

The City Record
rowing, kayaking, dragon boats,
and canoes, and riverside hiking,
bicycling, public art, fishing and
bird watching opportunities; and
Whereas, the Cleveland Rowing
Foundation
is
applying
for
a
$2,000,000 grant from the Clean Ohio
Conservation Fund for the acquisition of the approximately 2.73-acre
Rivergate parcel, located at 1758
Merwin Avenue in the Downtown
Cleveland Flats District; and
Whereas, the Rivergate Parcel is
a portion of a total approximately
6.5-acre property currently known as
the
Commodore’s
Club
Marina
(“CCM”); and
Whereas, with the acquisition of
the Rivergate Park property for
public purposes, the Cleveland Rowing Foundation will purchase the
remaining 3.70 acres of the CCM
property, utilizing its own private
funding (an estimated $1,200,000
investment), and will relocate its
operations to the adjoining parcel
allowing it the ability to steward
and maintain the Rivergate Park
parcel for public use, enjoyment,
and riverfront access; and
Whereas, the vision to re-imagine
Cleveland as a Green City on a Blue
Lake has included plans to restore
and make accessible Cleveland’s
waterfront, and the Rivergate project is unprecedented in its immediate effect in implementing this
vision; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the Cleveland Rowing Foundation’s application to the Clean
Ohio

Avenue in the Downtown Cleveland
Flats District, related to the Rivergate Project.
Section 2. That the Clerk of the
Council is hereby directed to transmit a certified copy of this resolution to the Cleveland Rowing Foundation.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
members elected to Council, it shall
take effect and be in force immediately upon its adoption and approval
by the Mayor; otherwise it shall
take effect and be in force from and
after the earliest period allowed by
law.

44114, Permanent Number 1543280 to
John Scordos, 850 Euclid Avenue,
Suite 120, Cleveland, Ohio 44114, Permanent Number 7918847; and
Whereas, the granting of this application for a liquor permit to this
high crime area, which is already
saturated with other liquor outlets,
is contrary to the best interests of
the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented rea-

30
sonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to
Section 4303.26 of the Ohio Revised
Code. Council’s objection to said
permit must be received by the
Director of Liquor Control within
30 days of notification; now, therefore,

hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

the Northeast Shores Development

Conservation Easement to the City
of Cleveland to hold for public use,
enjoyment, habitat restoration and
lakefront access; and
Whereas, the Hospice of the Western Reserve, as fee owner, is committed to steward, maintain and

An emergency resolution supporting ParkWorks’ application to the
Clean Ohio Fund for $414,675 to
acquire two parcels for “Phase II of
the Lake Link Trail and Greenway
Corridor” on the West Bank of the
Flats, and provide public access to
Lake Erie for residents of contiguous neighborhoods in the City of
Cleveland.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has been a partner with ParkWorks
and other stakeholders in planning
the Lake Link Trail; and
Whereas, a previous Clean Ohio
Fund application in 2008 is allowing
ParkWorks to acquire most of the
land necessary for the Trail, while
certain additional parcels remain to
be acquired and design funding is
needed; and
Whereas, acquisition of the currently proposed parcels and associated design work is a critical step
toward transforming abandoned urban
infrastructure with a recreational
greenway and natural resource corridor connecting the Towpath Trail
and the future Canal Basin Park to
the Lake Erie shoreline at Whiskey
Island; and
Whereas, acquisition of the parcels at 75% of their appraised value
will allow ParkWorks to use the
25% discount as matching funds,
satisfying the Clean Ohio Fund’s
requirement for a match of local
resources; and
Whereas, the Lake Link will provide a connector to the Towpath
Trail, connecting Lake Erie to a 100mile trail that leads to the Cuyahoga Valley National Park and
beyond, and will also run adjacent
to several civic and cultural landmarks including the West Side Market, Tower City and the lower Flats
district; and
Whereas, the Lake Link will provide significant green space, recreational opportunities and exposure
to nature for residents of adjacent
neighborhoods including the Flats,
Ohio City, Tremont, Downtown, and
the nearly 1,200 residents of public
housing estates at Lakeview Terrace and Riverview; and
Whereas, the trail will support the
nearly $100 million investment that
has been made in new housing
development on the west bank of
the Flats; and
Whereas, the parcels will increase
habitat protection and preserve natural features in a heavily urbanized
area, contributing to the quality of
life of City of Cleveland residents;
and
Whereas, the parcels will be naturalized to collect and treat stormwater flowing toward the Cuyahoga
River, helping to reduce stormwater
run-off throughout the Flats; and
Whereas, ParkWorks, working in
cooperation with the City of Cleve-

The City Record
land, will determine the best entity
to hold both the land following
acquisition and to provide maintenance for the trail; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports ParkWorks’ application to the
Clean Ohio Fund for $414,675 to
acquire two parcels for “Phase II of
the Lake Link Trail and Greenway
Corridor” on the West Bank of the
Flats, and provide public access to
Lake Erie for residents of contiguous neighborhoods in the City of
Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
certified copy of this resolution to
ParkWorks.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
