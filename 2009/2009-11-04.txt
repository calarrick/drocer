Groups I, II, and III copier service
on a cost-per-copy basis for a term
of four years beginning with the

the various divisions of City government; and
Whereas, because service did not
commence under Contract No. 64479

start on that date rather than the
date of execution of the contract;

community to help those most in
need.

2010

November 4, 2009
Whereas, thousands of Northeastern Ohioans lack access to legal
assistance that is often critical to
their safety and independence, forcing them to resolve complex legal
problems on their own, including
domestic violence, divorce, child custody, evictions, mortgage foreclosures and the physical and financial
abuse of the elderly; and
Whereas, despite the recent economic crisis, The Legal Aid Society
of Cleveland did not cut programs,
client services or staff; and
Whereas,
Legal
Aid
increased
capacity to represent disadvantaged
citizens, and in response to the
recession put more resources into
representing homeowners in foreclosure and those who need bankruptcy for a fresh start; and
Whereas, Legal Aid continues to
aid in building strong communities
by securing safety for domestic violence victims, retaining decent and
affordable housing for clients, and
increasing access to health care; and
Whereas, Legal Aid’s Volunteer
Lawyers Program, Brief Advice and
Referral Clinics and numerous other
programs provide easily accessible
legal advice and assistance to meet
a growing demand for free legal services; and
Whereas, the 55 staff attorneys
and more than 1400 volunteer attorneys in Northeastern Ohio donate
substantial hours to provide free
legal services to those in need; and
Whereas, despite thousands of
supporters’ generous financial contributions to legal aid organizations
in Northeastern Ohio, a huge unmet
need for legal assistance remains
for our disadvantaged citizens; and
Whereas, the National Pro Bono
Celebration is being observed across
the country during the week of October 24-31, 2009, to recognize the valuable work lawyers do throughout
the year, without fee, to represent
those who cannot afford civil legal
assistance;
Whereas, the Pro Bono Week celebration in Cleveland includes many
free legal advice clinics and legal
workshops at all Legal Aid’s offices,
and aims to raise awareness of the
need for available legal assistance
for all Northeastern Ohioans; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby celebrates National Pro Bono
Week, proclaims October 24 – 31,
2009 to be Pro Bono Week
in the
City of Cleveland, and urges all residents to recognize the contributions
of our legal community to help
those most in need.
