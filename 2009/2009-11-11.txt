FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES REFERRED
Ord. No. 1585-09.
By Council Members Zone and
Sweeney (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance to approve the form and authorize the
execution of power sales contracts
with American Municipal Power,
Inc. and taking other actions in connection therewith regarding Meldahl
and Greenup Hydroelectric Project
participation.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
Ohio
(“Municipality”)
owns
and
operates an electric utility system
for the sale of electric power and
associated energy for the benefit of
its citizens and taxpayers; and
Whereas, in order to satisfy the
electric power and energy requirements of its electric utility system,
Municipality has heretofore purchased, or desires to purchase in the
future,
economical
and
reliable
power and energy from, or arranged
by, American Municipal Power, Inc.
(“AMP”), of which Municipality is a
member; and
Whereas, AMP is an Ohio nonprofit corporation, organized to own
and operate facilities, or to provide
otherwise, for the generation, transmission or distribution of electric
power and energy, or any combination thereof, and to furnish technical services on a cooperative, nonprofit basis, for the mutual benefit
of AMP members (“Members”), such
Members, including Municipality,
being, as of the date hereof, political subdivisions that operate municipal electric utility systems in Ohio,
Kentucky, Michigan, Pennsylvania,
Virginia and West Virginia; and
Whereas, Municipality, acting individually and through AMP with
other political subdivisions of this
and other states that own and operate electric utility systems, jointly,
endeavors to arrange for reliable,
reasonably priced supplies of elec-

2022

November 11, 2009
tric power and energy for ultimate
delivery to its customers; and
Whereas, it is efficient and economical to act jointly in such regard; and
Whereas, certain Members, including the Municipality (“Participants”),
have determined they require additional, very long-term sources of
reliable and environmentally sound
base load electric power and energy
at reasonable costs and have requested that AMP arrange for the
same by developing or otherwise
acquiring interests in certain hydroelectric facilities located at locks
and dams along the Ohio River; and
Whereas, in furtherance of this
purpose, AMP and the City of Hamilton (“Hamilton”) have entered into
agreements under the terms of
which (i) AMP is to own, finance
and construct and Hamilton is to
operate the Meldahl Hydroelectric
Project, FERC License No. 12667
(“Meldahl Project”), projected to
have a net rated electric generating
capacity
of
one
hundred
five
megawatts (105 MW); and (ii) AMP
has agreed to purchase from Hamilton, contingent on the Meldahl Project being declared in Commercial
Operation, a forty-eight and sixtenths percent (48.6%) undivided
ownership interest in the currently
operating
Greenup
Hydroelectric
Project, FERC License No. 2614,
with a net rated electric generating
capacity of seventy and two-tenths
megawatts (70.2 MW) (the “Greenup Project” and, collectively with
the Meldahl Project, the “Hydroelectric Projects”); and
Whereas, because AMP’s acquisition of an ownership interest in the
Greenup Project is contingent upon
the Meldahl Project being declared
in Commercial Operation, AMP has
determined to make available the
Hydroelectric Projects as a package
such that each Participant will participate in both the Meldahl Project
and Greenup Project, although the
Participant will execute separate
power sales contracts for each project (individually the “Greenup PSC”
and “Meldahl PSC” and, collectively,
“Project PSCs”); and
Whereas, Members now have the
right, but not the obligation, by the
enactment of this ordinance (i) to
authorize and request AMP to own,
finance, construct and provide for
the operation of the Meldahl Project
(ii) to authorize and request AMP
to purchase an undivided ownership
interest in the Greenup Project from
Hamilton and to own, finance and
provide for the operation of the
Greenup Project, and (iii) to execute the Project PSCs authorized
below; and
Whereas, prior to the passage of
this ordinance, AMP has (i) informed the Municipality regarding
the Meldahl developmental process
and efforts undertaken by AMP to
further its interests in the Hydroelectric Projects; (ii) provided the
Municipality with a Feasibility Report regarding the Hydroelectric
Projects; and (iii) afforded representatives of the Municipality the
opportunity to ask such questions,
review such data and reports, conduct such inspections and otherwise
perform such investigations with
respect to, as applicable, the plan-

The City Record

November 11, 2009
ning, engineering, acquisition, construction and operation of the Hydroelectric Projects and the terms
and conditions of the Project PSCs
authorized below as the Municipality deems necessary or appropriate
in connection herewith; and
Whereas, after consideration of
the potential risks and benefits of
participating in Hydroelectric Projects and the respective Project
PSCs authorized below, the Municipality has determined it is reasonable and in its best interests to proceed as authorized herein and hereby requests and authorizes AMP (i)
to own, finance, construct and provide for the operation of the Meldahl
Project, on behalf of the Municipality and the other Participants in
accordance with the Meldahl PSC
authorized below and in conjunction
with similar authorizations by other
AMP Members, as Participants and
(ii) to purchase from Hamilton a
48.6% undivided ownership interest
in the Greenup Project, the closing
of such purchase being contingent
upon the Meldahl Project’s being
declared in Commercial Operation,
and to own such interest and
finance such purchase and improvements to the Greenup Project on
behalf of the Municipality and the
other Participants in accordance
with the Greenup PSC authorized
below and in conjunction with similar authorizations by other AMP
Members, as Participants; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Project PSCs
between Municipality and AMP, substantially in the form placed in File
No. 1585-09-A including Appendices
thereto, are approved, and the Director of Public Utilities of Municipality is hereby authorized to execute
and deliver the Project PSCs, with
such changes as the Director of Public Utilities may approve as neither
inconsistent with this ordinance nor
materially detrimental to the Municipality, his or her execution of the
PSCs to be conclusive evidence of
such approval.
Section 2. That the Director of
Public Utilities is hereby authorized
