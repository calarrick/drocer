The City Record
b) When three or more nuisance
activities as defined in division (a)
occur on separate occasions on the
same property within any thirty
(30) day period, the Director of Public Safety, or his designee, may
declare the premises to be a nuisance property and may abate the
nuisance as provided in Section
630.02.
Section 630.02
Action to Abate
Nuisances; Costs of Enforcement
(a) Notice of Declaration of Nuisance. The Director of Public Safety or his designee, upon finding that
three (3) or more nuisance activities
as defined in Section 630.01 have
occurred on separate occasions within any thirty (30) day period on the
same property, may cause a written
notice and order to be served on the
owner of the property declaring that
the property is a nuisance property.
This notice and order shall identify
the nuisance activities, and the estimated costs to abate any future nuisance activity; shall state that the
owner may avoid being charged the
costs of abatement by taking steps
to prevent any further nuisance
activity as set forth in division (d)
of this Section; and shall state the
appeal process. The notice shall further state that if a fourth or subsequent nuisance activity as defined
in Section 630.01 occurs later than
thirteen (13) days after the date of
the written nuisance declaration
notice
and
within
twelve
(12)
months of the date of the third or
any subsequent nuisance activity,
the City may abate the nuisance by
responding to the activities using
administrative and law enforcement
actions, and the costs of the abatement shall be charged to the owner
of the nuisance property and may be
certified as a lien on the nuisance
property. Notice shall be deemed
properly delivered by delivering it
personally to the owner or leaving
it at the owner’s usual place of business or residence, or by mailing it
to the owner, or, if it cannot be
served in any of the other ways
mentioned above, by publishing it
once in a newspaper of general circulation within the City, or by posting it in a conspicuous place on the
real estate involved.
(b) Abatement. If the Director of
Public Safety or his designee determines that a fourth or subsequent
nuisance activity as defined in Section 630.01 occurs later than thirteen (13) days after the date of the
initial written nuisance declaration
notice
and
within
twelve
(12)
months after the date of the third
or any subsequent nuisance activity, the City may abate the nuisance
activity by using administrative
and law enforcement actions, and
the costs of the abatement shall be
charged to the owner of the property and, if not paid, may be certified by the Commissioner of Assessments and Licenses to the County
Auditor to be placed on the nuisance property as a lien to be collected as other taxes and returned
to the City. The cost to abate the
nuisance activity shall be calculated as set forth in division (c). The
City shall provide notice to the
owner of the nuisance property of
the City’s decision to charge the

1796

October 4, 2006
cost of abatement. If the costs are
not paid by the owner, the City
shall notify the owner at least thirty (30) days before the costs are
certified to the County Auditor. The
notice
shall
contain
a
street
address or legal description of the
property, a description of the nuisance activities and the cost to
abate. Notices shall be served as set
forth in division (a) of this section.
The Director of Law may take any
other action necessary to collect the
costs of abatement.
(c) Costs of Abatement. Costs of
abatement
shall
be
determined
based on the time required to
respond to the nuisance activity
multiplied by an hourly rate based
upon the wages and benefits of a
police officer, dispatch costs, vehicle
and equipment costs, and supervisory and administrative costs. The
hourly rate may be adjusted based
on the number of police officers
required to abate the nuisance.
(d) Nuisance Abatement Plan. The
owner of a nuisance property may
avoid being charged the cost of
abating future nuisances if the
owner meets with the Director of
Public Safety or his designee; presents a plan to prevent further nuisance activity and that plan is
approved by the Director of Public
Safety or his designee; and implements the plan.
(e) Appeal. The owner of a nuisance
property
who
receives
a
notice declaring the owner’s property to be a nuisance property, a
notice charging the cost of abating
nuisance activity, or a notice that
the cost of abatement shall be certified to the County Auditor, may
appeal the notice by submitting a
written request to the City official
who issued the notice within ten
(10) days of the date of the notice.
If, after a decision on that appeal,
the owner disagrees with the decision, the owner may appeal the decision of the City official to the Board
of Zoning Appeals. An appeal to the
Board of Zoning Appeals shall be
made within fifteen (15) days of the
date of the decision from the City
official denying the appeal. The
Board shall conduct a hearing and
render a decision in accordance with
City ordinances and regulations governing its conduct and procedure.
An appeal to the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall not stay any actions
by the City to abate any subsequent
nuisance activity. In an appeal to
the Board of Zoning Appeals of a
nuisance declaration notice, the City
must show by a preponderance of
the evidence that there was probable cause to believe that each nuisance activity stated in the notice
being appealed has occurred, and
that the declaration of the property
as a nuisance property is justified.
In an appeal to the Board of Zoning
Appeals of a notice charging the
cost of abating nuisance activity, or
a notice that the cost of abatement
shall be certified to the County
Auditor, the City must show by a
preponderance of the evidence that
the charging of abatement costs or
the certification of abatement costs
is justified. The owner may prevail
on appeal of any notice if the owner
demonstrates by a preponderance of
the evidence that:

October 4, 2006
(1) He or she was not the owner
at the time of any of the nuisance
activity that is the basis of the
notice; or
(2) He or she had knowledge of
the nuisance activity, but promptly
and vigorously took all actions necessary to abate the nuisance activity
including,
without
limitation,
compliance with the requirements of
division (C) of Section 5321.17 and
division (A)(9) of Section 5321.04 of
the Revised Code; or
(3) He or she had no knowledge
of the nuisance activity and could
not, with reasonable care and diligence, have known of the nuisance
activity; and upon receipt of the
notice of the declaration of the property as a nuisance property, he or
she promptly took all actions necessary to abate the nuisance including, without limitation, compliance
with the requirements of division
(C) of Section 5321.17 and division
(A)(9) of Section 5321.04 of the
Revised Code.
Section 630.03
Failure to Abate
Nuisance Activity
(a) Whenever a property owner
has been billed on three (3) or more
separate dates within a two-year
time period for the cost to abate nuisance activity under this Chapter,
the Director of Public Safety, or his
designee, shall notify the property
owner that he or she may be issued
a criminal citation for a misdemeanor of the second degree thirty
(30) days after the third bill is
issued.
(b) No property owner shall fail
to abate nuisance activity within
thirty (30) days after the third bill
within a two-year time period for
the cost to abate nuisance activity
under this Chapter.
(c) Whoever violates this section
is guilty of failure to abate nuisance
activity, a misdemeanor of the second degree.
Section 630.04 Other Legal Actions
Not Affected
The declaration of a nuisance
property, an order to abate a nuisance, or the charging or assess-

The City Record
ment of costs by the City on a property under this chapter, do not
affect or limit the City’s right or
authority to bring criminal prosecution or other legal action against
any person for violation of the
City’s ordinances, including legal
action brought under Sections 619.24
and 619.25 of the Codified Ordinances.
Section 630.05 Severability
If any clause, sentence, paragraph
or part of this chapter, or its application to any person or circumstance, shall for any reason be
adjudged by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect, impair or
invalidate the remainder of this
Chapter nor the application of such
clause, sentence, paragraph or part
to other persons or circumstances
but shall be confined in its operation to the clause, sentence, paragraph or part and to the persons or
circumstances directly involved in
the controversy in which such judgment shall have been rendered. It is
declared to be the legislative intent
that this Chapter would have been
adopted had such provisions not
been included or such persons or circumstances been expressly excluded
from their coverage.
Section 2. That this ordinance
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Referred to Directors of Public
Safety, Finance, Law; Committees on

An emergency resolution supporting the Union Miles Development
Corporation’s Clean Ohio Assistance
Fund grant application to the Ohio
Department
of
Development
for
asbestos abatement and demolition
of certain buildings for development
of the Miles Shopping Center.
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the Union Miles Development
Corporation’s Clean Ohio Assistance
Fund grant application to the Ohio
Department
of
Development
for
asbestos abatement and demolition
of certain buildings located at 4141
East 131st Street, 4159 East 131st
Street, 13109 Miles Avenue, 13201
Miles Avenue, and 13205 Miles Avenue for development of the Miles
Shopping Plaza.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to send copies of this
resolution to the Ohio Department of
Development, the Cuyahoga County
Board of County Commissioners and
Union Miles Development Corporation.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency

it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

An emergency resolution urging
United States Senator Mike DeWine
to support meaningful legislation to
fix the Medicare Part D prescription
drug program and eliminate the
“donut hole” so that Medicare health
care coverage is simple, affordable,
and guaranteed for seniors and disabled Ohioans.
Whereas, on September 22, 2006, as
part of Americans United “National
Donut Hole Day,” Ohioans United
and local victims of the Medicare
Part D prescription drug program
“donut hole” coverage gap demonstrated outside of United States Senator Mike DeWine’s office to urge
Congress to fix Part D today; and
Whereas, the average senior and
disabled Ohioan falls into the Medicare Part D “donut hole” gap in coverage for members whose annual
drug cost are between $2,250 and
$5,100, and are forced to pay full cost
of their prescription drugs on top of
their costly monthly premiums; and
Whereas, seniors and disabled
Ohioans who missed the deadline to

The City Record
sign up for the Medicare Part D prescription drug program will be
slapped with a minimum of a 7%
life-time penalty to their monthly
premiums when they are eventually
allowed to be covered by a Part D
plan again in January 2007; and
Whereas, dozens of private insurance plans with different co-pays,
coverage drug lists, and deductibles
are
complicated
and
confusing,
causing thousands of seniors and
disabled Ohioans to sign up for the
wrong plan or miss the deadline for
coverage; and
Whereas, seniors whose prescription drug benefits are capped, similarly to falling into the “donut hole,”
are more likely to skip doses of
treatments, less likely to visit hospital emergency departments, and
have 22% higher mortality rates
than those without capped benefits,
according to a study in the New
England Journal of Medicine; and
Whereas, Part D prohibits Medicare from negotiating with drug
companies to get better prices for
seniors, which has resulted in prices
that are at least 50% higher than
those negotiated by the Veterans
Administration for veterans; and
Whereas, insurance companies are
allowed to take drugs off their
approved coverage list during the
year, but patients are locked in and
cannot change plans until the next
year; and
Whereas, this Council urges Congress to fix Part D by closing the
“donut hole” gap in coverage for
annual costs between $2,250 and
$5,100 that had resulted in millions
of seniors being denied prescription
drug coverage each year while they
still pay monthly premiums; and
Whereas, this Council urges Congress to reduce the cost of prescription drugs by requiring Medicare to negotiate lower prices from
drug companies, just as the Veterans Administration does for veterans; and
Whereas, this Council urges Congress to allow seniors the choice of
obtaining their prescription drug
plan directly from Medicare instead
of from a private insurance company; and
Whereas, this Council urges Congress to prohibit insurance company
bureaucrats from taking medications off their list of approved drugs
during the period when someone is
not allowed to move to another plan;
and
Whereas, this Council urges Congress to eliminate the penalty for
failing to sign up for a plan until
the Part D is fixed; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
United States Senator Mike DeWine
to support meaningful legislation to
fix the Medicare Part D prescription
drug program and eliminate the
“donut hole” so that Medicare health
care coverage is simple, affordable,
and guaranteed for seniors and disabled Ohioans.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
United States Senator Mike DeWine,

Cummins.
An emergency resolution supporting Issue 2 that, if passed by the
voters on November 7, 2006, will
raise the state minimum wage from
$5.15 to $6.85 an hour.
Whereas, it is important to the
health and welfare of all residents
of the City of Cleveland that working people are paid a wage that
enables them to lift their families
out of poverty; and
Whereas, the buying power of the
federal and state minimum wage of
$5.15 an hour is at its lowest point
in over 50 years because it has not
kept pace with the rising cost of living; and
Whereas, many working families
in Cleveland live at or below the
poverty line; and
Whereas, raising the minimum
wage to $6.85 an hour would raise
wages for about 720,000 workers, or
about 14% of Ohio’s workforce; and
Whereas, on average, these workers provide half of their families’
weekly earnings and nearly threequarters are adults over twenty; and
Whereas, experience and research
from the 22 states that have already
raised their minimum wage shows
that raising the minimum wage substantially helps families without
hurting the economy; and
Whereas,
productivity
of
Ohio
workers
has
risen
sharply
but
wages have remained stagnant; and
Whereas, at the same time U.S.
corporate profits have risen 50%
between 2001-2005; and
Whereas, increasing wages will
increase the ability of Cleveland
residents to attain self-sufficiency,
decrease economic hardship in the
City, and reduce the need for the
taxpayers to fund social services in
order to provide supplemental support for the employees of local businesses; and
Whereas,
Ohioans
for
a
Fair
Minimum Wage — a broad coalition
of community, labor and faith-based
organizations
and
individuals
across the state — have gathered

The City Record
over 700,000 signatures from Ohio
citizens and qualified Issue 2 for
the November 2006 ballot; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that hard work deserves fair pay,
and urges voters to consider and
approve Issue 2 on November 7, 2006
ballot, which would raise the state
minimum wage from $5.15 to $6.85
an hour with an annual cost of living adjustment.
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports Issue 2 that, if passed by the
voters on November 7, 2006, will
raise the state minimum wage from
$5.15 to $6.85 an hour.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
Ohioans for a Fair Minimum Wage.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it

An emergency resolution proclaiming October 4, 2006 as ENERGY
STAR Change a Light Day.
Whereas,
energy
efficiency
is
important to the City of Cleveland
because it save consumers and businesses money and helps protect the
environment by lessening greenhouse gas emissions and reducing
air pollution; and
Whereas, lighting accounts for
nearly 20% of the average home’s
electric bill; ENERGY STAR qualified light bulbs use at least twothirds less energy than standard
bulbs and last up to ten time longer;
and
Whereas, by taking the ENERGY
STAR Change a Light pledge, citizens of the City have the opportunity to save energy and help voluntarily reduce greenhouse gas emissions by switching at least one light
at
home
to
an
energy-efficient
model; and
Whereas, citizens are encouraged
to switch to light fixtures or bulbs
that have earned the ENERGY
STAR label, which designates products that meet strict energy efficiency criteria set by the U.S.
Department of Energy and the U.S.
EPA; and
Whereas, if every home in the
City of Cleveland made this one
change
our
city
would
save
127,5522,656 kWh of electricity, the
environmental equivalent of removing 3,207 cars from the road while
also reducing the amount of green-

1801

21
house gas emission going into the
air by 201,232,560 pounds; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council is
proud to do its part in this nationwide
effort, celebrating ENERGY STAR
Change a Light Day, to promote
energy efficiency and environmental
stewardship in every household, and
by encouraging the installation of
ENERGY STAR qualified lighting;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby proclaims October 4, 2006 as

An emergency resolution encouraging the Cuyahoga County Auditor’s Office, Department of Weights
and Measures and the City of Cleveland Department of Finance, Division of Weights and Measures to
study testing fuel quality at fuel
stations, and the State of Ohio to
pass laws that require fuel quality
testing.
Whereas, contaminated fuel sold
at fuel stations causes motor vehicle damage; and
Whereas, some fuel stations sell
low-octane fuel to customers at
high-octane prices; and
Whereas, testing fuel quality is
the only way to guarantee that consumers receive the fuel that they
purchase, and to detect contaminated fuel; and
Whereas, Ohio is only one of four
states that do not have laws that
require testing fuel; and
Whereas, Summit County is the
first and only county in Ohio to
implement a Fuel Quality Testing
Program; and
Whereas, Summit County authorized their Fiscal Officer in the
Auditor’s
Office,
Department
of
Weights and Measures to test fuel
according to adopted national fuel
testing regulations; and
Whereas, Fuel testing is needed
for the consumer protection of the
citizens of the State of Ohio, Cuyahoga County and the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby encourages the Cuyahoga County Auditor’s Office, Department of
Weights and Measures and the City
of Cleveland, Department of Finance,
Division of Weights and Measures
to study testing fuel quality at fuel
stations, and the State of Ohio to
pass laws that require fuel quality
testing.
Section 2. That the Aviation and
Transportation Committee, chaired
by Council Member Kelley, hold a
hearing on fuel quality testing.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Res. No. 1588-06.
By Council Members Polensek,
Brancatelli, Sweeney, Brady, Britt,
Cimperman, Cleveland, Coats, Conwell, Cummins, Dolan, Johnson, Kelley, Lewis, Pierce Scott, Reed, Santiago, Turner, Westbrook, White
and Zone.
An emergency resolution urging
the Administration, the Ohio Attorney General’s Office and the United
States Department of Justice, United States Attorney’s Office to investigate whether Argent Mortgage
Company and its subprime loan competitors are violating local, state, or
federal predatory lending, fraud,
and other laws pertaining to lending practices, and take legal action
accordingly.
Whereas, Ohio has the worst foreclosure rate in the country, with a
loan default rate more than three
times the national average; and
Whereas, a risky, high-interest
mortgage, called a subprime loan is
10 times more likely to default than
a conventional, prime-rate loan; and
Whereas, 20 percent of subprime
loans end up in foreclosure after
five years; and
Whereas, one in five house-purchase loans made in 2005 by Cleveland’s top mortgage lender, California-based Argent Mortgage Company (“Argent”), have already gone
into foreclosure; and
Whereas, Argent’s subprime loan
competitors have comparable high
foreclosure rates for Cleveland purchase loans in 2005, but lack the volume of Argent’s 1,258 loans in 2005;
and
Whereas, more than 70 percent of
the 7,300 loans Argent wrote in
Cleveland from 2003 through 2005
were on the East Side; and
Whereas, up to 20 percent of borrowers who received subprime loans
had credit scores for lower-interest
conventional mortgages; and
Whereas, Argent representatives
have suggested how to doctor loan
documents so that mortgages are
approved by company underwriters,
according to Plain Dealer investigation witnesses; and
Whereas, Argent rarely questions
the validity of property appraisals
or the source of down payments that
are key components to getting mortgage loans approved; and
Whereas, the higher a borrower’s
risk of default or foreclosure, the
higher the rate charged for a loan;
and
Whereas,
Argent’s
lax
lending
practices have allowed too many
unqualified borrowers to get too
many loans, resulting in foreclosures;
and
Whereas, subprime lending and
foreclosures contribute to the loss of
population in Cleveland and Cuyahoga County; and
Whereas, subprime lending and
foreclosures negatively impact Cleveland and Cuyahoga County homeowners and citizens by resulting in
vacant and abandoned properties;
and
Whereas, vacant properties often
become a breeding ground for crime
and fires, and require a disproportionate amount of government maintenance, from securing properties
against criminal activity to removal

The City Record
of garbage and rodents to demolition, all at a cost to taxpayers; and
Whereas, vacant properties reduce
city tax revenue in three ways: they
are often tax delinquent; their low
value means they generate little in
taxes; and they depress property
values across an entire neighborhood; and
Whereas, the cost of living in a
neighborhood with many vacant and
abandoned properties makes obtaining homeowner’s insurance, mortgages and loans for home improvements more difficult; and
Whereas, vacant properties degrade and devalue the quality of
life for remaining residents, isolating and weakening the neighborhood, and increasing the likelihood
that property values will continue to
decline and further abandonment
will set in; and
Whereas, it is incumbent upon the
Administration, the Ohio Attorney
General’s Office and the United
States Department of Justice, United States Attorney’s Office to investigate and take legal action if warranted against Argent and other
subprime loan competitors to eliminate illegal lending practices, in
order to reduce rising foreclosure
rates and the resulting abandoned
and vacant properties in our neighborhoods; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the Administration, the
Ohio Attorney General’s Office and
the United States Department of Justice, United States Attorney’s Office
to investigate whether Argent Mortgage Company and its subprime
loan competitors are violating local,
state, or federal predatory lending,
fraud, and other laws pertaining to
lending practices, and take legal
action accordingly.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Alberto
Gonzales, the United States Attorney
General, Gregory White, the United
States Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio, Jim Petro, the Ohio
Attorney General, Mark Bennett,
Senior Deputy Attorney General, and
Mayor Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

October 4, 2006
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of

Be it ordained by the Council of

Section 1. That Section 189.02 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended by
Ordinance No. 2009-A-99 passed June

as follows:
Section 189.02
Fair Employment
Wage
All Covered Employers shall pay
no less than the Fair Employment
Wage to Covered Employees. Determination of the Fair Employment
Wage shall be in accordance with
the following:
(a) Amount of Fair Employment
Wage:
(1) The Fair Employment Wage
shall be calculated on an hourly
basis and shall be at least $8.20 per
hour beginning January 1, 2001;
$8.70 beginning October 1, 2001; and
$9.20 beginning October 1, 2002.
Thereafter, the Fair Employment

hourly wage which, when combined
with the compensation received in
tips, will at least equal the Fair
Employment Wage.
(b) All employees working for
the City shall be paid at least a
Fair
Employment
Wage.
Work
being performed by City employees
at the time of the effective date of
this Chapter may not be contracted

paid to workers doing that or similar work, whichever is higher,
regardless
of
the
number
of
employees.
(c) Any new jobs created by the

(1) In order to encourage Covered
Employers to provide reasonable
health
care

the following incentives to Covered
Employers:
(A) Applicable Departments shall
consider the fact that a Service Contractor provides or agrees to provide
during the course of the Service
Contract
reasonable
health
care
insurance to Covered Employees

The City Record
working 30 or more hours a week
as a factor in determining the lowest and best or lowest responsible
bid for any Service Contract. If a
Service Contractor can demonstrate
that it has offered reasonable health
care insurance to its employees but
as a group the employees have
refused the health care insurance
coverage, the Service Contractor is
entitled to the same consideration
and
treatment
in
the
bidding
process as a Service Contractor who
provides or agrees to provide reasonable health care insurance. The
Division of Purchases and Supplies
shall promulgate regulations for the
evaluation of bids and proposals
that provide for meaningful consideration of the offering of reasonable
health care insurance in determining the lowest and best or lowest
responsible bid. Such regulations
must be reviewed and approved by
Cleveland City Council.
(B) Applicable Departments shall
offer additional financial incentives
to Recipients of Assistance who will
provide
reasonable
health
care
insurance to their Covered Employees working 30 or more hours a
week during the term of the contract for Assistance. Examples of
such incentives include: more favorable terms for a loan, such as a
lower interest rate; a higher percentage of taxes to be credited or
abated; a higher amount for a grant,
etc. Whether or not such incentives
have been offered; the reasons for
offering or not offering such incentives; the terms of such incentives,
if offered; and any evidence of the
intent of the proposed Recipient of
Assistance to provide reasonable
health care insurance shall be a
part of the information provided by
the Applicable Department to Cleveland City Council for consideration
in connection with any ordinance
authorizing a contract for Assistance.
(2) In order to qualify a Covered
Employer for an incentive as provided in the previous section, the
reasonable health care insurance
provided to employees must be comparable to a family health care
insurance plan provided by the City
to its employees.
(3) Evidence of the offer or provision or the intent to provide or
offer reasonable health care insurance benefits qualifying a Covered
Employer for such incentives shall
lie submitted to the Applicable
Department upon request.
Section 2. That existing Section
189.02 of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended
by Ordinance No. 2009-A-99 passed
June 19, 2000, is hereby repealed.
Section 3. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
