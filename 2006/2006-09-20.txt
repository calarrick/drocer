desired by the Commissioner of

By Council Members Cimperman,
Kelley,
Sweeney,
Dolan,
Pierce
Scott, White, Brancatelli, Cummins,
Zone, Brady, Lewis, Turner, Polensek, Cleveland, Conwell, Britt, Coats
and Santiago.
An emergency resolution supporting Cuyahoga County’s proposed
ballot resolution to place before the
voters a health and human services
tax levy that, if passed by the voters at the November 7, 2006 election,
will replace an existing 3.0 mill tax
levy and reduce it by 0.1 mills for a
rate not to exceed 2.9 mills for the
purpose of supplementing the general fund appropriation for health
and human or social services for a
period of four years.
Whereas, on July 27, 2006, the
Board of County Commissioners of
Cuyahoga County adopted a resolution
declaring
it
necessary
to
replace a portion of an existing 3.0
mill tax levy and reduce such levy
by 0.1 mills to constitute a tax levy
at a rate not to exceed 2.9 mills, for
four years, and requesting the County Auditor to certify the total current tax valuation of the County and
the dollar amount of revenue that
would be generated by the 2.9 mill
replacement and reduction levy; and

The City Record
Whereas, on July 27, 2006, the
County Auditor certified that the
total current tax valuation of the
County is $29,416,835,136 and the dollar amount of revenue that would be
generated by that 2.9 mill replacement and reduction levy would be
$87,217,392 annually during the life
of the levy, assuming that the total
current tax valuation remains the
same throughout the life of the levy;
and
Whereas, on August 17, 2006, the
Board of County Commissioners of
Cuyahoga County adopted a resolution that submitted the proposed
health and human services levy to
the electors of the County on November 7, 2006, after determining that
the amount of taxes which may be
raised by the County within the tenmill limitation by levies on the current tax duplicate will be insufficient to provide for the necessary
requirements of the County; and
Whereas, the County’s proposed
health and human services levy
would replace and reduce the current 3.0 mill levy that has been in
place
at
the
same
level
since
approved in 1989; and
Whereas, the County’s proposed
health and human services levy is
necessary
to
continue
funding
human services that range from the
early childhood “Invest in Children”
program that prepares Cleveland’s
youngest residents to enter school
healthy
and
prepared,
to
the
“Options” and “Passport” programs
that provide home health care to
Cleveland senior citizens; and
Whereas, the County’s proposed
health and human services levy is
necessary to continue base funding
for child welfare, public assistance,
senior citizen, homeless prevention,
foster care, adoption, and at-risk
children services used by Cleveland
citizens; and
Whereas, the proposed health and
human services levy is necessary to
continue annual County subsidies to
the MetroHealth System, the Cuyahoga County Community Mental
Health Board, and the Cuyahoga
County Alcohol and Drug Service
used by Cleveland citizens; and
Whereas, the proposed health and
services levy, if passed, will benefit
the City of Cleveland by continuing
to provide a basic safety net of services to meet the increasing needs
in our community; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports Cuyahoga County’s ballot resolution to place before the voters a
health and human services tax levy
that, if passed by the voters at the
November
7,
2006
election,
will
replace an existing 3.0 mill tax levy
and reduce it by 0.1 mills for a rate
not to exceed 2.9 mills for the purpose of supplementing the general
fund appropriation for health and
human or social services for a period of four years.

An emergency resolution encouraging the Jackson administration to
join the Plug-in Partners National
Campaign and to develop a program
to
purchase
flexible-fuel
plug-in
hybrid
vehicles,
including
fleet
orders; supporting local, state and
federal policies that will promote
flexible-fuel plug-in hybrid vehicles;

The City Record
and supporting the advocacy by
local government and other community members for the purchase of
flexible-fuel plug-in hybrid vehicles.
Whereas,
the
over-reliance
of
America on foreign oil has become
a growing and serious threat to the
economic vitality and national security interest of the United States;
and
Whereas,
automobile
emissions
are a major contributing factor to
global warming and to smog in our
cities, which threaten the health of
our citizens and the sustainability
of our planet; and
Whereas, the imbalance between
gasoline resources and worldwide
demand is causing gasoline prices
to escalate at an alarming rate to
levels that overburden commerce,
hurt economic growth and cause
serious hardship on our citizens; and
Whereas, the technology exists
today to build a flexible-fuel plug-in
hybrid
electric
automobile
that
could reduce oil imports, fuel costs
to our citizens and our economy and
emissions by dramatic margins; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
encourages the City of Cleveland to
partner with Austin, Texas and others of some of the nation’s largest
cities, to urge automakers to mass
produce plug-in hybrid vehicles for
the substantial economical, environmental and strategic reasons set
forth herein; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
is
officially
launching
“Plug-In
Cleveland”, a community-wide campaign to promote the mass production of plug-in hybrid vehicles; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby encourages the Jackson administration to join the Plug-in Partners

Cleveland, Ohio 44113, Permanent
Number 8202241; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.

must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of
