FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES REFERRED
Ord. No. 2005-06.
By Council Member Sweeney (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Finance, on
behalf of the Cleveland Municipal
Court, to enter into contract with
the Cuyahoga County Public Defender Commission for legal services necessary to defend indigents
charged with violation of ordinances
of the City of Cleveland provided
such violation may result in incarceration, for the Cleveland Municipal Court for a period of one year,
with one option to renew for an
additional one-year period.
Whereas, in Argersinger v. Hamlin and Scott v. Illinois, the United
States Supreme Court held that no
indigent criminal defendant may be
sentenced to a term of imprisonment
unless he has been afforded the
right to assistance of appointed
counsel in his defense; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
through the Cleveland Municipal
Court, is obligated to provide an
indigent defendant appointed counsel in order to permit the imposition
of a sentence including a term of
imprisonment; and
Whereas, under Section 120.14 of
the Revised Code, a county commission that has organized a county
public defender commission may
contract with any municipal corporation within the County served by
the county public defender to provide legal representation on behalf
of the municipal corporation; and
Whereas, the Cleveland Municipal
Court, the district of which encompasses Bratenahl and the City of
Cleveland,
recommends
that
the
Cuyahoga County Public Defender
Commission should provide indigent
defense; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Finance, on behalf of the Cleveland
Municipal Court, is authorized to
enter into contract with the Cuyahoga County Public Defender Commission for legal services necessary
to defend indigents charged with
violation of ordinances of the City
of Cleveland, provided the violation
may result in incarceration, for a
period of one year beginning January 1, 2007, at an estimated cost of
$1,517,539, with one option to renew
for an additional one-year period,
payable from the fund or funds
appropriated for this purpose in budget year 2007, Request No. 149973.
Section 2. That two percent (2%)
of any payment received by the City
and/or Cleveland Municipal Court
from the financing of defense counsel for indigent persons shall be utilized by participants in a court
exchange program between Cleveland Municipal Court and the Cleveland Municipal School District.
Section 3. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and

November 29, 2006
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Referred to Directors of Finance,
Law; Committee on Finance.
Ord. No. 2006-06.
By Council Members Pierce Scott,
Cimperman and Sweeney (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance declaring the improvement of certain real
property located in the City of
Cleveland, Ohio to be a public purpose; declaring such property to be
exempt from real property taxation;
requiring annual service payments
in lieu of taxes; acknowledging an
ongoing blight study and finding
the property to be in a blighted area
of an impacted city in the event the
blight study so finds and concludes;
approving the execution of a Compensation Agreement; approving the
execution of a Tax Increment Financing Agreement; establishing a Veterans Administration Urban Redevelopment Tax Increment Equivalent
Fund; designating the uses for moneys deposited into the Veterans
Administration Urban Redevelopment
Tax Increment Equivalent Fund; providing related authorizations pursuant to Ohio Revised Code Sections
5709.41, 5709.42 and 5709.43.
Whereas, Ohio Revised Code (“R.C.”)
Section 5709.41 provides that this
Council may, under certain circumstances,
declare
improvement
to
parcels of real property located in
the City of Cleveland (the “City”) to
be a public purpose, and thereby
exempt
a
percentage
of
that
improvement from real property taxation, provided the City has held fee
title to such real property prior to
the adoption of the ordinance providing for the exemption; and
Whereas, pursuant to R.C. Section
5709.41(C)(2), said exemption may
exceed 75% of such improvement and
be for a period of up to thirty (30)
years with approval of the board of
education of the city, local or exempted village school district within the
territory of which the improvement is
or will be located; and
Whereas, the real property shown
on the map contained in File No.
2006-06-A, and incorporated herein
by reference (the “Property”) is
located in the State of Ohio (the
“State”), County of Cuyahoga (the
“County”), and the City; and
Whereas, the current and future
owners of the Property and/or any
structures located thereon (each an
“Owner” and collectively the “Owners”) wish to develop the Property,
provided that the appropriate development incentives are available to
support this redevelopment; and
Whereas, Veterans Development,
LLC (the “Developer”), in cooperation with the Cleveland-Cuyahoga
County Port Authority (the “Port
Authority”), desires to construct a
domiciliary, office building, parking
garage and related improvements on
the Property for use by the Veterans Administration (the “VA Project”); and
Whereas, the Port Authority plans
to issue bonds (the “Port Authority
Bonds”) to help finance certain VA
Project costs, including certain public infrastructure improvements and
related appurtenances; and
Whereas, in connection with the
City’s urban redevelopment efforts,

The City Record
the City acquired the Property and
conveyed the Property to the Developer; and
Whereas, this Council has determined that it is necessary and
appropriate and in the best interests
of the City to provide for service
payments in lieu of real property
taxes (“Service Payments,” as further defined below) with respect to
the Property pursuant to R.C. Section 5709.42; and
Whereas, the City, through its
activities in connection with the VA
Project and through other activities,
has been and will continue to be
engaged in urban redevelopment;
and
Whereas, this Council desires to
enter into a compensation agreement
(the “Compensation Agreement”)
with the Board of Education of the
Cleveland Municipal School District
(the “School District”), which Compensation Agreement would provide
for the payment of compensation by
the City to the School District; and
Whereas, in connection with the
negotiation of the Compensation
Agreement, the Board of Education
of the School District has agreed to
waive the notice periods prescribed
in R.C. Sections 5709.41 and 5709.83
and has approved a 100% exemption
for the Property under R.C. Section
5709.41 for a period of thirty years;
and
Whereas, an emergency exists in
the usual daily operations of the
City in that it is immediately necessary to approve tax exemptions
for the Property for the preservation
of the public health, peace, property
and safety, that preservation being
related to the City’s need for the
Developer to construct the VA Project on the Property to create new
job opportunities immediately; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. The VA Project, the
improvement of the Property and
the increase in assessed value of the
Property after the acquisition of the
Property by the City (an “Improvement” as defined in R.C. Section
5709.41 and which Improvement is
further described in the summary
placed in the above-mentioned file
and incorporated by reference herein) are hereby declared to be a public purpose for purposes of R.C. Sections 5709.41 and 5709.42. One hundred percent (100%) of the Improvement is hereby exempted from real
property taxation for a period commencing on the effective date of
this Ordinance and ending at the
end of a period of exemption of thirty (30) years. On such ending date,
the Improvement shall cease to be a
public purpose.
Section 2. This Council hereby
acknowledges that a blight study is
currently being conducted in regard
to the Property, and if the blight
study finds and concludes that the
Property is in a blighted area of an
impacted City this Council anticipates that it will find that the Property is in a blighted area of an
impacted city, as those terms are
used in R.C. Section 1728.01.

5
ments in lieu of taxes to the County Treasurer with respect to the
period in which the Improvement
(or any part thereof) is exempt from
real property taxation, on or before
the final dates for payment of real
property taxes. Each such payment
(including interest and penalties)
shall be charged and collected in
the same manner and in the same
amount as the real property taxes
that would have been charged and
payable against the Improvement if
it were not exempt from taxation
(the service payments in lieu of
taxes, including any penalties and
interest, are referred to herein as
the “Payments in Lieu of Taxes”).
Any late payments shall be subject
to penalty and bear interest at the
then current rate established under
R.C. Sections 323.121 and 5703.47, as
may be amended from time to time,
or any successor provisions thereto,
as the same may be amended from
time to time. The County Treasurer
shall remit all Payments in Lieu of
Taxes, together with any associated
roll back payments received in

officers of the City to provide such
information and certifications and
execute and deliver, or accept delivery of, such instruments as are necessary and incidental to collect the
Service Payments and to make such
arrangements as are necessary and
proper for payment of the Service
Payments. The Service Payments
shall be allocated and deposited in
accordance with Sections 4 and 5 of
this Ordinance.
No Owner shall, under any circumstances, be required in any tax
year to both pay Service Payments
with respect to an Improvement and
reimburse local taxing authorities
for the amount of real property
taxes that would have been payable
to local taxing authorities had the
Improvement not been exempted
from taxation pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 4. This Council hereby establishes, pursuant to and in accordance
with the provisions of R.C. Section
5709.43, the Veterans Administration
Urban Redevelopment Tax Increment Equivalent Fund (the “Fund”),

(ii)
second,
to
make
principal
(whether at maturity or by prior
redemption) payments of and interest payments on the Port Authority
Bonds, and to establish reserves for

6
such payments. To the extent moneys remain after the first two aforementioned uses, this Council authorizes and directs that such moneys
shall be used, in no particular order,
(i) to make payments to the Owners for capital improvements to the
Property and for any other permissible purposes under Ohio law and
the Ohio Constitution, (ii) to finance
all or any portion of the Public Infrastructure Improvements described
in the summary placed in the abovementioned file, and (iii) for deposit
into a general fund of the City, but
not in an amount for any year that
exceeds the property tax revenues
that the City otherwise would have
received that year but for the exemption set forth in this Ordinance.
The Fund shall remain in existence so long as Service Payments
are collected and used for the aforesaid purposes, after which said
Fund shall be dissolved in accordance with R.C. Section 5709.43(D).
Upon dissolution, any incidental surplus money remaining in the Fund
shall be disposed of as provided in
R.C. Section 5709.43(D).
Section 5. In accordance with R.C.
Section 5709.43(C), the City shall
make annual payments to the School
District as required by the Compensation Agreement (each such payment to be in the amount of 30.32%
of

By Council Members Sweeney,
Cummins, Kelley and White.
An emergency resolution calling
upon the English and Irish governments to take immediate steps necessary to bring to fullness the
promises of the All Ireland institutions called for and envisioned by
the Good Friday Agreement; requesting the Irish government to
formally study the implications of a
United Ireland and outline steps fundamental to restore the Irish Nation
and publicly report their finding
and plans; and respectfully suggesting that the Irish government move
without delay to further the peaceful healing of the Irish nation by
granting duly elected northern MP’s
“Speaking Rights” in the Irish parliament and expand the voting
rights for the Irish President to the
citizens of the six counties of the
North of Ireland.
Whereas, Ireland and its people
are an ancient and distinct nation;
and
Whereas, Ireland is an island
nation that has throughout her history been comprised of 32 counties,
artificially divided into a 26 county
(the Irish Republic) and a 6 county
(Northern Ireland) unit in the 1920’s;
and
Whereas, this artificial, forced
division of the Irish Nation was
designed to be a transitory answer
to the 1920’s issues; and
Whereas, history has demonstrated that the Irish people have the
right and responsibility to govern
themselves; and

The City Record
Whereas, human and civic rights
derive “their just powers from the
consent of the governed” and are
best guaranteed by the people’s
freely instituted, duly elected and
independent government; and
Whereas, the Irish Republic has
the fastest growing economy in the
European Economic Union and a
unified, independent Irish economy
is the most effective way to sustain
such dynamic growth and the most
fair and impartial path to extend
the benefits of such growth to all
Ireland; and
Whereas, a unified, independent
Irish Police Service and Justice System is most likely to be effective,
fair and impartial; and
Whereas, a unified, independent
Irish society is most likely to provide for the social and practical
needs of its people; and
Whereas, the historic Good Friday
Agreement, negotiated with American support, and ratified by the
English and Irish governments, as
well as a vote of the entire island
of Ireland, includes provisions for
achieving a United Ireland through
purely
democratic
and
peaceful
means and provides for the development of North/South Institutions
and cross-border cooperation; and
Whereas, this City and the United
States have greatly benefited from
the contributions of the sons and
daughters of Ireland and Cleveland
City Council wishes to promote the
peace and prosperity for all Ireland;
and
Whereas, the democratic reunification of Ireland is the ultimate
roadmap to peace and prosperity for
the Irish nation and people; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby calls upon the English and Irish
governments
to
take
immediate
steps necessary to bring to fullness
the promises of the All Ireland institutions called for and envisioned by
the Good Friday Agreement.
Section 2. That this Council further requests the Irish government
to formally study the implications of
a United Ireland and outline steps
fundamental to restore the Irish
Nation and publicly report their
finding and plans.
Section 3. That this Council further respectfully suggests that the
Irish government move without delay to further the peaceful healing
of the Irish nation by granting duly
elected northern MP’s “Speaking
Rights” in the Irish parliament and
expand the voting rights for the
Irish President to the citizens of the
