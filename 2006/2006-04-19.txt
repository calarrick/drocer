An emergency resolution supporting H.R. 5054, the “Rebuilding America’s Infrastructure” bill.
Whereas, United States citizens
complain about the state of America’s public capital: about dilapidated
school
buildings,
condemned
highway
bridges,
contaminated
water supplies, and other shortcomings of the public infrastructure;
and
Whereas, in addition to inflicting inconvenience and endangering
health, the inadequacy of the public

The City Record
infrastructure adversely affects productivity and the growth of the
economy since public investment,
private investment and productivity
are intimately linked; and
Whereas, for over 2 decades the
United States government has retreated from public investment; and
Whereas, state and local governments, albeit to a lesser extent, have
also slowed public investments and
state and local taxpayers are frequently reluctant to approve bond
issues to finance public infrastructure; and
Whereas, in the early 1970s, nondefense public investment accounted
for about 3.2% of gross domestic
product; now it accounts for only
2.5%; and
Whereas, widespread neglect of
maintenance has contributed substantially to the failure of the stock
of public capital assets to keep pace
with the nation’s needs; and
Whereas, net of depreciation, the
real nondefense public capital stock
expanded in the past 2 decades at a
pace only half that set earlier in the
post World War II period; and
Whereas, evidence of failures to
maintain and improve infrastructure is seen every day in such problems as unsafe bridges, urban
decay, dilapidated and over-crowded schools and inadequate airports;
and
Whereas, the state departments of
education collected data that reveals
at least $300,000,000,000 worth of
unmet school infrastructure needs;
and
Whereas, H.R. 5054 will help the
nation take a significant step forward both in overcoming its infrastructure deficit and in promoting
the productivity needed to meet the
competitive challenges of the 21st
century; and
Whereas, H.R. 5054 represents fiscally sound planning and, in salient
ways, advances sound fiscal and
monetary operations; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports H.R 5054, the “Rebuilding America’s Infrastructure” bill.

Whereas, this Council passed Ordinance No. 1749-80 on October 8, 1980,
and thereafter amended that ordinance by Ordinance No. 1112-83,
passed on May 6, 1983 and Ordinance
No. 944-96 passed on June 10, 1996
(Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so amended and as the same may further be
amended from time to time in accordance with its provisions, is referred
to as the “General Bond Ordinance”),
providing the general terms and provisions for the issuance of unvoted
general obligations of the City, with
the specific terms of each series of
Bonds to be contained in ordinances
authorizing the issuance of Bonds in
accordance
with
the
provisions
thereof (the “Series Bond Ordinances”); and

April 19, 2006
Whereas, the authorization for
issuance of bonds is necessary to
enable the City to take advantage
of favorable market conditions on a
timely basis to obtain debt service
savings and as a result, this Ordinance
constitutes
an
emergency
measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public, peace,
property, health and safety, and for
the usual daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. General obligation refunding bonds of the City
(“Refunding Bonds”) are authorized
to be issued for the purpose of
refunding one or more series of the
City’s outstanding general obligation bonds, or designated maturities
thereof, issued to provide funds to
pay costs of Projects 1 through 79
and identified in the Certificate of
Award
authorized
in
Section
4
(“Refunded Bonds”), including the
payment of any expenses relating to
the
refunding
of
the
Refunded
Bonds and the issuance of the
Refunding Bonds, including any
financing costs within the meaning
of Revised Code Section 133.01(K),
provided the aggregate net present
value debt service savings resulting
from the refunding of the Refunded
Bonds is not less than three percent
(3%).
The aggregate principal amount
of Refunding Bonds to be issued
shall be in an amount determined by
the Director of Finance and set
forth in the Certificate of Award as
the amount required to be issued,
taking into account any original
issue discount and/or original issue
premium on the sale of the Refunding Bonds, in order to refund the
Refunded
Bonds
and
pay
any
expenses relating to the refunding
of the Refunded Bonds and the
issuance of the Refunding Bonds.
The Refunding Bonds may be issued
in one or more separate series, each
bearing a distinctive designation,
provided that the Refunding Bonds
of each series satisfy the requirements of this Ordinance and the
aggregate net present value debt
service savings to the City resulting
from
each
series
of
Refunding
Bonds is not less than three per cent
(3%). Separate series of Refunding
Bonds may be issued at the same or
different
times.
The
Refunding
Bonds of each series shall be designated as provided in the applicable Certificate of Award. A separate
Certificate of Award may be delivered for each series.
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The
Refunding
Bonds
shall
be
issued pursuant to the provisions of
Article XVIII of the Constitution of
Ohio, Revised Code Chapter 133 and
other applicable provisions of the
Revised Code, the Charter of the
City, the General Bond Ordinance
and this Ordinance in the principal
amount and for the purpose stated
in Section 1. The Refunding Bonds
of each series shall be issued in one
lot as fully registered bonds in
denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof but in no case
as to a particular maturity date
exceeding
the
principal
amount
maturing on that date. The Refund-

April 19, 2006
ing Bonds shall bear the designation
and be numbered as determined by
the Director of Finance.
The Refunding Bonds shall be
dated the date and shall bear interest at the rate or rates per year
specified
in
the
Certificate
of
Award, provided the weighted average of such rates (taking into
account the principal amount and
maturity of each Refunding Bond to
which a rate applies) shall not
exceed six percent (6%) per year.
Interest on the Refunding Bonds
shall be payable when due, or until
the principal amount is paid, semiannually on the first day of each of
two months specified in the Certificate of Award as the dates on which
interest on the Refunding Bonds
shall be payable (the “Interest Payment Dates”), beginning on the date
specified in the Certificate of Award
as the first Interest Payment Date.
The
Refunding
Bonds
shall
mature in the years and principal
amounts as shall be permitted by
law and determined by the Director
of Finance and specified in the Certificate of Award, based on the written advice of a Financial Advisor to
be in the best interests of the City
given market conditions at the time
the Refunding Bonds are sold and
the objectives of the plan of refunding to obtain aggregate net present
value debt service savings of not
less than three per cent (3%).
The Director of Finance also shall
determine and certify, on or prior to
the date of delivery of the Refunding Bonds to the Original Purchaser, that portion of the aggregate
principal amount of the Refunding
Bonds that is allocable to each Project, and the principal amount of
Refunding Bonds allocated to each
Project that shall be payable at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements (as defined below) on
the applicable principal payment
dates; provided, that (i) the aggregate
principal
amount
of
the
Refunding Bonds allocable to a Project shall be determined by the
Director of Finance on a pro rata
basis by reference to the respective
amount of funds that is required for
the
refunding
of
the
Refunded
Bonds that are allocable to that Project, taking into account any funds
other than the proceeds of the
Refunding Bonds that are available
and appropriated for that purpose,
and (ii) no portion of the aggregate
principal
amount
of
Refunding
Bonds allocated to a Project shall be
payable later than the maximum
maturity for that portion of the
Refunding Bonds as certified by the
Director of Finance.
The Refunding Bonds stated to
mature in any year may be issued
as term bonds (the “Term Refunding Bonds”), payable pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements as defined and
further described below. The Director of Finance shall determine in
the Certificate of Award whether
any of the Refunding Bonds shall be
issued as Term Refunding Bonds,
any dates (the “Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Refunding
Bonds shall be payable pursuant to
mandatory
sinking
fund
installments rather than at stated maturity and the amount of principal to be

The City Record
paid on each Mandatory Redemption
Date (the “Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Refunding Bonds shall be
subject to redemption prior to stated maturity as follows:
(a) Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption. If any of the Refunding
Bonds are issued as Term Refunding Bonds, the Term Refunding
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent,
currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of
and interest on any Term Refunding Bonds shall include amounts
sufficient to redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal
amount of Term Refunding Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided
below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Refunding Bonds in any aggregate
principal amount and to receive a
credit against the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption obligation) of the City for any Term
Refunding Bonds. That option shall
be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and corresponding mandatory redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Refunding
Bonds which prior thereto have been
redeemed (other than through the
operation of the Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements) or
purchased for cancellation and canceled by the Registrar, to the extent
not applied theretofore as a credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Refunding Bond so
delivered, or previously redeemed,
or purchased and canceled, shall be
credited by the Escrow Agent at 100
percent of the principal amount
thereof against the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption obligation). Any excess of that amount
over the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement shall be credited against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements (and cor-

745

45
responding mandatory redemption
obligations) in the order directed by
the Director of Finance.
(b)
Optional
Redemption.
The
Refunding Bonds may be subject to
redemption prior to maturity by and
at the option of the City, in whole
or in part on any date, in integral
multiples of $5,000, on the optional
redemption dates and at the redemption prices (expressed as a percentage
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed) specified in the Certificate of Award, plus, in each case,
accrued interest to the redemption
date. The first optional redemption
date for a series of Refunding
Bonds shall not be later than ten
years from the first Interest Payment Date of that series of Refunding Bonds, and the highest redemption price shall not be greater than
102%
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed. Based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, the
Director of Finance may determine
in the Certificate of Award that it
is in the best interests of the City
for some or all of the Refunding
Bonds not to be callable prior to
their stated maturity.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Refunding
Bonds, or portions thereof, to be
redeemed optionally shall be selected by lot prior to the selection by
lot of the Refunding Bonds to be
redeemed on the same date by operation of the Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements of
paragraph
(a).
The
Refunding
Bonds shall be redeemed pursuant
to this paragraph only upon written
notice from the Director of Finance
to the Registrar. That notice shall
specify the redemption date and the
principal amount of each maturity
of Refunding Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar.
There shall be deposited with the
Registrar on or prior to the redemption date, funds sufficient to redeem
at the redemption price, all of the
redeemable Refunding Bonds for
which notice of redemption has been
given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Refunding Bonds are called for redemption
at one time, they shall be called in
the order of maturities directed by
the Director of Finance. If fewer
than all Refunding Bonds of a single maturity are to be redeemed, the
selection of Refunding Bonds to be
redeemed, or portions thereof in
amounts of $5,000 or any integral
multiple thereof, shall be made by
the Registrar by lot in a manner
determined by the Registrar. In the
case of a partial redemption of
Refunding
Bonds
by
lot
when
Refunding Bonds of denominations
greater than $5,000 are then outstanding, each $5,000 unit of principal thereof shall be treated as
though it were a separate Refunding Bond of the denomination of
$5,000. If it is determined that one
or more, but not all of the $5,000
units of principal amount represented by a Refunding Bond are to be

46
called for redemption, then upon
notice of redemption of a $5,000 unit
or units, the registered owner of
that Refunding Bond shall surrender the Refunding Bond to the Registrar (i) for payment of the redemption price of the $5,000 unit or units
called for redemption (including,
without
limitation,
the
interest
accrued
to
the
date
fixed
for
redemption and any premium), and
(ii) for issuance, without charge to
the registered owner thereof, of a
new Refunding Bond or Refunding
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Refunding Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Refunding Bonds shall identify (i)
by designation, letters, numbers or
other
distinguishing
marks,
the
Refunding Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii) the redemption price to be paid, (iii) the date
fixed for redemption, and (iv) the
place or places where the amounts
due upon redemption are payable.
The notice shall be given by the
Registrar on behalf of the City by
mailing a copy of the redemption
notice by first class mail, postage
prepaid, at least thirty (30) days
prior to the date fixed for redemption, to the registered owner of each
Refunding Bond subject to redemption in whole or in part at the registered owner’s address shown on
the Register maintained by the Registrar at the close of business on the
fifteenth day preceding that mailing
and to any municipal Refunding
Bond insurance company that has
issued a policy insuring some or all
of the Refunding Bonds. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Refunding Bond, however, shall not affect
the validity of the proceedings for
the redemption of any Refunding
Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Refunding Bonds. Notice having been
mailed in the manner provided in
the
preceding
paragraph,
the
Refunding Bonds and portions thereof
called
for
redemption
shall
become due and payable on the
redemption date, and, upon presentation and surrender at the place or
places specified in that notice, shall
be paid. If money for the redemption of all of the Refunding Bonds
and portions thereof to be redeemed,
including interest accrued to the
redemption date, is held by the Registrar on the redemption date, and,
if notice of redemption has been
deposited in the mail, then from and
after the redemption date those
Refunding Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
that money shall not be so available
on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail, those Refunding
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held
by
the
Registrar
for
the

The City Record
redemption of particular Refunding
Bonds shall be held in trust for the
account of the registered owners
and shall be paid to them, respectively, upon presentation and surrender of those Refunding Bonds.
The debt charges on the Refunding Bonds shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of
America without deduction for the
services of the Registrar or Escrow
Agent as paying agent. Principal
shall be payable when due upon presentation
and
surrender
of
the
Refunding Bonds at the principal
corporate trust office of the Registrar. Interest on a Refunding Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Refunding Bond was registered, and
to that person’s address appearing,
on the Register (as defined in Section 3) at the close of business on
the date provided in the Registrar
Agreement authorized in Section 3
(the Record Date). Notwithstanding
any contrary provision in the General Bond Ordinance, so long as the
Refunding Bonds are held by a
Depository in a book entry system
(as described in Section 3), debt
charges on the Refunding Bonds
will be payable in lawful money of
the United States by wire transfer
to the Depository made by the
Escrow Agent on each Interest Payment Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance, except for the third paragraph of Section 13(a) (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 (pertaining generally to the periods during which the City is not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges
of
Refunding
Bonds
issued under the General Bond Ordinance), will apply to the Refunding
Bonds. Except for those provisions,
the General Bond Ordinance is
included as a part of this Ordinance
as fully as if restated in this Ordinance. Words and terms not otherwise defined in this Ordinance shall
have the same meaning as set forth
in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Refunding Bonds; Exchange and
Transfer of the Refunding Bonds;
Paying
Agents.
The
Refunding
Bonds shall express upon their faces
the purpose for which they are
issued and that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to
Section 4 of the General Bond Ordinance, each Refunding Bond shall
be authenticated by the manual signature of an authorized officer of
the Trustee (as defined therein).
The
Refunding
Bonds
shall
be
signed by the City’s Mayor and by
the City’s Director of Finance, and,
consistent with Revised Code Section 133.27 and notwithstanding Section 177.02 of the Codified Ordinances of the City, either or both of
those signatures may be a facsimile. The Refunding Bonds shall bear
the seal of the City, which seal may
be a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section 83 of the City’s Charter, the
Director of Law shall prepare the
Refunding Bonds and shall endorse
thereon his approval of the form and

746

April 19, 2006
correctness thereof by his manual or
facsimile signature.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating agent, bond registrar, transfer
agent and paying agent for the
Refunding Bonds (the “Registrar”);
provided that the Escrow Agent
shall also act as paying agent for
the Refunding Bonds so long as the
Refunding Bonds are held in a book
entry
system.
The
Director
of
Finance shall sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
an agreement among the City, the
Registrar and the Escrow Agent
(the “Registrar Agreement”) approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, containing
terms that are not inconsistent with
this Ordinance and not substantially adverse to the City and that are
approved by the Director of Finance
on behalf of the City, all of which
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Registrar Agreement by the Director of Finance.
Payment for the services rendered
and for reimbursement of expenses
incurred pursuant to the Registrar
Agreement shall be made from the
proceeds of the Refunding Bonds, to
the extent available, and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated for that purpose.
So long as any of the Refunding
Bonds remain outstanding, the City
will cause the Registrar to maintain
and keep at its principal corporate
trust office all books and records
necessary
for
the
registration,
exchange and transfer of Refunding
Bonds as provided in this Section
(the “Register”). Subject to the provisions of Section 5, the person in
whose name a Refunding Bond is
registered on the Register shall be
regarded as the absolute owner of
that Refunding Bond for all purposes of this ordinance. Payment of or
on account of the debt charges on
any Refunding Bond shall be made
only to or upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall be affected by any notice
to the contrary, but the registration
may be changed as provided in this
Section. All such payments shall be
valid and effectual to satisfy and
discharge the City’s liability upon
the
Refunding
Bond,
including
interest, to the extent of the amount
or amounts so paid.
Any Refunding Bond may be
exchanged for Refunding Bonds of
any authorized denomination upon
presentation and surrender at the
principal corporate trust office of
the
Registrar,
together
with
a
request for exchange signed by the
registered owner or by a person
legally empowered to do so in a
form satisfactory to the Registrar. A
Refunding Bond may be transferred
only on the Register upon presentation and surrender of the Refunding
Bond at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar together with
an assignment signed by the registered owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Refunding Bond or
Refunding Bonds of any authorized
denomination
or
denominations
requested by the owner equal in the
aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Refunding Bond

April 19, 2006
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Refunding Bonds only
after the new Refunding Bonds are
signed by the authorized officers of
the City. In all cases of Refunding
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall
authenticate
and
deliver
Refunding
Bonds
in
accordance
with the provisions of this ordinance. The exchange or transfer
shall be without charge to the
owner, except that the City and Registrar may make a charge sufficient
to reimburse them for any tax or
other governmental charge required
to be paid with respect to the
exchange or transfer. The City or
the Registrar may require that those
charges, if any, be paid before the
procedure is begun for the exchange
or transfer. All Refunding Bonds
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Refunding Bonds
surrendered upon that exchange or
transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Refunding Bonds may be issued in
book entry form in accordance with
the provisions of this Section. As
used in this Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Refunding
Bonds and the principal of and
interest on the Refunding Bonds
may be transferred only through a
book entry, and (ii) physical Refunding Bond certificates in fully
registered form are issued by the
City only to a Depository or its nominee as registered owner, with the
Refunding Bonds “immobilized” in
the custody of the Depository. The
book entry maintained by others
than the City is the record that identifies the owners of beneficial interests in those Refunding Bonds and
that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Refunding Bonds may be
issued to a Depository for use in a
book entry system and, if and as
long as a book entry system is utilized: (i) the Refunding Bonds may
be issued in the form of a single,
fully registered Refunding Bond
representing each maturity and reg-

The City Record
istered in the name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered
owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository; (ii) the beneficial owners in book entry form
shall have no right to receive
Refunding Bonds in the form of
physical securities or certificates;
(iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form shall be
shown by book entry on the system
maintained and operated by the
Depository and its Participants, and
transfers of the ownership of beneficial interests shall be made only
by book entry by the Depository and
its
Participants;
and
(iv)
the
Refunding Bonds as such shall not
be transferable or exchangeable,
except
for
transfer
to
another
Depository or to another nominee of
a Depository, without further action
by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Refunding Bonds for use in
a book entry system, the Director of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Refunding Bonds from the
Depository, and the Trustee and
Registrar shall authenticate and
deliver Refunding Bond certificates
in registered form to the assigns of
the Depository or its nominee, all at
the cost and expense (including any
costs of printing), if the event is not
the result of City action or inaction,
of those persons requesting such
issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
authorized to the extent necessary
or required to enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with the book entry system
for the Refunding Bonds, after
determining that the signing thereof will not endanger the funds or
securities of the City and after the
approval of the form of any such
agreement by the Director of Law.
Section
4.
Sale
of
Refunding
Bonds. The Refunding Bonds shall
first be offered for purchase to the
Trustees of the Sinking Fund and,
if not purchased by them, shall be
offered to the Treasury Investment
Account for purchase and, if not
purchased for that Account, shall be
sold to one or more firms that have
proposed to underwrite the Refunding Bonds and have been selected
by the Director of Finance based on
an evaluation of the qualifications
of those firms (collectively, the
“Original Purchaser”).
The Refunding Bonds shall be
awarded to the Original Purchaser
in the Certificate of Award which
shall specify the final terms of the
Refunding
Bonds
in
accordance
with law, the provisions of this Ordinance, the written advice of a
Financial Advisor and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Refunding Bonds, including: the
principal amount of the Refunding
Bonds, the purchase price (which
shall be not less than 97% of the
principal amount of the Refunding
Bonds plus any accrued interest to

747

47
their date of delivery), interest rate
or rates, the amounts and years in
which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements),
the
Interest Payment Dates and the
date of the Refunding Bonds, and
any other matters required in this
Ordinance to be set forth in that
Certificate. As appropriate under the
Charter, the Director of Finance,
Director of Law, Clerk of Council
and other appropriate officers of the
City are, and each of them is, authorized to take such actions as are
necessary, appropriate and in the
best interest of the City to establish
the terms and requirements for
delivery of the Refunding Bonds
and to make such arrangements as
are necessary with the Original Purchaser in order to establish the date,
location, and procedure, and conditions for the delivery of the Refunding Bonds to the Original Purchaser, to give all appropriate notices
and certificates, to cause a true
transcript of proceedings with reference
to
the
issuance
of
the
Refunding Bonds to be delivered to
the Original Purchaser, to sign any
transcript
certificates,
financial
statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Refunding Bonds. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to
sign and deliver on behalf of the
City a bond purchase agreement
between the City and the Original
Purchaser
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, setting forth the terms and
conditions on which the City agrees
to sell the Refunding Bonds and the
Original Purchaser agrees to buy
the Refunding Bonds, which shall
be consistent with this Ordinance,
not substantially adverse to the
City, and approved by the Director
of Finance and the Director of Law
on behalf of the City, all of which
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Bond Purchase
Agreement
by
the
Director
of
Finance. It is determined that the
terms of the Refunding Bonds, as
provided in this Ordinance and as
may be provided in or pursuant to
the Certificate of Award, are in the
best interest of the City and in compliance with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an Official
Statement is appropriate or necessary in connection with the original
issuance of the Refunding Bonds,
the Director of Finance is authorized to prepare or cause to be prepared on behalf of the City an Official Statement and any necessary
supplements and to authorize the
use and distribution of that Official
Statement and any supplements. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign on behalf of the City that Official Statement and any supplements.
The Director of Finance is authorized to sign and deliver, on behalf
of the City, such certificates in connection with the accuracy of the
Official Statement and any supple-

48
ments as may, in the Director’s
judgment, be necessary or appropriate. The Director of Finance is also
authorized to determine and certify
on behalf of the City that such disclosure document is “deemed final”
by the City within the meaning of
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12 (the “SEC Rule”).
The Director of Finance is authorized to contract for services for the

and termination, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare or
cause to be prepared, and to sign
and deliver, in the name and on

of that Agreement shall be subject
to the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs

Bonds at maturity, there shall be
and is levied on all the taxable property in the City, in addition to all
other taxes, a direct tax annually
during the period the Refunding
Bonds
are
outstanding,
in
an

as the same shall fall due, and also

Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is ordered
computed,
certified,

shall be placed before and in preference to all other items and for the
full amount thereof. The funds
derived from those tax levies shall

The City Record

funds, together with the interest collected on them shall be irrevocably

of such tax shall be reduced by the
amount of such revenues so available and appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,

Sections 133.25(B)(1) and 5705.51 of
the Revised Code, and in accordance

together
with
moneys
referred to in (i) above, for the payment, at their maturities or redemption dates, of all debt charges on the
Refunding Bonds to their date of

Bonds will not (i) constitute private
activity bonds, arbitrage bonds or
hedge bonds under Sections 141, 148

of 1986, as amended (the Code) or

Bonds to the governmental purpose
of the borrowing, (ii) restrict the

Code.
Each covenant made in this section with respect to the Refunding
Bonds is also made with respect to
all issues any portion of the debt
service on which is paid from proceeds of the Refunding Bonds (and,

to take actions with respect to those

section to take with respect to the
Refunding Bonds.

in
the
amount
of

$63,750,000).
“Refunded Bonds” means those
Outstanding Revenue Bonds identified in a Certificate of Award to be
refunded from proceeds of Refunding Bonds.
“Refunding
Bonds”
means
the
Airport System Revenue Refunding
Bonds authorized by this Ordinance
to be issued as Additional Revenue
Bonds under the Indenture for the
purpose of refunding one or more
series
of
Outstanding
Revenue
Bonds,
or
designated
maturities
thereof, to obtain debt service savings.
“Supplemental Indenture” means
each Supplemental Trust Indenture
delivered to supplement and amend
the Indenture, to further provide for
the terms and security of one or
more series of Refunding Bonds.
For purposes of comparing this
Ordinance with the Series 1976 Ordinance, the following terms shall
have the same meaning: “City” and
“Issuer,” “Council” and “Governing
Body,” “Director of Finance” and
“Fiscal Officer,” and “Ordinance”
and “Bond Legislation.”
Section 2. Authorization of the
Refunding Bonds.
This Council finds and determines
it is necessary and proper and in the
best interest of the City to authorize
the issuance of Refunding Bonds for
the purpose of refunding one or
more series of the Outstanding Revenue Bonds, or designated maturities thereof, to obtain aggregate net
present value debt service savings
of not less than three percent (3%).
The Refunding Bonds may be issued
in one or more separate series so
long as the aggregate net present
value savings achieved by each
series shall be not less than three
percent (3%). The principal amount
of each series of Refunding Bonds
is to be the amount set forth in the
Certificate of Award authorized in
Section 5 and shall be the amount
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
necessary (i) to refund the Refunded Bonds, (ii) to fund any deposit
to the Bond Service Reserve Fund
required under the Indenture, (iv) to
pay costs of any Credit Support
Instruments, (v) to pay identified
amounts owed under Hedge Agreements, and (vi) to pay costs of issuing
the
Refunding
Bonds
and
refunding the Refunded Bonds. The
proceeds from the sale of each
series of Refunding Bonds shall be
allocated, deposited and applied as
provided in Section 6 of this Ordinance.
The Refunding Bonds may be
issued in one or more separate
series, each bearing a distinctive
designation, provided that the Refunding Bonds of each series satisfy the requirements of this Ordinance and the Indenture. Separate
series of Refunding Bonds may be
issued at the same or different
times. The Refunding Bonds of each
series shall be designated as provided in the applicable Certificate of
Award. A separate Certificate of
Award and a separate Supplemental

52
Indenture may be delivered for each
series. Costs of issuance of the
Refunding Bonds and any required
deposit to the Debt Service Reserve
Fund attributable to the Refunding
Bonds shall, in each case, be included in the costs funded from the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds. The
Refunding Bonds shall constitute
Revenue Bonds for all purposes of
the Indenture.
This Council finds and determines
that the issuance of the Refunding
Bonds to obtain debt service savings
with respect to Refunded Bonds
serves a proper, public, municipal
purpose by reducing the costs of air
travel facilities serving the people
of the City of Cleveland, thereby
increasing and promoting commerce
by providing necessary transportation for individuals and commercial
enterprises purchasing and selling
services and products in northeastern Ohio, and creating and preserving jobs and employment opportunities in the City and improving the
economic welfare of the City.
Section 3. Authorization of Hedging Arrangements.
This Council finds that by engaging
in
interest
rate
hedging
arrangements, from time to time, the
City may reduce its cost of borrowing
by
optimizing
the
relative
amounts of fixed and variable rate
obligations and minimizing the risk
of variations in its debt service
costs. Certain types of hedging
arrangements (referred to in this
Ordinance
as
“swaptions”)
may
enable to the City to obtain savings
prior to the issuance of Refunding
Bonds by providing for an upfront
payment to the City by a financial
institution or other organization
that is the counterparty to the
hedge arrangement in consideration
of the City’s giving the counterparty the option to make effective at a
future date an interest rate exchange transaction with the City. To
permit the City to have the flexibility to undertake interest rate
swap, swaption, rate cap, rate collar
and other hedging transactions from
time to time, and to establish the
procedures
for
approving
those
transactions, this Council authorizes
the signing and delivery of one or
more agreements (each, a “Hedge
Agreement”) and any related agreements necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by each Hedge Agreement. The
authorizations in this Section 3 are
supplemental to and not in derogation of any authority provided by
any other ordinance of this Council
concerning hedging arrangements.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is to the financial advantage of the City and in the City’s
best
interests
that
a
hedging
arrangement be undertaken by the
City with respect to any Revenue
Bonds issued or to be issued under
the
Indenture,
the
Director
of
Finance may authorize one or more
interest rate hedge transactions in
accordance
with
the
applicable
Hedge Agreement; provided that (a)
the counterparty shall be rated at the
time of signing the Hedge Agreement not lower than A+ or A1 by at
least one rating agency or its obligations under the Hedge Agreement

The City Record
shall be guaranteed or insured by an
entity rated at the time of signing
the Hedge Agreement not lower than
A+ or A1 by at least one rating
agency, and (b) the term of each
hedge transaction shall not exceed
the final maturity of the Revenue
Bonds to which the hedge relates or
(in the case of an option) will relate.
The Director of Finance shall
negotiate the terms of each Hedge
Agreement with a counterparty satisfying the credit criteria in this
Ordinance. The City shall receive a
written opinion of a Financial Advisor that the upfront payment or the
periodic payments, as the case may
be, to be made by the counterparty
to the City, or by the City to the
counterparty, shall be fair value for
the Hedge Agreement, given the
credit of the counterparty and the
terms and conditions of the Hedge
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall determine the terms and conditions of the Hedge Agreement,
including without limitation, the
time or times and procedures for the
exercise by the counterparty or the
City, as the case may be, of its
option under the Hedge Agreement,
whether the obligations of the City
under the Hedge Agreement shall be
secured by a Credit Support Instrument, and the rates to be paid by
the counterparty to the City and by
the City to the counterparty under
the Hedge Agreement in the event
of the exercise of the option. The
approval of each interest rate hedge
transaction
by
the
Director
of
Finance shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery
of the applicable Hedge Agreement
by the Director of Finance.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from
the
Airport
Revenues
as
defined in the Indenture and may be
payable also from other funds permitted by law to be used for the purpose, as identified by the Director of
Finance in the Hedge Agreement.
Those payments may be secured by
a pledge of Airport Revenues, to the
extent permitted by the Indenture,
all as determined by the Director of
Finance and set forth in the Hedge
Agreement. The obligation of the
City to make payments under any
Hedge Agreement does not and shall
not represent or constitute a general
obligation, debt, bonded indebtedness
or a pledge of the faith and credit
of the City or the State of Ohio. Nothing gives any party to any Hedge
Agreement the right to have excises,
ad valorem or other taxes levied by
the City or the State of Ohio for the
payment of any amounts due under
any Hedge Agreement.
Section 4. Terms of Refunding
Bonds.
The Refunding Bonds shall contain the terms provided in or determined pursuant to, the Indenture,
this Ordinance, the applicable Certificate of Award and the applicable
Supplemental Indenture. Each series
of Refunding Bonds may be secured
by a separate Supplemental Indenture,
or
a
single
Supplemental
Indenture may secure more than one
series of Refunding Bonds.
(a) General. In the event that the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, determines that the City’s best

752

April 19, 2006
interests will be served by causing
a series of Refunding Bonds to be
obligations bearing interest at variable interest rates, then the Director of Finance is authorized to so
specify in the Certificate of Award
for that series. If the Director of
Finance so determines, then the
method and procedure by which the
variable rate of interest to be borne
by the Refunding Bonds of that
series shall be determined as provided in the applicable Supplemental Indenture, whether by auction,
by reference to a market index, by
a remarketing agent or otherwise,
provided that no series of variable
rate Refunding Bonds shall bear
interest at a rate in excess of twenty-five
percent
(25%)
per
year
(including any Refunding Bonds
held by a provider of a Credit Support Instrument). The Director of
Finance may determine that the
terms of a variable rate series of
Refunding Bonds may or may not
permit the holders to tender their
variable rate Refunding Bonds for
purchase by the City. If the Director of Finance designates any series
of Refunding Bonds as variable rate
Refunding Bonds, and if the Holders of that series of Refunding
Bonds are to be entitled to tender
those Refunding Bonds for purchase, then the Director of Finance
shall also designate for those variable rate Refunding Bonds (and
may designate others, from time to
time, in substitution therefor), the
tender agent or agents and the
remarketing agent or agents, which
designations shall be based on the
determination of the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed
to provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable. The Director of Finance is authorized to enter
into agreements in connection with
the
delivery
of
the
Refunding
Bonds, and from time to time thereafter so long as the Refunding
Bonds are outstanding, with providers of Credit Support Instruments, tender agents (which may be
the Trustee), remarketing agents
(which may be any of the Original
Purchasers) and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the method of
determining the variable interest
rates, permitting holders the right
of tender and providing for payment
of the purchase price of, or debt service on, the variable rate Refunding
Bonds. In the event the variable rate
Refunding Bonds are issued as auction rate obligations, the Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements, from time to time, with
auction agents and others, or to
cause the Trustee to enter into those
agreements, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor that
the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed
to provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of
any series of Refunding Bonds, and

April 19, 2006
regardless of whether that series of
Refunding Bonds bears interest at
variable or fixed rates, is authorized
to contract for a Credit Support
Instrument, and to pay the costs of
it from proceeds of the Refunding
Bonds, if the Director determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the Credit
Support Instrument will result in a
savings in the cost of the financing
to the City.
(b) Form; Exchange and Transfer.
All Refunding Bonds shall be issued
in
fully
registered
form.
The
Refunding Bonds initially shall be
delivered only in book-entry form,
shall be registered in the name of
the Depository or its nominee, as
registered owner, and immobilized
in the custody of the Depository,
and shall not be transferable or
exchangeable (except for transfer to
another Depository or its nominee)
without further action by the City
pursuant to the provisions of the
Supplemental
Indenture.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Original Indenture, no
Refunding
Bonds
shall
be
exchanged for or transferable into a
coupon Revenue Bond or Bonds
unless and until the Indenture shall
have been amended in accordance
with the terms thereof to permit
such exchanges or transfers. To the
extent that the Original Indenture
(particularly, but without limitation,
Section 2.05) permits fully registered
Revenue
Bonds
to
be
exchanged for or transferred into
coupon Revenue Bonds or Revenue
Bonds payable to bearer, then the
Original Indenture is amended to
prohibit such exchanges or transfers
for the Refunding Bonds unless and
until the Indenture shall have been
further amended to permit such
exchanges or transfers.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Refunding Bonds of any
series for use in a book entry system, the Director of Finance and the
Trustee may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance and the Trustee do not or
are unable to do so, the Director of
Finance and the Trustee, after making provision for notification of the
beneficial
owners
by
the
then
Depository and any other arrangements deemed necessary, shall permit withdrawal of the Refunding
Bonds of any series from the Depository, and authenticate and deliver
registered Bond certificates to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of action
or inaction of the City, of those persons requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is authorized and directed to enter into any
agreements determined by the Director to be necessary in connection
with the book entry system for the
Refunding Bonds, after determining
that those agreements will not
endanger the funds or securities of
the City under the Indenture (as evidenced by the Director’s signing of
those agreements).
(c) Dates; Denominations. The Refunding Bonds of each series shall
be dated as of the date or dates pro-

The City Record
vided in the Certificate of Award for
that series. The Refunding Bonds of
each series shall be issued in the
denominations permitted in the Supplemental Indenture for that series.
(d) Interest and Place of Payment. The Refunding Bonds of each
series shall bear interest at their
respective interest rates specified in
the Certificate of Award (or, in the
case of variable rate Refunding
Bonds, determined pursuant to the
Supplemental Indenture) for that
series. The Refunding Bonds of each
series shall bear interest from the
most recent date to which interest
has been paid or duly provided for
or, if no interest has been paid or
duly provided for, from their date.
The principal and any redemption
premium and the interest payable on
each series of Refunding Bonds
shall be payable at the times, to the
persons and in the manner set forth
in, or referenced by, the Supplemental Indenture, including, without
limitation, provisions thereof permitting special arrangements for
payments to the Depository.
(e) Maturities. The Refunding
Bonds of each series shall mature on
the dates and in the respective principal amounts provided in the Certificate of Award, consistent with
this Ordinance and the Indenture.
(f) Optional and Mandatory Redemption. The Refunding Bonds of
each series may be subject to
redemption prior to maturity at the
option of the City, if and to the
extent so provided in the Certificate
of Award for that series. Any
Refunding Bonds so determined to
be subject to optional redemption
and maturing by their stated terms
after the earliest optional redemption date shall be subject to redemption at the option of the City on or
after the earliest optional redemption date in whole or in part on any
date at the redemption prices provided in the Certificate of Award
and in accordance with the applicable Supplemental Indenture and the
Indenture. The Refunding Bonds
designated in the Certificate of
Award as term bonds subject to
mandatory sinking fund redemption
shall be redeemed prior to maturity
on each mandatory redemption date
designated in the Certificate of
Award in the aggregate amount of
the sinking fund installment to be
paid on such mandatory redemption
date, all as provided in the Certificate of Award and in accordance
with the Supplemental Indenture.
(g) Signing. The Refunding Bonds
shall be signed by the Mayor and
the Director of Finance, and approved as to form by the Director of
Law. Any or all of the signatures of
those officials may be facsimiles.
The Refunding Bonds shall bear the
corporate seal of the City or a facsimile thereof.
(h) Numbering. The Refunding
Bonds shall be numbered as determined by the Director of Finance.
Section 5. Award and Sale of
Refunding Bonds.
The Director of Finance shall sign
and deliver a Certificate of Award
for the Refunding Bonds. In the

753

53
event the Refunding Bonds are
issued in more than one series sold
at different times, a separate Certificate of Award shall be signed
and delivered for each separately
delivered series. The sale of the
Refunding Bonds shall be awarded
to the Original Purchasers selected
by the Director of Finance and identified in the Certificate of Award,
following
consultation
with
the
Director of Port Control and based
on an evaluation of the qualifications of firms that have proposed to
underwrite the Refunding Bonds.

the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, consistent with this Ordinance and the Indenture:

to the City by those Original Purchasers, which amount shall be not
less than: (i) 97% of the amount
determined by adding to the aggregate principal amount of the Refunding Bonds any aggregate original issue premium and subtracting
from that amount any aggregate
original issue discount, plus (ii) any
accrued interest on the Refunding
Bonds from their date to the date of
their delivery to the Original Purchasers;
(c) whether any Refunding Bonds
are to be subject to optional redemption prior to maturity, and, if so, the
earliest optional redemption date for
those Refunding Bonds subject to
prior redemption, which shall be not
later than ten years from the first
interest payment date of the applicable
series,
and
the
applicable
redemption price, which shall be not
greater than 102% of the principal
amount redeemed;
(d) the dates on which principal
of the Refunding Bonds is to be
paid, which shall be not later than
thirty (30) years from their respective dates of issuance, with an identification of whether the payment is
due by stated maturity or by mandatory sinking fund redemption of
Refunding Bonds of a particular
maturity;
(e) the interest rates to be borne
by Refunding Bonds bearing interest at a fixed rate, the weighted
average of which shall not exceed
six percent (6%) as to Refunding
Bonds of any series that are TaxExempt Bonds (as defined in Section 9) and shall not exceed eight
percent (8%) as to Refunding Bonds
of any series that are not TaxExempt Bonds, and the method by
which the interest rate is to be
determined for Refunding Bonds
bearing interest at variable rates,

and
any
determination
as
to

54
whether
there
shall
be
special
reserve fund for the Refunding
Bonds of any series, separate from
the common Bond Service Reserve
Fund, or a municipal bond insurance
policy, bank letter or line of credit,
or other form of credit or liquidity
facility enhancing the security for
Refunding Bonds of that series in
lieu of a funded reserve fund;
(i) the Paying Agent; and
(j) whether any Refunding Bonds
are to be secured by or payable from
a Credit Support Instrument.
It is determined that the terms of
the Refunding Bonds as so determined within the limitations set
forth in this Ordinance and as so
specified and set forth in the Certificate of Award will be in the best
interest of the City and consistent
with all legal requirements.
The Director of Finance may
enter into one or more Bond Purchase Agreements with the Original
Purchasers of Refunding Bonds setting forth the conditions for delivery of the Refunding Bonds that are
consistent with this Ordinance, the
Certificate of Award, and the Indenture and that are determined by the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, to be customary for airport revenue bonds issued by governmental
entities, including, without limitation, representations as to the accuracy and completeness of information contained in the Official Statement of the City described in Section 11.

Section 7. Refunding of Outstanding Revenue Bonds; Escrow Agreements.
The Director of Finance is authorized to sign and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of the City, an
escrow agreement between the City
and the Trustee, as escrow trustee,
providing for, among other matters:
the
investment

holding
in
escrow of the proceeds of the
Refunding Bonds to be applied to
the
refunding
of
the
Refunded
Bonds; the application of the moneys derived from those investments
to the payment of the Bond service
charges on those Refunded Bonds;
and the irrevocable call for redemption of those Outstanding Revenue
Bonds identified in the Certificate of
Award to be Refunded Bonds to be
called for redemption prior to maturity. The Director of Finance shall
provide for the payment of the services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant

The Director of Finance, the Director of Port Control and other appropriate City officials shall sign all
documents
and
take
all
other
actions necessary or appropriate on
the part of the City to effect such
refunding in accordance with the
Indenture and to cause the Refunded Bonds to be deemed paid and discharged, including without limitation, the retention of an independent
firm of accountants to verify the
mathematical accuracy of the calculations relating to the escrow.
Section 8. Authorization of Supplemental Indentures.
In order to secure the payment of
the principal of and any premium
and
interest
on
the
Refunding
Bonds, the Director of Finance and
the Director of Port Control are
authorized, in the name and on
behalf of the City, to sign and deliver to the Trustee, in trust for the
Original Purchasers and subsequent
holders of the Refunding Bonds, one
or more Supplemental Indentures,
approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, not inconsistent with this Ordinance, the Certificate of Award and the Indenture
and not substantially adverse to the
City as may be approved by the officers signing the same on behalf of
the City. The determination by those
officers that a Supplemental Indenture is not substantially adverse to
the City shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery
of that Supplemental Indenture by
those officers. Any Supplemental

advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
in the best interests of the City.
Section 9. Tax Covenants.
With respect to Refunding Bonds
that are to be issued and sold as
obligations bearing interest to be
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes (the “TaxExempt Bonds”), the City covenants
that it will use, and will restrict the
use and investment of, the proceeds
of the Tax-Exempt Bonds in such
manner and to such extent as may
be necessary so that (a) the interest on the Tax-Exempt Bonds will
be excluded from gross income for
federal income tax purposes, and
(b) in the case of any Tax-Exempt
Bonds qualifying as bonds, the interest on which is not treated as an
item of tax preference under Section
57 of the Code (“Non-AMT Bonds”),
such Tax-Exempt Bonds will be
treated as Non-AMT Bonds.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the TaxExempt Bonds to be and to remain
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will
not take or authorize to be taken
any actions that would adversely
affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or
persons acting for it, will, among
other acts of compliance, (i) apply
the proceeds of the Tax-Exempt
Bonds to the governmental purposes
of the borrowing, (ii) restrict the
yield on investment property, (iii)
make timely and adequate payments
to the federal government, (iv)
maintain books and records and
make calculations and reports, and
(v) refrain from certain uses of
those proceeds and, as applicable, of
property financed with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the
extent necessary to assure such
exclusion of that interest under the
Code.
The Director of Finance, or any
other officer of the City having
responsibility for issuance of the
Tax-Exempt Bonds, is hereby authorized (a) to make or effect any election, selection, designation, choice,
consent, approval, or waiver on
behalf of the City with respect to
the Tax-Exempt Bonds as the City
is permitted or required to make or
give under the federal income tax
laws, including, without limitation
thereto, any of the elections provided for in Section 148(f)(4)(C) of the
Code or available under Section 148
of the Code, for the purpose of
assuring, enhancing or protecting
the favorable tax treatment or status of the Tax-Exempt Bonds or
interest thereon or assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose,
reducing
the
burden
or
expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or payments
of penalties, or making payments of
special amounts in lieu of making
computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as rebate, or
obviating those amounts or payments, as determined by that officer,
which action shall be in writing and
signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf

April 19, 2006
of the City, as may be appropriate
to assure the exclusion of interest
from gross income and the intended
tax status of the Tax-Exempt Bonds,
and (c) to give one or more appropriate certificates of the City, for
inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Tax-Exempt Bonds,
setting forth the reasonable expectations of the City regarding the
amount and use of all the proceeds
of the Tax-Exempt Bonds, the facts,
circumstances
and
estimates
on
which they are based, and other
facts and circumstances relevant to
the tax treatment of the interest on
and the tax status of the TaxExempt Bonds.
Each covenant made in this Section
with respect to the Tax-Exempt
Bonds is also made with respect to
all issues any portion of the debt service on which is paid from proceeds
of the Tax-Exempt Bonds (and, if different, the original issue and any
refunding issues in a series of
refundings), to the extent such compliance is necessary to assure exclusion of interest on the Tax-Exempt
Bonds from gross income for federal
income tax purposes, and the officers
identified above are authorized to
take actions with respect to those
issues as they are authorized in this
Section to take with respect to the
Tax-Exempt Bonds.
Section 10. Additional Documents.
The Director of Finance, the Director of Port Control and other City
officials are authorized to sign and
deliver such instruments, certificates
and documents as are necessary or
appropriate to consummate the transactions authorized by this Ordinance,
the Bond Purchase Agreements, the
Supplemental Indentures, the Indenture, the Escrow Agreements and the
Hedge Agreements.
The Director of Finance, the
Director of Port Control, the Director of Law and other City officials,
as appropriate, are authorized to
make the necessary arrangements
on behalf of the City to establish the
date, location, procedure and conditions for the delivery of each series
