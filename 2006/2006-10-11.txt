By Council Member Dolan
An emergency resolution urging
Ohio Supreme Court Justices to
immediately and voluntarily recuse
themselves from all pending cases
when they have accepted contributions from parties involved; urging
the Ohio Supreme Court to restore
public confidence in the judiciary by
requiring all Ohio judges to recuse
themselves from all pending cases
when they have accepted contributions from litigants involved in such
cases; and urging the Ohio Supreme
Court to restore and promote the
public perception of a fair and
impartial judiciary in Ohio by prohibiting all judges in Ohio from
receiving contributions from litigants involved in said cases.
Whereas, on October 1, 2006 New
York Times and Columbus Dispatch
newspapers
reported
that
Ohio
Supreme Court Justices routinely sit
on cases after receiving campaign
contributions
from
the
parties
involved or from groups that file
support briefs in active pending
cases; and
Whereas, in the 12 years studied
by the New York Times, Ohio
Supreme Court justices almost never
disqualified themselves from hearing contributors’ cases; and
Whereas, the Code of Judicial
Ethics requires judges to disqualify
themselves whenever their impartiality might reasonably be questioned over financial or other conflicts; the exception to this is campaign contributions; and
Whereas, in order to maintain the
public trust in our judiciary, the
Codes of Professional Conduct and
Judicial Ethics require all attorneys
and judges to avoid all conduct that
creates an appearance of impropriety, and to disqualify themselves
whenever their impartiality might
reasonably be questioned over financial or other conflicts; and
Whereas, special interest groups
are paying a larger and more powerful role in the elections of judges
in Ohio; and
Whereas, according to the New
York Times, justices campaigns routinely took contributions after cases
involving contributors were argued,
and before they were decided; and
Whereas, taking financial contributions from litigants in pending
cases creates the perception and
appearance that Justices decisions
can be influenced and/or bought;
indeed, such contributions may be
perceived by the public as bribes;
Whereas, Justices’ acceptance of
financial contributions from litigants with cases pending before
them creates a clear appearance of
impropriety, sullies the public perception of an impartial judiciary
and undermines the public trust in
Ohio’s judicial integrity; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
Ohio Supreme Court Justices to
immediately and voluntarily recuse
themselves from all pending cases

The City Record
when they have accepted contributions from parties involved while
said causes are pending before the
Court.
Section 2. That this Council urges
Ohio Supreme Court to restore the
public trust in our judiciary by
immediately
requiring
all
Ohio
judges to recuse themselves from all
pending cases in which they have
accepted

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 1616-06.
By Council Member White.
An emergency resolution supporting the Union Miles Development
Corporation’s Clean Ohio Assistance
Fund grant application to the Ohio
Department
of
Development
for
asbestos abatement and demolition
of certain buildings for development
of the Miles Shopping Center.
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the Union Miles Development
Corporation’s Clean Ohio Assistance
Fund grant application to the Ohio
Department
of
Development
for
asbestos abatement and demolition
of certain buildings located at 4141
East 131st Street, 4159 East 131st
Street, 13109 Miles Avenue, 13201
Miles Avenue, and 13205 Miles Avenue for development of the Miles
Shopping Plaza.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to send copies of this
resolution to the Ohio Department of
Development, the Cuyahoga County
Board of County Commissioners and
Union Miles Development Corporation.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted October 2, 2006.
Effective October 10, 2006.

Res. No. 1645-06.
By Council Members Cimperman
and Cummins.
An emergency resolution urging
United States Senator Mike DeWine
to support meaningful legislation to
fix the Medicare Part D prescription
drug program and eliminate the
“donut hole” so that Medicare health
care coverage is simple, affordable,
and guaranteed for seniors and disabled Ohioans.
Whereas, on September 22, 2006, as
part of Americans United “National
Donut Hole Day,” Ohioans United
and local victims of the Medicare
Part D prescription drug program
“donut hole” coverage gap demonstrated outside of United States Senator Mike DeWine’s office to urge
Congress to fix Part D today; and
Whereas, the average senior and
disabled Ohioan falls into the Medicare Part D “donut hole” gap in coverage for members whose annual
drug cost are between $2,250 and
$5,100, and are forced to pay full cost
of their prescription drugs on top of
their costly monthly premiums; and

18
Whereas, seniors and disabled
Ohioans who missed the deadline to
sign up for the Medicare Part D prescription drug program will be
slapped with a minimum of a 7%
life-time penalty to their monthly
premiums when they are eventually
allowed to be covered by a Part D
plan again in January 2007; and
Whereas, dozens of private insurance plans with different co-pays,
coverage drug lists, and deductibles
are
complicated
and
confusing,
causing thousands of seniors and
disabled Ohioans to sign up for the
wrong plan or miss the deadline for
coverage; and
Whereas, seniors whose prescription drug benefits are capped, similarly to falling into the “donut hole,”
are more likely to skip doses of
treatments, less likely to visit hospital emergency departments, and
have 22% higher mortality rates
than those without capped benefits,
according to a study in the New
England Journal of Medicine; and
Whereas, Part D prohibits Medicare from negotiating with drug
companies to get better prices for
seniors, which has resulted in prices
that are at least 50% higher than
those negotiated by the Veterans
Administration for veterans; and
Whereas, insurance companies are
allowed to take drugs off their
approved coverage list during the
year, but patients are locked in and
cannot change plans until the next
year; and
Whereas, this Council urges Congress to fix Part D by closing the
“donut hole” gap in coverage for
annual costs between $2,250 and
$5,100 that had resulted in millions
of seniors being denied prescription
drug coverage each year while they
still pay monthly premiums; and
Whereas, this Council urges Congress to reduce the cost of prescription drugs by requiring Medicare to negotiate lower prices from
drug companies, just as the Veterans Administration does for veterans; and
Whereas, this Council urges Congress to allow seniors the choice of
obtaining their prescription drug
plan directly from Medicare instead
of from a private insurance company; and
Whereas, this Council urges Congress to prohibit insurance company
bureaucrats from taking medications off their list of approved drugs
during the period when someone is
not allowed to move to another plan;
and
Whereas, this Council urges Congress to eliminate the penalty for
failing to sign up for a plan until
the Part D is fixed; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
United States Senator Mike DeWine
to support meaningful legislation to
fix the Medicare Part D prescription
drug program and eliminate the
“donut hole” so that Medicare health
care coverage is simple, affordable,
and guaranteed for seniors and disabled Ohioans.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
United States Senator Mike DeWine,
Americans United, Ohioans United,
and Major Jackson.

Section 3. That this resolution is

for environmental remediation of
the site to be used for the Riverside

Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the

Res. No. 1650-06.
By Council Members Sweeney,
Polensek, Cimperman, Pierce Scott,
Conwell, Westbrook, Coats, Brady,
White, Lewis, Britt, Turner and
Cummins.
An emergency resolution supporting Issue 2 that, if passed by the
voters on November 7, 2006, will
raise the state minimum wage from
$5.15 to $6.85 an hour.
Whereas, it is important to the
health and welfare of all residents
of the City of Cleveland that working people are paid a wage that
enables them to lift their families
out of poverty; and
Whereas, the buying power of the
federal and state minimum wage of
$5.15 an hour is at its lowest point
in over 50 years because it has not
kept pace with the rising cost of living; and
Whereas, many working families
in Cleveland live at or below the
poverty line; and
Whereas, raising the minimum
wage to $6.85 an hour would raise
wages for about 720,000 workers, or
about 14% of Ohio’s workforce; and
Whereas, on average, these workers provide half of their families’
weekly earnings and nearly threequarters are adults over twenty; and
Whereas, experience and research
from the 22 states that have already
raised their minimum wage shows
that raising the minimum wage substantially helps families without
hurting the economy; and
Whereas,
productivity
of
Ohio
workers
has
risen
sharply
but
wages have remained stagnant; and
Whereas, at the same time U.S.
corporate profits have risen 50%
between 2001-2005; and
Whereas, increasing wages will
increase the ability of Cleveland residents
to
attain
self-sufficiency,
decrease economic hardship in the
City, and reduce the need for the
taxpayers to fund social services in
order to provide supplemental support for the employees of local businesses; and
Whereas,
Ohioans
for
a
Fair
Minimum Wage — a broad coalition
of community, labor and faith-based
organizations
and
individuals
across the state — have gathered
over 700,000 signatures from Ohio
citizens and qualified Issue 2 for
the November 2006 ballot; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that hard work deserves fair pay,
and urges voters to consider and
approve Issue 2 on November 7, 2006
ballot, which would raise the state
minimum wage from $5.15 to $6.85
an hour with an annual cost of living adjustment.
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports Issue 2 that, if passed by the
voters on November 7, 2006, will
raise the state minimum wage from
$5.15 to $6.85 an hour.

October 11, 2006
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
Ohioans for a Fair Minimum Wage.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period

Adopted October 2, 2006.
Effective October 6, 2006.

Res. No. 1651-06.
By Council Members Zone and
Cummins.
An emergency resolution proclaiming October 4, 2006 as ENERGY
STAR Change a Light Day.
Whereas,
energy
efficiency
is
important to the City of Cleveland
because it save consumers and businesses money and helps protect the
environment by lessening greenhouse gas emissions and reducing
air pollution; and
Whereas, lighting accounts for
nearly 20% of the average home’s
electric bill; ENERGY STAR qualified light bulbs use at least twothirds less energy than standard
bulbs and last up to ten time longer;
and
Whereas, by taking the ENERGY
STAR Change a Light pledge, citizens of the City have the opportunity to save energy and help voluntarily reduce greenhouse gas emissions by switching at least one light
at
home
to
an
energy-efficient
model; and
Whereas, citizens are encouraged
to switch to light fixtures or bulbs
that have earned the ENERGY
STAR label, which designates products that meet strict energy efficiency criteria set by the U.S.
Department of Energy and the U.S.
EPA; and
Whereas, if every home in the
City of Cleveland made this one
change
our
city
would
save
127,5522,656 kWh of electricity, the
environmental equivalent of removing 3,207 cars from the road while
also reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emission going into the
air by 201,232,560 pounds; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council is
proud to do its part in this nationwide
effort, celebrating ENERGY STAR
Change a Light Day, to promote
energy efficiency and environmental
stewardship in every household, and
by encouraging the installation of
ENERGY STAR qualified lighting;
