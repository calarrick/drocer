The City Record

and
Whereas, the Original Bond Legislation provides, in Section 12 thereof, that the City may issue Additional Bonds on a parity with the

and
Whereas, pursuant to Ordinance
No. 1133-93, duly passed on June 7,

Ordinance; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department and providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that authorizing the
Series 2006 Bonds to refund Outstanding Bonds is necessary to
enable Cleveland Public Power to
take advantage of favorable market

the same may be duly supplemented, amended or modified from time
to time in accordance with the provisions hereof.
Section 2. Authority. This Series
2006 Bond Legislation is adopted
pursuant to Sections 3, 4 and 12 of
Article XVIII of the Constitution of
the State, Section 12 of the Original
Bond Legislation, and the City’s
Charter.
Section 3. Authorization of Series
2006 Bonds. This Council finds and
determines it is necessary and proper and in the best interest of the
City to authorize the issuance of the
Series 2006 Bonds for the purpose of
refunding one or more series of the
Outstanding Bonds, or designated
maturities thereof, to obtain aggregate net present value debt service
savings of not less than three percent (3%). The Series 2006 Bonds
may be issued in one or more separate series so long as the aggregate
net present value savings achieved
by each series shall be not less than
three percent (3%). The principal
amount of each series of Series 2006
Bonds is to be the amount set forth
in the Series 2006 Certificate of
Award authorized in Section 6 and
shall be the amount determined by
the Director of Finance, based on

The City Record
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, to be necessary (i) to
refund the Refunded Bonds, (ii) to
fund any deposit to the Bond Service Reserve Fund or the Renewal
and Replacement Fund required
under the Indenture, (iv) to pay
costs of any Credit Support Instruments, (v) to pay identified amounts
owed under Hedge Agreements, and
(vi) to pay costs of issuing the
Series 2006 Bonds and refunding the
Refunded Bonds. The proceeds from
the sale of each series of Series 2006
Bonds shall be allocated, deposited
and applied as provided in Section 7
of this Ordinance.
The Series 2006 Bonds may be
issued in one or more separate
series, each bearing a distinctive
designation, provided that the Series
2006 Bonds of each series satisfy the
requirements of this Series 2006
Bond Legislation and the Indenture.
Separate series of Series 2006 Bonds
may be issued at the same or different times. The Series 2006 Bonds
of each series shall be designated as
provided in the applicable Certificate of Award (including replacing
references to 2006 to the calendar
year in which the obligations are
issued). A separate Certificate of
Award and a separate Supplemental
Indenture may be delivered for each
series. Costs of issuance of the
Series 2006 Bonds and any required
deposit to the Bond Service Reserve
Fund attributable to the Series 2006
Bonds shall, in each case, be included in the costs funded from the proceeds of the Series 2006 Bonds. The
Series 2006 Bonds shall constitute
Bonds for all purposes of the Indenture.
This Council finds and determines
that the issuance of the Series 2006
Bonds to obtain debt service savings
with respect to Outstanding Bonds
serves a proper, public, municipal
purpose by reducing the cost at
which Cleveland Public Power can
provide electric power.
Section 4. Authorization of Hedging Arrangements.
This Council finds that by engaging
in
interest
rate
hedging
arrangements from time to time, the
City may reduce its cost of borrowing
by
optimizing
the
relative
amounts of fixed and variable rate
obligations and minimizing the risk
of variations in its debt service
costs. Certain types of hedging
arrangements (referred to in this
Series 2006 Bond Legislation as
“swaptions”) may enable to the City
to obtain savings prior to the
issuance of Series 2006 Bonds by
providing for an upfront payment to
the City by a financial institution or
other organization that is the counterparty to the hedge arrangement
in consideration of the City’s giving
the counterparty the option to make
effective at a future date an interest rate exchange transaction with
the City. To permit the City to have
the flexibility to undertake interest
rate swap, swaption, rate cap, rate
collar and other hedging transactions from time to time, and to
establish the procedures for approving those transactions, this Council
authorizes the signing and delivery
of one or more agreements (each, a
“Hedge Agreement”) and any relat-

301

25
ed agreements necessary for the
consummation of the transactions
contemplated by each Hedge Agreement. The authorizations in this Section are supplemental to and not in
derogation of any authority provided by any other ordinance of this
Council
concerning
hedging
arrangements, and are all subject to
the requirements and restrictions of
the Indenture.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is to the financial advantage of the City and in the City’s
best
interests
that
a
hedging
arrangement be undertaken by the
City with respect to any Bonds
issued or to be issued under the
Indenture, the Director of Finance
may authorize one or more interest
rate hedge transactions in accordance with the applicable Hedge
Agreement; provided that (a) the
counterparty shall be rated at the
time of signing the Hedge Agreement not lower than A+ or A1 by
at least one rating agency or its
obligations under the Hedge Agreement shall be guaranteed or insured
by an entity rated at the time of
signing the Hedge Agreement not
lower than A+ or A1 by at least one
rating agency, and (b) the term of
each hedge transaction shall not
exceed the final maturity of the
Bonds to which the hedge relates or
(in the case of an option) will
relate. The requirements of this
paragraph are in addition to, and
not in place or in derogation of, any
other applicable requirements of the
Indenture.
The Director of Finance shall
negotiate the terms of each Hedge
Agreement with a counterparty satisfying the credit criteria in this
Series 2006 Bond Legislation and the
Indenture. The City shall receive a
written opinion of a Financial Advisor that the upfront payment or the
periodic payments, as the case may
be, to be made by the counterparty
to the City, or by the City to the
counterparty, shall be fair value for
the Hedge Agreement, given the
credit of the counterparty and the
terms and conditions of the Hedge
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall determine the terms and conditions of the Hedge Agreement,
including without limitation, the
time or times and procedures for the
exercise by the counterparty or the
City, as the case may be, of its
option under the Hedge Agreement,
whether the obligations of the City
under the Hedge Agreement shall be
secured by a Credit Support Instrument, and the rates to be paid by
the counterparty to the City and by
the City to the counterparty under
the Hedge Agreement in the event
of the exercise of the option. The
approval of each interest rate hedge
transaction
by
the
Director
of
Finance shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery
of the applicable Hedge Agreement
by the Director of Finance.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from the Net Revenues and the
Pledged Funds as permitted by the
Indenture, and may be payable also
from other funds permitted by law
to be used for the purpose, as iden-

26
tified by the Director of Finance in
the Hedge Agreement. Those payments may be secured by a pledge
of
the
Net
Revenues
and
the
Pledged Funds to the extent permitted by the Indenture, all as determined by the Director of Finance
and set forth in the Hedge Agreement. The obligation of the City to
make payments under any Hedge
Agreement does not and shall not
represent or constitute a general
obligation, debt, bonded indebtedness or a pledge of the faith and
credit of the City or the State of
Ohio. Nothing gives any party to
any Hedge Agreement the right to
have excises, ad valorem or other
taxes levied by the City or the State
of Ohio for the payment of any
amounts due under any Hedge
Agreement.
Section 5. Terms of Series 2006
Bonds.
The Series 2006 Bonds shall contain the terms provided in or determined pursuant to, the Indenture,
this Series 2006 Bond Legislation,
the Series 2006 Certificate of Award
and the Sixth Supplemental Indenture. Each series of Series 2006
Bonds may be secured by a separate
Supplemental Indenture, or a single
Supplemental Indenture may secure
more than one series of Series 2006
Bonds, and the authorization in this
Series 2006 Bond Legislation for the
Sixth Supplemental Indenture shall
encompass the authorization for
those one or more Supplemental
Indentures, regardless of their designation.
(a) General. In the event that the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, determines that the City’s best
interests will be served by causing
a series of Series 2006 Bonds to be
Variable Rate Bonds, then the Director of Finance is authorized to so
specify in the Series 2006 Certificate
of Award. If the Director of Finance
so determines, then the method and
procedure by which the variable
rate of interest to be borne by the
Series 2006 Bonds of that series
shall be determined as provided in
the Sixth Supplemental Indenture,
whether by auction, by reference to
a market index, by a remarketing
agent or otherwise, provided that no
series of variable rate Series 2006
Bonds shall bear interest at a rate
in excess of twenty-five percent
(25%) per year (including any
Series 2006 Bonds held by a provider
of a Credit Support Instrument). The
Director of Finance may determine
that the terms of a variable rate
series of Series 2006 Bonds may or
may not permit the holders to tender their variable rate Series 2006
Bonds for purchase by the City. If
the Director of Finance designates
any series of Series 2006 Bonds as
Variable Rate Bonds, and if the
Holders of that series of Series 2006
Bonds are to be entitled to tender
those Series 2006 Bonds for purchase, then the Director of Finance
shall also designate for those variable rate Series 2006 Bonds (and
may designate others, from time to
time, in substitution therefor) the
tender agent or agents and the
remarketing agent or agents, which

The City Record
designations shall be based on the
determination of the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed
to provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable. The Director of Finance is authorized to enter
into agreements in connection with
the delivery of the Series 2006
Bonds, and from time to time thereafter so long as the Series 2006
Bonds
are
outstanding,
with
providers of Credit Support Instruments, tender agents (which may be
the Trustee), remarketing agents
(which may be any of the Original
Purchaser) and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the method of
determining the variable interest
rates, permitting holders the right
of tender and providing for payment
of the purchase price of, or debt service on, the variable rate Series 2006
Bonds. In the event the variable rate
Series 2006 Bonds are issued as auction rate obligations, the Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements, from time to time, with
auction agents and others, or to
cause the Trustee to enter into those
agreements, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor that
the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed
to provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of
any series of Series 2006 Bonds, and
regardless of whether that series of
Series 2006 Bonds bears interest at
variable or fixed rates, is authorized
to contract for a Credit Support
Instrument, and to pay the costs of
it from proceeds of the Series 2006
Bonds, if the Director determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the Credit
Support Instrument will result in a
savings in the cost of the financing
to the City.
(b) Form; Exchange and Transfer.
All Series 2006 Bonds shall be issued
in fully registered form. The Series
2006 Bonds initially shall be delivered only in book-entry form, shall
be registered in the name of the
Depository or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the
custody of the Depository, and shall
not be transferable or exchangeable
(except for transfer to another
Depository or its nominee) without
further action by the City pursuant
to the provisions of the Sixth Supplemental Indenture. No Series 2006
Bonds shall be exchanged for or
transferable into a coupon Revenue
Bond or Bonds except to the extent
that the Indenture permits such
exchanges or transfers.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Series 2006 Bonds of any
series for use in a book entry system, the Director of Finance and the
Trustee may attempt to establish a

302

March 1, 2006
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance and the Trustee do not or
are unable to do so, the Director of
Finance and the Trustee, after making provision for notification of the
beneficial
owners
by
the
then
Depository and any other arrangements deemed necessary, shall permit withdrawal of the Series 2006
Bonds of any series from the Depository, and authenticate and deliver
registered Bond certificates to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of action
or inaction of the City, of those persons requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into any agreements
determined by the Director to be
necessary in connection with the
book entry system for the Series
2006 Bonds, after determining that
those agreements will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
under the Indenture (as evidenced
by the Director’s signing of those
agreements).
(c) Dates; Denominations. The
Series 2006 Bonds of each series
shall be dated as of the date or
dates provided in the Series 2006
Certificate of Award for that series.
The Series 2006 Bonds of each series
shall be issued in the denominations

Indenture.
(d) Interest and Place of Payment. The Series 2006 Bonds of each
series shall bear interest at their

Series 2006 Bonds, determined pursuant to the Sixth Supplemental
Indenture) for that series. The
Series 2006 Bonds of each series
shall bear interest from the most
recent date to which interest has
been paid or duly provided for or, if
no interest has been paid or duly
provided for, from their date. The
principal and any redemption premium and the interest payable on
each series of Series 2006 Bonds
shall be payable at the times, to the
persons and in the manner set forth
in, or referenced by, the Supplemental Indenture, including, without
limitation, provisions thereof permitting special arrangements for
payments to the Depository.
(e) Maturities. The Series 2006
Bonds of each series shall mature
on the Principal Retirement Dates
and in accordance with the Principal Retirement Schedule specified in
the Series 2006 Certificate of Award,
consistent with this Series 2006
Bond Legislation and the Indenture
and subject to any provisions for
their optional or mandatory redemption specified in the Series 2006 Certificate of Award pursuant to this
Series 2006 Bond Legislation.
(f) Optional and Mandatory Redemption. The Series 2006 Bonds of
each series may be subject to
redemption prior to maturity at the
option of the City, if and to the
extent so provided in the Series 2006

March 1, 2006
Certificate of Award for that series.
Any Series 2006 Bonds so determined
to be subject to optional redemption
and maturing by their stated terms
after the earliest optional redemption date shall be subject to redemption at the option of the City on or
after the earliest optional redemption date in whole or in part on any
date at the redemption prices provided in the Series 2006 Certificate
of Award and in accordance with
the Indenture. The Series 2006 Bonds
designated in the Series 2006 Certificate of Award as Term Bonds
subject to mandatory sinking fund
redemption shall be redeemed prior
to maturity on each Mandatory
Redemption Date designated in the
Series 2006 Certificate of Award in
the aggregate amount of the Mandatory Sinking Fund Installment to be
paid on such Mandatory Redemption
Date, all as provided in the Series
2006 Certificate of Award and in
accordance with the Indenture.
(g)
Signing.
The
Series
2006
Bonds shall be signed by the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, and
approved as to form by the Director
of Law. Any or all of the signatures
of those officials may be facsimiles.
The Series 2006 Bonds shall bear the
corporate seal of the City or a facsimile thereof.
(h) Numbering. The Series 2006

Section 6. Award and Sale of
Series 2006 Bonds.
The Director of Finance shall sign
and deliver a Series 2006 Certificate
of Award for the Series 2006 Bonds.
In the event the Series 2006 Bonds

each separately delivered series.
Each series of Series 2006 Bonds
shall bear such designation as the
Director of Finance determines to be

which the series is issued). The sale
of the Series 2006 Bonds shall be
awarded to the firm or firms (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”)
identified
in
the
Certificate
of
Award, following consultation with
the Director of Public Utilities and
based on an evaluation of the qualifications of firms that have proposed to underwrite the Series 2006
Bonds. Each Series 2006 Certificate
of Award shall determine the following, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, consistent
with this Series 2006 Bond Legislation and the Indenture:
(a)
the
aggregate
principal
amount of Series 2006 Bonds issued;
(b) the Purchase Price to be paid
to the City by the Original Purchaser, which amount shall be not
less than: (i) 97% of the amount
determined by adding to the aggregate principal amount of the Series
2006 Bonds any aggregate original

that amount any aggregate original
issue discount, plus (ii) any accrued
interest on the Series 2006 Bonds
from their date to the date of their
delivery to the Original Purchaser;

The City Record

any), and the Mandatory Redemption Dates (if any) on which principal of the Series 2006 Bonds is to
be paid, which shall be not later
than thirty (30) years from their
respective dates of issuance;
(e) the Specified Interest Rates to
be borne by Series 2006 Bonds bearing interest at a fixed rate, the

exceed six percent (6%) as to Series
2006 Bonds of any series and the

series and same maturity may bear
interest at different interest rates);
(f) the particular Outstanding
Bonds or portions thereof to be
Refunded Bonds;
(g) the title and series designation for the Series 2006 Bonds;
(h) the amount, if any, of proceeds of the sale of the Series 2006

any determination as to whether
there shall be special reserve fund

the Series 2006 Bonds as so determined and specified in the Series
2006 Certificate of Award within the
limitations set forth in this Series
2006 Bond Legislation and as permitted or required by the Indenture
will be in the best interest of the
City and consistent with all legal
requirements.
The Director of Finance may
enter into one or more Series 2006
Bond Purchase Agreements with the
Original Purchaser of Series 2006
Bonds setting forth the conditions
for delivery of the Series 2006 Bonds
that are consistent with this Series
2006 Bond Legislation, the Series
2006 Certificate of Award, and the
Indenture and that are determined
by the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, to be customary for comparable revenue bonds issued by
governmental
entities,
including,
without limitation, representations
as to the accuracy and completeness

of the Refunded Bonds; (e) to the
counterparty
under
any
Hedge
Agreement, any payment determined
by the Director of Finance to be
paid from the proceeds of the
Refunding Bonds, including any termination payment in the event that
the Director of Finance determines
it is in the best interests of the City
to terminate a Hedge Agreement
relating to Outstanding Bonds; and
(f) to an account to be created
under the Indenture for the payment
of costs of issuance, such amounts
as are needed to pay costs of issuing the Series 2006 Bonds and
refunding the Refunded Bonds. The
proceeds from the sale of the Series
2006 Bonds are appropriated and
shall be used for the purposes for
which the Series 2006 Bonds are
issued as provided in this Series
2006 Bond Legislation.
The Director of Finance is authorized to sign and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of the City, a
Series
2006
Escrow
Agreement
between the City and the Trustee,
as Series 2006 Escrow Agent, providing for, among other matters: the
investment and holding in escrow of
the proceeds of the Series 2006
Bonds to be applied to the refunding of the Refunded Bonds; the
application of the moneys derived
from those investments to the payment of the Bond Service Charges
on those Refunded Bonds; and the
irrevocable call for redemption of
the Refunded Bonds to be called for
redemption prior to maturity. The
Director of Finance shall provide for
the payment of the services rendered and for reimbursement of
expenses incurred pursuant to the
Series 2006 Escrow Agreement from
proceeds of the Series 2006 Bonds to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose. Provision shall be
made in the Series 2006 Escrow
Agreement to give the Trustee any

28
written
notice
of
redemption
required under Article III of the
Original Indenture. The Director of
Finance, the Director of Public Utilities and other appropriate City officials shall sign all documents and
take all other actions necessary or
appropriate on the part of the City
to effect such refunding in accordance with the Indenture and to
cause the Refunded Bonds to be
deemed paid and discharged, including without limitation, the retention
of an independent firm of accountants to verify the mathematical
accuracy of the calculations relating
to the escrow.
Section
8.
Sixth
Supplemental
Indenture. In order to secure the
payment of Bond Service Charges as
and when due and payable, the
Director of Finance and the Director of Public Utilities are hereby
authorized, in the name and on
behalf of the City, to make, execute,
acknowledge and deliver to the
Trustee,
a
Sixth
Supplemental
Indenture, approved as to form and
correctness by the Director of Law,
not inconsistent with this Series
2006 Bond Legislation, the Series
2006 Certificate of Award and the
Indenture
and
not
substantially
adverse to the City as may be
approved by the officers executing
the same on behalf of the City. The
determination by such officers that
the Sixth Supplemental Indenture is
not substantially adverse to the City
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the execution of the Sixth Supplemental Indenture by such officers.
This Series 2006 Bond Legislation
shall constitute a part of the Sixth
Supplemental Indenture as therein
provided and for all purposes thereof, including, without limitation, the
application to this Series 2006 Bond
Legislation of the provisions of the
Sixth Supplemental Indenture relating to amendment, modification,
supplementation and severability.
Without limiting the generality of
the authorization contained in the
preceding paragraph, the Sixth Supplemental Indenture may also (subject to Article VIII of the Original
Indenture
and
any
applicable
requirements thereof for the obtaining of consent of Bondholders and
further subject to any applicable
requirement for the obtaining of
consent from any insurer of any outstanding Bonds) include provisions
for such additional amendments,
supplements and modifications to
the Original Indenture, as previously amended and supplemented, as
the officers executing the Sixth Supplemental Indenture on behalf of the
City determine serve the best interests of the City by making the
Indenture more flexible, useful and
advantageous for the City’s purposes of financing Capital Costs or
refunding outstanding Bonds without materially increasing the City’s
obligations under the Indenture or
materially increasing the restrictions imposed on the City by the
Indenture, and their execution of
the Sixth Supplemental Indenture
shall conclusively evidence their
having made that determination.
The authority conferred by the preceding sentence shall include the
authorization to cause the Original

The City Record
Indenture as amended and supplemented by the Sixth Supplemental
Indenture and all preceding Supplemental Indentures to be restated in
a single amended and restated
Indenture, and the authorization in
this Section 8 for the execution of
the Sixth Supplemental Indenture
shall encompass the authorization
for the execution of any such
amended and restated Indenture.
Section 9. Tax Covenants.
With respect to Series 2006 Bonds
that are to be issued and sold as
obligations bearing interest to be
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes (the “TaxExempt Bonds”), the City covenants
that it will use, and will restrict the
use and investment of, the proceeds
of the Tax-Exempt Bonds in such
manner and to such extent as may
be necessary so that (a) the interest on the Tax-Exempt Bonds will
be excluded from gross income for
federal income tax purposes, and
(b) in the case of any Tax-Exempt
Bonds qualifying as bonds, the interest on which is not treated as an
item of tax preference under Section
57 of the Code (“Non-AMT Bonds”),
such Tax-Exempt Bonds will be
treated as Non-AMT Bonds.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the TaxExempt Bonds to be and to remain
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will
not take or authorize to be taken
any actions that would adversely
affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or
persons acting for it, will, among
other acts of compliance, (i) apply
the proceeds of the Tax-Exempt
Bonds to the governmental purposes
of the borrowing, (ii) restrict the
yield on investment property, (iii)
make timely and adequate payments
to the federal government, (iv)
maintain books and records and
make calculations and reports, and
(v) refrain from certain uses of
those proceeds and, as applicable, of
property financed with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the
extent necessary to assure such
exclusion of that interest under the
Code.
The Director of Finance, or any
other officer of the City having
responsibility for issuance of the
Tax-Exempt Bonds, is hereby authorized (a) to make or effect any election, selection, designation, choice,
consent, approval, or waiver on
behalf of the City with respect to
the Tax-Exempt Bonds as the City
is permitted or required to make or
give under the federal income tax
laws, including, without limitation
thereto, any of the elections provided for in Section 148(f)(4)(C) of the
Code or available under Section 148
of the Code, for the purpose of
assuring, enhancing or protecting
the favorable tax treatment or status of the Tax-Exempt Bonds or
interest thereon or assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose,
reducing
the
burden
or
expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or payments
of penalties, or making payments of
special amounts in lieu of making
computations to determine, or pay-

304

March 1, 2006
ing, excess earnings as rebate, or
obviating those amounts or payments, as determined by that officer,
which action shall be in writing and

Whereas, this Council passed Ordinance No. 1749-80 on October 8, 1980,
and thereafter amended that ordinance by Ordinance No. 1112-83,
passed on May 6, 1983 and Ordinance
No. 944-96 passed on June 10, 1996
(Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so amended and as the same may further be
amended from time to time in accordance with its provisions, is referred
to as the “General Bond Ordinance”),
providing the general terms and provisions for the issuance of unvoted
general obligations of the City, with
the specific terms of each series of
Bonds to be contained in ordinances
authorizing the issuance of Bonds in
accordance
with
the
provisions
thereof (the “Series Bond Ordinances”); and
Whereas, the authorization for
issuance of bonds is necessary to
enable the City to take advantage
of favorable market conditions on a
timely basis to obtain debt service
savings and as a result, this Ordinance
constitutes
an
emergency
measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public, peace,
property, health and safety, and for
the usual daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. General obligation refunding bonds of the City
(“Refunding Bonds”) are authorized
to be issued for the purpose of
refunding one or more series of the

March 1, 2006
City’s outstanding general obligation bonds, or designated maturities
thereof, issued to provide funds to
pay costs of Projects 1 through 79
and identified in the Certificate of
Award
authorized
in
Section
4
(“Refunded Bonds”), including the
payment of any expenses relating to
the
refunding
of
the
Refunded
Bonds and the issuance of the
Refunding Bonds, including any
financing costs within the meaning
of Revised Code Section 133.01(K),
provided the aggregate net present
value debt service savings resulting
from the refunding of the Refunded
Bonds is not less than three percent
(3%).
The aggregate principal amount
of Refunding Bonds to be issued
shall be in an amount determined by
the Director of Finance and set
forth in the Certificate of Award as
the amount required to be issued,
taking into account any original
issue discount and/or original issue
premium on the sale of the Refunding Bonds, in order to refund the
Refunded
Bonds
and
pay
any
expenses relating to the refunding
of the Refunded Bonds and the
issuance of the Refunding Bonds.
The Refunding Bonds may be issued
in one or more separate series, each
bearing a distinctive designation,
provided that the Refunding Bonds
of each series satisfy the requirements of this Ordinance and the
aggregate net present value debt
service savings to the City resulting
from
each
series
of
Refunding
Bonds is not less than three per cent
(3%). Separate series of Refunding
Bonds may be issued at the same or
different
times.
The
Refunding
Bonds of each series shall be designated as provided in the applicable Certificate of Award. A separate
Certificate of Award may be delivered for each series.
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The
Refunding
Bonds
shall
be
issued pursuant to the provisions of
Article XVIII of the Constitution of
Ohio, Revised Code Chapter 133 and
other applicable provisions of the
Revised Code, the Charter of the
City, the General Bond Ordinance
and this Ordinance in the principal
amount and for the purpose stated
in Section 1. The Refunding Bonds
of each series shall be issued in one
lot as fully registered bonds in
denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof but in no case
as to a particular maturity date
exceeding
the
principal
amount
maturing on that date. The Refunding Bonds shall bear the designation
and be numbered as determined by
the Director of Finance.
The Refunding Bonds shall be
dated the date and shall bear interest at the rate or rates per year
specified
in
the
Certificate
of
Award, provided the weighted average of such rates (taking into
account the principal amount and
maturity of each Refunding Bond to
which a rate applies) shall not
exceed six percent (6%) per year.
Interest on the Refunding Bonds
shall be payable when due, or until
the principal amount is paid, semiannually on the first day of each of
two months specified in the Certificate of Award as the dates on which

The City Record
interest on the Refunding Bonds
shall be payable (the “Interest Payment Dates”), beginning on the date
specified in the Certificate of Award
as the first Interest Payment Date.
The
Refunding
Bonds
shall
mature in the years and principal
amounts as shall be permitted by
law and determined by the Director
of Finance and specified in the Certificate of Award, based on the written advice of a Financial Advisor to
be in the best interests of the City
given market conditions at the time
the Refunding Bonds are sold and
the objectives of the plan of refunding to obtain aggregate net present
value debt service savings of not
less than three per cent (3%).
The Director of Finance also shall
determine and certify, on or prior to
the date of delivery of the Refunding Bonds to the Original Purchaser, that portion of the aggregate
principal amount of the Refunding
Bonds that is allocable to each Project, and the principal amount of
Refunding Bonds allocated to each
Project that shall be payable at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements (as defined below) on
the applicable principal payment
dates; provided, that (i) the aggregate
principal
amount
of
the
Refunding Bonds allocable to a Project shall be determined by the
Director of Finance on a pro rata
basis by reference to the respective
amount of funds that is required for
the
refunding
of
the
Refunded
Bonds that are allocable to that Project, taking into account any funds
other than the proceeds of the
Refunding Bonds that are available
and appropriated for that purpose,
and (ii) no portion of the aggregate
principal
amount
of
Refunding
Bonds allocated to a Project shall be
payable later than the maximum
maturity for that portion of the
Refunding Bonds as certified by the
Director of Finance.
The Refunding Bonds stated to
mature in any year may be issued
as term bonds (the “Term Refunding Bonds”), payable pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements as defined and
further described below. The Director of Finance shall determine in
the Certificate of Award whether
any of the Refunding Bonds shall be
issued as Term Refunding Bonds,
any dates (the “Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Refunding
Bonds shall be payable pursuant to
mandatory
sinking
fund
installments rather than at stated maturity and the amount of principal to be
paid on each Mandatory Redemption
Date (the “Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Refunding Bonds shall be
subject to redemption prior to stated maturity as follows:
(a) Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption. If any of the Refunding
Bonds are issued as Term Refunding Bonds, the Term Refunding
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount

313

37
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent,
currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of
and interest on any Term Refunding Bonds shall include amounts
sufficient to redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal
amount of Term Refunding Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided
below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Refunding Bonds in any aggregate
principal amount and to receive a
credit against the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption obligation) of the City for any Term
Refunding Bonds. That option shall
be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Refunding
Bonds which prior thereto have been
redeemed (other than through the
operation of the Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements) or
purchased for cancellation and canceled by the Registrar, to the extent
not applied theretofore as a credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Refunding Bond so
delivered, or previously redeemed,
or purchased and canceled, shall be
credited by the Escrow Agent at 100
percent of the principal amount
thereof against the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption obligation). Any excess of that amount
over the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement shall be credited against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligations) in the order directed by
the Director of Finance.
(b)
Optional
Redemption.
The
Refunding Bonds may be subject to
redemption prior to maturity by and
at the option of the City, in whole
or in part on any date, in integral
multiples of $5,000, on the optional
redemption dates and at the redemption prices (expressed as a percentage
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed) specified in the Certificate of Award, plus, in each case,

38
accrued interest to the redemption
date. The first optional redemption
date for a series of Refunding
Bonds shall not be later than ten
years from the first Interest Payment Date of that series of Refunding Bonds, and the highest redemption price shall not be greater than
102%
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed. Based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, the
Director of Finance may determine
in the Certificate of Award that it
is in the best interests of the City
for some or all of the Refunding
Bonds not to be callable prior to
their stated maturity.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Refunding
Bonds, or portions thereof, to be
redeemed optionally shall be selected by lot prior to the selection by
lot of the Refunding Bonds to be
redeemed on the same date by operation of the Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements of
paragraph
(a).
The
Refunding
Bonds shall be redeemed pursuant
to this paragraph only upon written
notice from the Director of Finance
to the Registrar. That notice shall
specify the redemption date and the
principal amount of each maturity
of Refunding Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar.
There shall be deposited with the
Registrar on or prior to the redemption date, funds sufficient to redeem
at the redemption price, all of the
redeemable Refunding Bonds for
which notice of redemption has been
given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Refunding Bonds are called for redemption
at one time, they shall be called in
the order of maturities directed by
the Director of Finance. If fewer
than all Refunding Bonds of a single maturity are to be redeemed, the
selection of Refunding Bonds to be
redeemed, or portions thereof in
amounts of $5,000 or any integral
multiple thereof, shall be made by
the Registrar by lot in a manner
determined by the Registrar. In the
case of a partial redemption of
Refunding
Bonds
by
lot
when
Refunding Bonds of denominations
greater than $5,000 are then outstanding, each $5,000 unit of principal thereof shall be treated as
though it were a separate Refunding Bond of the denomination of
$5,000. If it is determined that one
or more, but not all of the $5,000
units of principal amount represented by a Refunding Bond are to
be called for redemption, then upon
notice of redemption of a $5,000 unit
or units, the registered owner of
that Refunding Bond shall surrender the Refunding Bond to the Registrar
(i)
for
payment
of
the
redemption price of the $5,000 unit
or
units
called
for
redemption
(including, without limitation, the
interest accrued to the date fixed
for redemption and any premium),
and
(ii)
for
issuance,
without
charge to the registered owner

The City Record
thereof, of a new Refunding Bond
or Refunding Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the unmatured and
unredeemed portion of, and bearing
interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date as, the
Refunding Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Refunding Bonds shall identify (i)
by designation, letters, numbers or
other
distinguishing
marks,
the
Refunding Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii) the redemption price to be paid, (iii) the date
fixed for redemption, and (iv) the
place or places where the amounts
due upon redemption are payable.
The notice shall be given by the
Registrar on behalf of the City by
mailing a copy of the redemption
notice by first class mail, postage
prepaid, at least thirty (30) days
prior to the date fixed for redemption, to the registered owner of each
Refunding Bond subject to redemption in whole or in part at the registered owner’s address shown on
the Register maintained by the Registrar at the close of business on the
fifteenth day preceding that mailing
and to any municipal Refunding
Bond insurance company that has
issued a policy insuring some or all
of the Refunding Bonds. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Refunding Bond, however, shall not affect
the validity of the proceedings for
the redemption of any Refunding
Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Refunding Bonds. Notice having been
mailed in the manner provided in
the
preceding
paragraph,
the
Refunding Bonds and portions thereof
called
for
redemption
shall
become due and payable on the
redemption date, and, upon presentation and surrender at the place or
places specified in that notice, shall
be paid. If money for the redemption of all of the Refunding Bonds
and portions thereof to be redeemed,
including interest accrued to the
redemption date, is held by the Registrar on the redemption date, and,
if notice of redemption has been
deposited in the mail, then from and
after the redemption date those
Refunding Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
that money shall not be so available
on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail, those Refunding
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held
by
the
Registrar
for
the
redemption of particular Refunding
Bonds shall be held in trust for the
account of the registered owners
and shall be paid to them, respectively, upon presentation and surrender of those Refunding Bonds.
The debt charges on the Refunding Bonds shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of
America without deduction for the

314

March 1, 2006
services of the Registrar or Escrow
Agent as paying agent. Principal
shall be payable when due upon presentation
and
surrender
of
the
Refunding Bonds at the principal
corporate trust office of the Registrar. Interest on a Refunding Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Refunding Bond was registered, and
to that person’s address appearing,
on the Register (as defined in Section 3) at the close of business on
the date provided in the Registrar
Agreement authorized in Section 3
(the Record Date). Notwithstanding
any contrary provision in the General Bond Ordinance, so long as the
Refunding Bonds are held by a
Depository in a book entry system
(as described in Section 3), debt
charges on the Refunding Bonds
will be payable in lawful money of
the United States by wire transfer
to the Depository made by the
Escrow Agent on each Interest Payment Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance, except for the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) (pertaining generally to an adjustment
of the interest rate in an event of
default) and the third paragraph of
Section 4 (pertaining generally to
the periods during which the City is
not required to make any transfers
or exchanges of Refunding Bonds
issued under the General Bond Ordinance), will apply to the Refunding
Bonds. Except for those provisions,
the General Bond Ordinance is
included as a part of this Ordinance
as fully as if restated in this Ordinance. Words and terms not otherwise defined in this Ordinance shall
have the same meaning as set forth
in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Refunding Bonds; Exchange and
Transfer of the Refunding Bonds;
Paying
Agents.
The
Refunding
Bonds shall express upon their faces
the purpose for which they are
issued and that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to
Section 4 of the General Bond Ordinance, each Refunding Bond shall
be authenticated by the manual signature of an authorized officer of
the Trustee (as defined therein).
The
Refunding
Bonds
shall
be
signed by the City’s Mayor and by
the City’s Director of Finance, and,
consistent with Revised Code Section 133.27 and notwithstanding Section 177.02 of the Codified Ordinances of the City, either or both of
those signatures may be a facsimile. The Refunding Bonds shall bear
the seal of the City, which seal may
be a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section 83 of the City’s Charter, the
Director of Law shall prepare the
Refunding Bonds and shall endorse
thereon his approval of the form and
correctness thereof by his manual or
facsimile signature.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating agent, bond registrar, transfer agent and paying agent for the
Refunding Bonds (the “Registrar”);
provided that the Escrow Agent

March 1, 2006
shall also act as paying agent for
the Refunding Bonds so long as the
Refunding Bonds are held in a
book entry system. The Director of
Finance shall sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
an agreement among the City, the
Registrar and the Escrow Agent
(the
“Registrar
Agreement”)
approved as to form and correctness by the Director of Law, containing terms that are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and not
substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the
City, all of which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the Registrar Agreement by the
Director of Finance. Payment for
the services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred
pursuant to the Registrar Agreement shall be made from the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds, to
the extent available, and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated for that purpose.
So long as any of the Refunding
Bonds remain outstanding, the City
will cause the Registrar to maintain
and keep at its principal corporate
trust office all books and records
necessary
for
the
registration,
exchange and transfer of Refunding
Bonds as provided in this Section
(the “Register”). Subject to the provisions of Section 5, the person in
whose name a Refunding Bond is
registered on the Register shall be
regarded as the absolute owner of
that Refunding Bond for all purposes of this ordinance. Payment of or
on account of the debt charges on
any Refunding Bond shall be made
only to or upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall be affected by any notice
to the contrary, but the registration
may be changed as provided in this
Section. All such payments shall be
valid and effectual to satisfy and
discharge the City’s liability upon
the Refunding Bond, including interest, to the extent of the amount or
amounts so paid.
Any Refunding Bond may be
exchanged for Refunding Bonds of
any authorized denomination upon
presentation and surrender at the
principal corporate trust office of
the
Registrar,
together
with
a
request for exchange signed by the
registered owner or by a person
legally empowered to do so in a
form satisfactory to the Registrar. A
Refunding Bond may be transferred
only on the Register upon presentation and surrender of the Refunding
Bond at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar together with
an assignment signed by the registered owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Refunding Bond or
Refunding Bonds of any authorized
denomination
or
denominations
requested by the owner equal in the
aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Refunding Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar

The City Record
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Refunding Bonds only
after the new Refunding Bonds are
signed by the authorized officers of
the City. In all cases of Refunding
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall
authenticate
and
deliver
Refunding
Bonds
in
accordance
with the provisions of this ordinance. The exchange or transfer
shall be without charge to the
owner, except that the City and Registrar may make a charge sufficient
to reimburse them for any tax or
other governmental charge required
to be paid with respect to the
exchange or transfer. The City or
the Registrar may require that those
charges, if any, be paid before the
procedure is begun for the exchange
or transfer. All Refunding Bonds
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Refunding Bonds
surrendered upon that exchange or
transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, if it is
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance to be advantageous to the
City, the Refunding Bonds may be
issued in book entry form in accordance with the provisions of this
Section. As used in this Section and
this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Refunding
Bonds and the principal of and
interest on the Refunding Bonds
may be transferred only through a
book
entry,
and
(ii)
physical
Refunding Bond certificates in fully
registered form are issued by the
City only to a Depository or its nominee as registered owner, with the
Refunding Bonds “immobilized” in
the custody of the Depository. The
book entry maintained by others
than the City is the record that identifies the owners of beneficial interests in those Refunding Bonds and
that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Refunding Bonds may be
issued to a Depository for use in a
book entry system and, if and as
long as a book entry system is utilized: (i) the Refunding Bonds may
be issued in the form of a single,
fully registered Refunding Bond
representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered
owner, and immobilized in the cus-

315

39
tody of the Depository; (ii) the beneficial owners in book entry form
shall have no right to receive
Refunding Bonds in the form of
physical securities or certificates;
(iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form shall be
shown by book entry on the system
maintained and operated by the
Depository and its Participants, and
transfers of the ownership of beneficial interests shall be made only
by book entry by the Depository and
its
Participants;
and
(iv)
the
Refunding Bonds as such shall not
be transferable or exchangeable,
except
for
transfer
to
another
Depository or to another nominee of
a Depository, without further action
by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Refunding Bonds for use in
a book entry system, the Director of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Refunding Bonds from the
Depository, and the Trustee and
Registrar shall authenticate and
deliver Refunding Bond certificates
in registered form to the assigns of
the Depository or its nominee, all at
the cost and expense (including any
costs of printing), if the event is not
the result of City action or inaction,
of those persons requesting such
issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
authorized to the extent necessary
or required to enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with the book entry system
for the Refunding Bonds, after
determining that the signing thereof will not endanger the funds or
securities of the City and after the
approval of the form of any such
agreement by the Director of Law.
Section
4.
Sale
of
Refunding
Bonds. The Refunding Bonds shall
first be offered for purchase to the
Trustees of the Sinking Fund and,
if not purchased by them, shall be
offered to the Treasury Investment
Account for purchase and, if not purchased for that Account, shall be
sold to one or more firms that have
proposed to underwrite the Refunding Bonds and have been selected
by the Director of Finance based on
an evaluation of the qualifications
of those firms (collectively, the
“Original Purchaser”).
The Refunding Bonds shall be
awarded to the Original Purchaser
in the Certificate of Award which
shall specify the final terms of the
Refunding
Bonds
in
accordance
with law, the provisions of this
Ordinance, the written advice of a
Financial Advisor and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Refunding Bonds, including: the
principal amount of the Refunding
Bonds, the purchase price (which
shall be not less than 97% of the
principal amount of the Refunding
Bonds plus any accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate

40
or rates, the amounts and years in
which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements),
the
Interest Payment Dates and the
date of the Refunding Bonds, and
any other matters required in this
Ordinance to be set forth in that
Certificate. As appropriate under
the
Charter,
the
Director
of
Finance, Director of Law, Clerk of
Council and other appropriate officers of the City are, and each of
them is, authorized to take such
actions as are necessary, appropriate and in the best interest of the
City to establish the terms and
requirements for delivery of the
Refunding Bonds and to make such
arrangements as are necessary with
the Original Purchaser in order to
establish the date, location, and procedure, and conditions for the delivery of the Refunding Bonds to the
Original Purchaser, to give all
appropriate notices and certificates,
to cause a true transcript of proceedings with reference to the
issuance of the Refunding Bonds to
be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and
other documents and instruments
and to take such actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Ordinance and to take all
steps necessary to effect the due
execution, authentication and delivery of the Refunding Bonds. The
Director
of
Finance
is
further
authorized to sign and deliver on
behalf of the City a bond purchase
agreement between the City and the
Original Purchaser (the “Bond Purchase Agreement”), approved as to
form and correctness by the Director of Law, setting forth the terms
and conditions on which the City
agrees to sell the Refunding Bonds
and the Original Purchaser agrees
to buy the Refunding Bonds, which
shall be consistent with this Ordinance, not substantially adverse to
the City, and approved by the Director of Finance and the Director of
Law on behalf of the City, all of
which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of the Bond
Purchase Agreement by the Director of Finance. It is determined that
the terms of the Refunding Bonds,
as provided in this Ordinance and
as may be provided in or pursuant
to the Certificate of Award, are in
the best interest of the City and in
compliance with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an Official
Statement is appropriate or necessary in connection with the original
issuance of the Refunding Bonds,
the Director of Finance is authorized to prepare or cause to be prepared on behalf of the City an Official Statement and any necessary
supplements and to authorize the
use and distribution of that Official
Statement and any supplements. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign on behalf of the City that Official Statement and any supplements.
The Director of Finance is authorized to sign and deliver, on behalf
of the City, such certificates in con-

The City Record
nection with the accuracy of the
Official Statement and any supplements as may, in the Director’s
judgment, be necessary or appropriate. The Director of Finance is also
authorized to determine and certify
on behalf of the City that such disclosure document is “deemed final”
by the City within the meaning of
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12 (the “SEC Rule”).
The Director of Finance is authorized to contract for services for the
production and distribution of preliminary and final official statements, including by printed and
electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Refunding Bonds, the City
agrees, in accordance with, and as
the only obligated person with
respect to the Refunding Bonds
under the SEC Rule, to provide or
cause to be provided such financial
information and operating data and
notices, in such manner, as may be
required for purposes of the SEC
Rule. In order to describe and specify certain terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare or
cause to be prepared, and to sign
and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of the City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate,
which shall constitute the continuing disclosure agreement made by
the City for the benefit of the holders and beneficial owners of the
Refunding
Bonds
in
accordance
with the SEC Rule. The performance
of that Agreement shall be subject
to the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to
establish procedures in order to
ensure compliance by the City with
its continuing disclosure agreement,
including the timely provision of
information and notices.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Refunding
Bonds promptly when and as the
same falls due, and also to provide
for the discharge of the Refunding
Bonds at maturity, there shall be
and is levied on all the taxable property in the City, in addition to all
other taxes, a direct tax annually
during the period the Refunding
Bonds
are
outstanding,
in
an
amount sufficient to provide for the
payment of that interest, when and
as the same shall fall due, and also
to discharge the principal of the
Refunding Bonds at maturity, which
tax shall not be less than the interest and sinking fund tax required
by Section 11 of Article XII of the
Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is ordered
computed,
certified,
levied
and
extended upon the tax duplicate and
collected by the same officers, in the
same manner and at the same time
that taxes for general purposes for
each of those years are certified,
extended and collected. The tax

316

March 1, 2006
shall be placed before and in preference to all other items and for the
full amount thereof. The funds
derived from those tax levies shall
be placed in the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund as required by the
General Bond Ordinance and those
funds, together with the interest collected on them shall be irrevocably
pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds when and as the same
fall due; provided, however, that,
subject to the provisions of Section
8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in
each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the
Refunding Bonds and are appropriated for such purpose, the amount
of such tax shall be reduced by the
amount of such revenues so available and appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants,
on behalf of the City and its officials, pursuant to the authorization
under Sections 133.25(B)(1) and
5705.51 of the Revised Code, and in
accordance with the provisions of
and to the extent required or permitted by the General Bond Ordinance, that the City will appropriate annually from the proceeds of
the City’s municipal income taxes
an amount as is necessary to meet
the annual debt charges for the
Refunding Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds;
Notice of Redemption of Refunding
Bonds. Pursuant to Revised Code
Section 133.34, the General Bond
Ordinance and this Ordinance, the
proceeds of the Refunding Bonds to
be applied to the refunding of the
Refunded Bonds shall be deposited
in a separate bank account within
the Unvoted Refunding Bond and
Note Redemption Account of the
Sinking Fund held by The Huntington National Bank, Cleveland,
Ohio, as Escrow Agent, in accordance with Section 179.08 of the Codified Ordinances of the City and the
Escrow Agreement described below,
and shall be applied to the payment
of debt service charges on the
Refunding Bonds from and after the
date of issuance of the Refunding
Bonds to and including their respective maturity or prior redemption
dates. The amount to be deposited
in the Escrow Fund shall be determined by the Director of Finance in
the Certificate of Award and shall
be the amount necessary, together
with money in the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund available for the purpose, to provide for the refunding of
the Refunded Bonds. Any transfer to
the Escrow Fund of any money currently on deposit in the Unvoted
Tax-Supported Obligations Account
and determined by the Director of
Finance to be available for payment
of the Refunding Bonds, is authorized by this Ordinance.
Money deposited in the Escrow
Fund shall be (a) held in cash or
(b) invested in direct obligations of
the United States of America that
mature or are subject to redemption
by and at the option of the holder,
in amounts sufficient, together with
any uninvested cash in the Escrow
Fund but without further invest-

March 1, 2006
ment or reinvestment, for the payment
of
the
principal
of,
any
redemption premium and interest on,
the Refunded Bonds as provided in
the Escrow Agreement. Pursuant to
the respective Ordinances authorizing the Refunded Bonds, Section
133.34 of the Revised Code and this
Ordinance, money deposited in the
Escrow Fund, and the investment
income thereon, are pledged to the
payment of the Refunded Bonds.
Pursuant to Revised Code Chapter
133 and this Ordinance, and notwithstanding Chapter 179 of the Codified
Ordinances, any accrued interest
received
from
the
sale
of
the
Refunding Bonds and any original
issue premium in excess of the
amount deposited with the Escrow
Agent under the Escrow Agreement
to accomplish the refunding of the
Refunded Bonds shall be deposited
in the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the Sinking Fund
to be applied to the payment of
interest on the Refunding Bonds.
The proceeds of the Refunding
Bonds to be applied to pay costs of
any credit enhancement facilities
shall be paid to the provider or
providers of those credit enhancement facilities. The proceeds of the
Refunding Bonds to be used to pay
costs of issuing the Refunding
Bonds and refunding the Refunding
Bonds shall be deposited with the
Registrar in a separate account
under
the
Registrar
Agreement
pending their application to the payment of such costs.
The Director of Finance is authorized to sign and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of the Issuer,
an agreement (the “Escrow Agreement”) between the City and the
Escrow Agent, providing for the
investment and holding in escrow of
the
proceeds
of
the
Refunding
Bonds to be applied to the refunding of the Refunded Bonds and for
the
application
of
the
moneys
derived from such investments, in
accordance with the General Bond
Ordinance and this Ordinance and
as otherwise directed by law. Notice
of the advance refunding of any of
the Refunded Bonds and any early
redemption of Refunded Bonds shall
be given in accordance with the
terms of the Refunded Bonds and as
further provided in the Escrow
Agreement. The Refunded Bonds
shall be retired at stated maturity
or redeemed prior to maturity as
provided in the Certificate of Award
and in accordance with the ordinance authorizing the respective
Refunded Bonds and the Escrow
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Escrow Agreement
from money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose. The Director of
Finance shall obtain the services of
an independent accounting firm of
national reputation to provide a verification report as to the adequacy
of the escrow fund to pay the
Refunded Bonds on the dates set
forth in the Escrow Agreement. The
Director of Finance and other appropriate City officials shall execute all
documents
and
take
all
other
actions necessary or appropriate on

The City Record
the part of the City to effect the
refunding of the Refunded Bonds in
accordance with the General Bond
Ordinance and this Ordinance and
as otherwise directed by law, and to
cause the Refunded Bonds to be
deemed paid and discharged.
If U.S. Treasury Securities State
and Local Government Series are to
be purchased for the Escrow Fund,
the Escrow Agent is authorized to
file, on behalf of the City, subscriptions for the purchase and issuance
of those Securities. If those Securities are not timely available for purchase, or if in the judgment of the
Director of Finance, an open-market
purchase of direct obligations of the
United States of America for the
Escrow Fund is in the best interest
of and financially advantageous to
the City, the Director of Finance
may purchase and deliver those
obligations, engage the services of
a bidding agent or similar entity for
the purpose of facilitating the bidding, purchase and delivery of such
obligations for, and any related
structuring of, the Escrow Fund,
execute such instruments as are
deemed necessary to engage such
services for such purpose, and provide further for the payment of the
cost of obtaining such services from
the
proceeds
of
the
Refunding
Bonds to the extent available and
otherwise from any other funds lawfully available and that are appropriated or shall be appropriated for
that purpose.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Refunding Bonds are secured by a
pledge and lien on a parity with the
pledges and liens authorized by the
General Bond Ordinance and, in
addition to the taxes and revenues
specifically pledged pursuant to this
Ordinance and the General Bond
Ordinance and the other covenants,
terms
and
agreements
provided
hereunder and in the General Bond
Ordinance to secure payment of the
principal of and interest on the
Refunding Bonds, the City hereby
determines, declares, warrants and
covenants that the Refunding Bonds
are general obligations of the City
and that the full faith and credit of
the City are hereby pledged for the
payment of the principal of and
interest on the Refunding Bonds in
accordance with the laws and Constitution of the State of Ohio, this
Ordinance and the General Bond
Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid
and discharged all the outstanding
Refunding Bonds, or there shall
otherwise be paid to the holders of
the outstanding Refunding Bonds
all debt charges due or to become
due thereon, and provision shall
also be made for paying all other
sums payable hereunder, then and
in
that
event
this
Ordinance
(except for Section 8(b) hereof)
shall cease to be of further effect,
and the covenants, agreements and
other obligations of the City under
this Ordinance shall be discharged
and satisfied, and thereupon the
Trustee shall at the request of the
City execute and deliver to the City

317

41
such instruments in writing as
shall discharge the lien hereof and
enter on the record such discharge
of the lien and such other instruments
as
may
be
reasonably
required by the City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of Refunding Bonds. Outstanding Refunding Bonds shall be deemed to have
been paid and discharged within the
meaning of this Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a)
hereof, if:
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or sub-accounts, in trust for and
irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold
in special accounts or sub-accounts,
in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations
of the United States certified by an
independent public accounting firm
of national reputation to be of such
maturities and interest payment
dates and to bear such interest,
without further investment or reinvestment of either the principal
amount thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held
in trust and committed, except as
hereinafter provided), as will be
sufficient, together with moneys
referred to in (i) above, for the payment, at their maturities or redemption dates, of all debt charges on the
Refunding Bonds to their date of
maturity or redemption, as the case
may be, or if default in such payment shall have occurred on such
date then to the date of the tender
of such payment; provided, that if
any Refunding Bonds are to be
redeemed prior to the maturity
thereof, notice of such redemption
shall have been duly given or irrevocable provision satisfactory to the
Trustee shall have been duly made
for the giving of such notice. Any
moneys held by the Escrow Agent
in accordance with the provisions of
this Section shall be invested by the
Escrow Agent in direct obligations
of the United States of America
maturing, or redeemable at the
option of the holder, at times and in
amounts sufficient to meet payment
of debt charges on the Refunding
Bonds, as directed by the Director
of Finance. Any income or interest
earned by, or increment to, the
investments held under this Section
shall, to the extent determined from
time to time by the Escrow Agent
to be in excess of the amount
required to be held by it for the purposes of this Section, be transferred
at the time of such determination as
provided in Section 17(a) of the
General
Bond
Ordinance
for
unclaimed funds held by a Paying
Agent. In the event of nonpresentment of any Refunding Bond as
described in Section 17(a) of the
General Bond Ordinance, the moneys
held pursuant to this Section shall
be held and paid as provided in said
Section 17(a) for unclaimed funds
held by a Paying Agent.
Section 9. Miscellaneous.

Ordinances of the City which are
inconsistent with the provisions of
this Ordinance and the General

42
Bond Ordinance shall not apply to
the Refunding Bonds authorized
herein.
(b) All covenants, terms and provisions of the General Bond Ordinance are fully applicable to the
Refunding Bonds authorized herein,
and nothing in this Ordinance shall
be deemed to alter or restrict such
full application of the General Bond
Ordinance, except for the exclusion

Bonds of the provisions of the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) and the
third paragraph of Section 4 of the
General Bond Ordinance pursuant to
Section 2 of this Ordinance.
Section 10. Captions. The captions
or headings in this Ordinance are
for convenience only and in no way
define, limit or describe the scope or
intent of any provisions or sections
of this Ordinance.
Section 11. Federal Tax Covenants. The City covenants that it
will use, and will restrict the use
and investment of, the proceeds of
the Refunding Bonds in such manner and to such extent as may be
necessary so that (a) the Refunding
Bonds will not (i) constitute private
activity bonds, arbitrage bonds or
hedge bonds under Sections 141, 148
or 149 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the Code) or
(ii) be treated other than as bonds
to which Section 103(a) of the Code
applies, and (b) the interest thereon will not be treated as an item of
tax preference under Section 57 of
the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the Refunding Bonds to be and to remain
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will
not take or authorize to be taken
any actions that would adversely
affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or
persons acting for it, will, among
other acts of compliance, (i) apply
the
proceeds
of
the
Refunding
Bonds to the governmental purpose
of the borrowing, (ii) restrict the
yield on investment property acquired with those proceeds, (iii)
make timely and adequate payments
to the federal government, (iv)
maintain books and records and
make calculations and reports, and
(v) refrain from certain uses of
those proceeds, and, as applicable,
of property financed with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the
extent necessary to assure such
exclusion of that interest under the
Code.
Each covenant made in this section with respect to the Refunding
Bonds is also made with respect to
all issues any portion of the debt
service on which is paid from proceeds of the Refunding Bonds (and,
if different, the original issue and
any refunding issues in a series of
refundings), to the extent such compliance is necessary to assure exclusion of interest on the Refunding
Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes, and the officers identified above are authorized
to take actions with respect to those
issues as they are authorized in this

The City Record
section to take with respect to the
Refunding Bonds.
The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer
of the City having responsibility
for
issuance
of
the
Refunding
Bonds is hereby authorized (a) to

approval, or waiver on behalf of the
City with respect to the Refunding
Bonds as the City is permitted or
required to make or give under the
federal income tax laws, including,
without limitation thereto, any of
the elections provided for in Section
148(f)(4)(C) of the Code or available under Section 148 of the Code,
for the purpose of assuring, enhancing or protecting favorable tax
treatment or status of the Refunding Bonds or interest thereon or
assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose, reducing
the burden or expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount
or payments or penalties, or making payments of special amounts in
lieu of making computations to
determine, or paying, excess earnings as rebate, or obviating those
amounts or payments, as determined by that officer, which action
shall be in writing and signed by
the officer, (b) to take any and all
other actions, make or obtain calculations,
make
payments,
and
make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf
of the City, as may be appropriate

Bonds, and (c) to give one or more
appropriate certificates of the City,
for inclusion in the transcript of
proceedings
for
the
Refunding
Bonds, setting forth the reasonable
expectations of the City regarding
the amount and use of all the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds, the
facts, circumstances and estimates
on which they are based, and other
facts and circumstances relevant to
the tax treatment of the interest on
and the tax status of the Refunding Bonds.
Section 12. Refunding Bond Insurance and Ratings. If the Director of
Finance determines it to be in the
best interests of the City, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, the Director of Finance
may obtain a commitment for municipal bond insurance issued by a
nationally
recognized
municipal
bond insurance company insuring
the payment when due of the principal of and interest on all or any
portion of the Refunding Bonds,
request a rating on the Refunding
Bonds from one or more nationally
recognized rating organizations, and

“Issuer,” “Council” and “Governing
Body,” “Director of Finance” and
“Fiscal Officer,” and “Ordinance”
and “Bond Legislation.”
Section 2. Authorization of the
Refunding Bonds.
This Council finds and determines
it is necessary and proper and in the
best interest of the City to authorize
the issuance of Refunding Bonds for
the purpose of refunding one or
more series of the Outstanding Revenue Bonds, or designated maturities thereof, to obtain aggregate net
present value debt service savings
of not less than three percent (3%).
The Refunding Bonds may be issued
in one or more separate series so
long as the aggregate net present
value savings achieved by each
series shall be not less than three
percent (3%). The principal amount
of each series of Refunding Bonds
is to be the amount set forth in the
Certificate of Award authorized in
Section 5 and shall be the amount
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
necessary (i) to refund the Refunded Bonds, (ii) to fund any deposit
to the Bond Service Reserve Fund
required under the Indenture, (iv) to
pay costs of any Credit Support
Instruments, (v) to pay identified
amounts owed under Hedge Agreements, and (vi) to pay costs of issuing
the
Refunding
Bonds
and
refunding the Refunded Bonds. The
proceeds from the sale of each
series of Refunding Bonds shall be
allocated, deposited and applied as
provided in Section 6 of this Ordinance.
The Refunding Bonds may be
issued in one or more separate
series, each bearing a distinctive
designation, provided that the Refunding Bonds of each series satisfy the requirements of this Ordinance and the Indenture. Separate
series of Refunding Bonds may be
issued at the same or different
times. The Refunding Bonds of each
series shall be designated as pro-

The City Record
vided in the applicable Certificate of
Award. A separate Certificate of
Award and a separate Supplemental
Indenture may be delivered for each
series. Costs of issuance of the
Refunding Bonds and any required
deposit to the Debt Service Reserve
Fund attributable to the Refunding
Bonds shall, in each case, be included in the costs funded from the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds. The
Refunding Bonds shall constitute
Revenue Bonds for all purposes of
the Indenture.
This Council finds and determines
that the issuance of the Refunding
Bonds to obtain debt service savings
with respect to Refunded Bonds
serves a proper, public, municipal
purpose by reducing the costs of air
travel facilities serving the people
of the City of Cleveland, thereby
increasing and promoting commerce
by providing necessary transportation for individuals and commercial
enterprises purchasing and selling
services and products in northeastern Ohio, and creating and preserving jobs and employment opportunities in the City and improving the
economic welfare of the City.
Section 3. Authorization of Hedging Arrangements.
This Council finds that by engaging
in
interest
rate
hedging
arrangements, from time to time, the
City may reduce its cost of borrowing
by
optimizing
the
relative
amounts of fixed and variable rate
obligations and minimizing the risk
of variations in its debt service
costs. Certain types of hedging
arrangements (referred to in this
Ordinance
as
“swaptions”)
may
enable to the City to obtain savings
prior to the issuance of Refunding
Bonds by providing for an upfront
payment to the City by a financial
institution or other organization
that is the counterparty to the
hedge arrangement in consideration
of the City’s giving the counterparty the option to make effective at a
future date an interest rate exchange transaction with the City. To
permit the City to have the flexibility to undertake interest rate
swap, swaption, rate cap, rate collar
and other hedging transactions from
time to time, and to establish the
procedures
for
approving
those
transactions, this Council authorizes
the signing and delivery of one or
more agreements (each, a “Hedge
Agreement”) and any related agreements necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by each Hedge Agreement. The
authorizations in this Section 3 are
supplemental to and not in derogation of any authority provided by
any other ordinance of this Council
concerning hedging arrangements.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is to the financial advantage of the City and in the City’s
best
interests
that
a
hedging
arrangement be undertaken by the
City with respect to any Revenue
Bonds issued or to be issued under
the
Indenture,
the
Director
of
Finance may authorize one or more
interest rate hedge transactions in
accordance
with
the
applicable
Hedge Agreement; provided that (a)

320

March 1, 2006
the counterparty shall be rated at
the time of signing the Hedge
Agreement not lower than A+ or A1
by at least one rating agency or its
obligations under the Hedge Agreement shall be guaranteed or insured
by an entity rated at the time of
signing the Hedge Agreement not
lower than A+ or A1 by at least one
rating agency, and (b) the term of
each hedge transaction shall not
exceed the final maturity of the
Revenue Bonds to which the hedge
relates or (in the case of an option)
will relate.
The Director of Finance shall
negotiate the terms of each Hedge
Agreement with a counterparty satisfying the credit criteria in this
Ordinance. The City shall receive a
written opinion of a Financial Advisor that the upfront payment or the
periodic payments, as the case may
be, to be made by the counterparty
to the City, or by the City to the
counterparty, shall be fair value for
the Hedge Agreement, given the
credit of the counterparty and the
terms and conditions of the Hedge
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall determine the terms and conditions of the Hedge Agreement,
including without limitation, the
time or times and procedures for the
exercise by the counterparty or the
City, as the case may be, of its
option under the Hedge Agreement,
whether the obligations of the City
under the Hedge Agreement shall be
secured by a Credit Support Instrument, and the rates to be paid by
the counterparty to the City and by
the City to the counterparty under
the Hedge Agreement in the event
of the exercise of the option. The
approval of each interest rate hedge
transaction
by
the
Director
of
Finance shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery
of the applicable Hedge Agreement
by the Director of Finance.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from
the
Airport
Revenues
as
defined in the Indenture and may be
payable also from other funds permitted by law to be used for the purpose, as identified by the Director of
Finance in the Hedge Agreement.
Those payments may be secured by
a pledge of Airport Revenues, to the
extent permitted by the Indenture,
all as determined by the Director of
Finance and set forth in the Hedge
Agreement. The obligation of the
City to make payments under any
Hedge Agreement does not and
shall not represent or constitute a
general obligation, debt, bonded
indebtedness or a pledge of the faith
and credit of the City or the State
of Ohio. Nothing gives any party to
any Hedge Agreement the right to
have excises, ad valorem or other
taxes levied by the City or the State
of Ohio for the payment of any
amounts due under any Hedge
Agreement.
Section 4. Terms of Refunding
Bonds.
The Refunding Bonds shall contain the terms provided in or determined pursuant to, the Indenture,
this Ordinance, the applicable Certificate of Award and the applicable
Supplemental Indenture. Each series
of Refunding Bonds may be secured

March 1, 2006
by a separate Supplemental Indenture,
or
a
single
Supplemental
Indenture may secure more than one
series of Refunding Bonds.
(a) General. In the event that the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, determines that the City’s best
interests will be served by causing
a series of Refunding Bonds to be
obligations bearing interest at variable interest rates, then the Director of Finance is authorized to so
specify in the Certificate of Award
for that series. If the Director of
Finance so determines, then the
method and procedure by which the
variable rate of interest to be borne
by the Refunding Bonds of that
series shall be determined as provided in the applicable Supplemental Indenture, whether by auction,
by reference to a market index, by
a remarketing agent or otherwise,
provided that no series of variable
rate Refunding Bonds shall bear
interest at a rate in excess of twenty-five
percent
(25%)
per
year
(including any Refunding Bonds
held by a provider of a Credit Support Instrument). The Director of
Finance may determine that the
terms of a variable rate series of
Refunding Bonds may or may not
permit the holders to tender their
variable rate Refunding Bonds for
purchase by the City. If the Director of Finance designates any series
of Refunding Bonds as variable rate
Refunding Bonds, and if the Holders of that series of Refunding
Bonds are to be entitled to tender
those Refunding Bonds for purchase, then the Director of Finance
shall also designate for those variable rate Refunding Bonds (and
may designate others, from time to
time, in substitution therefor), the
tender agent or agents and the
remarketing agent or agents, which
designations shall be based on the
determination of the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed
to provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable. The Director of Finance is authorized to enter
into agreements in connection with
the
delivery
of
the
Refunding
Bonds, and from time to time thereafter so long as the Refunding
Bonds are outstanding, with providers of Credit Support Instruments, tender agents (which may be
the Trustee), remarketing agents
(which may be any of the Original
Purchasers) and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the method of
determining the variable interest
rates, permitting holders the right
of tender and providing for payment
of the purchase price of, or debt service on, the variable rate Refunding
Bonds. In the event the variable rate
Refunding Bonds are issued as auction rate obligations, the Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements, from time to time, with
auction agents and others, or to
cause the Trustee to enter into those

The City Record
agreements, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor that
the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed
to provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of
any series of Refunding Bonds, and
regardless of whether that series of
Refunding Bonds bears interest at
variable or fixed rates, is authorized
to contract for a Credit Support
Instrument, and to pay the costs of
it from proceeds of the Refunding
Bonds, if the Director determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the Credit
Support Instrument will result in a
savings in the cost of the financing
to the City.
(b) Form; Exchange and Transfer.
All Refunding Bonds shall be issued
in
fully
registered
form.
The
Refunding Bonds initially shall be
delivered only in book-entry form,
shall be registered in the name of
the Depository or its nominee, as
registered owner, and immobilized
in the custody of the Depository,
and shall not be transferable or
exchangeable (except for transfer to
another Depository or its nominee)
without further action by the City
pursuant to the provisions of the
Supplemental
Indenture.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Original Indenture, no
Refunding
Bonds
shall
be
exchanged for or transferable into a
coupon Revenue Bond or Bonds
unless and until the Indenture shall
have been amended in accordance
with the terms thereof to permit
such exchanges or transfers. To the
extent that the Original Indenture
(particularly, but without limitation,
Section 2.05) permits fully registered
Revenue
Bonds
to
be
exchanged for or transferred into
coupon Revenue Bonds or Revenue
Bonds payable to bearer, then the
Original Indenture is amended to
prohibit such exchanges or transfers
for the Refunding Bonds unless and
until the Indenture shall have been
further amended to permit such
exchanges or transfers.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Refunding Bonds of any
series for use in a book entry system, the Director of Finance and the
Trustee may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance and the Trustee do not or
are unable to do so, the Director of
Finance and the Trustee, after making provision for notification of the
beneficial
owners
by
the
then
Depository and any other arrangements deemed necessary, shall permit withdrawal of the Refunding
Bonds of any series from the Depository, and authenticate and deliver
registered Bond certificates to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of action
or inaction of the City, of those persons requesting such issuance.

321

45
The Director of Finance is authorized and directed to enter into any
agreements determined by the Director to be necessary in connection
with the book entry system for the
Refunding Bonds, after determining
that those agreements will not
endanger the funds or securities of
the City under the Indenture (as evidenced by the Director’s signing of
those agreements).
(c) Dates; Denominations. The Refunding Bonds of each series shall
be dated as of the date or dates provided in the Certificate of Award for
that series. The Refunding Bonds of
each series shall be issued in the
denominations permitted in the Supplemental Indenture for that series.

series shall bear interest at their
respective interest rates specified in

series. The Refunding Bonds of each
series shall bear interest from the
most recent date to which interest
has been paid or duly provided for
or, if no interest has been paid or
duly provided for, from their date.
The principal and any redemption
premium and the interest payable on
each series of Refunding Bonds
shall be payable at the times, to the
persons and in the manner set forth
in, or referenced by, the Supplemental Indenture, including, without
limitation, provisions thereof permitting special arrangements for
payments to the Depository.

Bonds of each series shall mature
on the dates and in the respective
principal amounts provided in the
Certificate
of
Award,
consistent
with this Ordinance and the Indenture.
(f) Optional and Mandatory Redemption. The Refunding Bonds of
each series may be subject to
redemption prior to maturity at the
option of the City, if and to the
extent so provided in the Certificate of Award for that series. Any
Refunding Bonds so determined to
be subject to optional redemption
and maturing by their stated terms
after the earliest optional redemption
date
shall
be
subject
to
redemption at the option of the
City on or after the earliest optional redemption date in whole or in
part on any date at the redemption
prices provided in the Certificate of
Award and in accordance with the
applicable Supplemental Indenture
and the Indenture. The Refunding

use and investment of, the proceeds
of the Tax-Exempt Bonds in such
manner and to such extent as may

make timely and adequate payments
to the federal government, (iv)

burden
or
expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or payments

any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf
of the City, as may be appropriate
to assure the exclusion of interest

inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Tax-Exempt Bonds,
setting forth the reasonable expectations of the City regarding the
amount and use of all the proceeds
of the Tax-Exempt Bonds, the facts,
circumstances
and
estimates
on
which they are based, and other
facts and circumstances relevant to
the tax treatment of the interest on

Bonds is also made with respect to

Refunding Bonds.
This Council finds and determines
it is necessary and proper and in the
best interest of the City to authorize
the issuance of Refunding Bonds for
the purpose of refunding one or
more series of the Outstanding Revenue Bonds, or designated maturities thereof, to obtain aggregate net
present value debt service savings
of not less than three percent (3%).

series shall be not less than three
percent (3%). The principal amount
of each series of Refunding Bonds
is to be the amount set forth in the
Certificate of Award authorized in
Section 5 and shall be the amount
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
necessary (i) to refund the Refunded Bonds, (ii) to fund any deposit
to the Debt Service Reserve Fund
required under the Indenture, (iv) to
pay costs of any Credit Support
Instruments, (v) to pay identified
amounts owed under Hedge Agreements, and (vi) to pay costs of issuing

series. Costs of issuance of the
Refunding Bonds and any required
deposit to the Debt Service Reserve
Fund attributable to the Refunding
Bonds shall, in each case, be included in the costs funded from the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds.
Section 3. Authorization of Hedging Arrangements.
This Council finds that by engaging
in
interest
rate
hedging
arrangements, from time to time, the
City may reduce its cost of borrowing
by
optimizing
the
relative
amounts of fixed and variable rate
obligations and minimizing the risk
of variations in its debt service
costs. Certain types of hedging
arrangements (referred to in this
Ordinance
as
“swaptions”)
may
enable the City to obtain savings
prior to the issuance of Refunding
Bonds by providing for an upfront
payment to the City by a financial
institution or other organization
that is the counterparty to the
hedge arrangement in consideration
of the City’s giving the counterparty the option to make effective at a
future
date
an
interest
rate
exchange transaction with the City.
To permit the City to have the flexibility to undertake interest rate
swap, swaption, rate cap, rate collar
and other hedging transactions from
time to time, and to establish the
procedures
for
approving
those
transactions, this Council authorizes
the signing and delivery of one or
more agreements (each, a “Hedge
Agreement”) and any related agreements necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by each Hedge Agreement. The
authorizations in this Section 3 are
supplemental to and not in derogation of any authority provided by
any other ordinance of this Council
concerning hedging arrangements.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is to the financial advantage of the City and in the City’s
best
interests
that
a
hedging
arrangement be undertaken by the
City with respect to any Outstanding Revenue Bonds or any series of
Refunding Bonds, the Director of
Finance may authorize one or more
interest rate hedge transactions in
accordance
with
the
applicable
Hedge Agreement; provided that (a)
the counterparty shall be rated at
the time of signing the Hedge
Agreement not lower than A+ or A1
by at least one rating agency or its
obligations under the Hedge Agreement shall be guaranteed or insured
by an entity rated at the time of
signing the Hedge Agreement not
lower than A+ or A1 by at least one
rating agency, and (b) the term of
each hedge transaction shall not
exceed the final maturity of the
Bonds to which the hedge relates or
(in the case of an option) will
relate.
The Director of Finance shall
negotiate the terms of each Hedge
Agreement with a counterparty satisfying the credit criteria in this
Ordinance. The City shall receive a
written opinion of a Financial Advisor that the upfront payment or the
periodic payments, as the case may

50
be, to be made by the counterparty
to the City, or by the City to the
counterparty, shall be fair value for
the Hedge Agreement, given the
credit of the counterparty and the
terms and conditions of the Hedge
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall determine the terms and conditions of the Hedge Agreement,
including without limitation, the
time or times and procedures for the
exercise by the counterparty or the
City, as the case may be, of its
option under the Hedge Agreement,
whether the obligations of the City
under the Hedge Agreement shall be
secured by a Credit Support Instrument, and the rates to be paid by
the counterparty to the City and by
the City to the counterparty under
the Hedge Agreement in the event
of the exercise of the option. The
approval of each interest rate hedge
transaction
by
the
Director
of
Finance shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery
of the applicable Hedge Agreement
by the Director of Finance.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from the Net Revenues of the Utility (each term as defined in the
Indenture) and may be secured by
a pledge of the Net Revenues on a
parity with the pledge given under
the Indenture to secure Bonds, subject to the requirements of Article
XI of the Indenture with respect to
Parity Obligations. The obligation
of the City to make payments under
a Hedge Agreement does not and
shall not represent or constitute a
general obligation, debt, bonded
indebtedness or a pledge of the faith
and credit of the City. Nothing shall
give any party to a Hedge Agreement the right to have excises, ad
valorem or other taxes levied by the
City or the State for the payment of
any amounts due under a Hedge
Agreement.
Section 4. Terms of Refunding
Bonds.
The Refunding Bonds shall contain the terms provided in or determined pursuant to, the Indenture,
this Ordinance, the applicable Certificate of Award and the applicable Supplemental Indenture. Each
series of Refunding Bonds may be
secured by a separate Supplemental Indenture, or a single Supplemental Indenture may secure more
than
one
series
of
Refunding
Bonds.
(a) General. In the event that the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, determines that the City’s best
interests will be served by causing
a series of Refunding Bonds to be
obligations bearing interest at variable interest rates, then the Director of Finance is authorized to so
specify in the Certificate of Award
for that series. If the Director of
Finance so determines, then the
method and procedure by which the
variable rate of interest to be borne
by the Refunding Bonds of that
series shall be determined as provided in the applicable Supplemental Indenture, whether by auction,
by reference to a market index, by
a remarketing agent or otherwise,
provided that no series of variable

The City Record
rate Refunding Bonds shall bear
interest at a rate in excess of twenty-five
percent
(25%)
per
year
(including any Refunding Bonds
held by a provider of a Credit Support Instrument). The Director of
Finance may determine that the
terms of a variable rate series of
Refunding Bonds may or may not
permit the holders to tender their
variable rate Refunding Bonds for
purchase by the City. If the Director of Finance designates any series
of Refunding Bonds as variable rate
Refunding Bonds, and if the Holders of that series of Refunding
Bonds are to be entitled to tender
those Refunding Bonds for purchase, then the Director of Finance
shall also designate for those variable rate Refunding Bonds (and
may designate others, from time to
time, in substitution therefor), the
tender agent or agents and the
remarketing agent or agents, which
designations shall be based on the
determination of the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed
to provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable. The Director of Finance is authorized to enter
into agreements in connection with
the
delivery
of
the
Refunding
Bonds, and from time to time thereafter so long as the Refunding
Bonds
are
outstanding,
with
providers of Credit Support Instruments, tender agents (which may be
the Trustee), remarketing agents
(which may be any of the Original
Purchasers) and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the method of
determining the variable interest
rates, permitting holders the right
of tender and providing for payment
of the purchase price of, or debt
service on, the variable rate Refunding Bonds. In the event the variable
rate Refunding Bonds are issued as
auction rate obligations, the Director of Finance is authorized to enter
into agreements, from time to time,
with auction agents and others, or
to cause the Trustee to enter into
those agreements, based on the written advice of a Financial Advisor
that the parties so designated possess the requisite resources and
experience to provide the services
required of them and that the terms
on which the designated parties
have agreed to provide such services are fair and commercially reasonable.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of
any series of Refunding Bonds, and
regardless of whether that series of
Refunding Bonds bears interest at
variable or fixed rates, is authorized
to contract for a Credit Support
Instrument, and to pay the costs of
it from proceeds of the Refunding
Bonds, if the Director determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the Credit
Support Instrument will result in a
savings in the cost of the financing
to the City.

Bonds of any series from the Depository, and authenticate and deliver
registered Bond certificates to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of action
or inaction of the City, of those persons requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is authorized and directed to enter into any
agreements determined by the Director to be necessary in connection
with the book entry system for the
Refunding Bonds, after determining
that those agreements will not
endanger the funds or securities of
the City under the Indenture (as
evidenced by the Director’s signing
of those agreements).

and not substantially adverse to the
City as may be approved by the officers signing the same on behalf of
the City. The determination by those
officers that a Supplemental Indenture is not substantially adverse to

to the Indenture to permit the City
increased flexibility for the use of
financial or credit structures and

obligations bearing interest to be
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes (the “TaxExempt Bonds”), the City covenants
that it will use, and will restrict the
use and investment of, the proceeds
of the Tax-Exempt Bonds in such
manner and to such extent as may
be necessary so that (a) the interest on the Tax-Exempt Bonds will
be excluded from gross income for
federal income tax purposes, and
(b) in the case of any Tax-Exempt
Bonds qualifying as bonds, the interest on which is not treated as an
item of tax preference under Section
57 of the Code (“Non-AMT Bonds”),
such Tax-Exempt Bonds will be
treated as Non-AMT Bonds.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken

The City Record
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the TaxExempt Bonds to be and to remain
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will

persons acting for it, will, among
other acts of compliance, (i) apply
the proceeds of the Tax-Exempt
Bonds to the governmental purposes
of the borrowing, (ii) restrict the
yield on investment property, (iii)
make timely and adequate payments
to the federal government, (iv)
maintain books and records and
make calculations and reports, and
(v) refrain from certain uses of
those proceeds and, as applicable, of
property financed with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the
extent necessary to assure such
exclusion of that interest under the
Code.
The Director of Finance, or any
other officer of the City having
responsibility for issuance of the
Tax-Exempt Bonds, is hereby authorized (a) to make or effect any election, selection, designation, choice,
consent, approval, or waiver on
behalf of the City with respect to
the Tax-Exempt Bonds as the City
is permitted or required to make or
give under the federal income tax
laws, including, without limitation
thereto, any of the elections provided for in Section 148(f)(4)(C) of the
Code or available under Section 148
of the Code, for the purpose of
assuring, enhancing or protecting
the favorable tax treatment or status of the Tax-Exempt Bonds or
interest thereon or assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose,
reducing
the
burden
or
expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or payments
of penalties, or making payments of
special amounts in lieu of making
computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as rebate, or
obviating those amounts or payments, as determined by that officer,
which action shall be in writing and
signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf
of the City, as may be appropriate
to assure the exclusion of interest
from gross income and the intended
tax status of the Tax-Exempt Bonds,
and (c) to give one or more appropriate certificates of the City, for
inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Tax-Exempt Bonds,
setting forth the reasonable expectations of the City regarding the
amount and use of all the proceeds
of the Tax-Exempt Bonds, the facts,
circumstances
and
estimates
on
which they are based, and other
facts and circumstances relevant to
the tax treatment of the interest on
and the tax status of the TaxExempt Bonds.
Each covenant made in this Section with respect to the Tax-Exempt
Bonds is also made with respect to
all issues any portion of the debt
service on which is paid from proceeds of the Tax-Exempt Bonds
(and, if different, the original issue
and any refunding issues in a series
of refundings), to the extent such

328

March 1, 2006
compliance is necessary to assure
exclusion of interest on the TaxExempt Bonds from gross income
for federal income tax purposes, and

with respect to the Tax-Exempt
Bonds.

for all purposes of Chapter 1309,
Ohio Revised Code) without the
necessity for separation of delivery
of the Net Revenues or for the filing or recording of the Indenture or
any other resolution or instrument
by which such pledge is created or
any certificate, statement or other
document
with
respect
to

compliance with all applicable legal
requirements.
Section 16. Separability.
Each section of this Ordinance
and each subdivision of any section
is declared to be independent, and
the finding or holding of any section or subdivision of any section to

“A”. Each bond, whether to secure
the execution of a contract, its performance, or both, shall be in an
amount determined by the Director
of Public Service. Each bond submitted to secure the contract or contracts authorized by this ordinance

The City Record
Res. No. 328-06.
By Council Members Zone, Santiago,
Cimperman, Britt, Westbrook, Brancatelli, White, Cleveland, Coats, Kelley, Cummins, Brady and Sweeney.
An emergency resolution opposing
proposed
House
Bill
515
which
would amend Ohio law to prohibit
an adoptive or foster child from
being placed in the private residence of a homosexual, bisexual, or
transgender person.
Whereas, on February 9, 2006, State
Representative Ron Hood introduced
the “Adoptive and Foster Children’s
Protection Act” (H.B. 515); and
Whereas, H.B. 515 would prohibit
adoptions and foster parenting by
gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people in Ohio; and
Whereas, H.B. 515 would also
deny adoption or foster parenting to
a household where any “individual
who is a homosexual, bi sexual, or
transgender individual” lives — including another child; and
Whereas, H.B. 515 would require
courts to determine the sexual orientation and gender identity of
prospective parents and directs the
Department of Job and Family Services to promulgate rules and procedures to carry this out; and
Whereas, the proposed bill attempts to legislatively circumvent
the Ohio Supreme Court-established
“best interest of the child” adoption
standard used since 1990; and
Whereas, this Council commends
House Speaker Jon Husted for ensuring that the bill remains on the
“back burner”, at least for now; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that all citizens of the United States
should be afforded equal protection
under the law, and that sexual orientation is not a standard by which
to measure whether a person will be
a good parent; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that H.B. 515 is discriminatory and
violates both the Ohio and the
United States Constitutions; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby opposes proposed House Bill 515
which would amend Ohio law to prohibit an adoptive or foster child
from being placed in the private residence of a homosexual, bisexual, or
transgender person.

An emergency resolution supporting Ohio House Bill 482 which
requires any physical fitness facility in the state to place within the
facility an automatic external defibrillator, requires the facility to have
at least one employee trained in use
of a defibrillator present at the
facility during operating hours, and
grants civil immunity to any person
who performs automated external
defibrillation in good faith.
Whereas, for several years now,
the City of Cleveland has placed
automated external defibrillators at
each elevator bank on every floor of
Cleveland City Hall, as well as on
location at each of its recreation
centers; and
Whereas, currently in Ohio, physical fitness facilities are not required to have automated external
defibrillators on location; and
Whereas,
it
is
reasonable
to
assume that one of the most important places to have an automated
external defibrillator is at a physical fitness facility, as it is at such
places that people exercise, increasing their heart rates and blood pressure, thus increasing their risk of
heart attacks; and
Whereas, this Council is aware of
at least one death due to a heart
attack that occurred at a physical
fitness facility, which likely could
have been avoided had an automatic external defibrillator been at the
facility and had someone trained to
use it been available; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports Ohio House Bill 482

Res. No. 341-06.
By Council Member Sweeney.
An emergency resolution supporting the introduction, passage and
enactment of federal relief legislation providing for legal permanent
residency and/or naturalization and
United States citizenship for Manuel
Bartsch.
Whereas, it has come before the
Council of the City of Cleveland that
Manuel Bartsch, of Gilboa, Ohio, is
an 18 year old high school senior
and has resided in the State of Ohio
for nearly ten years, after having
been brought to the United States as
a young child by his step-grandfather; and
Whereas, Manuel Bartsch’s legal
guardian took no responsible steps
to legalize Manuel’s immigration
status so he could lawfully remain
in the United States; and
Whereas,
Manuel
Bartsch
has
attended the Pandora-Gilboa High
School in Pandora, Ohio and expects
to graduate in May, 2006; and
Whereas,
Manuel
Bartsch
has
been accepted for admission to the
University of Northwestern Ohio
School of Business; and
Whereas, Manuel Bartsch, on his
own initiative, sought the counsel
and assistance of the Department of
Homeland Security (“DHS”), and the
United States Citizenship and Immigration Services “(USCIS”) to clarify his immigration status; and
Whereas, Manuel Bartsch’s request for assistance to the USCIS
ultimately resulted in his arrest and
detention by U. S. Immigration and
Customs Enforcement (“ICE”); and
Whereas, ICE ultimately released
Manuel Bartsch from custody but
continues to vigorously pursue his
deportation from the United States;
and
Whereas,
Manuel
Bartsch
has
spent the formative years of his life
living and attending school in Ohio
and because other special humanitarian circumstances exist in this
case;
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports the introduction, passage and enactment of federal relief
legislation providing for legal permanent residency and/or natural-

Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to U.S. Senators Mike DeWine and George
Voinovich and all members of the
Ohio delegation.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency

the affirmative vote of two-thirds of

Res. No. 342-06.
By Council Members Zone, Santiago, White, Brady, Cimperman, Conwell, Brancatelli, Pierce Scott, Sweeney and Cummins.
An emergency resolution opposing
the “Sensenbrenner-King Bill”, House
Resolution 4437, which would make
felons of 11 million undocumented
immigrants, criminalize contact with
undocumented immigrants and frustrate the dreams of legal immigrants seeking citizenship.
Whereas, on December 16, 2005,
the U.S. House of Representatives
Border
Protection,
approved
the
Antiterrorism and Illegal Immigration Act, H.R. 4437, also known as
the Sensenbrenner-King Bill; and
Whereas, H.R. 4437 criminalizes
the mere presence of an alien without valid immigration status, thereby causing 11 million undocumented
immigrants currently living and
working in the U.S. to be guilty of
a federal felony; and
Whereas, the Bill’s broad definition of “smuggling” allows the federal government to prosecute almost
any American having casual contact
with an undocumented immigrant;
and
Whereas, H.R. 4437 could potentially
make
criminals
out
of
church groups providing food, shelter or other assistance to undocumented immigrants, social workers
assisting undocumented workers
who are victims of domestic abuse,
co-workers giving an undocumented immigrant a ride to work, and
a U.S. citizen living with a spouse
who is an undocumented immigrant; and
Whereas, H.R. 4437 eliminates
judicial oversight of delays in the
naturalization process and allows
the federal government to use subjective and secretive information to
bar legal immigrants from becoming
U.S. citizens; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

Res. No. 263-06.
By Council Member Pierce Scott.
An emergency resolution declaring this Council’s support of the proposal of Cleveland East LP to the
Ohio Housing Finance Agency for
the use of low-income housing tax
credits.
Whereas, each year the Ohio
Housing Finance Agency allocates
housing credits for affordable housing developments throughout Ohio
using a competitive proposal process; and
Whereas, Cleveland East LP is
proposing to develop up to 30 housing units on scattered sites throughout the City of Cleveland, with special emphasis on the East submarket as defined by the Ohio Housing
Finance Agency; and
Whereas, 100% of these housing
units will be affordable to families
with incomes at or below 60% of the
area median income and no housing
units will be market rate; and
Whereas, 10% of these housing
units will be affordable to households whose annual income is at or
below 35% of the area median
income; and
Whereas, 50% of these housing
units will be affordable to households whose annual income is at or
below 50% of the area median
income; and
Whereas, the project does not
serve a special needs population;
and
Whereas, the Cleveland East LP
proposal will benefit the citizens of
the City; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby declares its support of the proposal of Cleveland East LP to the
Ohio Housing Finance Agency for
the use of low-income housing tax
