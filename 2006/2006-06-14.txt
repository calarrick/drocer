ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 997-06.
By Council Members Brady, Sweeney, Britt, Santiago, Conwell Westbrook, Lewis, Polensek, White, Kelley, Brancatelli, Pierce Scott, Zone,
Turner, Cleveland, Coats, Dolan,
Cummins, Cimperman and Johnson.
An emergency resolution in support of the Health Care For All
Ohioans Act providing for publicly
funded comprehensive, lifetime health
care coverage for all Ohio residents
as a matter of right and urging residents of the City to sign petitions
to put the Act on the ballot.
Whereas, this Council believes
that all residents of the State of
Ohio, with or without financial
means, should have access to affordable quality health care; and
Whereas, this Council has in the
past, and continues to advocate legislation that will guarantee such
access; and
Whereas, the Single-Payer Action
Network Ohio (SPAN Ohio), a coalition supported by the Ohio AFL-CIO,
UAW Region 2-B, UNITE HERE,
Graphic Communications Union/Teamsters, large numbers of health care
providers,
community
and
faith
groups,
women’s
organizations,
three Ohio members of Congress,
several Ohio state legislators, and
many
individuals
committed
to
working for publicly funded universal health care is sponsoring an initiative petition to put the Health
Care For All Ohioans Act on the ballot; and
Whereas, this initiative, if approved by the people of Ohio, would
establish a health care system in
our state which would provide comprehensive medical coverage for all
of the state’s residents, including
the full range of inpatient and outpatient hospital care, preventive
care, mental health, vision, hearing,
prescription drugs, dental, emergency services, rehabilitation services,
hospice
care,
home
care,
health maintenance care, medical
supplies, and all other necessary
medical services as determined by
any state licensed, certified or registered health care practitioner; and
Whereas, this initiative would provide timely emergency health care
services in each county, including
hospital care and triage, and necessary transportation in each county
to access covered health care services; and
Whereas, the cost of providing
health care coverage for employees
of the City of Cleveland would be
substantially reduced if this Act
becomes law because the funding
formula of the Act provides for a
payroll tax not to exceed 3.85% for
health care coverage, far less than
what the City now spends; and
Whereas, the adoption of a publicly funded universal health care
plan on a state level would give
impetus to the ultimate goal, which
is winning a national health care
system, which all other industrial
countries in the world today enjoy;
and

34
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports the Health Care For All
Ohioans Act providing for publicly
funded
comprehensive,
lifetime
health care coverage for all Ohio residents as a matter of right and urging residents of the City to sign petitions to put the Act on the ballot.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

An emergency resolution supporting the continued funding of cancer
research in the United States.

The City Record
Whereas, more than 10 million
people in the United States are currently living with cancer; and
Whereas, more than 1.3 million
people in the US will be diagnosed
with cancer this year; and
Whereas, 64% of adults and 78%
of children diagnosed today will be
alive five years from now; and
Whereas, last year, for the first
time in a decade, Congress cut
spending for NIH, NCI and CDC cancer programs, reducing funding by
2%; and
Whereas, 80% of NCI budget goes
to research; Congress risks cutting
current research in mid-stream, losing the momentum of the initial
research; and
Whereas, people are living longer
and
more
productively
due
to
progress with treatments; and
Whereas, by making cancer research a priority, Congress will save
millions of lives, reduce suffering,
and save billions in health care
costs now and in the future; and
Whereas, One Voice Against Cancer formed in 2000 to create the
broadest coalition, with more than
40 organizations committed to keeping cancer research and treatment a
critical priority in the US; and
Whereas, Congress must vote for
a budget that rejects cancer cuts
and give a high priority to cancer
funding; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports the continued funding

States.

(r) All fees and charges shall be effective on January 1 of each year.
Section 535.12 Extension of Time for Payment
Water bills shall be paid on or before the date stated on the bill but the Director of Public Utilities may, after
investigation, grant an extension of time for payment not to exceed ninety days in cases of indigency, emergency, relief and similar conditions. Partial payments may be accepted, properly approved, but bills must be paid
in full before the expiration of the ninety-day period.
Section 535.21 Charges for Unmetered Fire Protection Service within the City and Direct Service Metropolitan
Area
A charge shall be made for each unmetered fire supply connection within the limits of the City and direct
service suburbs. The charge shall be determined by the size of the fire supply connection through which water
passes for use on the premises so supplied under Section 535.06 of the Codified Ordinances for each three months
or any part of three months.
Charges shall be collected quarterly for each fire supply connection to cover inspection, testing, sealing and
resealing of such service connections, stand-by pumpage capacity, and replacement or cleaning of distribution or
trunk water mains to improve the water supply for fire protection purposes.
Section 535.24 Charges for Water from Fire Hydrants, Private Fire Line Systems, and Other Unmetered Sources
(a) In addition to other charges, if water is used from a public fire hydrant, a private fire line system, or any
other unmetered source, upon special permit only, a charge for the permit and a hydrant rental, if applicable,
must be paid in advance under Section 535.06 of the Codified Ordinances. A separate permit shall be issued for
each hydrant which shall identify its location.
(b) Water may be furnished from a fire hydrant, a private fire line system, or any other unmetered source, for
any special purpose authorized by the Commissioner of the Division of Water. The charge for water so furnished
shall be under Section 535.04 for the service district in which the fire hydrant private fire line system, or other
unmetered source is located, but shall not include a discounted rate for the first 1,000 cubic feet of water. The
quantity of water used may be estimated by the Commissioner based on information provided by the user as to
the user’s purpose and needs, or the Commissioner may require the installation of a meter at the connection to
the hydrant to be used, in which event the user shall pay the cost of installing the meter and the cost of all
water measured.
Section 535.25 Charges for Water for Building and Construction Purposes
All water for building or construction purposes, whether public or private, shall be paid for under Sections
535.04 and 535.06 of the Codified Ordinances. In the case of water to be used for building purposes, the Director
of Building and Housing, before granting any permit to erect, repair, change or alter any building or structure,
shall first require the owner of the building to pay in advance an amount as is justly chargeable for water to
be used in erecting, repairing, changing or altering such building or structure, and on the refusal of the owner
to pay the charges in advance, the Director shall refuse to grant the permit. Charges shall be based on estimates
of the amount of masonry, walls, plastering and other work for which water is used in construction, computed
according to the accepted rules of the Division of Water. If desired by the property owner or contractor, water
for building or construction purposes may be taken through a meter, furnished and set at the expense of the
owner or contractor, and paid for at the rate set forth in Sections 535.04 and 535.06 of the Codified Ordinances.
However, the advance payment for water in any case shall be made, as previously stated, and if the supply of
water is taken entirely through a meter, the charge shall be adjusted under the amount registered by the meter,
and the excess of the advance payment, if any, shall be refunded on the completion of the work.
Section 535.27 Use of Fire Hydrants for Construction Purposes
(a) No person shall use any hydrant for construction or other purposes without first obtaining a permit for
such use from the Commissioner of Water. Such permit shall be charged under Section 535.06 of the Codified Ordinances.
(b) All hydrants used for any construction purpose, such as sewers, buildings, paving, etc., must have reducing
couplings attached to the nozzles of the hydrants, with an independent valve for regulating the supply.
(c) The main valve of the hydrant must be opened full at the beginning of work each day, and remain open
until the stoppage of work at night. The water supply shall be regulated by the independent valve. The hydrant
shall be operated only by a proper hydrant key, which shall be obtained from the Division of Water.
(d) Water must not be allowed to run except when used. No leaking hose, pipe or joints shall be permitted.
All persons using hydrants shall immediately obey any instructions or orders that may be issued by the Commissioner of Water, or his authorized agents, to regulate the use of these hydrants.
(e) In case of failure to comply with the requirements of the Division, the water supply shall be stopped
immediately, the hydrant permit revoked and no new permits for the use of any hydrant shall be issued until
all damages or charges for the waste of water have been paid.
(f) If required by the Commissioner, a meter shall be applied to the connection made with the hydrant, at the
expense of the party using the same and the party shall pay for all water by meter measure.
Section 535.46 Fees for Returned Checks
The Division of Water shall charge an account holder under Section 535.06 of the Codified Ordinances for any
check returned for lack of sufficient funds.
