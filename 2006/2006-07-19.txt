of fixed rate Airport System Revenue Refunding Bonds to convert
outstanding Airport System Revenue
Bonds from variable rates of interest to fixed rates of interest; authorizing supplemental indentures and
other agreements related to Airport
System Revenue Bonds; and authorizing and approving related matters.
Whereas, the City has outstanding
certain series of variable rate Airport System Revenue Bonds issued

seeks to convert the interest rate on
one or more series of those Bonds
from variable rates of interest to

refunding the variable rate Bonds
with fixed rate Bonds of the Airport
System; and

a municipal department and providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that authorizing fixed
rate Airport System Revenue Bonds
to refund outstanding variable rate
Airport System Revenue Bonds is
necessary to enable the Airport System to take advantage of favorable
debt market conditions on a timely
basis to optimize the amount of
fixed rate and variable obligations
of the Airport System; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

In addition to the authorizations

Ordinance
No.
292-06,
passed by this Council on April 10,

in the best interest of the City to
authorize the issuance of Fixed
Rate Refunding Bonds for the purpose of refunding one or more series
of the Outstanding Variable Rate
Revenue Bonds, or designated maturities thereof, to convert the interest
on those outstanding Airport System
Revenue Bonds from variable rates
to fixed rates. The principal amount
of each series of Fixed Rate Refunding Bonds is to be the amount set
forth in the Certificate of Award
authorized in Section 4 and shall be
the amount determined by the Director of Finance, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
necessary (i) to refund the Refunded Bonds, (ii) to fund any deposit
to the Bond Service Reserve Fund
required under the Indenture, (iii)
to pay costs of any Credit Support

to
pay

Refunded Bonds. The proceeds from
the sale of each series of Fixed Rate
Refunding Bonds shall be allocated,
deposited and applied as provided in
Section 5 of this Ordinance.
The Fixed Rate Refunding Bonds
may be issued in one or more separate series, each bearing a distinctive designation, provided that the
Fixed Rate Refunding Bonds of
each series satisfy the requirements
of this Ordinance and the Indenture.
Separate
series
of
Fixed
Rate
Refunding Bonds may be issued at
the same or different times. The
Fixed Rate Refunding Bonds of

The City Record

provided in the applicable Certificate of Award. A separate Certificate of Award and a separate Supplemental Indenture may be delivered
for

of
issuance of the Fixed Rate Refunding Bonds and any required deposit
to the Bond Service Reserve Fund
attributable
to
the

Rate
Refunding
Bonds
shall

transfers. To the extent that the
Original Indenture (particularly, but
without limitation, Section 2.05) permits fully registered Revenue Bonds
to be exchanged for or transferred
into coupon Revenue Bonds or Revenue Bonds payable to bearer, then
the Original Indenture is amended
to prohibit such exchanges or transfers for the Fixed Rate Refunding
Bonds unless and until the Indenture shall have been further amended to permit such exchanges or
transfers.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Fixed Rate Refunding Bonds
of any series for use in a book entry
system, the Director of Finance and
the Trustee may attempt to establish a securities depository/book
entry
relationship
with
another
qualified Depository. If the Director
of Finance and the Trustee do not
or are unable to do so, the Director
of Finance and the Trustee, after
making provision for notification of
the beneficial owners by the then

Refunding Bonds of any series from
the Depository, and authenticate
and deliver registered Bond certificates to the assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost

Service Reserve Fund to the payment of costs of remarketing the

income for federal income tax purposes (the “Tax-Exempt Bonds”),
the City covenants that it will use,
and will restrict the use and investment of, the proceeds of the TaxExempt Bonds in such manner and
to such extent as may be necessary
so that (a) the interest on the TaxExempt Bonds will be excluded
from
gross
income
for
federal
income tax purposes, and (b) in the
case of any Tax-Exempt Bonds qualifying as bonds, the interest on
which is not treated as an item of
tax preference under Section 57 of
the Code (“Non-AMT Bonds”), such
Tax-Exempt Bonds will be treated
as Non-AMT Bonds.

(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required

affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or
persons acting for it, will, among
other acts of compliance, (i) apply
the proceeds of the Tax-Exempt

July 19, 2006
Bonds to the governmental purposes
of the borrowing, (ii) restrict the
yield on investment property, (iii)
make timely and adequate payments
to the federal government, (iv)
maintain books and records and
make calculations and reports, and
(v) refrain from certain uses of
those proceeds and, as applicable, of
property financed with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the
extent necessary to assure such

Code.
The Director of Finance, or any
other officer of the City having
responsibility for issuance of the
Tax-Exempt Bonds, is hereby authorized (a) to make or effect any election, selection, designation, choice,

Code or available under Section 148
of the Code, for the purpose of
assuring, enhancing or protecting
the favorable tax treatment or status of the Tax-Exempt Bonds or
interest thereon or assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose,
reducing
the
burden
or
expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or payments
of penalties, or making payments of
special amounts in lieu of making
computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as rebate, or
obviating those amounts or payments, as determined by that officer,

signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,

circumstances
and
estimates
on
which they are based, and other
facts and circumstances relevant to

By Council Members Turner, Conwell, Sweeney, Coats, Cleveland,
Brady, Zone, Santiago, Westbrook,
Polensek, Britt, White, Cummins,
Cimperman, Kelley and Brancatelli.
An emergency resolution announcing City Council’s intent to enact
legislation that imposes a duty on
parents and legal guardians to
supervise a minor under their care
to help prevent juvenile crime.
Whereas, parents are responsible
for the nurturing, role modeling,
safety and supervision of their children in order for them to lead a productive life and make contributions
to society; and
Whereas, alarmingly, juvenile offenders are the fastest growing

July 19, 2006
source of crime facing America’s
neighborhoods and schools, causing
increased concern in communities;
and
Whereas, there are approximately
2.3 million juveniles that are arrested each year in America and that
number is steadily increasing; and
Whereas, the lack of parental
involvement in the lives of children
is contributing to the problem of
juvenile delinquency; and
Whereas, since parents are responsible for raising their children and
teaching them proper discipline in
order to become law abiding citizens, active parental involvement
can decrease the incidence of juvenile delinquency and youth crimes;
and
Whereas, to address the growing
problem of juvenile crime and lack
of parental responsibility for the
actions of minors, various states and
municipalities have enacted statutes
and ordinances to encourage parents
and legal guardians to fulfill this
responsibility, and to impose sanctions for failing to fulfill this
responsibility; and
Whereas, City Council is considering imposing sanctions, including
parental education, fines, and/or
financial
responsibility
to
cover
damages, on any parent or legal
guardian who fails to supervise a
minor under their care who commits
a crime; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council will
consider enacting legislation that
requires parents and legal guardians to supervise minors under their
care to help prevent juvenile crime.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

Cimperman, Kelley and Brancatelli.
An emergency resolution announcing City Council’s intent to enact
legislation that imposes a duty on
parents and legal guardians to
supervise a minor under their care
to help prevent juvenile crime.
Whereas, parents are responsible
for the nurturing, role modeling,
safety and supervision of their children in order for them to lead a productive life and make contributions
to society; and
Whereas, alarmingly, juvenile offenders are the fastest growing
source of crime facing America’s
neighborhoods and schools, causing
increased concern in communities;
and
Whereas, there are approximately
2.3 million juveniles that are arrested each year in America and that
number is steadily increasing; and
Whereas, the lack of parental
involvement in the lives of children
is contributing to the problem of
juvenile delinquency; and
Whereas, since parents are responsible for raising their children and
teaching them proper discipline in
order to become law abiding citizens, active parental involvement
can decrease the incidence of juvenile delinquency and youth crimes;
and
Whereas, to address the growing
problem of juvenile crime and lack
of parental responsibility for the
actions of minors, various states and
municipalities have enacted statutes

62
and ordinances to encourage parents
and legal guardians to fulfill this
responsibility, and to impose sanctions for failing to fulfill this
responsibility; and
Whereas, City Council is considering imposing sanctions, including
parental education, fines, and/or
financial
responsibility
to
cover
damages, on any parent or legal
guardian who fails to supervise a
minor under their care who commits
a crime; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council will
consider enacting legislation that
requires parents and legal guardians to supervise minors under their
care to help prevent juvenile crime.

By Council Member Reed.
An emergency ordinance to amend
Section 628.02 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as

The City Record
enacted by Ordinance No. 2661-91,
passed November 18, 1991, relating
to possession or sale of assault
weapons.
Whereas, the State of California
recently banned the .50 caliber rifle;
and
Whereas, the .50 caliber rifle is a
combat weapon; and
Whereas, according to a Senate
report, a bullet from the .50 caliber
rifle, even at 1.5 miles ways, destroys a target with more energy
than a bullet fired at point-blank
range from Dirty Harry’s famous .44
Magnum; and
Whereas, the standard .50 caliber
bullet is four times heavier than the
.30 caliber bullet and ten times
heaver than the M16 bullet; and
Whereas, 60 Minutes recently produced and aired a segment on the
power of the .50 caliber rifle and the
dangers associated with the availability of the rifle; and
Whereas, such dangers include
the possibility that the .50 caliber
rifle could be used in a terrorist
attack; and
Whereas, one such specific danger
is the use of the .50 caliber rifle to
impair a commercial airline during
takeoff or landing; and
Whereas, this Council is concerned about the use of the .50 caliber rifle in non-combat zones and
the potential for use in a terrorist
attack; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
