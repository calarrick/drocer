Whereas, the Division of Water is
able to provide support with two
self-contained teams of up to a total
of 35 employees, complete with vehicles and equipment, to assist with

four to six weeks in two rotations
of
approximately
two
or
three
weeks for each team; and
Whereas, the conditions caused by
Hurricane Katrina constitute an
emergency requiring immediate purchases without formal competitive

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 124-06.
By Council Members Polensek,
Sweeney,
Westbrook,
Cimperman,
Pierce Scott, Britt, Brady, Zone,
Coats, Turner and Reed.
An emergency resolution urging
the Supreme Court of the State of
Ohio to investigate the backlog of
foreclosure
cases
in
Cuyahoga
County Common Pleas Court and to
take action to force the Common
Pleas Court to better manage its
foreclosure case load and hold
accountable those that manage the
foreclosure cases so that foreclosure cases are closed in a reasonable period of time and properties
do not sit vacant and abandoned
for years waiting for final rulings
by the court.
Whereas, last year, 11,076 new
foreclosure cases were filed in Cuyahoga County Common Please Court;
and
Whereas, almost 40% of its foreclosure cases, or 12,755 foreclosures,
have dragged out beyond the Ohio
Supreme Court’s 12-month standard;
and
Whereas, the practice of the Common Pleas Court is to conceal the
high number of backlogged foreclosure cases by removing them from
the judges’ case lists while the
cases are before magistrates; and
Whereas, reports filed with the
Ohio Supreme Court show only those
foreclosure cases returned from the
magistrates to the judges for final
ruling; and
Whereas,
obviously,
Cuyahoga
County
magistrates
are
overwhelmed by the high volume of foreclosure cases filed each year, coupled with the already backlogged
cases from past years; and
Whereas, homeowners and citizens all over the City of Cleveland
are negatively affected by the high
number of foreclosures cases currently backlogged in the court; and
Whereas, vacant properties often
become a breeding ground for crime:
a study in Austin Texas found that
blocks with vacant building had 3.2
times as many drug calls to police,

The City Record
1.8 times as many theft calls and
twice the number of violent calls as
blocks without vacant buildings; and
Whereas, more than 12,000 fires
break out in vacant structures each
year in the United States resulting
in $73 million in property damage
annually, most the result of arson;
and
Whereas, vacant and abandoned
properties require a disproportionate
amount of government maintenance,
from securing properties against
criminal activity to removal of
garbage and rodents to demolition,
all at a cost to taxpayers; and
Whereas, vacant properties reduce
city tax revenue in three ways: they
are often tax delinquent; their low
value means they generate little in
taxes; and they depress property
values across an entire neighborhood; and
Whereas, a 2001 study in Philadelphia found that houses within 150
feet of a vacant or abandoned property experienced a net loss of $7,627
in value; and
Whereas, the cost of living in a
neighborhood with many vacant and
abandoned properties makes obtaining homeowner’s insurance, mortgages and loans for home improvements more difficult; and
Whereas, vacant properties degrade and devalue the quality of
life for remaining residents, isolating and weakening the neighborhood, and increasing the likelihood
that property values will continue to
decline and further abandonment
will set in; and
Whereas, it is incumbent upon the
Ohio State Supreme Court to force
the Cuyahoga Court of Common
Pleas to take control of its foreclosure case load in order to turn
around the continuing spiral of
neighborhoods with abandoned and
vacant properties; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the Supreme Court of the
State of Ohio to investigate the
backlog of foreclosure cases in
Cuyahoga County Common Pleas
Court and to take action to force the
Common Pleas Court to better manage its foreclosure case load and
hold accountable those that manage
the foreclosure cases so that such
cases are closed in a reasonable
period of time and properties do not
sit vacant and abandoned for years
waiting for final rulings by the
court.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution the Justices
of the Supreme Court of the State of
Ohio, and the Judges and magistrates of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted January 23, 2006.
Effective February 1, 2006, without the signature of the Mayor.

By Council Members Conwell and

An emergency resolution opposing
the government-backed violence in
Darfur, Sudan which seeks to rid
Darfur of African tribes by encouraging violence against such African
tribes as a way of forcing them from
Darfur, Sudan, and further, urging
the United States government to intervene through legislative measures
and
by
sending
a
international
peacekeeping force with the ability
to protect civilians and urging the
City to disinvest any financial interest it may have in the Sudan.
Whereas, since February, 2003, a
government-backed militia known
as Janjaweed has been engaging in
a systematic program of expulsion,
rape and murderous violence in Darfur, Sudan; and
Whereas, Janjaweed has allegedly ordered all its commanders and
security officers to “change the
demography of Darfur and make it
void of African tribes”; and
Whereas, the government-backed
Janjaweed has also encouraged
“killing, burning villages, farms,
terrorizing
people,
confiscating
property from members of African
tribes and forcing them from Darfur”; and
Whereas, attacks on civilians continue, in violation of United Nations
resolutions
and
ceasefire
agreements; and
Whereas, this violence also threatens United Nations and non-governmental aid workers, many organizations of which have downscaled or
ceased
operations
in
dangerous
areas; and
Whereas, millions of Darfurians
remain reliant on international aid
for survival, while the escalating
violence has made such aid almost
impossible to deliver; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby opposes the government-backed
violence in Darfur, Sudan which
seeks to rid Darfur of African tribes
by encouraging violence against
such African tribes as a way of forcing them from Darfur, Sudan.
Section 2. That, further, this
Council urges the United States
government to intervene through

February 1, 2006
legislative measures and by sending a international peacekeeping
force with the ability to protect
civilians.
Section 3. That, this Council also
urges the City to disinvest any
financial interest it may have in the
Sudan.
Section 4. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit

Annan, U.N. Secretary General, the

An emergency resolution urging
Governor Taft to veto Ohio Senate
Bill 82 which prohibits political subdivisions from requiring their permanent full-time employees to reside
in any specific area of the state as
such bill violates the right of local
self government which is afforded
the citizens of a charter municipality under the Ohio Constitution.
Whereas, on January 18, 2006, the
Ohio General Assembly, ignoring
the Constitution of the State of Ohio,
and with reckless disregard of the
Constitutional
right
of
charter
municipalities in the State of Ohio
to govern themselves, passed Senate
Bill 82; and
Whereas, a municipality’s right to
invoke residency requirements for
its employees is not a matter of
statewide concern or a matter where
the state has a predominant interest; and
Whereas, the power of local selfgovernment includes the ability of a
municipality to provide for the
structure and organization of its
government, and to require city residency as a condition of employment; and
Whereas, in 1982, the citizens of
the City of Cleveland voted to
amend their Charter to require
employees of the City to be bona
fide residents of the City and
remain residents during their terms
of employment; and
Whereas, the passage of S.B. 82 is
an attempt to legislatively override
the will of the voters of the City of
Cleveland; and
Whereas, Senate Bill 82 is unconstitutional as it directly conflicts
with a municipality’s home rule
powers; and
Whereas, in passing S.B. 82, the
Ohio General Assembly fell victim
to political pandering and violated
their oath to uphold the Ohio Constitution; and
Whereas, Senate Bill 82 is part of
a continuing attempt by the Ohio
General Assembly to eliminate the
right of the citizens of charter
municipalities in Ohio to adopt a

The City Record
charter and to exercise the all powers of local self government; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges Governor Taft to veto Ohio
Senate Bill 82 which prohibits political subdivisions from requiring
their permanent full-time employees
to reside in any specific area of the
state, as such bill violates the right
of local self government which is
afforded the citizens of a charter
municipality under the Ohio Constitution.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to Governor Bob
Taft, the President of the Ohio
Municipal League, the Cuyahoga
County Mayors and Managers Association, the Northeast Ohio Mayors
and Managers Association, and the
members of the National League of
Cities.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period

An emergency resolution calling
on the United States government to
state formally that the United States
does not intend to keep permanent
military bases in Iraq and will
allow the Iraqi government to freely
determine its economic future and
use of its oil resources, to immediately begin a humane, orderly and
comprehensive withdrawal of United
States military personnel and bases
from Iraq, to couple the withdrawal
with negotiations with all relevant
Iraqi parties in order to minimize
concomitant or ensuing violence,
and to provide full benefits to
American soldiers who have served
in Iraq.
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
supports the brave men and women
deployed in Iraq; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
honors the memory of those men
and women who have died serving
their country in the Iraq War and
the families who have lost loved
ones; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
agrees with the statement of Congressman John Murtha (Democrat,
Pennsylvania): “the threat posed by
terrorism is real, but we have other
threats that cannot be ignored the
future of our military is at risk the
burden of this war has not been
shared equally; the military and
their families are shouldering this
burden”; and
Whereas, our families have paid a
heavy price for the United States’
involvement in Iraq with the deaths
of more than 2,200 our sons and
daughters serving in the United
States military, the wounding and
disabling of more than 16,000 American troops and the deaths of more
than 30,000 Iraqi civilians; and
Whereas, many Cleveland families
have
suffered
grievous
loss
or
injury to their kin serving in Iraq;
and
Whereas, more than $200 billion
has been appropriated to fund the
Iraq War and reconstruction operations; and
Whereas, Cleveland’s share of
these funds could have provided
1000 extra school teachers, 300 public safety officers, health insurance
for 14,000 uninsured adults and
Head Start for 8,500 children; and
Whereas, despite statements by
the Bush Administration that we
must “stay the course” for fear of
chaos
after
withdrawal,
many
respected polls show that the majority of Iraqi Sunnis and Shiites, who
know their country best and who
have the most to lose from such
chaos, oppose the American occupation and want us to leave Iraq, and
the leaders for all Iraq now support
a timetable for American withdrawal; and
Whereas, Iraqis at the recent
Cairo conference appeared to be
ready to negotiate reduction of violence and suppression of foreign terrorists in return for an American
exit, Sunni security and a fair share
of power and resources; and
Whereas, the recent Iraqi elections should allow the people of Iraq
to take responsibility for establishing a government and an economy
of their own choosing, and to ensure
that the rights and safety of minorities are protected; and

The City Record

32
Whereas, every day of continued
occupation of Iraq increases distrust
of the United States in much of the
world and fuels recruitment of and
serves as a training ground for terrorists; and
Whereas, in Resolution No. 100-03,
adopted January 27, 2003, this Council opposed this war as unnecessary
before it began and the Administration’s major reasons for going to
war have been proven false; and
Whereas, United States Representatives Stephanie Tubbs Jones and
Dennis Kucinich, who represent our
city in Congress, have vigorously
opposed the Iraq War; and
Whereas, the Iraq War has distracted this country from its real priorities in providing international
security and domestic health care,
economic development, education and
security for all U.S. citizens; and
Whereas, members of the 9/11
Commission have publicly stated
that the United States is at great
risk for more terrorist attacks because
Congress
and
the
White

House have failed to enact several
strong security measures; and
Whereas, such security measures
include improving communication
among emergency responders and
shifting federal terrorism-fighting
money to the areas most at risk; and
Whereas, almost 200 American
cities, including Chicago, Baltimore,
Philadelphia
and
Gary,
Indiana
have passed resolutions similar to
