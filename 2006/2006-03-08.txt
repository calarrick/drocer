An emergency resolution supporting reauthorization of the federal
Ryan White CARE Act, under which
the United States supports medical
and other social services for 571,000
poor, underinsured, and uninsured
people with HIV/AIDS in the United States — including thousands of
individuals in Ohio, Cuyahoga County, and the City of Cleveland, and
urging such reauthorization to be in
a manner that results in just and
equitable distribution of funding
based on accurate counts of persons
living with HIV/AIDS, and that
fully takes into account the impact
local economic conditions have on a
region’s ability to help people gain
access to HIV/AIDS care and treatment.
Whereas, since 1990 the Ryan
White CARE Act has been the payer
of last resort for primary medical
and ancillary support services for
poor, uninsured, and underinsured
people with HIV/AIDS in the United States; and
Whereas, the availability of Ryan
White CARE Act resources has literally meant the difference between
life and death for individuals who
would not otherwise be able to
access the services they need; and
Whereas, the availability of Ryan
White CARE Act resources has
helped thousands of Cleveland and
Cuyahoga County residents achieve
significantly improved medical status and greater independence; and
Whereas, the Ryan White CARE
Act has expired, and is currently
being financed by continuing budget resolutions; and
Whereas, the US Congress is set
to consider reauthorization of the
Ryan White CARE Act in late
March or early April; and
Whereas, since the Ryan White
CARE Act was last reauthorized in
2000, the number of HIV/AIDS cases
nationally, regionally, and locally
has continued to climb, even as
Ryan White CARE Act resources
have remained flat; and, impact that
poverty, unemployment, homelessness, and other
Whereas, poverty, unemployment,
homelessness, and other economic
conditions have a great impact on
the ability of a region to help people with HIV/AIDS gain access to
and remain within comprehensive

March 8, 2006
systems of HIV/AIDS care and
treatment; and
Whereas, the current funding formula results in an inequitable distribution of Ryan White CARE Act
resources across the United States,
leaving Ohio and cities within Ohio,
with fewer resources per patient
than other regions of the country;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this council supports the reauthorization of the federal Ryan White CARE Act, under

Adopted February 27, 2006.
Effective March 3, 2006.

should be afforded equal protection
under the law, and that sexual orientation is not a standard by which
to measure whether a person will be
a good parent; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that H.B. 515 is discriminatory and

Res. No. 328-06.
By Council Members Zone, Santiago,
Cimperman, Britt, Westbrook, Brancatelli, White, Cleveland, Coats, Kelley, Cummins, Brady and Sweeney.
An emergency resolution opposing
proposed
House
Bill
515
which
would amend Ohio law to prohibit
an adoptive or foster child from
being placed in the private residence of a homosexual, bisexual, or
transgender person.
Whereas, on February 9, 2006,
State Representative Ron Hood introduced the “Adoptive and Foster
Children’s
Protection
Act”
(H.B.
515); and
Whereas, H.B. 515 would prohibit
adoptions and foster parenting by
gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people in Ohio; and
Whereas, H.B. 515 would also
deny adoption or foster parenting to
a household where any “individual
who is a homosexual, bi sexual, or
transgender individual” lives — including another child; and
Whereas, H.B. 515 would require
courts to determine the sexual orientation and gender identity of
prospective parents and directs the
Department of Job and Family Services to promulgate rules and procedures to carry this out; and
Whereas, the proposed bill attempts to legislatively circumvent
the Ohio Supreme Court-established
“best interest of the child” adoption
standard used since 1990; and
Whereas, this Council commends
House
Speaker
Jon
Husted
for
ensuring that the bill remains on
the “back burner”, at least for now;
and

requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;

An emergency resolution supporting Ohio House Bill 482 which
requires any physical fitness facility in the state to place within the
facility an automatic external defibrillator, requires the facility to have
at least one employee trained in use
of a defibrillator present at the
facility during operating hours, and
grants civil immunity to any person
who performs automated external
defibrillation in good faith.
Whereas, for several years now,
the City of Cleveland has placed
automated external defibrillators at
each elevator bank on every floor of
Cleveland City Hall, as well as on
location at each of its recreation
centers; and
Whereas, currently in Ohio, physical fitness facilities are not required to have automated external
defibrillators on location; and
Whereas,
it
is
reasonable
to
assume that one of the most important places to have an automated
external defibrillator is at a physical fitness facility, as it is at such
places that people exercise, increasing their heart rates and blood pressure, thus increasing their risk of
heart attacks; and
Whereas, this Council is aware of
at least one death due to a heart
attack that occurred at a physical
fitness facility, which likely could
have been avoided had an automatic external defibrillator been at the
facility and had someone trained to
use it been available; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports Ohio House Bill 482
which requires any physical fitness
facility in the state to place within
the facility an automatic external
defibrillator, requires the facility to
have at least one employee trained
in use of a defibrillator present at
the facility during operating hours,
and grants civil immunity to any
person
who
performs
automated
external defibrillation in good faith.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to all members of the Ohio legislature representing Cuyahoga County.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency

the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

An emergency resolution supporting the introduction, passage and
enactment of federal relief legislation providing for legal permanent
residency and/or naturalization and
United States citizenship for Manuel
Bartsch.

40
Whereas, it has come before the
Council of the City of Cleveland that
Manuel Bartsch, of Gilboa, Ohio, is
an 18 year old high school senior
and has resided in the State of Ohio
for nearly ten years, after having
been brought to the United States as
a young child by his step-grandfather; and
Whereas, Manuel Bartsch’s legal
guardian took no responsible steps
to legalize Manuel’s immigration
status so he could lawfully remain
in the United States; and
Whereas,
Manuel
Bartsch
has
attended the Pandora-Gilboa High
School in Pandora, Ohio and expects
to graduate in May, 2006; and
Whereas,
Manuel
Bartsch
has
been accepted for admission to the
University of Northwestern Ohio
School of Business; and
Whereas, Manuel Bartsch, on his
own initiative, sought the counsel
and assistance of the Department of
Homeland Security (“DHS”), and the
United States Citizenship and Immigration Services “(USCIS”) to clarify his immigration status; and
Whereas, Manuel Bartsch’s request for assistance to the USCIS
ultimately resulted in his arrest and
detention by U. S. Immigration and
Customs Enforcement (“ICE”); and
Whereas, ICE ultimately released
Manuel Bartsch from custody but
continues to vigorously pursue his
deportation from the United States;
and
Whereas,
Manuel
Bartsch
has
spent the formative years of his life
living and attending school in Ohio
and because other special humanitarian circumstances exist in this
case;
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports the introduction, passage and enactment of federal relief
legislation providing for legal permanent residency and/or naturalization and United States citizenship
for Manuel Bartsch.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to U.S. Senators Mike DeWine and George
Voinovich and all members of the
Ohio delegation.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency

felons of 11 million undocumented
immigrants, criminalize contact with
undocumented immigrants and frustrate the dreams of legal immigrants seeking citizenship.

The City Record
Whereas, on December 16, 2005,
the U.S. House of Representatives
Border
Protection,
approved
the
Antiterrorism and Illegal Immigration Act, H.R. 4437, also known as
the Sensenbrenner-King Bill; and
Whereas, H.R. 4437 criminalizes
the mere presence of an alien without valid immigration status, thereby causing 11 million undocumented
immigrants currently living and
working in the U.S. to be guilty of
a federal felony; and
Whereas, the Bill’s broad definition of “smuggling” allows the federal government to prosecute almost
any American having casual contact
with an undocumented immigrant;
and
Whereas, H.R. 4437 could potentially make criminals out of church
groups providing food, shelter or
other assistance to undocumented
immigrants, social workers assisting undocumented workers who are
victims of domestic abuse, co-workers giving an undocumented immigrant a ride to work, and a U.S. citizen living with a spouse who is an
undocumented immigrant; and
Whereas, H.R. 4437 eliminates
judicial oversight of delays in the
naturalization process and allows
the federal government to use subjective and secretive information to
bar legal immigrants from becoming
U.S. citizens; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby opposes the “Sensenbrenner-King
Bill”, House Resolution 4437, which
would make felons of 11 million
undocumented immigrants, criminalize
contact
with
undocumented
immigrants
and
frustrate
the
dreams of legal immigrants seeking
citizenship
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to U.S. Senators Mike DeWine and George
Voinovich.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted February 27, 2006.
Effective March 3, 2006.
