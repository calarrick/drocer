Section 3103.09 Unsafe Structures
and Exterior Property Nuisances;
Violations and Remedial Notices;
Cost Recovery
(a) Legislative Findings.
Council of the City of Cleveland
finds that:
(1) Structures that are vacant and
open to entry at doors, windows or
other points accessible to the general public:
A. Attract children to enter;
B. Become harborage for vermin;
C. Serve as temporary abode for
derelicts, vagrants and criminals; and
D. Are likely to be damaged by
vandals or set ablaze by arsonists.
(2) Unkept grounds surrounding
vacant, open structures invite the
dumping of garbage and rubbish;
(3) Thousands of structures in
this City are made of wood-frame
construction
that
is
more
combustible than other building types;
(4) Thousands of structures in
this City are situated on narrow lots
and in close proximity to one

May 17, 2006
another, increasing the risk of conflagration and spread of insect and
rodent infestation;
(5) Population loss and economic
decline experienced by the City in
recent years has caused the incidence of vacant, open structures,
high grass, weeds, junk, debris, and
junk motor vehicles to increase significantly;
(6) Vacant, open structures often
become dilapidated because they are
not repaired by the owners or persons in control of the structures;
(7) Structures that are vacant and
open to entry, high grass, weeds,
junk, debris, and junk motor vehicles depress the market value of
surrounding properties;
(8) The existence of certain hazardous conditions may require a
structure to be vacated; these conditions include but are not limited
to:
A. Danger of structural collapse;
B. Inadequate heat or use of dangerous heating mechanism;
C. Danger of fire; and
D. Lack of plumbing in safe working order.
(9) Structures that remain boarded for an extended period of time
contribute to blight, cause a decrease in neighboring property values, create targets for arson, and
lead to the cancellation of homeowners’ insurance for neighboring
property owners.
(10) The following conditions
provide harborage and breeding
grounds for pests or otherwise create human-health problems:
A. Grass over 8 inches in height.
B. Noxious weeds including Russian, Canadian, or common thistle;
wild lettuce; wild mustard; wild
parsley; ragweed; milk weed; iron
weed; wild plants that can cause
skin reaction upon contact or produce or aggravate hay fever, asthma, allergic respiratory reaction, or
similar conditions; and all other noxious weeds.
C. Refuse, including but not limited to, trash, junk, garbage and
food waste, offal, animal wastes,
tires, and all other waste materials.
D. Stagnant surface water.
(11) As used in this Chapter,
“junk motor vehicle” means a motor
vehicle that meets all of the following criteria:
A. Three model years’ old or older;
B. Apparently inoperable; and
C. Extensively damaged, including, but not limited to, any of the
following: missing wheels, tires,
engine, motor, or transmission. (R.C.
§505.173)
(b) Declaration of Nuisance.
(1) All buildings or structures
that are injurious to or a menace to
the public health, safety or welfare,
or are structurally unsafe, unsanitary or not provided with adequate
safe egress, or constitute a fire hazard, or are vacant and open to public entry, or are otherwise dangerous to human life or injurious to the
public, or in relation to existing use
constitute a hazard to the public
health, safety or welfare by reason
of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence or abandonment, are, severally, for the purposes of this Building Code, declared to
be “unsafe structures.” All unsafe
structures or conditions are declared

The City Record
to be public nuisances. The public
nuisance shall be abated by correction of the violations to the minimum standards of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
applicable City rules and regulations, the Revised Code, and Ohio
Administrative Code, including the
Ohio Building Code, or by demolition.
(2) The conditions listed in division (a)(10) of this section are
declared to be nuisances that shall
be removed, destroyed, or abated
from any property on which they
are found.
(3)
Junk
motor
vehicles
as
defined in division (a)(11) of this
section are declared to be nuisances
that shall be removed or abated
from any property on which they
are found. Junk motor vehicles are
declared to be a nuisance because:
A. They harbor rodents, vermin,
and other pests;
B. They contain toxic substances
and flammable liquids and fumes;
C. They attract children to enter;
D. They serve as temporary abode
for derelicts, vagrants and criminals;
E.
They
diminish
neighboring
property values; and
F. They are likely to be damaged
by vandals or set ablaze by arsonists.
(c) Effective Boarding Pending
Rehabilitation.
(1) Permits. Pending the correction of the violations to the minimum standards of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
applicable City rules and regulations, the Revised Code, and the
Ohio Administrative Code, including
the Ohio Building Code, the owner
of a structure may secure the structure through effective boarding. In
order to effectively board the structure, the owner of the structure
shall apply, within 3 days of receiving a notice of violation, to the
Department of Building and Housing for a permit to board. The
Department of Building and Housing shall review the condition of the
structure, determine if it can be
effectively boarded, and grant or
deny the owner’s permit to board,
setting forth special requirements, if
any, necessary for compliance with
minimum standards for effective
boarding. The owner shall effectively board the structure within 3
days of the issuance of a boarding
permit, or within any other time
limit that the Director deems appropriate. Structures that are boarded
without first obtaining a boarding
permit or structures that do not comply with the boarding permit shall
continue to be considered public nuisances subject to demolition. Within
thirty (30) days of the issuance of
a permit to board, the owner of the
structure shall apply for a rehabilitation permit under Section 3105.06
of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976. The Director may
grant an extension of time for
acquiring a rehabilitation permit on
the owner’s written request and for
good cause shown. Failure of the
owner to obtain a rehabilitation permit after effective boarding will
result in the structure being deemed
a public nuisance, and scheduled for
demolition.

915

21
(2) Materials. The effective boarding of a structure shall include, but
not be limited to, doors, windows, or
other areas of the structure open to
ingress and egress and to weather
elements at any and all levels of the
structure. The openings shall be
secured by plywood, not less than
1/2" thick, or other material of
equal strength, cut and fit into the
openings. Openings in excess of
forty-eight inches wide shall be
framed with 2" x 4" lumber and plywood, or equivalent material fastened twenty-four inches on center
onto frame. The plywood or equivalent material shall be fastened into
the openings by screw type nails or
lag screws.
(3) Maintenance. Upon effectively
boarding the structure, the owner
shall monitor and maintain the
structure and its surrounding premises in a safe, sanitary and secured
condition. Any portion of the exterior structure that is deemed to be
potentially hazardous due to deteriorated conditions, or to be structurally unsound, shall be removed or
treated in a manner so as to eliminate
the
hazard.
The
exterior
premises shall be maintained free of
high weeds, debris, junk vehicles,
and conditions that may provide
harborage for rodents. Failure of
the owner to properly maintain the
building in the above condition, will
result in the structure being deemed
a public nuisance, and scheduled for
demolition.
(4) Rehabilitation. Rehabilitation
of the structure shall begin within
30 days of receiving a rehabilitation
permit under Section 3105.06 of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976 unless the time period is
extended with permission from the
Director. If rehabilitation of the
effectively boarded structure does
not begin within this time period, or
if the rehabilitation permit is otherwise invalidated or revoked, then
the Director may declare that the
nuisance has not been abated and
schedule the structure for demolition.
(d) Examination and Condemnation.
(1) The Director is authorized to
examine or cause to be examined
every building or other structure
reported to be unsafe or damaged or
injurious to or a menace to the public, and shall make a written record
of the examination.
(2) The Director may designate as
a public nuisance those particular
structures or conditions found to be
unsafe under division (b) of this
section.
(3)
The
Director
may
also
declare that a nuisance structure
which, due to its advanced state of
dilapidation, substantial fire damage or structural infirmity, is an
immediate hazard to human life or
health, may only be abated by
immediate repair and rehabilitation
to the minimum standards of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, applicable City rules
and regulations, the Revised Code,
and
Ohio
Administrative
Code,
including the Ohio Building Code,
or by demolition.
(4) Whenever the Director finds a
vacant structure open to entry at

22
doors, windows or other points
accessible to the general public, he
may cause the structure to be
secured at those points of entry. The
Director shall be authorized at any
time to enter the premises to secure
the structure in order to lessen the
severity of the public nuisance. In
securing the structure, the Director
may call any department, division or
bureau of the City for whatever
assistance may be necessary, or
may, by private contract, secure
such structure. This securing shall
not be deemed to constitute “effective boarding” under division (b) of
this section, and it does not abate
the nuisance condition of an unsafe
structure, as declared under division
(d)(2) of this section, unless so
declared in writing by the Director.
Later notice, issued under division
(e)(1) below, shall include the fact
that the Director has found it necessary to take appropriate action to
secure the structure.
(e) Notice of Violation.
(1) Whenever the Director finds a
building, structure or a portion of
those to be unsafe and determines it
or the property on which it is located to be a public nuisance as
defined in this Chapter, he shall forward by certified mail to the owner,
agent or person in control of the
building, structure or portion and to
any mortgagee of record a written
notice
of
violation
stating
the
defects in the building or structure.
The notice of violation shall require
the owner within a stated time to
abate the nuisance condition of the
building or structure by correction
of the violations and defects to the
minimum standards of the Codified
Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
applicable City rules and regulations, the Revised Code, and Ohio
Administrative Code, including the
Ohio Building Code, or by demolition and removal of the building,
structure, or a portion of those. The
notice also shall state that if the
nuisance is not abated within the
required time that the Director may
take appropriate action to repair,
remove, or otherwise abate the public nuisance and that the owner,
agent or person in control shall be
responsible for the costs. The handing of the violation notice to the
owner, agent or person in control of
the building, structure or a portion
of those shall be deemed actual
notice and is legal and valid service
and no other form of service is necessary.
(2) If the person to whom the
notice and order is addressed is not
found after a reasonable and diligent search, then the notice and
order shall be sent by certified mail
to his tax mailing address, if available, as indicated on the County tax
duplicate, and a copy of the notice
shall be posted in a conspicuous
place on the premises to which it
relates. The mailing and posting
shall be deemed legal service of the
notice.
(3) An owner, agent or person in
control of the structure or building,
a mortgagee of record, or a lien
holder of record who has received a
notice of violation or a notice to
make corrections to the minimum

The City Record
nances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
applicable City rules and regulations, the Revised Code, and Ohio
Administrative Code, including the
Ohio Building Code, or to demolish
and remove, as provided for in this
section, shall inform prospective
purchasers, vendees, grantees, assignees, lessees, or land contractees
of the notice of violation or the
notice to make corrections, or to
demolish and remove. No person
shall transfer to a vendee, grantee,
assignee, lessee, land contractee or
any other transferee any interest in
a building, structure or a portion of
those after receiving a notice of violation to make corrections, or to
demolish and remove the same,
without first providing the transferee with a copy of the notice.
(4) A. No person, agent, firm or
corporation shall sell, by land contract or otherwise, any interest in
any structure or building without
furnishing the buyer, prior to the
sale a copy of any outstanding
notice or order from the City, including any notice of violation or any
outstanding notice to make corrections to the minimum standards of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio 1976, applicable City rules
and regulations, the Revised Code,
including the Ohio Building Code, or
any outstanding notice to demolish
and remove.
No buyer or grantee, by land contract or otherwise, shall obtain any
interest in any structure or building
without obtaining from the seller,
prior
to
sale,
the
documents
described above.
B. No person, agent, firm or corporation acting in the capacity of an
escrow agent in any real estate
transaction involving the sale of a
structure or building situated in the
City,
shall
disburse
any
funds
unless the provisions of this division
have been met.
C. Any buyer or grantee, by land
contract or otherwise, of a structure
or building, shall begin at the date
of transfer to comply with any
notice or order obtained or to be
obtained under this division and,
within ten days of the date of transfer, shall notify the Director, in writing, of the actions that will be taken
to comply. The Director may then
establish a reasonable time to comply.
(f) Vacating Buildings and Prohibiting Use. The Director may
also require in the notice issued
under division (e)(1) of this section that the building, structure or
a portion of those be vacated, not
be reoccupied, or used until the
specified repairs and improvements
are
completed,
inspected,
and
approved by the Director. The
Director may cause to be posted at
each entrance to the building or
structure
a
notice
as
follows:
“THIS STRUCTURE IS IN A DANGEROUS CONDITION AND HAS
BEEN CONDEMNED AND ITS USE
HAS BEEN PROHIBITED BY THE
DIRECTOR OF BUILDING AND
HOUSING.” The notice shall remain
posted until the required corrections are made or demolition is
completed. No person shall remove
the notice without written permission of the Director, nor shall any

916

May 17, 2006
person use or enter the building or
structure except for the purpose of
making the required corrections or
demolishing or effectively boarding
the building or structure, or securing the structure under division
(d)(4) of this section.
(g) Right to Appeal. The owner,
agent or person in control shall
have a right to appeal from the
notice and decision of the Director
as provided in this section and
appear before the Board of Building
Standards and Building Appeals at
a specified time and place to show
cause why he should not comply
with the notice. Any notice served
by the Director shall automatically
become a final order if a written
notice of appeal before the Board is
not filed in the office of the Board
within the time set forth in the
notice from the Director. In the
absence of an appeal, all actions
taken shall constitute a valid exercise of the police powers of the City
of Cleveland.
(h) Noncompliance with Notice.
(1) Director Authorized To Demolish, Remove, or Abate. In case
the owner, agent or person in control fails, neglects or refuses to comply with the notice to repair or
rehabilitate, or to demolish and
remove a public nuisance or unsafe
building, structure or a portion of
those, the Director may take appropriate
action
to
demolish
and
remove an unsafe structure or to
remove or abate any condition that
is defined as a nuisance under this
Chapter.
(2) Action by Director of Law.
The Director may advise the Director of Law of the facts in the case,
who
may
institute
appropriate
action in the court to cause correction of the violations and defects, or
demolition and removal, or effective
boarding of the building or structure pending rehabilitation.
(3) Rehabilitation Permits Not
Bar To Director’s Action To Abate.
The securing of rehabilitation permits for the building or structure
shall not in and of itself bar the
Director from taking action to abate
the nuisance.
(4) Effective Boarding by Director. The Director may, with respect
to any condemned structure, also
take appropriate action to effectively board the structure, or to
secure it under division (d)(4) of
this section. The Director shall
specifically state in writing his
findings with respect to the structure, and shall determine whether
to secure or to effectively board,
based
on
factors
which
may
include the following: the distance
of the structure from neighboring
structures, the type of structure,
the extent to which the structure is
secured, the likelihood of vandalism or arson, the extent of the deterioration, the economic likelihood
of eventual rehabilitation of the
structure, or cost of securing or
effectively boarding the structure.
Failure
To
Comply
with
(5)
Notice. In case the owner, agent or
person in control fails, neglects or
refuses to comply with the notice to
repair or rehabilitate, or to demolish
and remove a public nuisance or
unsafe building, structure or a por-

May 17, 2006
tion of those, or to remove or abate
any other condition that is defined
as a nuisance under this Chapter,
the Director may take appropriate
action to take repair or maintenance
measures or to otherwise abate the
public nuisance. The Director shall
specifically state in writing the
findings with respect to the structure, and shall determine whether to
perform
repair
or
maintenance
based on factors which may include
the following: the distance of the
structure from neighboring structures, the type of structure, the
extent of deterioration, the likelihood of vandalism or arson, the economic likelihood of eventual complete rehabilitation of the structure,
the cost of repair or maintenance.
(6) Notice of Intent To Demolish.
Except as provided in division (i) of
this section, the Director shall give
written notice informing the owner,
agent, or person in control, mortgagee of record and lien holders of
record of the City’s intention to
demolish and remove the unsafe
building or structure at least 30
days before the intended action by
the City. The notice may be effective concurrently with the violation
notice. A condemned structure, once
effectively boarded by the owner
pending rehabilitation that later
becomes open to entry, may then be
demolished and removed, subject to
the Director giving written notice as
stated in divisions (e)(1) and (h) of
this section, upon a finding by the
Director that the structure can no
longer be effectively boarded.
(i) Junk Motor Vehicle Removal.
(1) Notice. The Director shall send
written notice, by certified mail
with return receipt requested, to the
person having the right of possession of the property on which a junk
motor vehicle, as defined in this
Chapter, is left. This notice shall
notify the person having right of
possession of the property that within ten days of mailing of the notice,
the junk motor vehicle either shall
be covered by being housed in a
garage or other suitable structure or
removed from the property. The
notice shall also be posted in a conspicuous place on the property.
(2) Director Authorized To Remove Junk Motor Vehicles. The
Director is authorized to provide for
and order the removal of a junk
motor vehicle when the junk motor
vehicle has not been either covered
by being housed in a garage or
other suitable structure or removed
from the property, within ten days
of the date of mailing and posting
of the notice as set forth above.
(j) Cases of Emergency. In cases
of emergency that, in the opinion
of the Director, involve immediate
danger to human life or health, the
Director shall promptly cause the
building, structure or a portion of
those to be made safe or removed.
For this purpose he may at once
enter the structure or land on
which it stands, or any abutting
land or structure, with assistance

should remain in the law; and
Whereas, when sufficient signatures are obtained and the measure
goes to a vote on November 7, 2006,
then the electors of the State of Ohio
will decide whether the provisions
that limit or eliminate workers’
rights stay in the law or not; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby
opposes those provisions of Amended
Substitute Senate Bill 7 relating to
the Ohio Workers’ Compensation Law
that are detrimental to workers and
supports the efforts of those seeking

An emergency resolution calling
upon the President of the United
States and the United States Congress to extend the deadline until
the end of the year, and eliminate
the penalty to sign up for a Medicare prescription drug program.

May 17, 2006
Whereas, the deadline for seniors
to sign up for a Medicare drug plan
is midnight tonight, May 15, 2006;
and
Whereas, under the law, Medicare
beneficiaries who do not sign up for
a drug plan by the May 15th deadline must wait until November 15th
to sign up and will pay a penalty
of 1 percent of their monthly premium per month for each month
delayed; and
Whereas, the Medicare plan has
dozens of prescription drug plans
from which to choose, making it
extremely
confusing
for
many
seniors to try to figure out which
plan is best; and
Whereas, the law is so confusing
for seniors that more time is needed for them to get an adequate
understanding of the drug plans
offered; and
Whereas, as of two days ago,
more than 10 million seniors have
not yet enrolled, including almost
half-million in Ohio; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby calls upon the President of the
United States and the United States
Congress to extend the deadline
until the end of the year and eliminate the penalty to sign up for a
Medicare prescription drug program.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
the President of the United States
Senators DeWine and Voinovich and
all U.S. Representatives from Ohio.

it shall take effect and be in force

By Council Members Zone and
Sweeney (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Public Utilities
to enter into a competitive response
water service agreement with Portage County; and authorizing the
Director of Finance to enter into an
economic development agreement or
agreements for the purpose of mitigating economic impacts to Cleveland’s General Fund relating to the
City’s extension of water service to
the City of Aurora and other areas
within Portage County.
Whereas,
the
City
of
Aurora
solicited competing proposals from
the City of Cleveland and Portage
County to provide water service to
the residents and businesses of
Aurora; and
Whereas, the parties have agreed
in principle to an arrangement
where Cleveland will supply water
to Portage County under a master
meter water service agreement for
supply to Aurora and other areas
within Portage County; and
Whereas, the service area under
the Water Service Agreement shall
be Portage County within the Great
Lakes Watershed; and
Whereas, Section 535.08 of the
Codified Ordinances of the City of
Cleveland,
1976,
authorizes
the
Director of Public Utilities to enter
into competitive response water service agreements to meet competition
from alternative water suppliers;
and
Whereas, the City wishes to enter
into a competitive response water
service agreement to increase its
customer base and provide future
opportunities for water service to
the area surrounding the City of
Aurora; and
Whereas, retaining existing water
customers and adding new customers through the expansion of the
Division of Water’s service area
increases the rate base, promotes
rate stability, minimizes the need
for future rate increases, and improves the Division of Water’s bond
credit rating, to the benefit of all
Division of Water customers and
bondholders; and
Whereas, the expansion of water
service outside the City creates
opportunities for economic development in suburban communities by
enabling businesses to locate in that
community that might otherwise
have chosen to locate within the
City; and

May 17, 2006
Whereas, as a condition of providing water service, the City wishes to enter into an agreement with
Portage County and, if appropriate,
the City of Aurora to mitigate economic impacts to Cleveland’s General Fund from such expansion; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council finds
that entering into a competitive
response water service agreement
for service to Aurora and other
areas of Portage County is necessary to meet competition from alternative water sources and is in the
best interests of the Division of
Water, its customers, and bondholders in that it will preserve and

An emergency resolution supporting H.R. 5054, the “Rebuilding America’s Infrastructure” bill.
Whereas, United States citizens
complain about the state of America’s public capital: about dilapidated
school
buildings,
condemned
highway
bridges,
contaminated
water supplies, and other shortcomings of the public infrastructure;
and
Whereas, in addition to inflicting
inconvenience
and
endangering
health, the inadequacy of the public
infrastructure adversely affects productivity and the growth of the
economy since public investment,
private investment and productivity
are intimately linked; and
Whereas, for over 2 decades the
United States government has retreated from public investment; and
Whereas, state and local governments, albeit to a lesser extent, have
also slowed public investments and
state and local taxpayers are frequently reluctant to approve bond
issues to finance public infrastructure; and
Whereas, in the early 1970s, nondefense public investment accounted
for about 3.2% of gross domestic
product; now it accounts for only
2.5%; and
Whereas, widespread neglect of
maintenance has contributed substantially to the failure of the stock
of public capital assets to keep pace
with the nation’s needs; and
Whereas, net of depreciation, the
real nondefense public capital stock
expanded in the past 2 decades at a
pace only half that set earlier in the
post World War II period; and
Whereas, evidence of failures to
maintain and improve infrastructure
is seen every day in such problems
as unsafe bridges, urban decay,
dilapidated
and
over-crowded
schools and inadequate airports; and
Whereas, the state departments of
education collected data that reveals

The City Record

at least $300,000,000,000 worth of
unmet school infrastructure needs;
and
Whereas, H.R. 5054 will help the
nation take a significant step forward both in overcoming its infrastructure deficit and in promoting
the productivity needed to meet the
competitive challenges of the 21st
century; and
Whereas, H.R. 5054 represents fiscally sound planning and, in salient
ways, advances sound fiscal and
monetary operations; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
