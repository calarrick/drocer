FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES REFERRED
Ord. No. 928-A-05 (As a substitute
for Ord. No. 928-05).
By Council Members Zone and
Westbrook.
An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting
new Section 394.071 relating to
transporting hazardous materials by
rail car prohibited on Cleveland’s
Lakefront Rail Line.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
supplemented by enacting new Section 394.071, to read as follows:
Section 394.071 Transporting Hazardous Materials by Rail Car Prohibited on Cleveland’s Lakefront
Rail Line
(a) This Council finds and declares the following:
(1) The volume of rail traffic per
day on the Norfolk Southern Lakefront Rail Line (“Lakefront Rail
Line”) in Cleveland is over 50 trains,
approximately 80% of which carry
hazardous materials;
(2) The total daytime population,
including workplace, school and
child care population, is significantly denser by approximately three
times, along Cleveland’s Lakefront
Rail Line than the CSX Short Line;
(3) Cleveland’s critical infrastructure including water intake, wastewater treatment, and electric facilities, is predominantly along the
Lakefront Rail Line;
(4) Cleveland’s assembly and critical government structures, including the Brown’s Stadium, the Cleveland Convention Center, museums,
courthouses, City Hall, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation building, are predominantly along the
Lakefront Rail Line;
(5) The recommended distance for
initial isolation and evacuation in
the event of a hazardous cargo
release in a serious railroad incident

August 16, 2006
extends from a few hundred feet to
several miles, potentially requiring
the evacuation or shelter-in-place of
many thousands of people in downtown Cleveland and other densely
populated areas along the Lakefront
Rail Line;
(6)The release and/or ignition of
several types of the most commonly
shipped hazardous cargo on the
Lakefront Rail Line, could result in
the release of toxic materials for
several miles and into Lake Erie;
(7) Any evacuation could be hampered by the inability to evacuate to
the north, where Lake Erie and the
Lakefront Rail Line are located;
(8) The topography and transportation infrastructure along the
Lakefront
Rail
Line,
including
bridges and tunnels, present more
characteristics than the CSX Short
Line that increase the likelihood of
accidents
and
make
emergency
response more difficult; and
(9) That prohibiting certain hazardous materials along the Lakefront Rail Line would not prohibit
them from being transported on the
CSX Short Line as an alternative
and does not unreasonably burden
interstate commerce because feasible alternative routes are available.
(b) Council also finds:
(1) The Cuyahoga County Local
Emergency Planning Committee has
recommend an alternate rail route to
the Lakefront Rail Line that traverses less population sections of
the Cleveland metropolitan area and
would dramatically reduce the consequences of a potential accidental
release;
(2) The alternate rail route would
require minimal capital expenditures on the part of the rail road
companies;
(3) That the alternate rail route
more closely follows the mandatory
routes for the through shipment of
hazardous materials by motor carrier on highways as ordered by the

and
otherwise
improved,
through use of an ornamental base
or frame, a streamlined support
structure, or similar features effective in improving the appearance of
the site. At a minimum, evergreen
shrubs, at least three (3) feet in
height at the time of planting and
four (4) feet in height after two (2)
growing seasons, shall be planted at
maximum intervals of four (4) feet
along any side of the base of the
billboard oriented toward a public
street. Such planting shall extend at
least the full width of the billboard
panel. In addition, all portions of the
parcel(s) of land on which the billboard site is located shall be planted with grass or other suitable vegetative ground cover between the
billboard and all public streets abutting the parcel(s).
(2) Degree of Nonconformity. The
new or reconstructed billboard shall
be no greater in size, height, number
of panels, or any panel dimension
than is the existing billboard, nor
shall the new or reconstructed billboard be less conforming to any zoning regulation than is the existing
billboard, except that a panel or sign
face may be added to the back of a
billboard where previously there had
been no panel or sign face.
(3) Location. The new or reconstructed billboard shall be placed in
precisely the same location as the
existing billboard unless the City
Planning Commission determines that
a different location on the same parcel of land would be more effective
in meeting the intent of the sign regulations, as stated in Section 350.01.
(4) Sign Type. With respect to the
“sign types” defined in division (f) of
Section 350.03, the new or reconstructed billboard shall be the same
type as the existing billboard unless
the City Planning Commission determines that a different sign type
would be more compatible with the
subject property or nearby properties.
(5) Changeable Copy. The new or
reconstructed billboard may incorporate automatic changeable copy
only if such copy is limited to a single billboard panel or two back-toback billboard panels and only if
each such panel replaces two or
more billboard panels on a single
parcel of property or two or more
billboard panels on adjacent properties.
The
replacement
billboard
panel shall not be larger than any
of the billboard panels it is replacing. In the case of a sign utilizing
changeable
copy,
each
message

26
shall remain fixed for at least eight
(8) seconds.

guaranteed by the manufacturer to
last at least 10 years before weather causes the paint to deteriorate.
The paint shall be a solid color that
is consistent with the color of the

described in the approved permit
application so long as fewer than
six wall murals are on display
simultaneously within the Central
Business District or the portion of
the Flats-Oxbow Business Revitalization District that is north of the
Detroit-Superior Bridge and east of

construed as signifying all approvals required by this section. All
permits and applications for permits
authorized by this section shall be
in the name of the person in control
of the display. Such permits shall
convey to such person all rights and
privileges prescribed by this section,
which may be assigned, and impose
upon such person all duties prescribed by this section, which may

period of six months. It shall not be
re-erected
or
replaced
without
obtaining a new permit pursuant to
this section.
(7) The City shall keep a permanent record of all permits issued for
wall murals including dates and
times of issuance, which shall be
available for public inspection and
copying.
(8) Change or Replacement of Display. A change or replacement of a
display shall not require a permit or
any other approval by the City.
However, a change of material or
method of attachment to the building or wall surface shall be deemed
a replacement of the wall mural,
requiring a new permit, unless such
change is authorized by Section
350.19 of this Zoning Code.
(h)
Standards for Determining
Whether To Issue Permit for Wall
Murals. An application for a permit
to erect or replace a wall mural shall
be granted if the wall mural as proposed satisfies the criteria of this sec-

1469

27
tion. Such criteria are in lieu of the
standards and guidelines prescribed
and authorized elsewhere in the Codified Ordinances for a permit, certificate of appropriateness, or other
approval by any agency or official of
the City except those set forth in the
Building Code addressing structures
and materials for signs.
For those geographic areas where
the City Planning Commission has
jurisdiction as set out in the Codified Ordinances, a permit shall not
be issued unless the City Planning
Commission determines that all of
the following are satisfied. For
those areas where the Landmarks
Commission has jurisdiction as set
out in the Codified Ordinances, a
permit shall not be issued unless the
City
Planning
Commission
determines that all of the following
are satisfied:
(1) Walls Eligible for Wall Murals.
The proposed location of a wall
mural shall be on an exterior building wall that qualifies as unsightly
at the time that the application for a
permit is pending. A wall shall be
deemed unsightly if its facade is a
generally flat surface, lacking distinctive external architectural ornamentation, is constructed of poor
quality or inappropriate construction
materials, or is in disrepair.
(2) No Interference with Distinctive Architectural and Historic Features. Placement of a wall mural at
the proposed location shall not be
clearly incongruous with — or obscure or compromise the design
integrity of — distinctive architectural or historic features of the
building and of the architectural or
scenic
character
of
surrounding
properties within 250 lineal feet
from the wall. A personal preference
of any agency or official that wall
murals as a class are incongruous
with the Central Business District or
the portion of the Flats-Oxbow Business Revitalization District that is
north of the Detroit-Superior Bridge
and east of the Cuyahoga River as
a whole shall not be considered.
(3)
Findings
of
Clear
Incongruity/Material Alteration of Distinctive Architectural, Historic Features. If the agency or official of the
City responsible for evaluating an
application for a permit decides to
deny the application because the
proposed wall mural would be clearly incongruous with, or would materially alter, a distinctive historic or
architectural feature, that agency or
official shall state the grounds for
such finding in writing delivered to
the applicant. On the applicant’s
appeal of such finding and denial,
the agency hearing the appeal shall
find for the applicant unless the
agency
or
official
demonstrates
clear incongruity or material alteration. As to that finding, such an
appeal shall be heard de novo.
(4) No Pending Notices of Violation. No permit to erect or replace a
wall mural shall be issued if, while
the permit application is pending, a
notice issued pursuant to Section
3101.10 of the Building Code is unresolved as to the building on which
the proposed wall mural would be
placed. A permit may be issued upon
resolution of the alleged violation
that is the subject of the notice.
(5) Content of Display Not Subject
To Approval. No agency or official
of the City shall prescribe or otherwise require approval of the color,
graphic design, words, message, or
any other element of the content of
any display, nor shall any agency or
official of the City require advance
submission of the content of a display before granting a permit or

28
other approval required or authorized by the Codified Ordinances.
(6) Administrative Authority To
Establish Other Criteria. No agency
or official of the City is authorized
to establish criteria, standards, or
guidelines that add restrictions, conditions, or requirements to those set
forth in this section. However, each
reviewing agency or official shall
be allowed to follow its procedural
rules and regulations, unless those
rules and regulations conflict with
this section. In that case, this section shall govern.
(7) The wall mural’s size and
placement is appropriate to achieve
the objective of beautifying the
unsightly wall.
(i) Application for Permit.
(1) Each application shall address
one wall mural proposed for one
wall.
(2) Completed and satisfactory
applications for permits to erect or
replace wall murals filed first in
accordance with this section shall
be given priority over all other
completed and satisfactory applications. The Building Commissioner
shall record on the application the
time and date upon which each
application is filed, and maintain all
filed applications or copies for at
least 10 years from the date of filing.
(3) The applicant for a permit prescribed by this section shall file
such application with the Building
Commissioner, who shall forward
the application to the appropriate
agency or official responsible for
evaluating it within seven days of
receiving it.
(4) The application shall be accompanied by a color photographic
or digital image of the proposed
wall location in the context of
adjoining properties, and the same
color image shall also depict the
proposed wall mural to represent
with general accuracy the appearance of the wall with the addition
of the mural. The agency or official
of the City responsible for evaluating the application may require
additional photographic or digital
images to be submitted with the
application relevant to the criteria
prescribed by this section.
(5) The application shall also be
accompanied by:
(i) The materials and information
required by Section 350.04(C) of this
Zoning Code and 3113.03(g) of the
Building Code;
(ii) The street address of the
building upon which the proposed
wall mural would be located;
(iii) A list of streets and other
vehicular rights of way to which the
proposed mural principally would be
oriented;
(iv) A calculation of the area of
the wall upon which the wall mural
would be located and a calculation
of the area of the expected display;
(v) If the area of the expected display would be less than 80% of the
wall area, the reasons for the smaller display;
(vi) A description of the medium
to be used for the display, and if
vinyl or other high-resolution material, a description of its grade and
a calibration of the dots-per-inch of
the resolution of the display;
(vii) A list of buildings within the
Central Business District and the
portion of the Flats-Oxbow Business
Revitalization District that is north
of the Detroit-Superior Bridge and
east of the Cuyahoga River where
existing wall murals are on display
at the time of filing the application;

The City Record
(viii) The telephone number and
postal address of the applicant and
the name, telephone number, and
postal address of the owner of the
building to which the wall mural
would be secured and a statement
as to whether the owner or person
in possession of the wall has consented to erection of the proposed
wall mural.
(j) Time for Granting or Denying
Application for Permit.
(1) Within 60 days after receiving
an application for a permit or up to
an additional 60 days if requested
by the applicant or needed by the
agency or official responsible for
evaluating
the
application,
the
agency or official of the City responsible for evaluating the application
shall grant or deny the application
and shall notify the applicant, the
Building
Commissioner,
and
the
Planning Director in writing of the
decision.
(2)
An
application
shall
be
deemed denied only by written notification to the applicant identifying
each ordinal provision that was not
satisfied and the reason that it was
not satisfied.
(3)
The
application
shall
be
deemed granted if not denied in
accordance with this section.
(k) Enforcement. Whenever the
Building Commissioner finds that a
wall mural does not conform to the
requirements of this section, exclusive of subsections 350.161(h)(1)
and 350.161(h)(2), or that the structure of the wall mural or its attachment to the building is in a hazardous condition, he shall forward
by certified mail to the person in
control of the display a written
notice
of
violation,
stating
the
defects and requiring that person to
correct or abate the defects within
30 days. The Commissioner shall
otherwise follow the procedures set
forth in Chapter 3103.
Section 350.162 When Valid Permit, Approval Is Presumed
Where for 12 consecutive years
beginning at any time prior to January 1, 2006 a sign with a face of
at least 300 square feet has remained at the same location continuously with no change in height,
setback, number of panels, size, or
dimensions,
other
than
changes
allowed by division (l) of Section
350.10, it shall be conclusively presumed for purposes of Section 350.18
of this Zoning Code and Section
3113.04 of the Building Code that the
sign was erected initially pursuant
to valid permits, certificates, and all
other approvals required by the City
at the time of erection.
Section 6. That Clear Channel Outdoor, Inc., formerly known as Eller
Media Company (“Clear Channel”),
and the City dispute a claim for
approximately $688,276 asserted by
Clear Channel as the prevailing
party denominated as Eller Media
Company in the lawsuit of Eller
Media Company v. City of Cleveland,
Case No. 1:99 CV 276, United States
District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, and Case No. 01-3946,
United States Court of Appeals for
the Sixth Circuit, for reimbursement
of all attorneys’ fees, costs, and disbursements incurred by the plaintiff
in pursuing in the United States District Court and in defending the
appeal by the City in the United
States Court of Appeals (collectively,
“the
advertising
ordinance
case”). The City, acting through its
Director of Law, and Clear Channel
have
entered
into
a
settlement

1470

August 16, 2006
agreement
to
compromise
Clear
Channel’s claim. In accordance with
paragraphs 9 and 10 of the settlement agreement between the City
and Clear Channel Outdoor, Inc.:
Beginning on the date that this
legislation becomes effective and
for 12 months afterward, the City
must give priority to the first six
applications for permits, certificates,
or other approvals Clear Channel
files for the erection of wall murals,
regardless of whether there are
other applications pending by other
applicants. During that 12-month
period, the City will not grant any
application by Clear Channel or any
other applicant within 120 days
after Clear Channel or any other
applicant has filed an application
with the City. To “give priority”
means to treat each of the first six
applications filed by Clear Channel
as though it had been filed before
all other applications filed by all
other applicants, and to grant or
deny each of the first six applications filed by Clear Channel before
granting or denying any other application, regardless of the actual date
of each application, and regardless
of whether the 120-day waiting period described in this paragraph has
expired.
If the City denies a Clear Channel application within the 12 month
period, the City must extend the initial 12-month period by another 12
months. During the 12-month extension, the City must give priority to
as many additional applications by
Clear Channel as were denied during the first 12-month period. Also
during this extension, the City will
not grant an application by Clear
Channel or any other applicant
within 120 days after the application is filed with the City. Clear
Channel’s priority status ends automatically once the City has issued
six permits to Clear Channel for
wall murals.
If Clear Channel obtains all permits, certificates and other approvals required by law to erect six
wall murals in the Central Business
District, Clear Channel will devote
one wall mural exclusively to display of noncommercial public art
for, at least, eight consecutive years
in consultation with and with the
approval of the City of Cleveland.
Clear Channel will use its best
efforts to secure state-of-the art
media for use on the wall murals
within the Central Business District
to cover walls that otherwise are
flat,
windowless,
unornamented
sides of buildings.
No application for a permit to
erect a wall mural may be accepted
by the Building Commissioner for
filing until after the provisions of
this Ordinance become effective.
Section 7. That notwithstanding
any provision of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, to
the contrary, the Director of Port
Control is authorized to enter into
a Lease By Way of Concession
with Clear Channel Outdoor, Inc. to
erect a billboard. The Director of
Law shall prepare the Lease By
Way of Concession and shall contain any additional provisions as
the director determines to be necessary to protect and benefit the
public interest.
Section 8. That this ordinance
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

reducing
the
burden
or
expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or payments
of penalties, or making payments of
special amounts in lieu of making
computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as rebate, or

which action shall be in writing and
signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants

service on which is paid from proceeds of the Tax-Exempt Bonds
(and, if different, the original issue
