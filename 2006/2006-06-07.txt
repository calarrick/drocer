An emergency resolution in support of the Health Care For All
Ohioans Act providing for publicly
funded comprehensive, lifetime health
care coverage for all Ohio residents
as a matter of right and urging residents of the City to sign petitions
to put the Act on the ballot.
Whereas, this Council believes
that all residents of the State of
Ohio, with or without financial
means, should have access to affordable quality health care; and
Whereas, this Council has in the
past, and continues to advocate legislation that will guarantee such
access; and
Whereas, the Single-Payer Action
Network Ohio (SPAN Ohio), a coalition supported by the Ohio AFL-CIO,
UAW Region 2-B, UNITE HERE,
Graphic Communications Union/Teamsters, large numbers of health care
providers,
community
and
faith
groups,
women’s
organizations,
three Ohio members of Congress,
several Ohio state legislators, and
many
individuals
committed
to
working for publicly funded universal health care is sponsoring an initiative petition to put the Health
Care For All Ohioans Act on the ballot; and
Whereas, this initiative, if approved by the people of Ohio, would
establish a health care system in
our state which would provide comprehensive medical coverage for all
of the state’s residents, including
the full range of inpatient and outpatient hospital care, preventive
care, mental health, vision, hearing,
prescription drugs, dental, emergency services, rehabilitation services,
hospice
care,
home
care,
health maintenance care, medical
supplies, and all other necessary
medical services as determined by
any state licensed, certified or registered health care practitioner; and
Whereas, this initiative would provide timely emergency health care
services in each county, including
hospital care and triage, and necessary transportation in each county
to access covered health care services; and
Whereas, the cost of providing
health care coverage for employees

The City Record
of the City of Cleveland would be
substantially reduced if this Act
becomes law because the funding
formula of the Act provides for a
payroll tax not to exceed 3.85% for
health care coverage, far less than
what the City now spends; and
Whereas, the adoption of a publicly funded universal health care
plan on a state level would give
impetus to the ultimate goal, which
is winning a national health care
system, which all other industrial
countries in the world today enjoy;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

An emergency resolution supporting the continued funding of cancer
research in the United States.
Whereas, more than 10 million
people in the United States are currently living with cancer; and
Whereas, more than 1.3 million
people in the US will be diagnosed
with cancer this year; and
Whereas, 64% of adults and 78%
of children diagnosed today will be
alive five years from now; and
Whereas, last year, for the first
time in a decade, Congress cut
spending for NIH, NCI and CDC cancer programs, reducing funding by
2%; and
Whereas, 80% of NCI budget goes
to research; Congress risks cutting
current research in mid-stream, losing the momentum of the initial
research; and
Whereas, people are living longer
and
more
productively
due
to
progress with treatments; and
Whereas, by making cancer research a priority, Congress will save
millions of lives, reduce suffering,
and save billions in health care
costs now and in the future; and
Whereas, One Voice Against Cancer formed in 2000 to create the
broadest coalition, with more than
40 organizations committed to keeping cancer research and treatment a
critical priority in the US; and
Whereas, Congress must vote for
a budget that rejects cancer cuts
and give a high priority to cancer
funding; and
