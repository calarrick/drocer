An emergency resolution opposing
Ohio Senate Bill 82 which prohibits
political subdivisions from requiring
their permanent full-time employees
to reside in any specific area of the
state as such bill violates the right
of local self government which is
afforded the citizens of a charter
municipality under the Ohio Constitution.
Whereas, pursuant to the Ohio
Constitution, the City of Cleveland
has adopted a charter by which it
exercises all powers of local self
government; and
Whereas, one such power is the
power to require City residency as
a condition of employment; and
Whereas, in 1982, the citizens of
the City of Cleveland voted to
amend their Charter to require
employees of the City to be bona
fide residents of the City and
remain residents during their terms
of employment; and
Whereas,
Cleveland’s
Charter
amendment requiring City residency
as a condition of employment was
an exercise of the constitutional
rights of the citizens of the City of
Cleveland: generally, the right to
govern themselves; and specifically,
the right to establish residency as a
condition of employment; and

The City Record
Whereas, Senate Bill 82 is unconstitutional as it directly conflicts
with a municipality’s home rule
powers; and
Whereas, Senate Bill 82 prevents
the citizens of the City of Cleveland
and other charter municipalities
from exercising their constitutional
rights, including the right to require
employees, as a condition of employment, to live in a specific area; and
Whereas, Senate Bill 82 is part of
a continuing attempt by the Ohio
General Assembly to eliminate the
right of the citizens of charter
municipalities in Ohio to adopt a
charter and to exercise the powers
of local self government; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby opposes Ohio Senate Bill 82
which prohibits political subdivisions from requiring their permanent full-time employees to reside in
any specific area of the state, as
such bill violates the right of local
self government which is afforded
