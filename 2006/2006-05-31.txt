for the purpose of sharing the
income tax revenue to be paid by
players and coaches of the Cleveland Cavaliers as a result of the
relocation of the team’s practice
facilities to a new complex to be
located in Independence, Ohio.
Whereas, the Cleveland Cavaliers
have announced plans to relocate
the team’s practice facilities to a
new complex to be located in the
City of Independence; and

1039

Whereas, the Mayors of Cleveland
and Independence have announced
their intention to work cooperatively when business enterprises relocate from one city to the other city;
and
Whereas, the Mayors intend to
share the future municipal tax
revenue collected from the income
of Cavaliers players and coaches
that is currently taxed by the City
of Cleveland, including but not limited to salaries, wages, payroll,
bonuses and incentive payments
(“salaries, wages and bonuses”); and
Whereas, in furtherance of this
spirit of cooperation, the Mayors
have proposed that the two cities
equally share the municipal income
tax revenue to be paid on the
salaries, wages and bonuses of the
players and coaches of the Cleveland Cavaliers upon the operation of
a practice facility for the Cleveland
Cavaliers in Independence; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

with the City of Independence for
the purpose of equally sharing the
income tax revenue to be paid on the
salaries, wages and bonuses of the
players and coaches of the Cleveland
Cavaliers upon the operation of a
practice facility for the Cleveland
Cavaliers in Independence, provided
that the agreement will be re-negotiated if the Cavaliers move their
financial, accounting, sales, marketing, or executive business staffs to
the new practice facility.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it

Ord. No. 903-06.
By Council Members Westbrook
and Sweeney (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance to amend
Sections 209.05 and 3103.09 of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, as amended by various
ordinances, relating to collection of
costs from abatement of nuisances
and unsafe structures.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the following sections of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976:
Section 209.05, as amended by
Ordinance No. 318-06, passed March
20, 2006, and
Section 3103.09, as amended by
Ordinance No. 1189-04, passed June
14, 2004,
are amended as follows:
Section 209.05
Costs of Abatement; Liens on Property
(a) The Director of Parks, Recreation,
and
Properties,
or
his
designee, after abating a nuisance
under this Chapter shall bill the
owner of the property for reimbursement of the costs of abatement.
The bill shall be mailed to the
owner’s last known address, when
the name and address of the owner
are known.
(b) Costs that may be billed
include inspection, records research,

10
notification, collection agency fees,
if any, and billing. A schedule of
the costs shall be on file in the
office of the Director of Parks,
Recreation, and Properties, open
for public inspection, and shall be
published at least once in the City
Record.
(c) If a bill is not paid within 30
days, or if the name or address of
the owner is not known, the Director of Parks, Recreation, and Properties may certify that fact to the
Commissioner of Assessments and
Licenses. The Commissioner may
make a written return to the County Auditor of the action under this
Chapter, including a statement of
the costs of the abatement services
and a description of the property
sufficient to allow the costs to
become a lien on the property. If the
Commissioner makes a return to the
County Auditors, then the lien on
the property shall be collected in the
same manner as other taxes and
returned to the City general fund in
accordance with Revised Code Chapter 731.
(d) Nothing in this Section shall
prevent the Director of Law from
taking any other action necessary to
collect
the
costs
of
abatement
described by this Section.
Section 3103.09 Unsafe Structures
and Exterior Property Nuisances;
Violations and Remedial Notices;
Cost Recovery
(a) Legislative Findings.
Council of the City of Cleveland
finds that:
(1) Structures that are vacant and
open to entry at doors, windows or
other points accessible to the general public:
A. Attract children to enter;
B. Become harborage for vermin;
C. Serve as temporary abode for
derelicts, vagrants and criminals;
and
D. Are likely to be damaged by
vandals or set ablaze by arsonists.
(2) Unkept grounds surrounding
vacant, open structures invite the
dumping of garbage and rubbish;
(3) Thousands of structures in
this City are made of wood-frame
construction
that
is
more
combustible than other building types;
(4) Thousands of structures in
this City are situated on narrow lots
and in close proximity to one another, increasing the risk of conflagration and spread of insect and rodent
infestation;
(5) Population loss and economic
decline experienced by the City in
recent years has caused the incidence of vacant, open structures,
high grass, weeds, junk, debris, and
junk motor vehicles to increase significantly;
(6) Vacant, open structures often
become dilapidated because they are
not repaired by the owners or persons in control of the structures;
(7) Structures that are vacant and
open to entry, high grass, weeds,
junk, debris, and junk motor vehicles depress the market value of
surrounding properties;
(8) The existence of certain hazardous conditions may require a
structure to be vacated; these conditions include but are not limited
to:

The City Record
A. Danger of structural collapse;
B. Inadequate heat or use of dangerous heating mechanism;
C. Danger of fire; and
D. Lack of plumbing in safe working order.
(9) Structures that remain boarded for an extended period of time
contribute to blight, cause a decrease in neighboring property values, create targets for arson, and
lead to the cancellation of homeowners’ insurance for neighboring
property owners.
(10) The following conditions
provide
harborage
and
breeding
grounds for pests or otherwise create human-health problems:
A. Grass over 8 inches in height.
B. Noxious weeds including Russian, Canadian, or common thistle;
wild lettuce; wild mustard; wild
parsley; ragweed; milk weed; iron
weed; wild plants that can cause
skin reaction upon contact or produce or aggravate hay fever, asthma, allergic respiratory reaction, or
similar conditions; and all other noxious weeds.
C. Refuse, including but not limited to, trash, junk, garbage and
food waste, offal, animal wastes,
tires, and all other waste materials.
D. Stagnant surface water.
(11) As used in this Chapter,
“junk motor vehicle” means a motor
vehicle that meets all of the following criteria:
A. Three model years’ old or older;
B. Apparently inoperable; and
C. Extensively damaged, including, but not limited to, any of the
following: missing wheels, tires,
engine, motor, or transmission. (R.C.
§505.173)
(b) Declaration of Nuisance.
(1) All buildings or structures
that are injurious to or a menace to
the public health, safety or welfare,
or are structurally unsafe, unsanitary or not provided with adequate
safe egress, or constitute a fire hazard, or are vacant and open to public entry, or are otherwise dangerous to human life or injurious to the
public, or in relation to existing use
constitute a hazard to the public
health, safety or welfare by reason
of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence or abandonment, are, severally, for the purposes of this Building Code, declared to
be “unsafe structures.” All unsafe
structures or conditions are declared
to be public nuisances. The public
nuisance shall be abated by correction of the violations to the minimum standards of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
applicable City rules and regulations, the Revised Code, and Ohio
Administrative Code, including the
Ohio Building Code, or by demolition.
(2) The conditions listed in division (a)(10) of this section are
declared to be nuisances that shall
be removed, destroyed, or abated
from any property on which they
are found.
(3) Junk motor vehicles as defined in division (a)(11) of this section are declared to be nuisances
that shall be removed or abated
from any property on which they
are found. Junk motor vehicles are
declared to be a nuisance because:

1046

May 31, 2006
A. They harbor rodents, vermin,
and other pests;
B. They contain toxic substances
and flammable liquids and fumes;
C. They attract children to enter;
D. They serve as temporary abode
for derelicts, vagrants and criminals;
E. They diminish neighboring
property values; and
F. They are likely to be damaged
by vandals or set ablaze by arsonists.
(c) Effective Boarding Pending
Rehabilitation.
(1) Permits. Pending the correction of the violations to the minimum standards of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
applicable City rules and regulations, the Revised Code, and the
Ohio Administrative Code, including
the Ohio Building Code, the owner
of a structure may secure the structure through effective boarding. In
order to effectively board the structure, the owner of the structure
shall apply, within 3 days of receiving a notice of violation, to the
Department of Building and Housing for a permit to board. The
Department of Building and Housing shall review the condition of the
structure, determine if it can be
effectively boarded, and grant or
deny the owner’s permit to board,
setting forth special requirements, if
any, necessary for compliance with
minimum standards for effective
boarding. The owner shall effectively board the structure within 3
days of the issuance of a boarding
permit, or within any other time
limit that the Director deems appropriate. Structures that are boarded
without first obtaining a boarding
permit or structures that do not
comply with the boarding permit
shall continue to be considered public nuisances subject to demolition.
Within thirty (30) days of the
issuance of a permit to board, the
owner of the structure shall apply
for a rehabilitation permit under
Section 3105.06 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976. The
Director may grant an extension of
time for acquiring a rehabilitation
permit on the owner’s written request and for good cause shown.
Failure of the owner to obtain a
rehabilitation permit after effective
boarding will result in the structure
being deemed a public nuisance, and
scheduled for demolition.
(2) Materials. The effective boarding of a structure shall include, but
not be limited to, doors, windows, or
other areas of the structure open to
ingress and egress and to weather
elements at any and all levels of the
structure. The openings shall be
secured by plywood, not less than
1/2" thick, or other material of
equal strength, cut and fit into the
openings. Openings in excess of
forty-eight inches wide shall be
framed with 2" x 4" lumber and plywood, or equivalent material fastened twenty-four inches on center
onto frame. The plywood or equivalent material shall be fastened into
the openings by screw type nails or
lag screws.
(3) Maintenance. Upon effectively
boarding the structure, the owner
shall monitor and maintain the

May 31, 2006
structure and its surrounding premises in a safe, sanitary and secured
condition. Any portion of the exterior structure that is deemed to be
potentially hazardous due to deteriorated conditions, or to be structurally unsound, shall be removed or
treated in a manner so as to eliminate
the
hazard.
The
exterior
premises shall be maintained free of
high weeds, debris, junk vehicles,
and conditions that may provide
harborage for rodents. Failure of
the owner to properly maintain the
building in the above condition, will
result in the structure being deemed
a public nuisance, and scheduled for
demolition.
(4) Rehabilitation. Rehabilitation
of the structure shall begin within
30 days of receiving a rehabilitation
permit under Section 3105.06 of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976 unless the time period is
extended with permission from the
Director. If rehabilitation of the
effectively boarded structure does
not begin within this time period, or
if the rehabilitation permit is otherwise invalidated or revoked, then
the Director may declare that the
nuisance has not been abated and
schedule the structure for demolition.
(d) Examination and Condemnation.
(1) The Director is authorized to
examine or cause to be examined
every building or other structure
reported to be unsafe or damaged or
injurious to or a menace to the public, and shall make a written record
of the examination.
(2) The Director may designate as
a public nuisance those particular
structures or conditions found to be
unsafe under division (b) of this
section.
(3) The Director may also declare
that a nuisance structure which, due
to its advanced state of dilapidation,
substantial fire damage or structural infirmity, is an immediate hazard
to human life or health, may only
be abated by immediate repair and
rehabilitation to the minimum standards of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, applicable
City rules and regulations, the
Revised Code, and Ohio Administrative Code, including the Ohio Building Code, or by demolition.
(4) Whenever the Director finds a
vacant structure open to entry at
doors, windows or other points
accessible to the general public, he
may cause the structure to be
secured at those points of entry. The
Director shall be authorized at any
time to enter the premises to secure
the structure in order to lessen the
severity of the public nuisance. In
securing the structure, the Director
may call any department, division or
bureau of the City for whatever
assistance may be necessary, or
may, by private contract, secure
such structure. This securing shall
not be deemed to constitute “effective boarding” under division (b) of
this section, and it does not abate
the nuisance condition of an unsafe
structure, as declared under division
(d)(2) of this section, unless so
declared in writing by the Director.
Later notice, issued under division
(e)(1) below, shall include the fact

The City Record
that the Director has found it necessary to take appropriate action to
secure the structure.
(e) Notice of Violation.
(1) Whenever the Director finds a
building, structure or a portion of
those to be unsafe and determines it
or the property on which it is located to be a public nuisance as
defined in this Chapter, he shall
forward by certified mail to the
owner, agent or person in control of
the building, structure or portion
and to any mortgagee of record a
written notice of violation stating
the defects in the building or structure. The notice of violation shall
require the owner within a stated
time to abate the nuisance condition
of the building or structure by correction of the violations and defects
to the minimum standards of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, applicable City rules and
regulations, the Revised Code, and
Ohio Administrative Code, including
the Ohio Building Code, or by demolition and removal of the building,
structure, or a portion of those. The
notice also shall state that if the
nuisance is not abated within the
required time that the Director may
take appropriate action to repair,
remove, or otherwise abate the public nuisance and that the owner,
agent or person in control shall be
responsible for the costs. The handing of the violation notice to the
owner, agent or person in control of
the building, structure or a portion
of those shall be deemed actual
notice and is legal and valid service
and no other form of service is necessary.
(2) If the person to whom the
notice and order is addressed is not
found after a reasonable and diligent search, then the notice and
order shall be sent by certified mail
to his tax mailing address, if available, as indicated on the County tax
duplicate, and a copy of the notice
shall be posted in a conspicuous
place on the premises to which it
relates. The mailing and posting
shall be deemed legal service of the
notice.
(3) An owner, agent or person in
control of the structure or building,
a mortgagee of record, or a lien
holder of record who has received a
notice of violation or a notice to
make corrections to the minimum
standards of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
applicable City rules and regulations, the Revised Code, and Ohio
Administrative Code, including the
Ohio Building Code, or to demolish
and remove, as provided for in this
section, shall inform prospective
purchasers, vendees, grantees, assignees, lessees, or land contractees
of the notice of violation or the
notice to make corrections, or to
demolish and remove. No person
shall transfer to a vendee, grantee,
assignee, lessee, land contractee or
any other transferee any interest in
a building, structure or a portion of
those after receiving a notice of violation to make corrections, or to
demolish and remove the same,
without first providing the transferee with a copy of the notice.
(4) A. No person, agent, firm or
corporation shall sell, by land con-

1047

11
tract or otherwise, any interest in
any structure or building without
furnishing the buyer, prior to the
sale a copy of any outstanding
notice or order from the City, including any notice of violation or any
outstanding notice to make corrections to the minimum standards of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio 1976, applicable City rules
and regulations, the Revised Code,
including the Ohio Building Code, or
any outstanding notice to demolish
and remove.
No buyer or grantee, by land contract or otherwise, shall obtain any
interest in any structure or building
without obtaining from the seller,
prior
to
sale,
the
documents
described above.
B. No person, agent, firm or corporation acting in the capacity of an
escrow agent in any real estate
transaction involving the sale of a
structure or building situated in the
City,
shall
disburse
any
funds
unless the provisions of this division
have been met.
C. Any buyer or grantee, by land
contract or otherwise, of a structure
or building, shall begin at the date
of transfer to comply with any
notice or order obtained or to be
obtained under this division and,
within ten days of the date of transfer, shall notify the Director, in writing, of the actions that will be taken
to comply. The Director may then
establish a reasonable time to comply.
(f) Vacating Buildings and Prohibiting Use. The Director may also
require in the notice issued under
division (e)(1) of this section that
the building, structure or a portion
of those be vacated, not be reoccupied, or used until the specified
repairs and improvements are completed, inspected, and approved by
the Director. The Director may
cause to be posted at each entrance
to the building or structure a notice
as follows: “THIS STRUCTURE IS
IN A DANGEROUS CONDITION AND
HAS BEEN CONDEMNED AND ITS
USE HAS BEEN PROHIBITED BY
THE DIRECTOR OF BUILDING
AND HOUSING.” The notice shall
remain posted until the required corrections are made or demolition is
completed. No person shall remove
the notice without written permission of the Director, nor shall any
person use or enter the building or
structure except for the purpose of
making the required corrections or
demolishing or effectively boarding
the building or structure, or securing the structure under division
(d)(4) of this section.
(g) Right to Appeal. The owner,
agent or person in control shall
have a right to appeal from the
notice and decision of the Director
as provided in this section and
appear before the Board of Building
Standards and Building Appeals at
a specified time and place to show
cause why he should not comply
with the notice. Any notice served
by the Director shall automatically
become a final order if a written
notice of appeal before the Board is
not filed in the office of the Board
within the time set forth in the
notice from the Director. In the
absence of an appeal, all actions

12
taken shall constitute a valid exercise of the police powers of the City
of Cleveland.
(h) Noncompliance with Notice.
(1) Director Authorized To Demolish, Remove, or Abate. In case
the owner, agent or person in control fails, neglects or refuses to
comply with the notice to repair or
rehabilitate, or to demolish and
remove a public nuisance or unsafe
building, structure or a portion of
those, the Director may take appropriate
action
to
demolish
and
remove an unsafe structure or to
remove or abate any condition that
is defined as a nuisance under this
Chapter.
(2) Action by Director of Law.
The Director may advise the Director of Law of the facts in the case,
who
may
institute
appropriate
action in the court to cause correction of the violations and defects, or
demolition and removal, or effective
boarding of the building or structure pending rehabilitation.
(3) Rehabilitation Permits Not
Bar To Director’s Action To Abate.
The securing of rehabilitation permits for the building or structure
shall not in and of itself bar the
Director from taking action to abate
the nuisance.
(4) Effective Boarding by Director. The Director may, with respect
to any condemned structure, also
take appropriate action to effectively board the structure, or to
secure it under division (d)(4) of
this section. The Director shall
specifically state in writing his
findings with respect to the structure, and shall determine whether
to secure or to effectively board,
based on factors which may include
the following: the distance of the
structure from neighboring structures, the type of structure, the
extent to which the structure is
secured, the likelihood of vandalism or arson, the extent of the deterioration, the economic likelihood
of eventual rehabilitation of the
structure, or cost of securing or
effectively boarding the structure.
Failure
To
Comply
with
(5)
Notice. In case the owner, agent or
person in control fails, neglects or
refuses to comply with the notice to
repair or rehabilitate, or to demolish and remove a public nuisance
or unsafe building, structure or a
portion of those, or to remove or
abate any other condition that is
defined as a nuisance under this
Chapter, the Director may take
appropriate action to take repair or
maintenance measures or to otherwise abate the public nuisance. The
Director shall specifically state in
writing the findings with respect to
the structure, and shall determine
whether to perform repair or maintenance based on factors which
may include the following: the distance of the structure from neighboring structures, the type of structure, the extent of deterioration, the
likelihood of vandalism or arson,
the economic likelihood of eventual
complete rehabilitation of the structure, the cost of repair or maintenance.
(6) Notice of Intent To Demolish.
Except as provided in division (i)
of this section, the Director shall

The City Record
give written notice informing the
owner, agent, or person in control,
mortgagee of record and lien holders of record of the City’s intention
to demolish and remove the unsafe
building or structure at least 30
days before the intended action by
the City. The notice may be effective concurrently with the violation
notice. A condemned structure, once
effectively boarded by the owner
pending rehabilitation that later
becomes open to entry, may then be
demolished and removed, subject to
the Director giving written notice
as stated in divisions (e)(1) and
(h) of this section, upon a finding
by the Director that the structure
can no longer be effectively boarded.
(i) Junk Motor Vehicle Removal.
(1) Notice. The Director shall
send written notice, by certified
mail with return receipt requested,
to the person having the right of
possession of the property on which
a junk motor vehicle, as defined in
this Chapter, is left. This notice
shall notify the person having right
of possession of the property that
within ten days of mailing of the
notice,
the
junk
motor
vehicle
either shall be covered by being
housed in a garage or other suitable structure or removed from the
property. The notice shall also be
posted in a conspicuous place on
the property.
(2) Director Authorized To Remove Junk Motor Vehicles. The
Director is authorized to provide for
and order the removal of a junk
motor vehicle when the junk motor
vehicle has not been either covered
by being housed in a garage or
other suitable structure or removed
from the property, within ten days
of the date of mailing and posting
of the notice as set forth above.
(j) Cases of Emergency. In cases
of emergency that, in the opinion of
the Director, involve immediate danger to human life or health, the
Director shall promptly cause the
building, structure or a portion of
those to be made safe or removed.
For this purpose he may at once
enter the structure or land on which
it stands, or any abutting land or
structure, with assistance and at the
cost as he deems necessary. He may
request the Director of Public Safety to enforce the orders he gives
that are necessary to cause the
building, structure or a portion of
those to be made safe or removed.
The Director of Public Safety has
the authority to enforce the orders.
He may order adjacent structures

(1) Any and all expenses or costs
incurred under this section for the
removal, repair, alteration, securing or boarding of a building or

ed by federal money. In the case of
a junk motor vehicle, any and all
expenses or costs incurred under
this section to remove the vehicle
shall be paid by the person having
the right of possession of the
premises where the vehicle is located.
(2) Whenever an inspection is
made after the compliance date
stated on a Notice of Violation of
the Building Code, the Housing
Code, or the Zoning Code or after
a compliance date determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction to
determine whether the violation
has been remedied and the violation has not been remedied, or an
additional permit is obtained for
work previously permitted and the
original permit has expired or was
appropriately
voided,
a
fee
of
$100.00 shall be charged for each
inspection, except that this fee
shall not apply to one-family and
two-family owner-occupied dwelling
structures.
(3) If within 30 days from the
date the Director of Building and
Housing
sends
a
statement
of
charges and costs incurred, the
owner fails to pay for the costs of
removal, repair, alteration, securing or boarding or of inspections of
violations that have not been remedied, or the person having possession fails to pay for the cost of
removing a junk vehicle, the Director may certify the amount to the
Commissioner of Assessments and
Licenses, including collection agency
fees. The Commissioner of Assessments and Licenses may make
written return to the County Auditor of the action under this section
with a statement of the charges for
services, the amount paid for the
performing of labor and a proper
description of the premises. Certification to the County Auditor is
for the purpose of making expenses and costs a lien upon the lands,
to be collected as other taxes and
returned to the City with the General Fund, with special accounting
under Section 715.261 of the Revised Code.
(4) Notwithstanding the method of
collection set forth in this division,
the Director of Law may take any
action necessary to collect the costs
of demolition, boarding, or other
nuisance abatement from the owner
or other responsible party.
