Section 531.03 Charges for Installation of Service Connections, Tapping Sleeves and Valves
(a) The charges for work performed by the Division of Water, including, but not limited to, service connection
installations, hydrant relocations, tapping sleeve and valve installations and fire line installations, shall be in
accordance with Section 535.06 of the Codified Ordinances.
(b) The applicant for a service connection shall pay in advance to the Division for the furnishing of material
specified and the labor for tapping the water main and installing the service connection and pipe from the water
main to approximately two feet back to the curb line, or proposed curb line, including the setting of the stop
cock box or valve box in a trench excavated by the applicant, his agent or contractor.
(c) All excavating, backfilling and repaving done within and without the territorial limits of the City are to
be provided by the applicant by arrangement with the particular municipality.
Section 531.07 Abandoned Service Connections
(a) No building permit under Section 3105.01 or water service connection permit shall be issued until the Division of Water has determined the location of any previously installed service connections and arrangements have
been made with the Division of Water to plug or cap previously installed service connections under rules and
regulations promulgated by the Commissioner. All necessary work involving plugging or capping previously
installed service connections shall be done by the Division of Water, and the applicant shall pay the fees established in Section 535.06 of the Codified Ordinances for each connection to be plugged or capped.
(b) The City shall not be responsible for any damages resulting from previously installed service connections
which have not been plugged or capped under this section.
Section 531.77 Refusal or Neglect to Pay for Service Connections or Repairs; Fee
If any person refuses or neglects to pay for a service connection put in, or for repairs made on service pipes
or private meters, or permits any waste or use of water contrary to the provisions of these rules or ordinances
for the management and protection of the Division of Water, the water shall be immediately turned off without
any preliminary notice, and not turned on again until all charges and damages have been paid. In case the water
has been turned off on account of waste or unauthorized use of the same, the Commissioner of Water may charge
and collect the further sum contained in Section 535.06 of the Codified Ordinances for turning it off and on.
Section 531.78 Conditions When Connections May be Plugged; Fee
In cases where the water has been turned off for nonpayment of water rent or for any other cause, and it is
found turned on again, or when in the opinion of the Commissioner of Water the turning off of the water at the
stop cock is not a sufficient protection against the use or waste of water, the Commissioner may cause the ferrule to be drawn or the corporation cock to be turned off and disconnected. On a reapplication for water where
the service pipe has been so disconnected, the charges set forth in Section 535.06 of the Codified Ordinances will
be made together with all additional expense for opening and closing the street and repaving.
Section 531.81 Fees for Engineering Services

(4) Charges for metering devices supplied by the City and for their installation and/or replacement by the City
shall be borne by the owner of or the person applying for water service to the premises.
(5) Excepting private re-registering and sewer-exempt meters, metering devices shall be repaired by and at the
expense of the Division.
(b) New Connections.
(1) All new service connections and service pipes from all water distribution mains supplied with water by the
City shall be metered by a water meter with an outside registering device, except meters required to be placed
in vaults.
(2) Each living unit of a multiple housing arrangement in a building of not more than two stories shall be
metered individually.
(3) When vaults are required, they shall be furnished by the owner or customer and approved by the Commissioner. Vaults shall be installed by the owner or customer in strict conformity with the rules and regulations
of the Department of Public Utilities.
(c) Existing Connections.
(1) Meters on existing service connections and service pipes shall be replaced with meters with outside registering devices on request of the owner or when deemed necessary by the Commissioner, subject to approval by
the Director, to prevent waste or to protect the integrity of the water system or to continue the policy of metering all consumers, pursuant to rules and regulations by the Commissioner, subject to approval by the Director.
(2) Replacement, repair and maintenance of metering devices shall be performed only by authorized employees of the Division or by persons authorized to perform such services by contract.
(3) Charges for installation and/or replacement of metering devices may be prorated on the water bill for a
period of not more than four years or may be paid in a lump sum.
(d) Rules and Regulations. The Director shall make and amend written rules and regulations necessary to
effectuate the provisions of this chapter. The rules and regulations shall not conflict with nor waive any provisions
of these Codified Ordinances.
Section 533.13 Meter Inspection; Fee
On written application made to the Commissioner of Water by any consumer of water, accompanied by the
inspection fee required under Section 535.06 of the Codified Ordinances, the Division of Water shall test the meter.
If upon such inspection the meter is found to be more than two percent fast, that is, registers a greater amount
of water than actually passes through it, the Division shall return to the consumer the above inspection fee and
shall make such reduction in the current bill as the facts warrant. If, however, the meter does not over-register
the amount of water that actually passes through it, the Division shall retain the above inspection fee as the
expense for the testing.
Section 533.15 Tampering with Meters
If the Division of Water finds that a meter seal has been broken, or that there is good evidence that a meter
has been tampered with, the water shall be shut off and not turned on again until the payment set forth under
Section 535.06 of the Codified Ordinances has been made to the Division. The consumer or owner of the premises shall also pay for twice the estimated quantity of water which has not been registered because of tampering
with the meter.
Section 533.16 Charges for Reading Registering Meters
The charge for reading each private re-registering meter shall be under Section 535.06 of the Codified Ordinances. This charge shall be added to and made a part of the quarterly charge for water furnished through the
main meter.

A charge shall be made for each unmetered fire supply connection within the limits of the City and direct

or any part of three months.
Charges shall be collected quarterly for each fire supply connection to cover inspection, testing, sealing and

trunk water mains to improve the water supply for fire protection purposes.
Section 535.24 Charges for Water from Fire Hydrants
(a) In addition to other charges, if water is used from a public fire hydrant, upon special permit only, a charge

separate permit shall be issued for each hydrant which shall identify its location.
(b) Water may be furnished from a fire hydrant for any special purpose authorized by the Commissioner of

which the fire hydrant is located, but shall not include a discounted rate for the first 1,000 cubic feet of water.
The quantity of water used may be estimated by the Commissioner based on information provided by the user

of all water measured.
Section 535.25 Charges for Water for Building and Construction Purposes
All water for building or construction purposes, whether public or private, shall be paid for under Sections
535.04 and 535.06 of the Codified Ordinances. In the case of water to be used for building purposes, the Director
of Building and Housing, before granting any permit to erect, repair, change or alter any building or structure,
shall first require the owner of the building to pay in advance an amount as is justly chargeable for water to
be used in erecting, repairing, changing or altering such building or structure, and on the refusal of the owner
to pay the charges in advance, the Director shall refuse to grant the permit. Charges shall be based on estimates
of the amount of masonry, walls, plastering and other work for which water is used in construction, computed
according to the accepted rules of the Division of Water. If desired by the property owner or contractor, water
for building or construction purposes may be taken through a meter, furnished and set at the expense of the
owner or contractor, and paid for at the rate set forth in Sections 535.04 and 535.06 of the Codified Ordinances.
However, the advance payment for water in any case shall be made, as previously stated, and if the supply of
water is taken entirely through a meter, the charge shall be adjusted under the amount registered by the meter,
and the excess of the advance payment, if any, shall be refunded on the completion of the work.
Section 535.27 Use of Fire Hydrants for Construction Purposes
(a) No person shall use any hydrant for construction or other purposes without first obtaining a permit for
such use from the Commissioner of Water. Such permit shall be charged under Section 535.06 of the Codified Ordinances.
(b) All hydrants used for any construction purpose, such as sewers, buildings, paving, etc., must have reducing
couplings attached to the nozzles of the hydrants, with an independent valve for regulating the supply.
(c) The main valve of the hydrant must be opened full at the beginning of work each day, and remain open
until the stoppage of work at night. The water supply shall be regulated by the independent valve. The hydrant
shall be operated only by a proper hydrant key, which shall be obtained from the Division of Water.

immediately, the hydrant permit revoked and no new permits for the use of any hydrant shall be issued until
all damages or charges for the waste of water have been paid.

expense of the party using the same and the party shall pay for all water by meter measure.

Sweeney, Santiago, Zone, Turner and

An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Department of Development
to develop criteria for the Ohio Jobs
Ready Sites Program that are fair
and enable urban communities to
apply for and receive funding.
Whereas, the Ohio Department of
Development (ODOD) is developing
criteria and rules by which communities in Ohio may apply for and
receive funding under the Ohio Jobs
Ready Sites program; and
Whereas, this Council understands
that the State is considering a rule
that
would
create
a
minimum
acreage requirement, limiting the
eligible acreage to at least 150
acres; and
Whereas, such a limitation would
significantly limit, if not eliminate,
the ability of urban communities to
apply for the funds available under
the Ohio Jobs Ready Sites program;
and
Whereas, the Ohio Jobs Ready
Sites program was made possible by
passage of State Issue 1, passed
overwhelmingly by voters in urban
areas of the state, including Cuyahoga County; and the City of Cleveland, the same areas that will be
ineligible to apply for and receive
funding under this program, should
the burdensome minimum acreage
requirement be made a criteria; and
Whereas,
a
minimum
acreage
requirement
such
as
the
one
described above is inconsistent with
the legislative intent of the bill creating the Ohio Jobs Ready Sites program; and
Whereas, the ODOD should also
consider making the amount and
nature of eligible local matching
funds through the Jobs Ready Sites
program less restrictive for smaller
urban areas; and
Whereas, the ODOD should also
consider the proximity to existing
infrastructure an asset in the site
certification process; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,

May 3, 2006
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the Ohio Department of
Development to develop criteria for
the Ohio Jobs Ready Sites Program
that are fair and enable urban communities to apply for and receive
funding.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to Lt. Governor Bruce
Johnson and Fran Migliorino in the
Office of Governor Bob Taft, and to
the members of the Ohio House and
Senate representing the city of
Cleveland.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
