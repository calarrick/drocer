An emergency resolution calling
upon the President of the United
States and the United States Congress to extend the deadline until
the end of the year, and eliminate
the penalty to sign up for a Medicare prescription drug program.

to sign up for a Medicare drug plan
is midnight tonight, May 15, 2006;

Whereas, the Medicare plan has
dozens of prescription drug plans
from which to choose, making it
extremely
confusing
for
many
seniors to try to figure out which
plan is best; and
Whereas, the law is so confusing
for seniors that more time is need-
