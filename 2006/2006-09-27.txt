Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of

Section 1. That Section 189.02 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended by
Ordinance No. 2009-A-99 passed June

as follows:
Section 189.02
Fair Employment
Wage
All Covered Employers shall pay
no less than the Fair Employment
Wage to Covered Employees. Determination of the Fair Employment
Wage shall be in accordance with
the following:
(a) Amount of Fair Employment
Wage:
(1) The Fair Employment Wage
shall be calculated on an hourly
basis and shall be at least $8.20 per
hour beginning January 1, 2001;
$8.70 beginning October 1, 2001; and
$9.20 beginning October 1, 2002.
Thereafter, the Fair Employment
Wage shall be adjusted by the City
of Cleveland on an annual basis,
beginning October 1, 2003 and each
year thereafter in proportion to the
Consumer Price Index for Northeast
Ohio, as published by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of
Labor. As of October 1, 2006, the
annual adjustment shall be suspended at the rate in effect on September 30, 2006, until further action
is taken by Council.
(2) Tipped employees, i.e., employees for whom a substantial portion
of their compensation consists of
tips or gratuities, shall be paid an
hourly wage which, when combined
with the compensation received in
tips, will at least equal the Fair
Employment Wage.
(b) All employees working for the
City shall be paid at least a Fair
Employment Wage. Work being performed by City employees at the
time of the effective date of this
Chapter may not be contracted out
unless the contractor pays employees performing that work the Fair
Employment Wage or the current
wages and benefits being paid to
workers doing that or similar work,
whichever is higher, regardless of
the number of employees.
(c) Any new jobs created by the
City that are not currently being
performed by City employees as of
the effective date of this ordinance

wage if contracted out, regardless of
the number of employees.
(d) Health Care Incentives:
(1) In order to encourage Covered
Employers to provide reasonable
health
care
coverage
to
their
employees, the City shall provide
the following incentives to Covered
Employers:

The City Record
(A) Applicable Departments shall
consider the fact that a Service Contractor provides or agrees to provide
during the course of the Service
Contract
reasonable
health
care
insurance to Covered Employees
working 30 or more hours a week
as a factor in determining the lowest and best or lowest responsible
bid for any Service Contract. If a
Service Contractor can demonstrate
that it has offered reasonable health
care insurance to its employees but
as a group the employees have
refused the health care insurance
coverage, the Service Contractor is
entitled to the same consideration
and
treatment
in
the
bidding
process as a Service Contractor who
provides or agrees to provide reasonable health care insurance. The
Division of Purchases and Supplies
shall promulgate regulations for the
evaluation of bids and proposals
that provide for meaningful consideration of the offering of reasonable
health care insurance in determining the lowest and best or lowest
responsible bid. Such regulations
must be reviewed and approved by
Cleveland City Council.
(B) Applicable Departments shall
offer additional financial incentives
to Recipients of Assistance who will
provide reasonable health care insurance to their Covered Employees
working 30 or more hours a week
during the term of the contract for
Assistance. Examples of such incentives include: more favorable terms
for a loan, such as a lower interest
rate; a higher percentage of taxes to
be credited or abated; a higher
amount for a grant, etc. Whether or
not
such
incentives
have
been
offered; the reasons for offering or
not offering such incentives; the
terms of such incentives, if offered;
and any evidence of the intent of the
proposed Recipient of Assistance to
provide reasonable health care insurance shall be a part of the information provided by the Applicable
Department to Cleveland City Council for consideration in connection
with any ordinance authorizing a
contract for Assistance.
(2) In order to qualify a Covered
Employer for an incentive as provided in the previous section, the
reasonable health care insurance
provided to employees must be comparable to a family health care
insurance plan provided by the City
to its employees.
(3) Evidence of the offer or provision or the intent to provide or
offer reasonable health care insurance benefits qualifying a Covered
Employer for such incentives shall
lie submitted to the Applicable
Department upon request.
Section 2. That existing Section
189.02 of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended
by Ordinance No. 2009-A-99 passed

An emergency resolution encouraging the Cuyahoga County Auditor’s Office, Department of Weights
and Measures and the City of Cleveland Department of Finance, Division of Weights and Measures to
study testing fuel quality at fuel
stations, and the State of Ohio to
pass laws that require fuel quality
testing.

10
Whereas, contaminated fuel sold
at fuel stations causes motor vehicle damage; and
Whereas, some fuel stations sell
low-octane fuel to customers at
high-octane prices; and
Whereas, testing fuel quality is
the only way to guarantee that consumers receive the fuel that they
purchase, and to detect contaminated fuel; and
Whereas, Ohio is only one of four
states that do not have laws that
require testing fuel; and
Whereas, Summit County is the
first and only county in Ohio to
implement a Fuel Quality Testing
Program; and
Whereas, Summit County authorized their Fiscal Officer in the
Auditor’s
Office,
Department
of
Weights and Measures to test fuel
according to adopted national fuel
testing regulations; and
Whereas, Fuel testing is needed
for the consumer protection of the
citizens of the State of Ohio, Cuyahoga County and the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby encourages the Cuyahoga County Auditor’s Office, Department of
Weights and Measures and the City
of Cleveland, Department of Finance,
Division of Weights and Measures
to study testing fuel quality at fuel
stations, and the State of Ohio to
pass laws that require fuel quality

An emergency resolution urging
the Administration, the Ohio Attorney General’s Office and the United
States Department of Justice, United States Attorney’s Office to investigate whether Argent Mortgage
Company and its subprime loan competitors are violating local, state, or
federal predatory lending, fraud,
and other laws pertaining to lending practices, and take legal action
accordingly.

The City Record
Whereas, Ohio has the worst foreclosure rate in the country, with a
loan default rate more than three
times the national average; and
Whereas, a risky, high-interest
mortgage, called a subprime loan is
10 times more likely to default than
a conventional, prime-rate loan; and
Whereas, 20 percent of subprime
loans end up in foreclosure after
five years; and
Whereas, one in five house-purchase loans made in 2005 by Cleveland’s top mortgage lender, California-based Argent Mortgage Company (“Argent”), have already gone
into foreclosure; and
Whereas, Argent’s subprime loan
competitors have comparable high
foreclosure rates for Cleveland purchase loans in 2005, but lack the volume of Argent’s 1,258 loans in 2005;
and
Whereas, more than 70 percent of
the 7,300 loans Argent wrote in
Cleveland from 2003 through 2005
were on the East Side; and
Whereas, up to 20 percent of borrowers who received subprime loans
had credit scores for lower-interest
conventional mortgages; and
Whereas, Argent representatives
have suggested how to doctor loan
documents so that mortgages are
approved by company underwriters,
according to Plain Dealer investigation witnesses; and
Whereas, Argent rarely questions
the validity of property appraisals
or the source of down payments that
are key components to getting mortgage loans approved; and
Whereas, the higher a borrower’s
risk of default or foreclosure, the
higher the rate charged for a loan;
and
Whereas, Argent’s lax lending
practices have allowed too many
unqualified borrowers to get too
many loans, resulting in foreclosures; and
Whereas, subprime lending and
foreclosures contribute to the loss of
population in Cleveland and Cuyahoga County; and
Whereas, subprime lending and
foreclosures negatively impact Cleveland and Cuyahoga County homeowners and citizens by resulting in
vacant and abandoned properties;
and
Whereas, vacant properties often
become a breeding ground for crime
and fires, and require a disproportionate amount of government maintenance, from securing properties
against criminal activity to removal
of garbage and rodents to demolition, all at a cost to taxpayers; and
Whereas, vacant properties reduce
city tax revenue in three ways: they
are often tax delinquent; their low
value means they generate little in
taxes; and they depress property
values across an entire neighborhood; and
Whereas, the cost of living in a
neighborhood with many vacant and
abandoned properties makes obtaining homeowner’s insurance, mortgages and loans for home improvements more difficult; and
Whereas, vacant properties degrade and devalue the quality of
life for remaining residents, isolating and weakening the neighborhood, and increasing the likelihood

1750

September 27, 2006
that property values will continue to
decline and further abandonment
will set in; and
Whereas, it is incumbent upon the
Administration, the Ohio Attorney
General’s Office and the United
States Department of Justice, United States Attorney’s Office to investigate and take legal action if warranted against Argent and other
subprime loan competitors to eliminate illegal lending practices, in
order to reduce rising foreclosure
rates and the resulting abandoned
and vacant properties in our neighborhoods; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the Administration, the
Ohio Attorney General’s Office and
the United States Department of Justice, United States Attorney’s Office
to investigate whether Argent Mortgage Company and its subprime
loan competitors are violating local,
state, or federal predatory lending,
fraud, and other laws pertaining to
lending practices, and take legal
action accordingly.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Alberto
Gonzales, the United States Attorney
General, Gregory White, the United
States Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio, Jim Petro, the Ohio
Attorney General, Mark Bennett,
Senior Deputy Attorney General, and
Mayor Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
