An emergency resolution supporting reauthorization of the federal
Ryan White CARE Act, under which
the United States supports medical
and other social services for 571,000
poor, underinsured, and uninsured
people with HIV/AIDS in the United
States — including thousands of individuals in Ohio, Cuyahoga County,
and the City of Cleveland, and urging such reauthorization to be in a
manner that results in just and equitable distribution of funding based
on accurate counts of persons living
with HIV/AIDS, and that fully takes
into account the impact local economic conditions have on a region’s
ability to help people gain access to
HIV/AIDS care and treatment.
Whereas, since 1990 the Ryan
White CARE Act has been the payer
of last resort for primary medical and
ancillary support services for poor,
uninsured, and underinsured people
with HIV/AIDS in the United States;
and
Whereas, the availability of Ryan
White CARE Act resources has literally meant the difference between
life and death for individuals who
would not otherwise be able to
access the services they need; and
Whereas, the availability of Ryan
White CARE Act resources has
helped thousands of Cleveland and
Cuyahoga County residents achieve
significantly improved medical status and greater independence; and
Whereas, the Ryan White CARE
Act has expired, and is currently
being financed by continuing budget resolutions; and
Whereas, the US Congress is set
to consider reauthorization of the
Ryan White CARE Act in late
March or early April; and,

The City Record
Whereas, since the Ryan White
CARE Act was last reauthorized in
2000, the number of HIV/AIDS cases
nationally, regionally, and locally
has continued to climb, even as
Ryan White CARE Act resources
have remained flat; and, impact that
poverty, unemployment, homelessness, and other
Whereas, poverty, unemployment,
homelessness, and other economic
conditions have a great impact on
the ability of a region to help people with HIV/AIDS gain access to
and remain within comprehensive
systems of HIV/AIDS care and
treatment; and
Whereas, the current funding formula results in an inequitable distribution of Ryan White CARE Act
resources across the United States,
leaving Ohio and cities within Ohio,
with fewer resources per patient
than other regions of the country;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this council supports the reauthorization of the federal Ryan White CARE Act, under
which the United States supports
medical and other social services
for 571,000 poor, underinsured, and
uninsured people with HIV/AIDS in
the United States – including thousands of individuals in Ohio, Cuyahoga County, and the City of Cleveland.
Section 2. That, this Council urges
such reauthorization to be in a manner that results in just and equitable distribution of funding based
on accurate counts of persons living
with HIV/AIDS, and that fully
takes into account the impact local
economic
conditions
have
on
a

hereby declared to be an emergency

all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
