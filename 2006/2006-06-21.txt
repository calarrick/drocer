Section 459.05 Answers; Procedures
(a) A person who is personally or
constructively served with a parking ticket charging the commission
of a parking infraction may answer
the charge by appearing personally
before
the
Parking
Violations

1200

Bureau or by mail. An answer shall
be made within fifteen days from
the date of the infraction, and shall
be in one of the following forms:
(1) An admission that the person
committed the parking infraction,
by payment of any fine arising out
of the parking infraction;
(2) An admission that the person
committed the parking infraction,
with an explanation of the circumstances surrounding the parking
infraction;
(3) A denial that the person committed the parking infraction and a
request for a hearing relative to the
infraction. If the person desires the
presence, at the hearing, of the law
enforcement officer who issued the
parking ticket, the person must
request his presence in his answer.
(b) (1) A person who admits that
he committed a parking infraction
shall, and a person who admits that
he committed a parking infraction
with explanation may, when he
makes his answer, pay the fine arising out of the infraction admitted to
the Violations Clerk of the Parking
Violations Bureau.
(2) A person who admits that he
committed a parking infraction with
explanation shall submit evidence to
the Parking Violations Bureau that
explains
the
circumstances
surrounding the parking infraction.
The evidence may be submitted in
person or, to avoid the necessity of
personal appearance, may be sent as
affidavits and other documentary
evidence, by mail. The Parking Violations Bureau, when it receives an
answer admitting that a person committed a parking infraction with
explanation, shall promptly determine whether the explanation mitigates the fact that the person committed the parking infraction and
notify the person, in writing, of its
determination.
If the Parking Violations Bureau
determines that the explanation mitigates the fact that the person committed the parking infraction, the
Parking Violations Bureau shall
eliminate or reduce the amount of
the fine arising out of the parking
infraction. If the fine is eliminated
or reduced and the person has previously paid the fine, the amount
paid in excess of the revised fine
shall be returned to the person; if
the fine is eliminated or reduced
and the person has not previously
paid the fine, the person shall pay
only the amount of the revised fine.
If the Parking Violations Bureau
determines
that
the
explanation
does not mitigate the fact that the
person
committed
the
parking
infraction, the person owes the
entire amount of the fine arising out
of the parking infraction, and if the
person has not previously paid the
fine, the person shall pay the entire
amount of the fine. If a person
admits that he committed a parking
infraction with explanation and the
person fails to pay the amount of
the fine due within ten days after
receiving notice of the Parking Violations
Bureau’s
determination,
unless the amount due has previously been paid, the Parking Violations Bureau’s determination and
the amount of the fine due shall be
considered a judgment and shall be
treated as if it were a judgment rendered subsequent to a hearing held
pursuant to Division (b) of Section
459.07 hereof.
(3) A person who denies that he
committed
a
parking
infraction
shall be granted a hearing concerning the infraction. The Parking Vio-

place of the hearing. The hearing
