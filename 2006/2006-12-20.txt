An emergency resolution encouraging the City of Cleveland’s Department of Public Health to study
ways to reduce artificial trans fats
in citizens’ diets and work with the
Cuyahoga County Board of Health
towards banning artificial trans fats
from restaurants.
Whereas, on December 5, 2006,
New York City became the first city
in the nation to ban artery-clogging
artificial trans fats at restaurants;
and
Whereas, the New York Board of
Health unanimously passed the ban
that bars restaurants from using
most frying oils containing the fats
by July 2007 and gives restaurants
another year to eliminate all trans
fats from all foods; and
Whereas, the ban, which was
advocated by New York Mayor
Michael Bloomberg, follows a national requirement beginning this
past January that companies list
artificial trans-fat content on food
labels, and efforts are being made
to reduce the trans-fat content of
snacks in school vending machines;
and
Whereas, health and nutrition
groups say artificial trans fats
clearly contribute to heart disease,
and studies have shown that they
raise bad cholesterol and lower the
good kind of cholesterol; and
Whereas, partially hydrogenated
vegetable oil, the main form of
artificial trans fates, is used for
frying and baking and is present
in processed foods from cookies
and crackers to pizza dough and
pre-made blends like pancake mix;
and
Whereas, reducing artificial trans
fats in citizens’ diets and banning
the fats from restaurants is necessary for the public health of the citizens of the State of Ohio, Cuyahoga
County and the City of Cleveland;
and

An emergency resolution supporting federal and state efforts to
restore the Great Lakes through the
federal “Great Lakes Collaboration
Implementation Act” and the State
of Ohio’s “Great Lakes-St. Lawrence
River Basin Water Resources Compact”.
Whereas, the Great Lakes comprise almost 20% of the world’s surface fresh water and 95% of North
America’s fresh surface water, and
supply drinking water to more than
40 million U.S. and Canadian residents; and
Whereas,
Lake
Erie
supplies
drinking water to nearly 3 million
Ohioans and supports local agriculture; a diversity of wildlife, including a world class fishery; maritime
trade; industry; and tourism; and
Whereas, Lake Erie is ailing from
a multitude of stressors, including
aquatic invasive species, toxic contamination of river and lake sediments, partially or inadequately
treated sewage discharges, pollution
from non-point sources, and coastal
habitat loss; and
Whereas, Lake Erie is the shallowest, warmest and most biologically productive, producing more
fish for human consumption than all
of the other four Great Lakes combined; and
Whereas, Lake Erie is incredibly
vulnerable to stressors as the smallest Great Lake both in surface area
and volume, with a drainage basin
totaling 30,140 square miles, and
encompassing
parts
of
Indiana,
Michigan, New York, Ohio, Ontario,
and Pennsylvania; and
Whereas, the health of Lake Erie
is essential to the quality of life and

December 20, 2006
economic vitality of communities
along its shores and in the surrounding basin, supporting tourism,
industrial, recreational, commercial,
and cultural activities; and
Whereas, over 140 scientists have
endorsed a paper, “Prescription for
Great Lakes Ecosystem Protection
and Restoration – Avoiding the Tipping Point of Irreversible Changes,”
which calls for urgent action in the
Great Lakes to avoid an ecosystem
breakdown;
Whereas,
there
has
been
an
unprecedented collaborative effort
on the part of 1,500 people representing federal, state, tribal and
local governments, research institutions including universities, businesses, agricultural organizations,
non governmental entities and private citizens to develop an Action
Plan to Restore and Protect the
Great Lakes; and
Whereas, Members of Congress
have introduced the Great Lakes
Collaboration Implementation Act,
which seeks approximately $20 billion over a five year period to fund
projects that implement the Action
Plan to Restore and Protect the
Great Lakes; and
Whereas, specifically, the Act will
provide funding to:
• Prevent and control aquatic
invasive species;
• Create and restore wetlands
and other fish and wildlife habitat;
• Reduce municipal sewage overflows;
• Clean up toxic sediments in
Great Lakes Areas of Concern, including the Cuyahoga River;
• Reduce mercury pollution;
• Otherwise implement the Action
Plan to Restore and Protect the
Great Lakes; and
Whereas, local governments need
financial
assistance
to
upgrade
wastewater treatment plants and
infrastructure, to reduce non-point
source pollution; and
Whereas, the Florida Everglades
and
other
nationally
significant
water resources have already benefited from significant federal investments in restoration and protection; and
Whereas, the Great Lakes are a
treasured natural resource in need
of substantial state and federal
financial assistance; and
Whereas, protection of the Great
Lakes is a challenge of utmost significance and scope to the people
of the City of Cleveland, the Northeast Ohio region, the State of Ohio,
and all states and provinces that
comprise the Great Lakes’ basin;
and
Whereas, this monumental challenge includes working to safeguard the quality of the waters in
order to protect these freshwater
resources from threats of out-ofbasin water diversions and to continue to enable our use and enjoyment of this water resource within
the basin; and
Whereas, Canada and the United
States
created
the
International
Joint Commission through the 1909
Boundary Waters Treaty because
they recognized that the two countries need to cooperate in order to
manage these waters wisely and to

The City Record
protect them for the benefit of current and future generations; and
Whereas, in June 2002, the Commission appointed the International
Water Uses Review Task Force to
assist it in carrying out a review of
the issue of water uses in the Great
Lakes basin and to prepare a report
on the topic; and
Whereas, the International Water
Uses Review Task Force finalized a
report to the International Joint
Commission, entitled “Protection of
Waters of the Great Lakes” that
encourages support for a more deliberative approach to finalizing the
Great Lakes Compact to establish
protection of waters of the Great
Lakes from diversion; and
Whereas, the Great Lakes Compact is an amendment to the Great
Lakes Charter of 1985, which is a
non-binding agreement signed by
the Governors of the eight states
and the Premiers of the two Canadian provinces that border the Great
Lakes; and
Whereas,
the
purpose
of
the
Great Lakes Compact is to forge a
new binding agreement to manage
the Great Lakes waters, develop a
decision-making standard for a new
or increased water withdrawals,
and make further commitments to
continue
to
improve
the
Great
Lakes water management system;
and
Whereas, the state of Ohio must
continue its proud tradition of protecting Lake Erie and fulfill its
commitment
to
protecting
and
restoring the Great Lakes by taking
substantial
steps
and,
whenever
practical, match federal funding to
implement the Great Lakes Collaboration Implementation Act; and
Whereas, the state of Ohio should
firmly establish its opposition to
the diversion of Great Lakes water
for the future protection of this
important global resource that is
vital to strengthening the American and Canadian economies and
the vitality of the states and
provinces along the Great Lakes
shores; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports federal and state efforts
to restore the Great Lakes through
the federal “Great Lakes Collaboration Implementation Act” and the
State of Ohio’s “Great Lakes-St.
Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact”.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to Ohio Congressional Delegation, the Governor of Ohio,
the members of the Ohio General
Assembly, the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration, International Joint
Commission
(Canada
&
United
States), Great Lakes Commission,
Council of Great Lakes Governors,
National League of Cities, and the
legislative leadership in the Great
Lakes states and provinces.
Section 3. That this resolution is

and
Whereas, the construction of the

blighted conditions and prevent the
recurrence of blight in the Plan
Area and as a result, this Ordinance
constitutes an emergency measure
