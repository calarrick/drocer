An emergency resolution supporting Cuyahoga County’s proposed
ballot resolution to place before the
voters a health and human services
tax levy that, if passed by the voters at the November 7, 2006 election,
will replace an existing 3.0 mill tax
levy and reduce it by 0.1 mills for a
rate not to exceed 2.9 mills for the
purpose of supplementing the general fund appropriation for health
and human or social services for a
period of four years.
Whereas, on July 27, 2006, the
Board of County Commissioners of
Cuyahoga County adopted a resolution
declaring
it
necessary
to
replace a portion of an existing 3.0
mill tax levy and reduce such levy
by 0.1 mills to constitute a tax levy
at a rate not to exceed 2.9 mills, for
four years, and requesting the County Auditor to certify the total current tax valuation of the County and
the dollar amount of revenue that
would be generated by the 2.9 mill
replacement and reduction levy; and
Whereas, on July 27, 2006, the
County Auditor certified that the
total current tax valuation of the
County is $29,416,835,136 and the dollar amount of revenue that would be
generated by that 2.9 mill replacement and reduction levy would be
$87,217,392 annually during the life
of the levy, assuming that the total
current tax valuation remains the
same throughout the life of the levy;
and
Whereas, on August 17, 2006, the
Board of County Commissioners of
Cuyahoga County adopted a resolution that submitted the proposed
health and human services levy to
the electors of the County on November 7, 2006, after determining that
the amount of taxes which may be
raised by the County within the tenmill limitation by levies on the current tax duplicate will be insufficient to provide for the necessary
requirements of the County; and
Whereas, the County’s proposed
health and human services levy
would replace and reduce the current 3.0 mill levy that has been in
place
at
the
same
level
since
approved in 1989; and
Whereas, the County’s proposed
health and human services levy is
necessary
to
continue
funding
human services that range from the
early childhood “Invest in Children”
program that prepares Cleveland’s
youngest residents to enter school
healthy
and
prepared,
to
the
“Options” and “Passport” programs
that provide home health care to
Cleveland senior citizens; and
Whereas, the County’s proposed
health and human services levy is
necessary to continue base funding
for child welfare, public assistance,
senior citizen, homeless prevention,
foster care, adoption, and at-risk
children services used by Cleveland
citizens; and
Whereas, the proposed health and
human services levy is necessary to
continue annual County subsidies to
the MetroHealth System, the Cuyahoga County Community Mental
Health Board, and the Cuyahoga

The City Record
County Alcohol and Drug Service
used by Cleveland citizens; and
Whereas, the proposed health and
services levy, if passed, will benefit
the City of Cleveland by continuing
to provide a basic safety net of services to meet the increasing needs
in our community; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports Cuyahoga County’s ballot resolution to place before the voters a
