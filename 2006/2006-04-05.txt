By Mayor Jackson and Council
Members Sweeney, Brady, Brancatelli, Britt, Cimperman, Cleveland,
Coats, Conwell, Cummins, Dolan,
Johnson, Kelley, Lewis, Pierce Scott,
Polensek, Reed, Santiago, Turner,
Westbrook, White and Zone.
An emergency resolution opposing
all tax and expenditure limitation
proposals to the Ohio Constitution
that
would
arbitrarily
constrain
state and local governments’ ability
to effectively realize and allocate
the tax resources needed to meet the
people’s needs through a representative democracy and supporting
efforts to defeat these proposed
changes to the Ohio Constitution.
Whereas, the Citizens for Tax
Reform and others are endorsing
proposals to amend the Ohio Constitution to institute tax and expenditure limitations at the state and
local levels of government that
could only be overridden by a popular vote; an example of these proposals is the so-called “Taxpayers
Bill of Rights”; and
Whereas, Colorado has instituted
a similar Constitutional proposal
and faced such severe problems in
meeting the basic needs of their citizenry that voters suspended key
aspects of the law in November,
2005; and
Whereas, such proposals tie the
hands of state and local leaders in
times of crisis and other unpredictable circumstances, circumventing state and local governments’
thoughtful consideration of policy
decisions; and
Whereas, such proposals would
reduce funding for education, health
care, public safety, libraries, economic development, and other vital
services to citizens; and
Whereas, such proposals would
prevent state and local officials
from making the tough decisions
they were elected to make, passing
the responsibility for learning all
aspects of often complex issues to
citizens who have other jobs and
responsibilities; and
Whereas, such proposals allow
taxpayers to sue allow political subdivisions in to compel compliance
with the expenditure limitations and
require that successful plaintiffs be
awarded costs and attorney fees;
and
Whereas, such proposals would
grant veto power to non-voters, in a
perversion of the democratic process, by creating a super-majority
requirement that few political subdivisions could meet; and
Whereas, amending the constitution is a virtually irrevocable action
and should only be undertaken
when
legislative
remedies
have
proven enduringly inadequate; and

599

23
Whereas, such constitutional tinkering brings great harm to local
communities through continued reductions in state funding, derodes
decision-making at the local level
and degrades government’s ability
to provide the basic services residents and businesses expect and
deserve; and
Whereas, such proposals would
force the state and local governments to spend valuable time and
money asking for permission from
the same people who elected them
before any action can be taken on
important issues, and would also
force taxpayers to pay twice for
government — once for elections of
their state and local officials and
again for elections to make the decisions those officials were elected to
make; and
Whereas, such proposals contradict
the
fundamental
principles
upon which our constitution and system of representative government
are based and damages the ability
to craft good public policy; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby opposes all tax and expenditure
limitation proposals to the Ohio Constitution that would arbitrarily constrain state and local governments’
ability to effectively realize and
allocate the tax resources needed to
meet the people’s needs through a
representative democracy and supports efforts to defeat these proposed changes to the Ohio Constitution.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to Governor Bob
Taft, Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, all members of the Ohio General Assembly, the President of the
Ohio Municipal League, the Cuyahoga County Mayors and Managers
Association, the Northeast Ohio Mayors and Managers Association, and
the members of the National League
of Cities.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted March 27, 2006.
Effective March 28, 2006.

Res. No. 577-06.
By Council Member Dolan.
An emergency resolution opposing
House Bill 347, which would disregard a political subdivision’s constitutional right to Home Rule by overriding
a
municipality’s
assault
weapons ban, reasonable gun show
restrictions, ban of firearms from
playgrounds and any other regulations it may have related to firearms, whether in conflict with state
law or not.

24
Whereas, in its latest effort to
extinguish municipal Home Rule in
the state of Ohio, as set forth in
Article III, Section XVIII of the
Ohio Constitution, the Ohio House
passed
House
Bill
347,
which
amends Ohio’s conceal-carry law;
and
Whereas, H.B. 347 says that the
state of Ohio recognizes the right of
every Ohio citizen to have, purchase,
sell,
transfer,
or
transport
any
firearm; and
Whereas, this provision in H.B.
347 attempts to override municipal
assault weapons ban regulations,
reasonable gun show restrictions,
bans of firearms on playgrounds
and any other regulation Home Rule
municipalities may have related to
firearms; and
Whereas, under H.B. 347, local
municipalities with firearms regulations will have to pay attorneys’
fees if its laws are challenged and
found contrary to the proposed state
law; and
Whereas, in a further effort to end
municipal Home Rule authority,
H.B. 347 declares that a local municipality cannot prohibit the sale of
firearms in any area of Ohio zoned
for commercial, retail or industrial
use; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby opposes House Bill 347, which
would disregard a political subdivision’s constitutional right to Home
Rule by overriding a local municipality’s assault weapons ban, reasonable gun show restrictions, ban
of firearms from playgrounds and
any other regulations it may have
related to firearms, whether in conflict with state law or not
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to Governor Bob
Taft, all members of the Ohio state
legislature, and the President of the
Ohio Municipal League.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
