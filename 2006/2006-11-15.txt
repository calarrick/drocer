THE CALENDAR
The following measure will be on
its final passage at the next Council meeting:
ORDINANCE
Ord. No. 1724-06.
By Council Member Sweeney (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Mayor or the Director of
Finance to enter into a tax-sharing
agreement or agreements with the
City of Shaker Heights and University Hospital Health System, Inc. for
the purpose of sharing in tax revenues generated in the Joint Economic Development Zone located in
Shaker Heights for the purpose of
facilitating economic development
associated with the possible relocation and redevelopment of University Hospital Health System, Inc.
facilities.
Whereas, Section 715.69 of the Revised Code provides special provisions for the creation of a Joint Economic Development Zone (“JEDZ”)
and a contract between Cleveland
and Shaker Heights for the purpose
of facilitating economic development,
including the sharing of income
taxes; and
Whereas, Article VIII, Section 13
of the Ohio Constitution also provides to Charter municipalities the
authority to engage in economic
development activities to facilitate
the creation and retention of jobs;
and
Whereas, the Greater Cleveland
economy is adapting to the many
challenges it faces in the global
marketplace; and
Whereas, much of Cuyahoga County is fully developed and the need

2060

November 15, 2006
to diversify the economy and redevelop previously used properties is
readily apparent; and
Whereas, local governments in
Cuyahoga County recognize that it
is imperative that they cooperate
and collaborate with one another for
the benefit of the region and its resident-taxpayers in order to attract
and retain businesses and jobs; and
Whereas, Cleveland and Shaker
Heights are desirous of creating a
new model for inter-municipal cooperation and revenue sharing so that
both may mutually benefit from private investment decisions by University Hospitals Health System,
Inc. (“UHHS”) to redevelop a portion
of the main campus in Cleveland for
a state-of-the-art cancer hospital and
research center and to consolidate
UHHS administrative jobs currently
located in various northeast Ohio
communities into a single location;
and
Whereas, University Hospitals of
Cleveland has decided to locate that
consolidated administrative center
in Shaker Heights and thereby relocate jobs which are presently located at or near the main campus location in Cleveland (“new UHHS facility”); and,
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Mayor or the
Director of Finance is authorized
to enter into a tax-sharing agreement or agreements with the City
of Shaker Heights and UHHS to
share income-tax receipts generated through a JEDZ agreement
related to the proposed relocation
and redevelopment of UHHS.
Section 2. That the agreements
authorized by this ordinance shall
entitle the City to share equally
with the City of Shaker Heights in
the JEDZ’s net income-tax revenues,
which shall be an amount equal to
one-half of all new income tax revenues received by Shaker Heights
from University Hospitals of Cleveland
administrative
employees
presently employed in Cleveland.
Section 3. That all payments by
the City of Shaker Heights under
the agreements authorized by this
ordinance shall be deposited in the
City’s General fund.
Section 4. That the Mayor or the
Director of Finance are authorized
to execute on behalf of Cleveland all
necessary documents to effectuate
the purposes of this ordinance.
Section 5. That the Director of
Finance shall cause a copy of each
agreement that is entered into under
the authority of this ordinance to be
submitted, upon its execution, to the
Clerk of Council for placement in
File No. 1724-06-A.
Section 6. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
