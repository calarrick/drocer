An emergency ordinance authorizing the purchase by one or more
requirement contracts of labor and
materials to implement Cleveland
Public Power’s decorative post and
safety lighting program, for the
Division of Cleveland Public Power,
Department of Public Utilities.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Public Utilities is authorized to
make one or more written requirement contracts under the Charter
and the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, for the requirements for a one or two year
period of the necessary items of
labor and materials to implement
Cleveland Public Power’s decorative
post and safety lighting program, in
the approximate amount as purchased during the preceding term, to
be purchased by the Commissioner
of Purchases and Supplies on a unit
basis for the Division of Cleveland
Public Power, Department of Public
Utilities. Bids shall be taken in a
manner that permits an award to be
made for all items as a single contract, or by separate contract for
each or any combination of the
items as the Board of Control determines. Alternate bids for a period
less than the specified term may be
taken if desired by the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies
until provision is made for the
requirements for the entire term.
The Director of Public Utilities is
authorized to enter into one or more
contracts with a term of two years
instead of one year when there is a
financial advantage to the City. For
purposes of this ordinance, a financial advantage shall be determined
by the Director of Public Utilities by
comparing the bids received for both
terms.
Section 2. That the costs of the
contract
or
contracts
shall
be
charged against the proper appropriation accounts and the Director
of Finance shall certify the amount
of the initial purchase, which purchase, together with all later purchases, shall be made on order of

Supplies under a requisition against
the contract or contracts certified by
the Director of Finance. (RL 157796)
Section 3. That under Section
108(b) of the Charter, the purchases
authorized by this ordinance may be
made through cooperative agreements using state procedures. The
Director of Public Utilities may sign
all documents with the State of Ohio
or any of its political subdivisions
that are necessary to make the purchases, and may enter into one or
more contracts with the vendors
selected through that cooperative
process.
Section 4. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency mea-

sure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 576-06.
By Mayor Jackson and Council
Members Sweeney, Brady, Brancatelli, Britt, Cimperman, Cleveland,
Coats, Conwell, Cummins, Dolan,
Johnson, Kelley, Lewis, Pierce Scott,
Polensek, Reed, Santiago, Turner,
Westbrook, White and Zone.
An emergency resolution opposing
all tax and expenditure limitation
proposals to the Ohio Constitution
that
would
arbitrarily
constrain
state and local governments’ ability
to effectively realize and allocate
the tax resources needed to meet the
people’s needs through a representative democracy and supporting
efforts to defeat these proposed
changes to the Ohio Constitution.
Whereas, the Citizens for Tax
Reform and others are endorsing
proposals to amend the Ohio Constitution to institute tax and expenditure limitations at the state and
local levels of government that
could only be overridden by a popular vote; an example of these proposals is the so-called “Taxpayers
Bill of Rights”; and
Whereas, Colorado has instituted
a similar Constitutional proposal
and faced such severe problems in
meeting the basic needs of their citizenry that voters suspended key
aspects of the law in November,
2005; and
Whereas, such proposals tie the
hands of state and local leaders in
times of crisis and other unpredictable circumstances, circumventing state and local governments’
thoughtful consideration of policy
decisions; and
Whereas, such proposals would
reduce funding for education, health
care, public safety, libraries, eco-

The City Record
nomic development, and other vital
services to citizens; and
Whereas, such proposals would
prevent state and local officials
from making the tough decisions
they were elected to make, passing
the responsibility for learning all
aspects of often complex issues to
citizens who have other jobs and
responsibilities; and
Whereas, such proposals allow
taxpayers to sue allow political subdivisions in to compel compliance
with the expenditure limitations and
require that successful plaintiffs be
awarded costs and attorney fees;
and
Whereas, such proposals would
grant veto power to non-voters, in a
perversion of the democratic process, by creating a super-majority
requirement that few political subdivisions could meet; and
Whereas, amending the constitution is a virtually irrevocable action
and should only be undertaken
when
legislative
remedies
have
proven enduringly inadequate; and
Whereas, such constitutional tinkering brings great harm to local
communities through continued reductions in state funding, derodes
decision-making at the local level
and degrades government’s ability
to provide the basic services residents and businesses expect and
deserve; and
Whereas, such proposals would
force the state and local governments to spend valuable time and
money asking for permission from
the same people who elected them
before any action can be taken on
important issues, and would also
force taxpayers to pay twice for
government — once for elections of
their state and local officials and
again for elections to make the decisions those officials were elected to
make; and
Whereas, such proposals contradict
the
fundamental
principles
upon which our constitution and system of representative government
are based and damages the ability
to craft good public policy; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby opposes all tax and expenditure
limitation proposals to the Ohio Constitution that would arbitrarily constrain state and local governments’
ability to effectively realize and
allocate the tax resources needed to
meet the people’s needs through a
representative democracy and supports efforts to defeat these proposed changes to the Ohio Constitution.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to Governor Bob
Taft, Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, all members of the Ohio General Assembly, the President of the
Ohio Municipal League, the Cuyahoga County Mayors and Managers
Association, the Northeast Ohio Mayors and Managers Association, and
the members of the National League
of Cities.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of

529

Res. No. 577-06.
By Council Member Dolan.
An emergency resolution opposing
House Bill 347, which would disregard a political subdivision’s constitutional right to Home Rule by overriding
a
municipality’s
assault
weapons ban, reasonable gun show
restrictions, ban of firearms from
playgrounds and any other regulations
it
may
have
related
to
firearms, whether in conflict with
state law or not.
Whereas, in its latest effort to
extinguish municipal Home Rule in
the state of Ohio, as set forth in
Article III, Section XVIII of the
Ohio Constitution, the Ohio House
passed
House
Bill
347,
which
amends Ohio’s conceal-carry law;
and
Whereas, H.B 347 says that the
state of Ohio recognizes the right of
every Ohio citizen to have, purchase,
sell,
transfer,
or
transport
any
firearm; and
Whereas, this provision in H.B.
347 attempts to override municipal
assault weapons ban regulations,
reasonable gun show restrictions,
bans of firearms on playgrounds
and any other regulation Home Rule
municipalities may have related to
firearms; and
Whereas, under H.B 347, local
municipalities with firearms regulations will have to pay attorneys’
fees if its laws are challenged and
found contrary to the proposed state
law; and
Whereas, in a further effort to end
municipal Home Rule authority,
H.B. 347 declares that a local municipality cannot prohibit the sale of
firearms in any area of Ohio zoned
for commercial, retail or industrial
use; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby opposes House Bill 347, which
would disregard a political subdivision’s constitutional right to Home
Rule by overriding a local municipality’s assault weapons ban, reasonable gun show restrictions, ban
of firearms from playgrounds and
any other regulations it may have
related to firearms, whether in conflict with state law or not
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby directed to transmit copies of

Taft, all members of the Ohio state
legislature, and the President of the
Ohio Municipal League.

amended by Ordinance No. 650-05,
passed June 6, 2005, relating to configuration of adult video booths.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 237.03 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended by
Ordinance No. 650-05, passed June 6,
2005, is amended to read as follows:
Section 237.03 Configuration
No person shall operate an Adult
Video Arcade or an Adult Live
Entertainment Arcade unless the
Arcade complies with the following
requirements:
(a) It is the duty of the owners
and operator of the premises to
ensure that at least one employee is
on duty and can see the monitor
located at the manager’s station at
all times that any patron is present
inside the premises.
(b) The premises’ owner or operator installs a camera system in the
video booths that complies with the
following requirements:
(1) The owner or operator operates the camera system when any of
the booths are available for viewing
videos.
(2) The owner or operator numbers all the booths in the store with
an individual number so that the
booth is identified on the monitor,

546

March 29, 2006
the digital recording, and the maintenance log.
(3) The camera system includes
an individual camera in each video
booth.
(4) The individual cameras are
placed in the booths in a way that
shows the people inside the booths
from at least the knees to the shoulders.
(5) Each Video Arcade will ensure
that nothing obstructs the camera
from showing the people inside the
booths from at least the knees to the
shoulders.
(6) Each Video Arcade will immediately
remove
anything
that
obstructs the camera from showing
the people inside the booths from at
least the knees to the shoulders.
(7) The camera system has a monitor at the manager’s station so that
the owner, operator, or employee
who is present in the store can view
it.
(8) The monitor faces into the
store’s public area so that it is visible from the public area.
(9) The monitor’s screen is not
obstructed from view from the public area at any time that the store
is open to the public.
(10) The monitoring system operates on a switcher system so that
the monitor switches sequentially
and continuously from one camera
to another. The continuous switching process will be timed to allow
an adequate view of each area surveyed by each camera. The view
inside each booth must be at least
four seconds, but not more than six
seconds. Once the camera system
completes a circuit showing the
inside of all the booths, the system
must immediately start a new circuit showing inside all the booths.
(11) The monitor and the recording identify the booth number for
the booth that is being shown on the
monitor.
(12) The camera system records
the
view
required
in
division
(b)(10) of this section in digital format on a minimum five consecutive
days recording loop. The owner or
operator must maintain at least the
most recent five-day period’s recordings at all times.
(13) The camera system records
the date and time for the recorded
images.
(14) The owner or operator places
a sign that is at least 5" by 7" in a
conspicuous place in each booth
stating words to the effect: “This
arcade installed a video-camera-monitoring-and-recording system in this
booth. The arcade monitors and
records activity in this booth.”
(15) If anyone removes or defaces
the
sign
required
by
division
(b)(14) of Section 237.03, then the
owner or operator will replace the
sign with a new one as soon as
store personnel find that the sign
has been removed or defaced. The
owner or operator must keep enough
extra signs in supply at the store to
be able to replace any sign as needed.
(16) If a camera is not operating
in any booth, the store must close
that booth until the camera is
repaired. “Not operating” means that
the
camera
does
not
transmit
images showing the booth’s interior
so that the image is shown on the
monitor and recorded by the recording device.

March 29, 2006
(17) If the entire camera system
is not operating, then the Video
Arcade may not operate any video
booths until the system is repaired.
(18) Each Video Arcade will keep
a log for every time the camera system or an individual camera is not
working. The log also must note
any time that the sign required by
division (b)(14) of Section 237.03 is
defaced or removed. The log should
show the date and time the camera
or camera system stopped working,
the date and time a repair company
fixed it, and the repair company’s
contact information. The owner or
operator must immediately provide
a copy of this log to City officials
on request.
(c) Restrooms may not contain
video-reproduction equipment and
shall not be used for viewing videos.

person who is the owner’s or operator’s agent or employee, shall fail to
ensure that the requirements of division (b) of this section are met at
all times.
(e)
Except
inside
the
video
booths, the owner or operator will
provide
artificial
light
at
the
premises in all areas where the public is permitted at a level that provides an average illumination of 10
foot candles (107 lux) over the area
at a height of 30 inches above the
floor level. Inside the video booths,
the owner or operator will provide
artificial light at a level that allows
the activities inside the booth to be
clearly visible on the camera system’s monitor and recordings. If
City officials cannot clearly see
activities inside the booths either on
the camera system’s monitor or
recordings, then the Video Arcades
must raise the light level inside the
booths to the point where the activities are clearly visible.
(f) It shall be the duty of the
operator, and it shall also be the
duty of any agents and employees
present in the premises, to ensure
that
the
illumination
described
above is maintained at all times
that any patron is present in the
premises.

time occupies a viewing booth or
room, and to ensure that no person
attempts to make an opening of any
kind between the viewing booths or

oriented business, either personally
or through an agent or employee,

refund the Refunded Bonds, (ii) to
fund any deposit to the Bond Service Reserve Fund or the Renewal
and Replacement Fund required
under the Indenture, (iv) to pay
costs of any Credit Support Instruments, (v) to pay identified amounts
owed under Hedge Agreements, and
(vi) to pay costs of issuing the
Series 2006 Bonds and refunding the
Refunded Bonds. The proceeds from
the sale of each series of Series 2006
Bonds shall be allocated, deposited
and applied as provided in Section 7
of this Ordinance.
The Series 2006 Bonds may be
issued in one or more separate
series, each bearing a distinctive
designation, provided that the Series
2006 Bonds of each series satisfy the
requirements of this Series 2006
Bond Legislation and the Indenture.
Separate series of Series 2006 Bonds
may be issued at the same or different times. The Series 2006 Bonds
of each series shall be designated as
provided in the applicable Certificate of Award (including replacing
references to 2006 to the calendar
year in which the obligations are
issued). A separate Certificate of
Award and a separate Supplemental
Indenture may be delivered for each
series. Costs of issuance of the
Series 2006 Bonds and any required
deposit to the Bond Service Reserve
Fund attributable to the Series 2006
Bonds shall, in each case, be included in the costs funded from the proceeds of the Series 2006 Bonds. The
Series 2006 Bonds shall constitute
Bonds for all purposes of the Indenture.
This Council finds and determines
that the issuance of the Series 2006
Bonds to obtain debt service savings
with respect to Outstanding Bonds
serves a proper, public, municipal
purpose by reducing the cost at
which Cleveland Public Power can
provide electric power.
Section 4. Authorization of Hedging Arrangements.
This Council finds that by engaging
in
interest
rate
hedging
arrangements from time to time, the
City may reduce its cost of borrowing
by
optimizing
the
relative
amounts of fixed and variable rate
obligations and minimizing the risk
of variations in its debt service
costs. Certain types of hedging
arrangements (referred to in this
Series 2006 Bond Legislation as
“swaptions”) may enable to the City
to obtain savings prior to the
issuance of Series 2006 Bonds by
providing for an upfront payment to
the City by a financial institution or
other organization that is the counterparty to the hedge arrangement
in consideration of the City’s giving

34
the counterparty the option to make
effective at a future date an interest rate exchange transaction with
the City. To permit the City to have
the flexibility to undertake interest
rate swap, swaption, rate cap, rate
collar and other hedging transactions from time to time, and to
establish the procedures for approving those transactions, this Council
authorizes the signing and delivery
of one or more agreements (each, a
“Hedge Agreement”) and any related agreements necessary for the
consummation of the transactions
contemplated by each Hedge Agreement. The authorizations in this Section are supplemental to and not in
derogation of any authority provided by any other ordinance of this
Council
concerning
hedging
arrangements, and are all subject to
the requirements and restrictions of
the Indenture.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is to the financial advantage of the City and in the City’s
best
interests
that
a
hedging
arrangement be undertaken by the
City with respect to any Bonds
issued or to be issued under the
Indenture, the Director of Finance
may authorize one or more interest
rate hedge transactions in accordance with the applicable Hedge
Agreement; provided that (a) the
counterparty shall be rated at the
time of signing the Hedge Agreement not lower than A+ or A1 by
at least one rating agency or its
obligations under the Hedge Agreement shall be guaranteed or insured
by an entity rated at the time of
signing the Hedge Agreement not
lower than A+ or A1 by at least one
rating agency, and (b) the term of
each hedge transaction shall not
exceed the final maturity of the
Bonds to which the hedge relates or
(in the case of an option) will
relate. The requirements of this
paragraph are in addition to, and
not in place or in derogation of, any
other applicable requirements of the
Indenture.
The Director of Finance shall
negotiate the terms of each Hedge
Agreement with a counterparty satisfying the credit criteria in this
Series 2006 Bond Legislation and the
Indenture. The City shall receive a
written opinion of a Financial Advisor that the upfront payment or the
periodic payments, as the case may
be, to be made by the counterparty
to the City, or by the City to the
counterparty, shall be fair value for
the Hedge Agreement, given the
credit of the counterparty and the
terms and conditions of the Hedge
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall determine the terms and conditions of the Hedge Agreement,
including without limitation, the
time or times and procedures for the
exercise by the counterparty or the
City, as the case may be, of its
option under the Hedge Agreement,
whether the obligations of the City
under the Hedge Agreement shall be
secured by a Credit Support Instrument, and the rates to be paid by
the counterparty to the City and by
the City to the counterparty under
the Hedge Agreement in the event
of the exercise of the option. The

The City Record
approval of each interest rate hedge
transaction
by
the
Director
of
Finance shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery
of the applicable Hedge Agreement
by the Director of Finance.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from the Net Revenues and the
Pledged Funds as permitted by the
Indenture, and may be payable also
from other funds permitted by law
to be used for the purpose, as identified by the Director of Finance in
the Hedge Agreement. Those payments may be secured by a pledge
of
the
Net
Revenues
and
the
Pledged Funds to the extent permitted by the Indenture, all as determined by the Director of Finance
and set forth in the Hedge Agreement. The obligation of the City to
make payments under any Hedge
Agreement does not and shall not
represent or constitute a general
obligation, debt, bonded indebtedness or a pledge of the faith and
credit of the City or the State of
Ohio. Nothing gives any party to
any Hedge Agreement the right to
have excises, ad valorem or other
taxes levied by the City or the State
of Ohio for the payment of any
amounts due under any Hedge
Agreement.
Section 5. Terms of Series 2006
Bonds.
The Series 2006 Bonds shall contain the terms provided in or determined pursuant to, the Indenture,
this Series 2006 Bond Legislation,
the Series 2006 Certificate of Award
and the Sixth Supplemental Indenture. Each series of Series 2006
Bonds may be secured by a separate
Supplemental Indenture, or a single
Supplemental Indenture may secure
more than one series of Series 2006
Bonds, and the authorization in this
Series 2006 Bond Legislation for the
Sixth Supplemental Indenture shall
encompass the authorization for
those one or more Supplemental
Indentures, regardless of their designation.
(a) General. In the event that the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, determines that the City’s best
interests will be served by causing
a series of Series 2006 Bonds to be
Variable Rate Bonds, then the Director of Finance is authorized to so
specify in the Series 2006 Certificate
of Award. If the Director of Finance
so determines, then the method and
procedure by which the variable
rate of interest to be borne by the
Series 2006 Bonds of that series
shall be determined as provided in
the Sixth Supplemental Indenture,
whether by auction, by reference to
a market index, by a remarketing
agent or otherwise, provided that no
series of variable rate Series 2006
Bonds shall bear interest at a rate
in excess of twenty-five percent
(25%) per year (including any
Series 2006 Bonds held by a provider
of a Credit Support Instrument). The
Director of Finance may determine
that the terms of a variable rate
series of Series 2006 Bonds may or
may not permit the holders to tender their variable rate Series 2006
Bonds for purchase by the City. If
the Director of Finance designates

554

March 29, 2006
any series of Series 2006 Bonds as
Variable Rate Bonds, and if the
Holders of that series of Series 2006
Bonds are to be entitled to tender
those Series 2006 Bonds for purchase, then the Director of Finance
shall also designate for those variable rate Series 2006 Bonds (and
may designate others, from time to
time, in substitution therefor) the
tender agent or agents and the
remarketing agent or agents, which
designations shall be based on the
determination of the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed
to provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable. The Director of Finance is authorized to enter
into agreements in connection with
the delivery of the Series 2006
Bonds, and from time to time thereafter so long as the Series 2006
Bonds
are
outstanding,
with
providers of Credit Support Instruments, tender agents (which may be
the Trustee), remarketing agents
(which may be any of the Original
Purchaser) and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the method of
determining the variable interest
rates, permitting holders the right
of tender and providing for payment
of the purchase price of, or debt service on, the variable rate Series 2006
Bonds. In the event the variable rate
Series 2006 Bonds are issued as auction rate obligations, the Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements, from time to time, with
auction agents and others, or to
cause the Trustee to enter into those
agreements, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor that
the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed
to provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of
any series of Series 2006 Bonds, and
regardless of whether that series of
Series 2006 Bonds bears interest at
variable or fixed rates, is authorized
to contract for a Credit Support
Instrument, and to pay the costs of
it from proceeds of the Series 2006
Bonds, if the Director determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the Credit
Support Instrument will result in a
savings in the cost of the financing
to the City.
(b) Form; Exchange and Transfer.
All Series 2006 Bonds shall be issued
in fully registered form. The Series
2006 Bonds initially shall be delivered only in book-entry form, shall
be registered in the name of the
Depository or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the
custody of the Depository, and shall
not be transferable or exchangeable
(except for transfer to another
Depository or its nominee) without
further action by the City pursuant
to the provisions of the Sixth Supplemental Indenture. No Series 2006

March 29, 2006
Bonds shall be exchanged for or
transferable into a coupon Revenue
Bond or Bonds except to the extent
that the Indenture permits such
exchanges or transfers.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Series 2006 Bonds of any
series for use in a book entry system, the Director of Finance and the
Trustee may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance and the Trustee do not or
are unable to do so, the Director of
Finance and the Trustee, after making provision for notification of the
beneficial
owners
by
the
then
Depository and any other arrangements deemed necessary, shall permit withdrawal of the Series 2006
Bonds of any series from the Depository, and authenticate and deliver
registered Bond certificates to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of action
or inaction of the City, of those persons requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into any agreements
determined by the Director to be
necessary in connection with the
book entry system for the Series
2006 Bonds, after determining that
those agreements will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
under the Indenture (as evidenced
by the Director’s signing of those
agreements).
(c) Dates; Denominations. The
Series 2006 Bonds of each series
shall be dated as of the date or
dates provided in the Series 2006
Certificate of Award for that series.
The Series 2006 Bonds of each series
shall be issued in the denominations
permitted in the Sixth Supplemental
Indenture.
(d) Interest and Place of Payment. The Series 2006 Bonds of each
series shall bear interest at their
respective interest rates specified in
the Series 2006 Certificate of Award
(or, in the case of variable rate
Series 2006 Bonds, determined pursuant to the Sixth Supplemental
Indenture) for that series. The
Series 2006 Bonds of each series
shall bear interest from the most
recent date to which interest has
been paid or duly provided for or, if
no interest has been paid or duly
provided for, from their date. The
principal and any redemption premium and the interest payable on
each series of Series 2006 Bonds
shall be payable at the times, to the
persons and in the manner set forth
in, or referenced by, the Supplemental Indenture, including, without
limitation, provisions thereof permitting special arrangements for
payments to the Depository.
(e) Maturities. The Series 2006
Bonds of each series shall mature
on the Principal Retirement Dates
and in accordance with the Principal Retirement Schedule specified in
the Series 2006 Certificate of Award,
consistent with this Series 2006
Bond Legislation and the Indenture
and subject to any provisions for
their optional or mandatory redemption specified in the Series 2006 Cer-

The City Record
tificate of Award pursuant to this
Series 2006 Bond Legislation.
(f) Optional and Mandatory Redemption. The Series 2006 Bonds of
each series may be subject to
redemption prior to maturity at the
option of the City, if and to the
extent so provided in the Series 2006
Certificate of Award for that series.
Any Series 2006 Bonds so determined
to be subject to optional redemption
and maturing by their stated terms
after the earliest optional redemption date shall be subject to redemption at the option of the City on or
after the earliest optional redemption date in whole or in part on any
date at the redemption prices provided in the Series 2006 Certificate
of Award and in accordance with
the Indenture. The Series 2006 Bonds
designated in the Series 2006 Certificate of Award as Term Bonds
subject to mandatory sinking fund
redemption shall be redeemed prior
to maturity on each Mandatory
Redemption Date designated in the
Series 2006 Certificate of Award in
the aggregate amount of the Mandatory Sinking Fund Installment to be
paid on such Mandatory Redemption
Date, all as provided in the Series
2006 Certificate of Award and in
accordance with the Indenture.
(g)
Signing.
The
Series
2006
Bonds shall be signed by the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, and
approved as to form by the Director
of Law. Any or all of the signatures
of those officials may be facsimiles.
The Series 2006 Bonds shall bear the
corporate seal of the City or a facsimile thereof.
(h) Numbering. The Series 2006
Bonds shall be numbered as determined by the Director of Finance.
Section 6. Award and Sale of
Series 2006 Bonds.
The Director of Finance shall sign
and deliver a Series 2006 Certificate
of Award for the Series 2006 Bonds.
In the event the Series 2006 Bonds
are issued in more than one series
sold at different times, a separate
Series 2006 Certificate of Award
shall be signed and delivered for
each separately delivered series.
Each series of Series 2006 Bonds
shall bear such designation as the
Director of Finance determines to be
appropriate (including, without limitation, changing 2006 to the year in
which the series is issued). The sale
of the Series 2006 Bonds shall be
awarded to the firm or firms (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”)
identified
in
the
Certificate
of
Award, following consultation with
the Director of Public Utilities and
based on an evaluation of the qualifications of firms that have proposed to underwrite the Series 2006
Bonds. Each Series 2006 Certificate
of Award shall determine the following, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, consistent
with this Series 2006 Bond Legislation and the Indenture:
(a)
the
aggregate
principal
amount of Series 2006 Bonds issued;
(b) the Purchase Price to be paid
to the City by the Original Purchaser, which amount shall be not
less than: (i) 97% of the amount
determined by adding to the aggregate principal amount of the Series
2006 Bonds any aggregate original

555

35
issue premium and subtracting from
that amount any aggregate original
issue discount, plus (ii) any accrued
interest on the Series 2006 Bonds
from their date to the date of their
delivery to the Original Purchaser;
(c) whether any Series 2006 Bonds
are to be subject to optional redemption prior to maturity, and, if so, the

those Series 2006 Bonds that are subject to prior redemption, which shall
be not later than ten years from the
first interest payment date of the
applicable series, and the applicable
Optional Redemption Price, which
shall be not greater than 102% of
the principal amount redeemed;
(d)
the
Principal
Retirement
Dates, the Term Maturity Dates (if
any), and the Mandatory Redemption Dates (if any) on which principal of the Series 2006 Bonds is to
be paid, which shall be not later
than thirty (30) years from their
respective dates of issuance;
(e) the Specified Interest Rates to
be borne by Series 2006 Bonds bearing interest at a fixed rate, the
weighted average of which shall not
exceed six percent (6%) as to Series
2006 Bonds of any series and the
method by which the interest rate is
to be determined for Series 2006
Bonds bearing interest at variable
rates, consistent with Section 6
(Series 2006 Bonds of the same
series and same maturity may bear
interest at different interest rates);
(f) the particular Outstanding
Bonds or portions thereof to be
Refunded Bonds;
(g) the title and series designation for the Series 2006 Bonds;
(h) the amount, if any, of proceeds of the sale of the Series 2006
Bonds to be deposited in the Bond
Service Reserve Fund in order to
cause the balance therein to equal
the Bond Reserve Requirement, if
and to the extent required by the
Sixth Supplemental Indenture, and
any determination as to whether
there shall be special reserve fund
for the Series 2006 Bonds of any
series, separate from the common
Bond Service Reserve Fund, or a
Credit Facility from a Qualified
Credit Facility Provider or any
other instrument in lieu of a funded reserve fund, all as may be permitted by the Indenture;
(i) the Paying Agent; and
(j) whether any Series 2006 Bonds
are to be secured by or payable from
a Credit Support Instrument.
It is determined that the terms of
the Series 2006 Bonds as so determined and specified in the Series
2006 Certificate of Award within the
limitations set forth in this Series
2006 Bond Legislation and as permitted or required by the Indenture
will be in the best interest of the
City and consistent with all legal
requirements.
The Director of Finance may
enter into one or more Series 2006
Bond Purchase Agreements with the
Original Purchaser of Series 2006
Bonds setting forth the conditions
for delivery of the Series 2006 Bonds
that are consistent with this Series
2006 Bond Legislation, the Series
2006 Certificate of Award, and the
Indenture and that are determined
by the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial

36
Advisor, to be customary for comparable revenue bonds issued by
governmental
entities,
including,
without limitation, representations
as to the accuracy and completeness
of information contained in the Official Statement of the City described
in Section 11.
Section 7. Allocation of Purchase
Price for the Series 2006 Bonds;
Refunding
of
Refunded
Bonds;
Escrow Agreements. The net proceeds from the sale of the Series
2006 Bonds (consisting of the Purchase Price less bond insurance premiums and other costs of Credit Support Instruments) shall be received
and receipted for by the Director of
Finance or by the Trustee on the
City’s behalf and shall be allocated,
deposited and credited as follows,
all pursuant to and in accordance
with the Indenture: (a) to the Interest Payment Account in the Bond
Service Fund, that portion, if any,

Series 2006 Bonds from their date to
the date of their delivery; (b) to the
Bond Service Reserve Fund, the
amount, if any, necessary to cause
the balance therein to equal the
Bond Reserve Requirement; (c) to
the Renewal and Replacement Fund,
the amount, if any, necessary to
cause the balance therein to equal
the Renewal and Replacement Fund
Required Balance; (d) to the Series

of the Refunded Bonds; (e) to the
counterparty
under
any
Hedge
Agreement, any payment determined
by the Director of Finance to be
paid from the proceeds of the
Refunding Bonds, including any termination payment in the event that
the Director of Finance determines
it is in the best interests of the City
to terminate a Hedge Agreement
relating to Outstanding Bonds; and
(f) to an account to be created
under the Indenture for the payment
of costs of issuance, such amounts
as are needed to pay costs of issuing the Series 2006 Bonds and
refunding the Refunded Bonds. The
proceeds from the sale of the Series
2006 Bonds are appropriated and
shall be used for the purposes for
which the Series 2006 Bonds are
issued as provided in this Series
2006 Bond Legislation.
The Director of Finance is authorized to sign and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of the City, a
Series
2006
Escrow
Agreement
between the City and the Trustee,
as Series 2006 Escrow Agent, providing for, among other matters: the
investment and holding in escrow of
the proceeds of the Series 2006
Bonds to be applied to the refunding of the Refunded Bonds; the
application of the moneys derived
from those investments to the payment of the Bond Service Charges
on those Refunded Bonds; and the
irrevocable call for redemption of
the Refunded Bonds to be called for
redemption prior to maturity. The
Director of Finance shall provide for
the payment of the services rendered and for reimbursement of
expenses incurred pursuant to the
Series 2006 Escrow Agreement from
proceeds of the Series 2006 Bonds to

The City Record
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose. Provision shall be
made in the Series 2006 Escrow
Agreement to give the Trustee any
written
notice
of
redemption
required under Article III of the
Original Indenture. The Director of
Finance, the Director of Public Utilities and other appropriate City officials shall sign all documents and
take all other actions necessary or
appropriate on the part of the City
to effect such refunding in accordance with the Indenture and to
cause the Refunded Bonds to be
deemed paid and discharged, including without limitation, the retention
of an independent firm of accountants to verify the mathematical
accuracy of the calculations relating
to the escrow.
Section 8. Sixth Supplemental Indenture. In order to secure the payment of Bond Service Charges as
and when due and payable, the
Director of Finance and the Director of Public Utilities are hereby
authorized, in the name and on
behalf of the City, to make, execute,
acknowledge and deliver to the
Trustee, a Sixth Supplemental Indenture, approved as to form and
correctness by the Director of Law,
not inconsistent with this Series
2006 Bond Legislation, the Series
2006 Certificate of Award and the
Indenture
and
not
substantially
adverse to the City as may be
approved by the officers executing
the same on behalf of the City. The
determination by such officers that
the Sixth Supplemental Indenture is
not substantially adverse to the City
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the execution of the Sixth Supplemental Indenture by such officers.
This Series 2006 Bond Legislation
shall constitute a part of the Sixth
Supplemental Indenture as therein
provided and for all purposes thereof, including, without limitation, the
application to this Series 2006 Bond
Legislation of the provisions of the
Sixth Supplemental Indenture relating to amendment, modification,
supplementation and severability.
Without limiting the generality of
the authorization contained in the
preceding paragraph, the Sixth Supplemental Indenture may also (subject to Article VIII of the Original
Indenture
and
any
applicable
requirements thereof for the obtaining of consent of Bondholders and
further subject to any applicable
requirement for the obtaining of
consent from any insurer of any outstanding Bonds) include provisions
for such additional amendments,
supplements and modifications to
the Original Indenture, as previously amended and supplemented, as
the officers executing the Sixth Supplemental Indenture on behalf of the
City determine serve the best interests of the City by making the
Indenture more flexible, useful and
advantageous for the City’s purposes of financing Capital Costs or
refunding outstanding Bonds without materially increasing the City’s
obligations under the Indenture or
materially increasing the restrictions imposed on the City by the

556

March 29, 2006
Indenture, and their execution of
the Sixth Supplemental Indenture
shall conclusively evidence their
having made that determination.
The authority conferred by the preceding sentence shall include the
authorization to cause the Original
Indenture as amended and supplemented by the Sixth Supplemental
Indenture and all preceding Supplemental Indentures to be restated in
a single amended and restated
Indenture, and the authorization in
this Section 8 for the execution of
the Sixth Supplemental Indenture
shall encompass the authorization
for the execution of any such
amended and restated Indenture.
Section 9. Tax Covenants.
With respect to Series 2006 Bonds
that are to be issued and sold as
obligations bearing interest to be
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes (the “TaxExempt Bonds”), the City covenants
that it will use, and will restrict the
use and investment of, the proceeds
of the Tax-Exempt Bonds in such
manner and to such extent as may
be necessary so that (a) the interest on the Tax-Exempt Bonds will
be excluded from gross income for
federal income tax purposes, and
(b) in the case of any Tax-Exempt
Bonds qualifying as bonds, the interest on which is not treated as an
item of tax preference under Section
57 of the Code (“Non-AMT Bonds”),
such Tax-Exempt Bonds will be
treated as Non-AMT Bonds.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the TaxExempt Bonds to be and to remain
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will
not take or authorize to be taken
any actions that would adversely
affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or
persons acting for it, will, among
other acts of compliance, (i) apply
the proceeds of the Tax-Exempt
Bonds to the governmental purposes
of the borrowing, (ii) restrict the
yield on investment property, (iii)
make timely and adequate payments
to the federal government, (iv)
maintain books and records and
make calculations and reports, and
(v) refrain from certain uses of
those proceeds and, as applicable, of
property financed with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the
extent necessary to assure such
exclusion of that interest under the
Code.
The Director of Finance, or any
other officer of the City having
responsibility for issuance of the
Tax-Exempt Bonds, is hereby authorized (a) to make or effect any election, selection, designation, choice,
consent, approval, or waiver on
behalf of the City with respect to
the Tax-Exempt Bonds as the City
is permitted or required to make or
give under the federal income tax
laws, including, without limitation
thereto, any of the elections provided for in Section 148(f)(4)(C) of the
Code or available under Section 148
of the Code, for the purpose of
assuring, enhancing or protecting
the favorable tax treatment or status of the Tax-Exempt Bonds or

March 29, 2006
interest thereon or assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose,
reducing
the
burden
or
expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or payments
of penalties, or making payments of
special amounts in lieu of making
computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as rebate, or
obviating those amounts or payments, as determined by that officer,
which action shall be in writing and
signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf
of the City, as may be appropriate
to assure the exclusion of interest
from gross income and the intended
tax status of the Tax-Exempt Bonds,
and (c) to give one or more appropriate certificates of the City, for
inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Tax-Exempt Bonds,
setting forth the reasonable expectations of the City regarding the
amount and use of all the proceeds
of the Tax-Exempt Bonds, the facts,
circumstances
and
estimates
on
which they are based, and other
facts and circumstances relevant to
the tax treatment of the interest on
and the tax status of the TaxExempt Bonds.
Each covenant made in this Section 9 with respect to the TaxExempt Bonds is also made with
respect to all issues any portion of
the debt service on which is paid
from proceeds of the Tax-Exempt
Bonds (and, if different, the original
issue and any refunding issues in a
series of refundings), to the extent
such compliance is necessary to
assure exclusion of interest on the
Tax-Exempt
Bonds
from
gross
income for federal income tax purposes, and the officers identified
above are authorized to take actions
with respect to those issues as they
are authorized in this Section to
