Sweeney (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Public Utilities
to employ one or more professional

to
evaluate
whether

Cleveland Public Power should participate in the proposed AMP-Ohio
generating facility or other generating projects and to provide any
opinions and certifications required
by the CPP bond indenture.
The selection of the consultants
for the services shall be made by
the Board of Control on the nomination of the Director of Public Utilities from a list of qualified consultants available for employment as

Issue 5, Smoke Free Ohio law and
go into effect if both laws pass; and
Whereas, Issue 4 is backed by Big

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 1692-06.
By Council Member White.
An emergency resolution supporting the Board of County Commissioners’ Clean Ohio Assistance Fund
grant application to the Ohio Department of Development for asbestos abatement and demolition of
certain buildings for development of
the Miles Shopping Plaza.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the Board of County Commissioners’ Clean Ohio Assistance Fund
grant
application
to
the
Ohio
Department
of
Development
for
asbestos abatement and demolition
of certain buildings located at 4141
East 131st Street, 4159 East 131st
Street, 13109 Miles Avenue, 13201
Miles Avenue, and 13205 Miles Avenue for development of the Miles
Shopping Plaza.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to send copies of this
resolution to the Ohio Department of
Development, the Board of County
Commissioners of Cuyahoga County,
and to Union Miles Development
Corporation.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted October 9, 2006.
Effective October 13, 2006.

Res. No. 1694-06.
By Council Member Dolan.
An emergency resolution urging
Ohio Supreme Court Justices to
immediately and voluntarily recuse
themselves from all pending cases

when they have accepted contributions from parties involved; urging
the Ohio Supreme Court to restore
public confidence in the judiciary by
requiring all Ohio judges to recuse
themselves from all pending cases
when they have accepted contributions from litigants involved in such
cases; and urging the Ohio Supreme
Court to restore and promote the
public perception of a fair and
impartial judiciary in Ohio by prohibiting all judges in Ohio from
receiving contributions from litigants involved in said cases.
Whereas, on October 1, 2006 New
York Times and Columbus Dispatch
newspapers
reported
that
Ohio
Supreme Court Justices routinely sit
on cases after receiving campaign
contributions
from
the
parties
involved or from groups that file
support briefs in active pending
cases; and
Whereas, in the 12 years studied
by the New York Times, Ohio
Supreme Court justices almost never
disqualified themselves from hearing contributors’ cases; and
Whereas, the Code of Judicial
Ethics requires judges to disqualify
themselves
whenever
their
impartiality might reasonably be questioned over financial or other conflicts; the exception to this is campaign contributions; and
Whereas, in order to maintain the
public trust in our judiciary, the
Codes of Professional Conduct and
Judicial Ethics require all attorneys
and judges to avoid all conduct that
creates an appearance of impropriety, and to disqualify themselves
whenever their impartiality might
reasonably be questioned over financial or other conflicts; and
Whereas, special interest groups
are paying a larger and more powerful role in the elections of judges
in Ohio; and
Whereas, according to the New
York Times, justices campaigns routinely took contributions after cases
involving contributors were argued,
and before they were decided; and
Whereas, taking financial contributions from litigants in pending
cases creates the perception and
appearance that Justices decisions
can be influenced and/or bought;
indeed, such contributions may be
perceived by the public as bribes;
Whereas, Justices’ acceptance of
financial contributions from litigants with cases pending before
them creates a clear appearance of
impropriety, sullies the public perception of an impartial judiciary
and undermines the public trust in
Ohio’s judicial integrity; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
Ohio Supreme Court Justices to
immediately and voluntarily recuse
themselves from all pending cases
when they have accepted contributions from parties involved while
said causes are pending before the
Court.

1878

October 18, 2006
Section 2. That this Council urges
Ohio Supreme Court to restore the
public trust in our judiciary by
immediately
requiring
all
Ohio
judges to recuse themselves from all
pending cases in which they have
accepted
contributions
from
litigants while said causes are pending
before the Court.
Section 3. That this Council urges
Ohio Supreme Court to restore and
promote the public perception of a
fair and impartial judiciary in Ohio
by prohibiting all judges in Ohio
from receiving contributions from
litigants involved in cases pending
before their Courts.
Section 4. That the Clerk is directed to transmit copies of this resolution to the American Bar Association, the Ohio State Bar Association
Office of Professional Standards and
to all Justices sitting on the Ohio
Supreme Court.
Section 5. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted October 9, 2006.
Effective October 13, 2006.

Res. No. 1695-06.
By Council Member Coats.
An emergency resolution objecting to the transfer of Liquor License
of a D1, D2, D3 and D3A Liquor Permit to 18310 Euclid Avenue.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Department of Liquor
Control of an application for a transfer of Liquor License of a D1, D2,
D3 and D3A Liquor Permit from
Kamms Korner Tavern, Inc., DBA
Kilbane’s Restaurant and Pub, 16800
Lorain Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44111,
Permanent Number 44656470001 to
JC & RW Enterprises, Inc., DBA
Euclid Green Lanes, 18310 Euclid
Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44112, Permanent Number 4261287; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and

October 18, 2006
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to
Section 4303.26 of the Ohio Revised
Code. Council’s objection to said
permit must be received by the
Director of Liquor Control within
30 days of notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby record its objection to a transfer of Liquor License of a D1, D2,
D3 and D3A Liquor Permit from
Kamms Korner Tavern, Inc., DBA
Kilbane’s Restaurant and Pub, 16800
Lorain Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44111,
Permanent Number 44656470001 to
JC & RW Enterprises, Inc., DBA
Euclid Green Lanes, 18310 Euclid
Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44112, Permanent Number 4261287; and requests the Director of Liquor Control to set a hearing for said application in accordance with provisions
of Section 4303.26 of the Revised
Code of Ohio.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she is hereby directed to
transmit two certified copies of this
resolution, together with two copies
of a letter of objection and two
copies of a letter requesting that the
hearing be held in Cleveland, Cuyahoga County.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted October 9, 2006.
Effective October 13, 2006.

Ord. No. 1250-A-05 (As a substitute
for Ord. No. 1250-05).
By Council Members Westbrook,
Brady, Conwell, Turner, Santiago,
Polensek, Cummins and Zone.
An ordinance to supplement the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, by enacting new Sections
630.01 through 630.05, relating to
criminal activity as a nuisance.
Whereas, certain activities that
are violations of the law that repeatedly occur at certain properties
adversely affect citizens of the City
of Cleveland and are found to be
nuisances: and
Whereas, properties that generate
repeated calls for public safety service because of activities that are
violations of the law place an undue

The City Record
and inappropriate burden on the taxpayers of the City, and an undue
burden on the City’s safety forces;
and
Whereas, such repeated activities
interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life and property for the

nuisance property and may abate
the nuisance as provided in Section
630.02.
Section 630.02
Action to Abate
Nuisances; Costs of Enforcement
(a) Notice of Declaration of Nuisance. The Director of Public Safety or his or her designee, upon finding that three (3) or more nuisance
activities as defined in Section
630.01 have occurred on separate
occasions within any thirty (30) day
period on the same property, may
cause a written notice and order to
be served on the owner of the property declaring that the property is a
nuisance property. This notice and
order shall identify the nuisance
activities, and the estimated costs to
abate any future nuisance activity;
shall state that the owner may
avoid being charged the costs of
abatement by taking steps to prevent any further nuisance activity
as set forth in division (d) of this
Section; and shall state the appeal
process. The notice shall further
state that if a fourth or subsequent
nuisance activity as defined in Section 630.01 occurs later than thirteen
(13) days after the date of the written nuisance declaration notice and
within twelve (12) months of the
date of the third or any subsequent
nuisance activity, the City may
abate the nuisance by responding to
the activities using administrative
and law enforcement actions, and
the costs of the abatement shall be
charged to the owner of the nuisance property and may be certified
as a lien on the nuisance property.
Notice shall be deemed properly
delivered by delivering it personally to the owner or leaving it at the
owner’s usual place of business or
residence, or by mailing it to the
owner, or, if it cannot be served in
any of the other ways mentioned
above, by publishing it once in a
newspaper of general circulation
within the City, or by posting it in
a conspicuous place on the real
estate involved.
(b) Abatement. If the Director of
Public Safety or his or her designee
determines that a fourth or subsequent nuisance activity as defined
in Section 630.01 occurs later than
thirteen (13) days after the date of
the initial written nuisance declaration notice and within twelve (12)
months after the date of the third
or any subsequent nuisance activity, the City may abate the nuisance
activity by using administrative
and law enforcement actions, and
the costs of the abatement shall be
charged to the owner of the prop-

The City Record
erty and, if not paid, may be certified by the Commissioner of Assessments and Licenses to the County
Auditor to be placed on the nuisance property as a lien to be collected as other taxes and returned
to the City. The cost to abate the
nuisance activity shall be calculated as set forth in division (c). The
City shall provide notice to the
owner of the nuisance property of
the City’s decision to charge the
cost of abatement. If the costs are
not paid by the owner, the City
shall notify the owner at least thirty (30) days before the costs are
certified to the County Auditor. The
notice shall contain a street address
or legal description of the property,
a description of the nuisance activities and the cost to abate. Notices
shall be served as set forth in division (a) of this section. The Director of Law may take any other
action necessary to collect the costs
of abatement.
(c) Costs of Abatement. Costs of
abatement
shall
be
determined
based on the time required to
respond to the nuisance activity
multiplied by an hourly rate based
upon the wages and benefits of a
police officer, dispatch costs, vehicle
and equipment costs, and supervisory and administrative costs. The
hourly rate may be adjusted based
on the number of police officers
required to abate the nuisance.
(d) Nuisance Abatement Plan. The
owner of a nuisance property may
avoid being charged the cost of
abating future nuisances if the
owner meets with the Director of
Public Safety or his or her designee;
presents a plan to prevent further
nuisance activity and that plan is
approved by the Director of Public
Safety or his or her designee; and
implements the plan.
(e) Appeal. The owner of a nuisance
property
who
receives
a
notice declaring the owner’s property to be a nuisance property, a
notice charging the cost of abating
nuisance activity, or a notice that
the cost of abatement shall be certified to the County Auditor, may
appeal the notice by submitting a
written request to the City official
who issued the notice within ten
(10) days of the date of the notice.
If, after a decision on that appeal,
the owner disagrees with the decision, the owner may appeal the decision of the City official to the Board
of Zoning Appeals. An appeal to the
Board of Zoning Appeals shall be
made within fifteen (15) days of the
postmark date of the decision from
the City official denying the appeal.
The Board shall conduct a hearing
and render a decision in accordance
with City ordinances and regulations governing its conduct and procedure. An appeal to the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall not stay any
actions by the City to abate any subsequent nuisance activity. In an
appeal to the Board of Zoning
Appeals of a nuisance declaration
notice, the City must show by a preponderance of the evidence that
there was probable cause to believe

1880

October 18, 2006
that each nuisance activity stated in
the
notice
being
appealed
has
occurred, and that the declaration of
the property as a nuisance property
is justified. In an appeal to the
Board of Zoning Appeals of a notice
charging the cost of abating nuisance activity, or a notice that the
cost of abatement shall be certified
to the County Auditor, the City must
show by a preponderance of the evidence that the charging of abatement costs or the certification of
abatement costs is justified. The
owner may prevail on appeal of any
notice if the owner demonstrates by
a preponderance of the evidence
that:
(1) He or she was not the owner
at the time of any of the nuisance
activity that is the basis of the
notice; or
(2) He or she had knowledge of
the nuisance activity, but promptly
and vigorously took all actions necessary to abate the nuisance activity
including,
without
limitation,
compliance with the requirements of
division (C) of Section 5321.17 and
division (A)(9) of Section 5321.04 of
the Revised Code; or
(3) He or she had no knowledge
of the nuisance activity and could
not, with reasonable care and diligence, have known of the nuisance
activity; and upon receipt of the
notice of the declaration of the property as a nuisance property, he or
she promptly took all actions necessary to abate the nuisance including, without limitation, compliance
with the requirements of division
(C) of Section 5321.17 and division
(A)(9) of Section 5321.04 of the
Revised Code.
Section 630.03
Failure to Abate
Nuisance Activity
(a) Whenever a property owner
has been billed on three (3) or more
separate dates within a two-year
time period for the cost to abate nuisance activity under this Chapter,
the Director of Public Safety, or his
or her designee, shall notify the
property owner that he or she may
be issued a criminal citation for a
misdemeanor of the second degree
thirty (30) days after the third bill
is issued.
(b) No property owner shall fail
to abate nuisance activity within
thirty (30) days after the third bill
within a two-year time period for
the cost to abate nuisance activity
under this Chapter.
(c) Whoever violates this section
is guilty of failure to abate nuisance
activity, a misdemeanor of the second degree.
Section 630.04 Other Legal Actions
Not Affected
The declaration of a nuisance
property, an order to abate a nuisance, or the charging or assessment of costs by the City on a property under this chapter, do not
affect or limit the City’s right or
authority to bring criminal prosecution or other legal action against
any person for violation of the
City’s ordinances, including legal

October 18, 2006
action brought under Sections 619.24
and 619.25 of the Codified Ordinances.
Section 630.05 Severability
If any clause, sentence, paragraph
or part of this chapter, or its application to any person or circumstance, shall for any reason be
adjudged by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect, impair or
invalidate the remainder of this
Chapter nor the application of such
clause, sentence, paragraph or part
to other persons or circumstances
but shall be confined in its operation to the clause, sentence, paragraph or part and to the persons or
circumstances directly involved in
the controversy in which such judgment shall have been rendered. It is
declared to be the legislative intent
that this Chapter would have been
adopted had such provisions not
been included or such persons or circumstances been expressly excluded
from their coverage.
Section 2. That this ordinance
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
