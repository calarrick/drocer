ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 25-06.
By Mayor Jackson and Council
Members Sweeney, Pierce Scott, Kelley, Brady, Brancatelli, Britt, Cimperman, Cleveland, Coats, Conwell,
Cummins, Dolan, Johnson, Lewis,
Polensek, Reed, Santiago, Turner,
Westbrook, White and Zone.
An emergency resolution opposing
Ohio Senate Bill 82 which prohibits
political subdivisions from requiring
their permanent full-time employees
to reside in any specific area of the
state as such bill violates the right
of local self government which is
afforded the citizens of a charter
municipality under the Ohio Constitution.
Whereas, pursuant to the Ohio
Constitution, the City of Cleveland
has adopted a charter by which it
exercises all powers of local self
government; and
Whereas, one such power is the
power to require City residency as
a condition of employment; and
Whereas, in 1982, the citizens of
the City of Cleveland voted to
amend their Charter to require
employees of the City to be bona
fide residents of the City and

The City Record
remain residents during their terms
of employment; and
Whereas,
Cleveland’s
Charter
amendment requiring City residency
as a condition of employment was
an exercise of the constitutional
rights of the citizens of the City of
Cleveland: generally, the right to
govern themselves; and specifically,
the right to establish residency as a
condition of employment; and
Whereas, Senate Bill 82 is unconstitutional as it directly conflicts
with a municipality’s home rule
powers; and
Whereas, Senate Bill 82 prevents
the citizens of the City of Cleveland
and other charter municipalities
from exercising their constitutional
rights, including the right to require
employees, as a condition of employment, to live in a specific area; and
Whereas, Senate Bill 82 is part of
a continuing attempt by the Ohio
General Assembly to eliminate the
right of the citizens of charter
municipalities in Ohio to adopt a
charter and to exercise the powers
of local self government; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby opposes Ohio Senate Bill 82
which prohibits political subdivisions from requiring their permanent full-time employees to reside in
any specific area of the state, as
such bill violates the right of local
self government which is afforded
the citizens of a charter municipality under the Ohio Constitution.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to Governor Bob
Taft, all members of the Ohio General Assembly, the President of the
Ohio Municipal League, the Cuyahoga County Mayors and Managers
Association, the Northeast Ohio Mayors and Managers Association, and
the members of the National League
of Cities.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted January 9, 2006.
Effective January 10, 2006.

Res. No. 26-06.
By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency resolution withdrawing objection to the transfer
of ownership of a D2, D2X and D3
Liquor Permit at 3528-30 Independence Road, and repealing Resolution
No. 1554-05, objecting to said transfer.
Whereas, this Council objected to
a D2, D2X and D3 Liquor Permit to

Whereas, this Council wishes to

Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,

D2X and D3 Liquor Permit to
Nicholas Albondante, DBA Stop In

No. 1688-05 adopted by the Council
on September 12, 2005; and

withdrawn and Resolution No. 168805, containing such objection, be and

Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and provided it receives the

the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
