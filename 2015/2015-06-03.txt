Section 1 of Ordinance No. 495-13,
passed May 6, 2013, relating to a
requirement contract of labor and
materials necessary for analysis,
identification, storage, remediation,
transportation, recycling and disposal of various chemicals, hazardous
waste products and other non-hazardous and recyclable waste materials for the Department of Public Utilities; and to authorize the Director to
exercise the first option to renew Contract No. RC 2014-25 with RJB Enterprises dba Chemtron Corporation.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 1 of Ordinance No. 495-13, passed May 6, 2013, is
amended to read as follows:

Section 1. That the Director of Public Utilities is authorized to make one
or more written requirement contracts under the Charter and the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio,
1976, for the requirements for the period up to two years, with two one-year
options to renew, of the necessary
items of labor and materials necessary for analysis, identification, storage, remediation, transportation,
recycling and disposal of various
chemicals, hazardous waste products
and other non-hazardous and recyclable waste materials, in the approximate amount as purchased during
the preceding term, to be purchased
by the Commissioner of Purchases
and Supplies on a unit basis for the
Divisions of Water, Cleveland Public
Power, and Water Pollution Control,
Department of Public Utilities. The
first of the one-year options to renew
may not be exercised without additional legislative authority. If such
additional legislative authority is
granted and the first of the one-year
options to renew is exercised, then the
second of the one-year options to
renew may be exercised at the option
of the Director of Public Utilities,
without the necessity of obtaining
additional authority of this Council.
Bids shall be taken in a manner that
permits an award to be made for all
items as a single contract, or by separate contract for each or any combination of the items as the Board of Control determines. Alternate bids for a
period less than the specified term
may be taken if desired by the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies
until provision is made for the
requirements for the entire term.
Section 2. That existing Section 1 of
Ordinance No. 495-13, passed May 6,
2013, is repealed.
Section 3. That the Director of Public Utilities is authorized to exercise
the first option to renew Contract No.

the approximate amount of $150,000,
with RJB Enterprises dba Chemtron
Corporation, for the requirements for
an additional year of the necessary
items of labor and materials necessary for analysis, identification, storage, remediation, transportation,
recycling and disposal of various
chemicals, hazardous waste products
and other non-hazardous and recyclable waste materials, for the Divisions of Water, Cleveland Public
Power, and Water Pollution Control,
Department of Public Utilities. This
ordinance constitutes the additional
legislative authority required by
Ordinance No. 495-13 to exercise this
option.
Section 4. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure
and, provided it receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take
effect and be in force immediately
upon its passage and approval by the
Mayor; otherwise it shall take effect
and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.

The City Record

Council is the legislative branch
of the municipal government of the
City of Cleveland.
The Office of
City Council conducts a wide array
of research, policy, legislative, document management, archive and
publishing activities. In 2009, Council contracted for professional services to create a comprehensive Legislative Management System (LMS),
to serve as the operational spine for
a wide array of current Council
functions, be integrated with existing office software/hardware/network infrastructure, and have the
capacity to bring additional functionality and integration in the
future. Council selected the OnBase
software as a service platform,
which has been customized for the
legislative functions of Council.
Through this RFP, Council is
seeking
proposals
for
the
next
phase of LMS development.
Council’s major goals for its LMS is to
integrate many users across multiple platforms, continue to reduce the
cost of managing Council’s workflow, and to become as “paperless”
as possible. The Council is seeking
a proven software solution to meet
these goals. The Council is also
looking for a software provider or
vendor-authorized consulting partner to configure, implement, train
core users and provide ongoing technical support.
There will be a mandatory meeting/conference call for all potential proposers on Thursday, May 28,
2015, at 2:00 p.m. (EST). Potential
proposers may attend in person at
