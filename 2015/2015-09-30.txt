Res. No. 1112-15.
By Council Member Kelley (by
departmental request).
An emergency resolution requesting the County Fiscal Officer to make
advances during the year 2016, pursuant to Section 321.34, Ohio Revised
Code.
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That under Section 321.34
of the Revised Code, the County Fiscal Officer is hereby requested to
draw, and the County Treasurer to
pay on draft or drafts made payable
to the Treasury of the City of Cleveland, any money that may be in the

Adopted September 21, 2015.

Res. No. 1134-15.
By Council Members Polensek, J.
Johnson and Conwell.
An emergency resolution urging
the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency to investigate the cause of
continued water contamination at
Villa Angela Beach and Euclid
Beach.
Whereas,
these
past
summer
months the water quality conditions
at Villa Angela Beach and Euclid
Beach have been consistently poor; at
the end of August the probability that
E. coli exceeded safe levels was at
nearly 86%; and
Whereas, often the water quality at
other beaches in Cleveland and the
surrounding counties is good, while
the water quality at Villa Angela and
Euclid beaches remains poor; and
Whereas, the Natural Resources
Defense Council has found that seven
of the nation’s 17 worst “repeat
offenders” with persistent contamination problems are located on Lake
Erie, with five beaches in Cuyahoga
County; and
Whereas, Villa Angela Beach and
Euclid Beach are on the list of those
repeat offenders with the worst water
quality every year for the past five
years; and

1396

Whereas, when water quality is
always poor, area residents cannot
take advantage of cooling off at their
neighborhood beaches in the hot summer months; and
Whereas, it is incumbent upon federal officials to determine what is
causing the consistent contamination
of Lake Erie’s water at Villa Angela
and Euclid beaches which are the
only swimming beaches on Cleveland’s east side; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency to investigate the cause of
continued water contamination at
Villa Angela Beach and Euclid
Beach.

The City Record
An emergency resolution urging
Governor Kasich to accept the federal
waiver of time limits on food aid for
as many counties and cities in Ohio as
possible.
Whereas, between 2012 and 2014,
7.5% of Ohio households experienced
“very low food security” up from the
state’s 6.4% average from 2009 to 2011,
and worse than every state but
Arkansas and Missouri; and
Whereas, Ohio ranks third in the
nation, tied with Mississippi, for people in “severe food insecurity”; and
Whereas, when the economy is
strong, the federal government places
time limits on food aid for job-seekers
who are not disabled, elderly or parents with custody of minor children;
and
Whereas, the federal government
allows waivers of time limits on food
aid when economies are struggling;
and
Whereas, Ohio qualified for a statewide waiver of food aid time limits
but for the past two years the state
government has rejected that waiver
for most Ohio counties; in 2014, only 16
counties and in 2015, 17 counties – all
of them rural - were allowed the waiver; and
Whereas, in those years, because
Ohio rejected the statewide waiver,
more than 70% of those who lost their
food aid live in urban counties;
excluding cities means that many
Ohioans are subject to time limits on
food aid; and
Whereas, people in Ohio continue to
struggle under a weak economy and,
although a the state government has
accepted the federal waiver for some
rural counties for 2016, it has rejected
extending the waiver to other counties and cities that otherwise qualify;
and
Whereas, with an 8.5% unemployment rate – more than 20% above the
national average - the city of Cleveland is eligible for a waiver; and
Whereas, Ohio should maximize
access to federal food aid by accepting the federal waiver of food stamps
for as many counties and cities as possible, to help those still struggling in
the economic recovery; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
Governor Kasich to accept the federal
waiver of time limits on food aid for
as many counties and cities in Ohio as
possible.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to forward copies of this
resolution to
Governor John Kasich and all members of the Ohio legislature.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
