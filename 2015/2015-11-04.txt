that a minimum lot area of 4,800
square feet is required for a single
family dwelling; a lot area of
approximately 4,050 square feet is

that where no specific building line
is indicated on the Building Zone
Map, the average of the setbacks of
the existing buildings within one
hundred (100) feet on both sides of
any lot shall determine the location
of the required front yard line for
that lot; the average of the setbacks
of the existing buildings is approximately 25.8 feet; a 13' front yard is
proposed.
5. Section 357.09(b)(2)(A) which
states that No building shall be

such interior side yard shall in no
