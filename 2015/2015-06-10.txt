By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency ordinance to amend
Section 607.15 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as
amended by Ordinance No. 474-14,
passed June 2, 2014, to raise the sales

848

June 10, 2015
and distribution age from eighteen to
twenty-one years for cigarettes,
tobacco products and alternative nicotine products, including electronic
cigarettes.
Whereas, raising the minimum age
to buy and sell cigarettes and other
tobacco products to twenty-one would
save lives by preventing adolescents
and young adults from ever taking up
smoking, according to a recent report
by the Ohio State University College
of Public Health; and
Whereas, many eighteen year olds
who legally buy cigarettes currently
share them with much younger children who become addicted to smoking; and
Whereas, youth access to tobacco
products will decrease upon raising
the minimum age to twenty-one by
putting legal purchasers outside the
social circle of most high school students, as 90% of the population that
provides cigarettes to children under
eighteen are under twenty-one; and
Whereas, when Needham, Massachusetts increased its sales age to
twenty-one in 2005, collected data
showed almost a 50% decrease in
tobacco use rates among high school
students; and
Whereas, locally, data from the
most recent Cuyahoga County Youth
Risk Behavior Survey in 2013 indicates over 22% of high school students in Cuyahoga County use tobacco products; within the City of Cleveland, rates range between 23.1% on
the west side and 25.1% on the east
side; and
Whereas, nearly all adult smokers
began smoking by the age of eighteen
and almost no one starts smoking
after twenty-one; and
Whereas, of those who begin smoking as youths, 80% will smoke into
adulthood because of the powerful
effects of nicotine, and one half of
adult smokers will die prematurely
from tobacco-related diseases; and
Whereas, also, in Franklin County,
twice as many young women ages
eighteen to twenty-one smoke during
pregnancy than those over twentyone; given the fact that smoking during pregnancy increases risks of premature infant death and birth defects,
raising the smoking age to twentyone may reduce negative birth outcomes; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland and
the State of Ohio already prohibit the
sale or distribution of cigarettes,
other tobacco products, and alternative nicotine products, including electronic cigarettes, to children under
the age of eighteen, and this Council
is compelled to raise the age to twenty-one in order to prevent Cleveland’s
children and young adults from taking up smoking and the harmful
health effects of smoking; and
Whereas, more than fifty municipalities, including New York City,
have raised the age to buy tobacco
products to twenty-one and at least
eight states have proposals pending
in their legislatures; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 607.15 of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio 1976, as amended by Ordinance
No. 474-14, passed June 2, 2014, is

age, unless the individual reasonably

An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland Ohio, 1976 by enacting new
Section 135.042 thereof, relating to
establishment of a policy with respect
to biased-based profiling.
Whereas, biased-based profiling is
an unnecessary, objectionable procedure by police which involves engaging, investigating or stopping a citizen on the pretext of investigating a
crime or suspected criminal activity
based solely on the citizen’s actual or
perceived race, ethnicity, religion,
sexual orientation or gender identity
or gender expression, national origin
or citizenship, English language proficiency or inclusion in a protected
class; and
Whereas, this City’s police officers
are prohibited from engaging a citizen using profiling that is based solely on physical appearance, physical
characteristics and mannerisms as
belonging to a specific minority
group or other protected class; and
Whereas, the Cleveland Division of
Police is committed to the fair and
impartial enforcement of the law and
shall take all appropriate actions necessary to maintain the public’s trust
by aggressively investigating all
allegations of biased-based profiling;
and
Whereas, this City recognizes that
biased-based profiling is unacceptable to the fundamental principles of
a free and democratic society and has
a corrosive effect on the relationship
that law enforcement has with the
people it serves; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
hereby supplemented by enacting
new Section 135.042 to read as follows:
Section 135.042 Establishment of

Police, shall establish a policy within
the Division of Police with respect to
biased-based profiling which policy
shall incorporate the following:
(1) Definitions.
A. “Biased-based profiling” means
to stop, detain, investigate, search,
seize or arrest an individual based
solely on the individual’s actual or
perceived race, color, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression, national
origin, citizenship, English language
proficiency or inclusion in a protected
class.
B. “Investigatory stop” or “investigatory detention” means a temporary
restraint where the subject of the stop
or detention reasonably believes that
he or she is not free to leave. An investigatory stop or detention may be a
pedestrian, vehicle or bicycle stop.

The City Record
C. “Member of the police force”
means any sworn member of the City
of Cleveland’s Division of Police, and
also Special Policemen commissioned
pursuant to section 135.20.
D. “Chief” means the Chief of the
Division of Police of the City of Cleveland.
(2) Prohibition. No member of the
police force shall engage in biasedbased profiling.
(3) Data Recording. Whenever a
member of the police force makes an
investigatory stop or investigatory
detention, the member of the police
force shall record the following data
on forms developed by the Chief for
that purpose:
A. the name and badge number of
the member of the police force making the stop;
B. the date and time of the stop;
C. the location of the stop;
D. the duration of the stop;
E. the actual or perceived race, ethnicity, approximate age and gender
of the subject of the stop, so long as
the information shall not be required
to be provided by the subject of the
stop;
F. if a vehicle stop, the presence
and number of any passengers;
G. if a vehicle stop, whether the driver or any passenger was required to
exit the vehicle, and the reason for
doing so;

other non-consensual search was performed on any individual or vehicle,
including a brief description of the
facts justifying the action;
K. a full description of any contraband or evidence seized from any
individual or vehicle;
L. the disposition of the investigatory stop, including whether a citation or summons was issued to, or an
arrest made of any individual, including the charge(s); and
M. any additional information the
Chief deems necessary.
(4) Assessment. All data recorded
pursuant to this section shall be collected and submitted at least annually to an individual or individuals designated by the Director and the Chief
who are responsible for coordinating
data collection and analysis and who
shall evaluate such data in accordance with developed protocol to
determine whether disparities exist
in investigatory stops or investigatory detentions that cause a disproportionately adverse effect on a particular group or groups because of biasedbased profiling.
Annual Report; Remedial
(b)
Action.
(1) The designated individual or
individuals conducting the assessment pursuant to division (a)(4)
shall submit a written report of their
findings to the Community Police
Commission and to Cleveland City
Council, and to any other entities as
required. Such report shall be submitted annually and shall be made publicly available to the extent permitted
by law.
(2) If the statistical data collected
and analyzed shows a pattern of
biased-based profiling by the Division of Police, the Director and Chief
shall institute remedial actions to
eradicate those practices.

Cleveland City Council requests
responses from qualified parties to
provide a software solution and professional services for an integrated
legislative management system for
the Council.
Council is the legislative branch
of the municipal government of the
City of Cleveland.
The Office of
City Council conducts a wide array
of research, policy, legislative, document management, archive and
publishing activities. In 2009, Council contracted for professional services to create a comprehensive Legislative Management System (LMS),
to serve as the operational spine for
a wide array of current Council
functions, be integrated with existing office software/hardware/network infrastructure, and have the
capacity to bring additional functionality and integration in the
future. Council selected the OnBase
software as a service platform,
which has been customized for the
legislative functions of Council.
Through this RFP, Council is
for
the
next
seeking
proposals
phase of LMS development.
Council’s major goals for its LMS is to
integrate many users across multiple platforms, continue to reduce the
cost of managing Council’s workflow, and to become as “paperless”
as possible. The Council is seeking
a proven software solution to meet
these goals. The Council is also
looking for a software provider or
vendor-authorized consulting partner to configure, implement, train
core users and provide ongoing technical support.

Res. No. 612-15.
By Council Members Brancatelli
and Cleveland.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio General Assembly to enact
the same protections for tenants in
foreclosed properties as the recently
expired federal Protecting Tenants at
Foreclosure Act, and urging mortgage servicers to voluntarily apply
the protections of the act.
Whereas,
consumer
advocates
expect a rash of evictions in the
coming months on properties entering foreclosure following the expiration of the federal Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act at the end
of 2014; and
Whereas, this 2009 federal law
required that bona fide tenants in
foreclosed properties be given 90
days’ notice before being evicted;
and
Whereas, the act also allowed
bona fide tenants with leases to
occupy the property until the end of
the lease term, except a lease could
be terminated with 90 days’ notice
if the unit was sold to a purchaser
who would occupy the property; and
Whereas, nine states and Washington, D.C. have enacted the same
protections as the expired federal
law, while other states have no specific tenant protections or allow servicers to evict tenants immediately
following a foreclosure sale; and
Whereas, Ohio law allows tenants
to be evicted after a foreclosure sale
with only three days’ notice; and

869

31
Whereas, often tenants are not
aware
that
their
landlord
is
involved in a foreclosure action, as
Ohio does not require they be notified or named in the action;
Whereas, as the foreclosure crisis
continues in Cleveland, this Council
urges the General Assembly to enact
the same protections for tenants in
foreclosed properties as were provided in the federal act, as well as
notice requirements to tenants upon
a foreclosure case being filed; and
Whereas, in reaction to the federal act expiring, some mortgage servicers are voluntarily following the
tenant protections, while others are
reviewing their policies and some
are applying state and local regulations; and
Whereas, in order to provide necessary protections to tenants in foreclosed properties and avoid a rash
evictions
against
tenants
in
of
Cleveland, this Council urges local
mortgage servicers to voluntarily
apply the same protections they
have
been
applying
under
the
expired federal act; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio General Assembly to enact
the same protections for tenants in
foreclosed properties as the now
expired federal Protecting Tenants at
Foreclosure Act, and urging mortgage servicers to voluntarily apply
the protections of the act.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit a copy of this
resolution to State Representative
Kent Smith, member of the Financial
Institutions, Housing and Urban
Development Committee.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
