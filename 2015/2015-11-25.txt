Cleveland and the City of Shaker
Heights (the “Redevelopment Area”);
and
Whereas, Shaker Heights wishes to
develop this area by constructing
townhomes in connection with its
Blue Line Rapid Terminus Improvement (the “Improvement”); and
Whereas, because the Redevelopment Area is in two cities, it is an
impediment for development; and
Whereas, Shaker Heights desires to
annex the portions of the Redevelopment Area that is located in the City
of Cleveland (“Cleveland-located portion of the Redevelopment Area”);
and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
(“Cleveland”) is willing to adjust its
boundary line so the Redevelopment

Section 9.482 and their respective
Home Rule powers, that a Tax Sharing Agreement between Shaker
Heights and Cleveland for the purpose of facilitating economic development, including the sharing of real

in the global marketplace; and
Whereas, Cleveland and Shaker
Heights recognize that it is imperative that they cooperate and collaborate with one another for the benefit
of the region and its resident-taxpayers in order to attract and retain businesses and jobs; and
Whereas, Cleveland and Shaker
Heights are desirous of creating a
new model for inter-municipal cooperation and revenue sharing so that
they may mutually benefit from the
Improvement; and,
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTION REFERRED
Res. No. 1459-15.
By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency resolution opposing
Ohio House Resolution No. 31 (HCR
31) against allowing Syrian refugees
into the United States and to expressly welcome not only Syrian refugees
but also Iraqi, Congolese, Bhutanese,
Burmese and Somali refugees and
any other nationality processed by
the Cleveland resettlement agencies
and to reiterate that all refugees,
regardless of faith or country of origin are welcome in the City of Cleveland.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland has
proudly been a home for resettlement
for all those who have migrated here
since the City’s founding in 1796; the
richness and diversity of cultures
found in Cleveland is part of the fabric that makes our city so strong; and
Whereas, since 2008 over 2,500
refugees have been resettled in
greater Cleveland without security
incident or cause of concern; and
Whereas, during the last fiscal
year, more than 3,000 refugees have
resettled in Ohio, including 48 from
Syria and 403 from Iraq; and
Whereas, the most recent 48 Syrian
refugees join an already large Syrian
population in Ohio that has made
great and valuable contributions to
this state and the communities in
Ohio where they reside; and
Whereas, this Council understands
that all refugees positively impact
the local economy, as stated in the
“Economic Impact of Refugees in the
Cleveland Area, Calendar Year 2012”,
by Chmura Economics & Analytics
and further, this Council appreciates
the financial growth to the local economy brought by all refugees; and
Whereas, this Council disagrees
with the concerns raised in HCR 31,
introduced by Representative Tim
Derickson, stating Ohio’s concern of
resettling Syrian refugees in this
state bearing in mind the terrorist
attacks in Paris; and
Whereas, HCR 31 formally asks the
Executive Branch to consider preventing the resettlement of the
largest displaced population since
World War II; and
Whereas, this Council believes that
HCR 31 is not an accurate representation of the City of Cleveland’s sentiment towards Muslim refugees or residents; this Council further believes
HCR 31 serves to undermine American core values and peoples’ rights
against discrimination protected by
the First Amendment; and
Whereas, the United States of
America has historically recognized
the right of persons to seek asylum
from persecution in other countries
and has signed on to documents such
as the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights 1948, and the United
Nations Convention relating to the
Status of Refugees, adopted in 1951,
which is the centerpiece of international refugee protection; this Convention resolved for member groups
the correct way to proceed with

November 25, 2015
refugee resettlement which procedures are to be applied without discrimination as to race, religion or
country of origin; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes
Ohio House Resolution No. 31 (HCR
31) against allowing Syrian refugees
into the United States and expressly
welcomes not only Syrian refugees
but also Iraqi, Congolese, Bhutanese,
Burmese and Somali refugees and
any other nationality processed by
the Cleveland resettlement agencies
and reiterates that all refugees,
regardless of faith or country of origin, are welcomed in the City of
Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
resolution to Governor John Kasich
and all members of the Ohio legislature.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
