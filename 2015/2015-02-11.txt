the Revised Code , the improvements
declared to be a public purpose may
be exempt from real property taxation; and
Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of
the Revised Code, the owners of the
improvements may be required to
make annual service payments in lieu
of taxes that would have been paid
had the improvement not been
exempt; and
Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of
the Revised Code, the exemption may
exceed 75% of the improvements for
up to 30 years when a portion of the
service payments so collected are distributed to the Cleveland City School
District (“District”) in an amount
equal to the amount the District
would have received had the improvement not been exempt; and
Whereas, the District has been notified of the intent to enter into the
agreement authorized by this ordinance in compliance with Sections
5709.41(C)(4) and 5709.83 of the

3 of this ordinance shall be distributed by the Cuyahoga County Treasurer to the Treasurer of the District
in the amount of the taxes that would
have been payable to the District had

development will be both an attraction for shoppers, workers, and residents in itself and a strong compliment to the existing assets in downtown. In addition to the large surface
lots at E. 4th and Prospect, the development will also encompass the
neighboring parking garages to the
east.
Phase I of the development proposes to construct 491 residential rental
units, 130,000 square feet of national
credit tenant retail, two parking
decks totaling 1,693 parking spaces,
and pedestrian oriented infrastructure improvements. The project proposes to construct an 18-story structure (Building A) on the surface parking lot on the corner of E. 4th Street
and Prospect. Building A will contain
roughly 120,000 sf of leasable retail
space, 940 parking spaces on a 5-story
parking deck, and 491 residential
units totaling roughly 550,000 square
feet. Building B, located adjacent to
the E. 6th Street Walkway and
Prospect Avenue, will consist of an
additional 750 parking spaces on a 12story parking deck, with almost
10,000 sf of additional ground-floor
retail. Finally, on the small lot located on the southwest corner of
Prospect and E. 4th, the development
proposes an additional 27,800 sf of
retail space. Additionally, the development proposes substantial improvements to the E. 6th Street walkway,
creating a “Laneway” modeled on successful retail developments in Melbourne, Australia, and E. 4th Street,
creating an additional pedestrianonly extension on the Prospect side,
while retaining a dedicated driveway
access to the Horseshoe-Gateway
North garage from Huron Road.

Project Description:
The Gateway lots, located at the
corner of E. 4th and Prospect, have
long been an underutilized area for
downtown Cleveland. As surface lots,
these parcels created a gap in the
urban fabric and broke up the vitality
of the connection between the strong
and growing assets at E. 4th Street &
Euclid Avenue and the huge draws of
Progressive Field & Quicken Loans
Arena.
Gateway Huron, LLC has acquired
these lots to launch Project NuCLEus,
a truly transformative development
that will change the face of the Gateway District and leverage this key
location. Their proposed mixed-use

152

Proposed City Assistance:
The request to Cleveland City Council is to authorize the Director of Economic Development to enter into the
chain of title for certain properties
associated with the Project NuCLEus
redevelopment for the purpose of
entering into a non-school Tax Increment Finance (TIF) agreement with
Gateway Huron or its designee. This
TIF will be used to partially finance
project debt associated with Project
NuCLEus. This TIF agreement will
be up to 30 years in length. The City
will declare certain improvements
with respect to the project to be a public purpose and exempt 100% of the
improvements from real property
taxes.
Under the agreement, parcels
acquired and re-conveyed to the developer will be “TIFed” under section
5709.41 of the Ohio Revised Code in
consideration for the developer agreeing to make certain improvements to
those parcels, and agreeing to make
payments in lieu of taxes (PILOT)
equal to the taxes that would have
been paid for those parcels but for the
TIF. A portion of the PILOT will be
paid to the Cleveland Municipal
School District in the amount the District would have otherwise received
but for the TIF.
This piece of legislation will complete the legislation required to enter
into the TIF Agreement with the
Developer.
