Cleveland City Council requests
responses from qualified parties to
provide a software solution and
professional services for an integrated legislative management system for the Council.
Council is the legislative branch
of the municipal government of the
City of Cleveland.
The Office of
City Council conducts a wide array
of research, policy, legislative, document management, archive and
publishing activities. In 2009, Council contracted for professional services to create a comprehensive
Legislative
Management
System
(LMS), to serve as the operational
spine for a wide array of current
Council functions, be integrated
with existing office software/hardware/network infrastructure, and
have the capacity to bring additional functionality and integration
in the future. Council selected the
OnBase software as a service platform, which has been customized
for the legislative functions of
Council.
Through this RFP, Council is
seeking proposals for the next
phase of LMS development. Council’s major goals for its LMS is to
integrate many users across multiple platforms, continue to reduce
the cost of managing Council’s
workflow, and to become as “paperless” as possible.
The Council is
seeking a proven software solution
to meet these goals. The Council is
also
looking
for
a
software
provider or vendor-authorized consulting partner to configure, implement, train core users and provide
ongoing technical support.
There will be a mandatory meeting/conference call for all potential proposers on Thursday, May
28,
2015,

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 587-15.
By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency resolution urging
the U.S. Department of Homeland
Security agents and administration,
U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services, the White House, and all relevant agencies, to expeditiously assist
veteran Staff Sgt. Elizabeth Perez to
immediately return her husband, Marcos Perez, to the United States to
reunite the Perez family of Cleveland,
Ohio, so that Mrs. Perez, a daughter
and sister of our city, can enjoy the
fullest support she needs and has
earned as a veteran of these United
States of America.

772

May 27, 2015
Whereas,
Staff
Sgt.
Elizabeth
Perez USMC, was born in East
Cleveland, Ohio, in 1978, and lived
with
her
family
on
Allendale,
between
Euclid
and
Terrace
Avenue, and has lived in the City of
Cleveland and surrounding locations
since; and
Whereas, she served our country
with honor and distinction both in
the Ohio Army National Guard, and
the U.S. Marine Corps, for a total of
ten years; and
Whereas, she and her husband
Marcos have lived apart since June
of 2010 when Marcos was deported
to Mexico after a traffic stop, and
they are the parents of two young
boys, Pele, 5, and Rocky, 4, who
have spent their entire lives apart
from their father; and
Whereas, the children have known
him only through daily phone calls
and Skype for the past five years,
and a couple of short visits to Mexico, and Mrs. Perez struggles economically near poverty, and also
emotionally without the support of
her husband; and
Whereas, Mrs. Perez is a combat
veteran who relies on support from
her 80% service-connected disability,
and receives weekly care at the
Cleveland VA hospital, and is therefore unable to move to Mexico
because the medical care she needs
would unavailable to her; and
Whereas, their children need the
support of their father so that they
can thrive and reach their fullest
potential; and
Whereas, the Obama administration recognizes that a special debt
is owed to military veterans, as outlined in a 2013 memo released by the
Department of Homeland Security,
which states: “We as a nation have
made a commitment to our veterans,
to support and care for them. It is
a commitment that begins at enlistment and continues as they become
veterans.”; and
Whereas, in Mrs. Perez’s singular
mission to reunite her family, she
has faced an unresponsive bureaucracy and indifferent officials and,
the effort has taken away from her
ability to be all she can for her children and community; and
Whereas, Mr. and Mrs. Perez will
be assets to our community, and
each passing day that this family is
separated intensifies their despair
and longing; without their father,
the children will suffer a disadvantage in their upbringing; and
Whereas, this Council respectfully
urges that this family be reunified
in the most expeditious manner, and
that Mr. Marcos Perez be released
into the U.S. so that the Perez’s can
raise their minor children together
and live as a family; and
Whereas, this Council supports
this critical humanitarian gesture
which will ensure the proper care
and health not only of their children, but Staff Sgt. Elizabeth Perez,
too; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the U.S. Department of Homeland
Security agents and administration,
U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services, the White House, and all relevant agencies, to expeditiously assist

May 27, 2015
veteran Staff Sgt. Elizabeth Perez to
immediately return her husband, Marcos Perez, to the United States, to
reunite the Perez family of Cleveland,
Ohio, so that Mrs. Perez, a daughter
and sister of our city can enjoy the
fullest support she needs and has
earned as a veteran of these United
States of America.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit a copy of this
resolution
to
Veronica
Isabel
Dahlberg, Executive Director, HOLA
Ohio.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted May 18, 2015.
Effective May 19, 2015.

their spouses: hospitalization/health
insurance, prescription drug program, dental care insurance, vision
care insurance sick leave and funeral

and their same-sex domestic partners
remain registered and remain in full
compliance with the domestic partnership criteria.
(b) An employee’s registered samesex domestic partner and the partner’s family shall be considered as
