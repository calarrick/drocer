An emergency resolution urging
Governor Kasich to accept the federal
waiver of time limits on food aid for
as many counties and cities in Ohio as
possible.
Whereas, between 2012 and 2014,
7.5% of Ohio households experienced
“very low food security” up from the
state’s 6.4% average from 2009 to 2011,
and worse than every state but
Arkansas and Missouri; and
Whereas, Ohio ranks third in the
nation, tied with Mississippi, for people in “severe food insecurity”; and

1352

September 23, 2015
Whereas, when the economy is
strong, the federal government places
time limits on food aid for job-seekers
who are not disabled, elderly or parents with custody of minor children;
and
Whereas, the federal government
allows waivers of time limits on food
aid when economies are struggling;
and
Whereas, Ohio qualified for a statewide waiver of food aid time limits
but for the past two years the state
government has rejected that waiver
for most Ohio counties; in 2014, only 16
counties and in 2015, 17 counties – all
of them rural - were allowed the waiver; and
Whereas, in those years, because
Ohio rejected the statewide waiver,
more than 70% of those who lost their
food aid live in urban counties;
excluding cities means that many
Ohioans are subject to time limits on
food aid; and
Whereas, people in Ohio continue to
struggle under a weak economy and,
although a the state government has
accepted the federal waiver for some
rural counties for 2016, it has rejected
extending the waiver to other counties and cities that otherwise qualify;
and
Whereas, with an 8.5% unemployment rate – more than 20% above the
national average - the city of Cleveland is eligible for a waiver; and
Whereas, Ohio should maximize
access to federal food aid by accepting the federal waiver of food stamps
for as many counties and cities as possible, to help those still struggling in
the economic recovery; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
Governor Kasich to accept the federal
waiver of time limits on food aid for
as many counties and cities in Ohio as
possible.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to forward copies of this
resolution to
Governor John Kasich and all members of the Ohio legislature.
Section 3. That this resolution is

the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 1127-15.
By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency resolution supporting the Round 15 Catalytic Project
Application of Landmark Management to the Ohio Development Services Agency for State Historic
Preservation Tax Credits for the
adaptive reuse and redevelopment of
the May Company Building, located
at 200 Euclid Avenue.
Whereas, each year the State of
Ohio through the Ohio Development
Services Agency allocates State Historic Preservation Tax Credits to
encourage private investment in redeveloping
historically
significant
buildings throughout Ohio using a
competitive proposal process; and
Whereas, Landmark Management
is applying for the State’s newly
enacted $25 million tax credit award
under the Catalytic Project Application that will only be awarded to one
project within the entire State of Ohio
during Round 15 for the biennium
that includes 2015 and 2016, in order to
execute its plans for redevelopment
of the May Company Building; and
Whereas, the Cleveland City Council has recognized the need for adaptive reuse and redevelopment of historic buildings in Downtown Cleveland, and desires to have the May
Company Building, that has been
vacant for twenty years, redeveloped
by Landmark Management; and
Whereas, Landmark Management
is proposing to restore and redevelop
the historic one million square foot
May Company Building into an exciting and vibrant new mixed-use development, adding 500 new residents and
commercial opportunities to the heart
of Public Square; and
Whereas, the building is located
where Euclid Avenue meets Public
Square, at a central point in Downtown Cleveland at the heart of our
transit operations where residents

18
and visitors enter the downtown experience to work, play or visit our community; and
Whereas, the May Company Building’s redevelopment will anchor Public Square’s $30 million transformation as Cleveland’s “front door” to
Public Square at the 2016 Republican
National Convention, and have a catalytic impact on the broader image of
Cleveland and Ohio on a national
stage; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
supports Landmark Management’s
proposal for the May Company Building as a high priority initiative for
future development in the heart of
Downtown to benefit the citizens of
the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the Round 15 Catalytic Project
Application of Landmark Management to the Ohio Development Services Agency for State Historic
Preservation Tax Credits for the
adaptive reuse and redevelopment of
the May Company Building, located
at 200 Euclid Avenue.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit a certified copy of this resolution to David
Goodman, Director, Ohio Development Services Agency, and David
Goldberg and John Carney, Landmark Management.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted September 14, 2015.
