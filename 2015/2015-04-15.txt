SUMMARY FOR THE

Developer: Hemingway Development
Project Location:
E. 59th Street & Euclid Avenue
Project Manager:
David Ebersole/Zach Fela
Ward/Councilperson:
Ward 7/ Councilman T.J. Dow

Project Background
Hemingway Development has proposed to purchase and develop the
City-owned property at E. 59th Street
and Euclid Avenue and E. 61st Street
and Chester Avenue for the development of the MidTown Urban Medical
Campus.
Hemingway’s
proposed
development of over 140,000 square
feet of new mixed-use space will complement the University Hospitals
development on the neighboring site.
This development team brings
strong expertise in real estate development and environmental sustainability. Hemingway’s three main
partners have developed over 32 million square feet of design/build
office, warehouse, and industrial
space. Hemingway is committed to
the concept of responsible environmental design, and the company recycles over 80% of its construction
waste. Many of Hemingway’s projects over the last 5 years have
focused on the Midtown neighborhood
of the City, including Midtown Tech
Park, and have been catalytic projects to the overall synergy of the corridor. Hemingway is confident the
market will support additional space.
City Assistance
The Department of Economic
Development has worked with the US
Department of Housing and Urban
Development to secure the transfer of
a $10 Million HUD 108 Loan and $3
Million BEDI Grant to the development of the Midtown Tech Center
Phase II at E. 59th Street and Euclid
Avenue. With this ordinance, the City
is enacting a non-School TIF to serve
as a Debt Reserve for the project. The
non-school TIF proceeds will be
restricted for use by the City only and
will provide additional security for
the HUD 108 Loan.
Economic Impact

• $312,000 of additional estimated
income tax generated for City

space in the Health-Tech Corridor

5709.41 of the Revised Code, Redeveloper (or the owners of the Improvements) shall make service payments
for a period of thirty years in lieu of
the exempt taxes to the Cuyahoga
County Treasurer; the payments shall
be charged and collected in the same

less than the taxes that would have
been paid had the Improvements not
been exempt from taxation.

An emergency resolution supporting marriage equality and the work
of Why Marriage Matters Ohio.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
host of the 2014 Gay Games, is home
to a culturally diverse population
who prides itself on its inclusiveness, is one of the first cities in the
region to have a domestic partnership registry, and is committed to
continued social progress, celebrating the great diversity of our community; and
Whereas, Why Marriage Matters
Ohio is working to open the hearts
and minds of all Ohioans to the
importance of allowing all loving,
committed couples to legally marry;
Whereas,
the
United
States
Supreme Court has ruled that marriage is one of the basic civil rights
of the American people, fundamental to our very existence and survival; and
Whereas, in 1974, the Supreme
Court declared that: “This court has
long recognized that freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage

The City Record
and family life is one of the liberties protected by the [Constitution]”;
and
marriages
that
are
Whereas,
deemed legally valid by the federal
and state governments provide the
married couple with more than 1,000
federal rights, privileges, economic
advantages and legal protections,
including access to health care,
inheritance of social security benefits and eligibility for significant
taxation advantages; and
Whereas, protections afforded to
each spouse in a legal marriage
include protection of their parental
relationship with their children, protection of the inheritance rights of
their spouse and children, ensuring
hospital visitation rights and the
ability to make medical decisions
for their spouse, and protection of
property rights; and
Whereas, without being declared
legally valid, the spouses of samesex marriages cannot receive these
rights, privileges, advantages and
protections; and
Whereas, recent national polls
show that a majority of Americans
now
believe
same-sex
marriage
should be recognized by law as
valid; and
Whereas, thirty-seven states and
the District of Colombia in this
nation have legalized marriage for
same-sex couples; and
Whereas, in 2013, the Supreme
Court ruled Section 3 of the Defense
of Marriage Act (“DOMA”) as unconstitutional under the Due Process
Clause of the Fifth Amendment; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that every Ohioan should be allowed
to marry the person they love, and
fully endorses the efforts of Why
Marriage Matters Ohio.
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports marriage equality and the work
of Why Marriage Matters Ohio.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit a copy of this
resolution to Chris Geggie, Executive
