counted as one of the certifications.

until the appointee has satisfactorily
served his or her probationary period.
At the end of the probationary period,
the appointing officer shall transmit
to the Commission a record of the
employee’s service certifying that the
service has been satisfactory or
unsatisfactory and if the service is
unsatisfactory, the employee may,
with the approval of the Commission,
be removed or reduced without
restriction; but dismissal or reduction
may be made during that period, as is
provided for in Section  121  of the
Charter.
When no eligible list for a position
exists, or when the eligible list has
become exhausted and until a new list
can be created, names may be certified from the eligible list most nearly
appropriate to the position to be
filled.

receiving at least a majority of the

An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting
new Section 607.21, to ban the sale or
distribution of flavored tobacco products, except in a retail tobacco store.
Whereas, flavored tobacco products, including flavored little cigars,
smokeless tobacco, chewing tobacco,
and roll-your-own tobacco, are marketed specifically to youth and are
just as deadly as cigarettes, according to the American Cancer Society;
and
Whereas, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration banned candy, fruit,
and clove-flavored cigarettes, in 2009,
but has failed to yet regulate other
flavored tobacco products; and
Whereas, flavored tobacco products
are especially attractive to youth and
can disguise the taste of tobacco,
according to the American Lung Association; and
Whereas, while flavored tobacco
products are highly addictive, the
public perception especially among
younger users is that flavored tobacco products like cigars are less likely
to cause harmful health effects; and
Whereas, studies show that youths
prefer little cigars: about 3.7 percent
of seventh and eighth-graders reported smoking cigarettes, compared to
6.7 percent smoking little cigars in
2010, according to the Prevention
Research Center for Healthy Neighborhoods at Case Western Reserve
University; in 2011, the high school
student smoking rates were 11.4 percent for cigarettes and 16.9 for cigarillos; and
Whereas, locally, 2014 data from
the Prevention Research Center for
Healthy Neighborhoods at Case Western Reserve University indicates that
Cleveland middle school students are
smoking cigar products at three times
the rate of cigarettes: 9.1% of middle
school youth smoked cigars, cigarillos, or little cigars in the past 30 days,
while 3.2% smoked cigarettes; and
Whereas, because flavored tobacco
products have been shown to be used
more by youth, banning them is necessary to limit their access to children
who acquire them from adults they
know; and
Whereas, in 2013, New York City
banned flavored tobacco products
other than cigarettes in order to
restrict sales to adults-only smoke
shops, stymie illegal sales, and hinder
youths purchasing flavored tobacco
products through an adult who buys
them at a corner store; and
Whereas, of those who begin smoking as youths, 80% will smoke into
adulthood because of the powerful
effects of nicotine, and one half of
adult smokers will die prematurely
from tobacco-related diseases; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland and
the State of Ohio already prohibit the
sale or distribution of cigarettes,
other tobacco products, and alternative nicotine products, including electronic cigarettes, to children under
the age of eighteen, and this Council
is compelled to ban flavored tobacco
products marketed to youth in order

1074

July 29, 2015
to prevent Cleveland’s children and
young adults from taking up smoking
and the harmful health effects of
smoking; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio 1976, are
supplemented by enacting new Section 607.21as follows:
Section 607.21 Illegal Distribution
of Flavored Tobacco Products
As used in this section:
(1) “Cigarette” means any roll for
smoking made wholly or in part of
tobacco or any other substance, irrespective of size or shape and whether
or not such tobacco or substance is
flavored, adulterated or mixed with
any other ingredient, the wrapper or
cover of which is made of paper or
any other substance or material but is
not made in whole or in part of tobacco.
(2) “Characterizing flavor” means a
distinguishable taste or aroma, other
than the taste or aroma of tobacco,
menthol, mint or wintergreen, imparted either prior to or during consumption of a tobacco product or component part thereof, including, but not
limited to, tastes or aromas relating
to any fruit, chocolate, vanilla, honey,
candy, cocoa, dessert, alcoholic beverage, herb or spice; provided, however,
that no tobacco product shall be determined to have a characterizing flavor
solely because of the use of additives
or flavorings or the provision of
ingredient information.

(f) Policy; Exceptions. It is the policy of the City of Cleveland that persons and groups have the right to
organize and participate in peaceful
parades and impromptu demonstrations on the streets and public
grounds of the City, subject to reasonable restrictions designed to protect
public safety, persons and property,
and to accommodate the interest of
persons not participating in the
assemblies to use the streets and sidewalks to travel to their intended destinations, and use public grounds for
their intended purposes. For this reason:
(1) Except as provided in division
(f)(2) of this section, all parades
shall obtain a parade permit under
this section and all reasonable efforts
shall be taken to expedite the review
of any application for a permit for a
parade;
(2) A person or group is not
required to obtain a permit for a
parade before conducting the parade
where:
A. The parade is not associated
with a special event, will take place
on sidewalks and crosswalks and will
not prevent pedestrian traffic from
using the sidewalks or crosswalks or
interfere with vehicular traffic on the
streets at the crosswalks, and will not
occur on streets; or
B. The event is an impromptu
demonstration, provided that a person
involved in organizing the event notifies the Chief, by telephone, in writing, or in person, at least eight (8)
hours prior to the parade of: 1) the
date and time of the parade; 2) the
name and telephone number of an onsite coordinator or a person in charge
of the parade; and 3) a description of
the proposed route to be traveled,
including the starting point, the identification of and the directions to be
followed on all streets, the termination point, and any areas to be used to
set up before and disperse after a
parade.
(3) The Chief may impose reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on parades that have not
obtained a permit under division
(f)(2) of this section based on the
Chief’s determination that the parade
will substantially interfere with:
A. The safe and expeditious movement of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, ingress or egress to or use of
adjoining private property, or unreasonably disrupt the use of a street
when it is usually subject to significant traffic congestion;
B. The health or safety of the
parade participants or other members
of the public, or cause damage to public or private property;

City;
D. Another parade, special event, or
impromptu demonstration; or
E. Any construction or maintenance
work schedule to take place along a
route or location to be used by the
parade.
(g) Permit Fee. A fee of twenty-five
dollars ($25.00) to cover the administrative cost of processing the permit
shall be paid to the City when the
approved permit is obtained from the
Division of Assessments and Licenses. This fee is separate from and in
addition to any fees or charges paid
for special events under Section
131.08.
(h) Permit Revocation. Based on
the recommendation of the Director of
Public Safety or the Director’s
designee,
the
Commissioner
of
Assessments
and
Licenses
may
revoke or suspend any permit granted
under this section because of any
false statement made in the application for the permit.
(i) Appeals. If an application for a
parade permit is denied or revoked,
the applicant or permittee shall be
notified in writing by email, if available, or by telephone and regular mail
to the address on the application with
the reason for the denial or revocation. An applicant or permittee shall
have the right to appeal the denial or
revocation of a parade permit within
three (3) business days of receipt of
the notice of denial to the Director of
Public Safety. The Director of Public
Safety, or his designee, shall hold a
hearing on the denial or revocation
within three (3) business days of
receipt of the notice of appeal. If the
Director determines that the permit
should be granted, the applicant shall
be notified in writing and obtain the
permit from the Division of Assessments and Licenses upon payment of
the fee. If the Director determines
that a revoked permit should be reinstated, the permittee shall be notified
in writing and proceed as if the permit was not revoked. If the Director
affirms the denial or revocation of the
permit, the applicant shall be immediately notified of the decision and
shall have the right to appeal the
denial within the same time and in
the same manner provided in Section
403.09.
Section 3. That any permit applications filed with the City prior to the
effective date of this ordinance shall

in the time granted by the Director
of Public Health, and/or authorized
employee, the Director of Public
Health, and/or authorized employee,

order of suspension or revocation of
a food license without giving written notice or affording the license
holder the opportunity to correct the
violation.
(d) The license holder may appeal
the proposed suspension or revocation of a food license or the immediate order of suspension or revocation of a food license as provided in
RC 3717.29 and 3717.49 and in conformance with the rules of procedure adopted thereunder.
In such
cases, the Director of Public Health

Ord. No. 119-15.
By Council Member Brancatelli.
An emergency ordinance declaring
a moratorium on the review and
issuance of land filling permits in the
City of Cleveland unless authorization is given by Council.
Whereas, the issuance of land filling permits is governed by Chapter
561 of the Codified Ordinances; and
Whereas, Chapter 561 authorizes
the Mayor’s Office of Capital Projects
to issue permits to fill land; however,
the chapter’s very broad criteria fails
to provide community safeguards,
limitations on the amount of fill or to
require inspections of the filling
process or the type of fill;
Whereas, Chapter 561 does not
require coordination with other relevant city departments, often leaving
city departments unaware of matters
a department should be monitoring
and regulating; and
Whereas, this Council believes the
filling permit process must contain
rigorous yet reasonable regulations
that will allow for better control by
the city of both the land fill permitting process and filling process itself;
and
Whereas, this Council will convene
appropriate city departments in order
to draft reasonable regulations within a new permitting procedure for filling of land in order to create a clear
and efficient process that is in the
best interests of public health, safety
and property; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure for the immediate preservation of the public peace,

64
property, health, safety, or welfare in
that a moratorium on the review and
issuance of land fill permits in the
City is necessary to enable this Council to consider improved regulations
for a land fill permitting process;
now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That, for the reasons stated in the preamble, this Council
declares a moratorium on the review
and issuance of land filling permits
for a period commencing on the effective date of this ordinance and ending
on either the effective date of an ordinance creating new regulations for
the land fill permitting process or
January 22, 2016, whichever date
occurs first, unless authorization for
a specific permit is given by Council
via separate legislation within the
moratorium period.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately upon its passage and approval
by the Mayor; otherwise it shall take
effect and be in force from and after

route or location; and

set up before and disperse after a
parade.
(3) The Chief may impose reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on parades that have not
obtained a permit under division
(f)(2) of this section based on the
Chief’s determination that the parade
will substantially interfere with:
A. The safe and expeditious movement of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, ingress or egress to or use of
adjoining private property, or unreasonably disrupt the use of a street
when it is usually subject to significant traffic congestion;

parade.

shall be paid to the City when the
approved permit is obtained from the
Division of Assessments and Licenses. This fee is separate from and in
addition to any fees or charges paid

the recommendation of the Director of
Public Safety or the Director’s
designee,
