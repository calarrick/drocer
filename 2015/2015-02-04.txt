Ord. No. 119-15.
By Council Member Brancatelli.
An emergency ordinance declaring
a moratorium on the review and
issuance of land filling permits in the
City of Cleveland unless authorization is given by Council.
Whereas, the issuance of land filling permits is governed by Chapter
561 of the Codified Ordinances; and
Whereas, Chapter 561 authorizes
the Mayor’s Office of Capital Projects
to issue permits to fill land; however,
the chapter’s very broad criteria fails
to provide community safeguards,
limitations on the amount of fill or to
require inspections of the filling
process or the type of fill;
Whereas, Chapter 561 does not
require coordination with other relevant city departments, often leaving
city departments unaware of matters
a department should be monitoring
and regulating; and
Whereas, this Council believes the
filling permit process must contain
rigorous yet reasonable regulations

110

February 4, 2015
that will allow for better control by
the city of both the land fill permitting process and filling process itself;
and
Whereas, this Council will convene
appropriate city departments in order
to draft reasonable regulations within a new permitting procedure for filling of land in order to create a clear
and efficient process that is in the
best interests of public health, safety
and property; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure for the immediate preservation of the public peace,
property, health, safety, or welfare in
that a moratorium on the review and
issuance of land fill permits in the
City is necessary to enable this Council to consider improved regulations
for a land fill permitting process;
now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That, for the reasons stated in the preamble, this Council
declares a moratorium on the review
and issuance of land filling permits
for a period commencing on the effective date of this ordinance and ending
on either the effective date of an ordinance creating new regulations for
the land fill permitting process or
August 2, 2015, whichever date occurs
first, unless authorization for a specific permit is given by Council via
separate legislation within the moratorium period.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately upon its passage and approval
by the Mayor; otherwise it shall take
effect and be in force from and after
the earliest period allowed by law.
