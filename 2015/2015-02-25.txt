MAYOR’S VETO
File No. 1647-14-A.
February 11, 2015
By Hand Delivery
The Honorable Kevin J. Kelley
President of Council
601 Lakeside Avenue
Cleveland, Ohio 44114
Re: Ordinance 1647-14
Dear Council President Kelley:
I disapprove Ordinance No. 1647-14,
passed by City Council on February
2, 2015, and return it to you with my
veto noted. My objections are outlined below.
Ordinance No. 1647-14 rescinds
Ordinance No. 650-08, passed May 5,
2008. Rescinding Ordinance 650-08 is
a null action because the authority
granted in that Ordinance was validly used. The actions taken under
cannot
now
be
that
Ordinance
undone by rescinding the Ordinance.
Ordinance 650-08 authorized the
Director of Economic Development
and the City Clerk to execute and
sign on behalf of the City a Petition
to create The Flats East New Community
Development
Authority,
authorized the Clerk to file the Petition with the Clerk of the Cuyahoga
County Board of Commissioners, and
determined that the Petition complied with the requirements of Section 349.03(A) of the Ohio Revised
Code. Ordinance No. 769-08, passed
May 12, 2008, states that the actions
authorized under Ordinance 650-08
were taken. Ordinance No. 769-08 set
the hearing on the Petition for June
9, 2008 and directed the City Clerk
to arrange for notice of the hearing
date to be published in accordance
with the requirements in the Ohio
Revised Code. The recitals in Ordinance No. 769-08 state that, as authorized under Ordinance No. 650-08, the
City Clerk and the Director of Economic Development had signed the
Petition and had filed it with the
Clerk of the Board of Commissioners of Cuyahoga County on May 6,
2008. Council later passed Ordinance
No. 1024-08 on July 2, 2008 stating
that the hearing took place on June
9, 2008. Ordinance 1024-08 determined
that The Flats East New Community Development District will be conducive to the public health, safety,

February 25, 2015

convenience and welfare, and is
intended to result in the development of a new community; accepted
the Petition and directed it to be
recorded in the journals of the City
Council and the Board of County
Commissioners of Cuyahoga County;
declared that The Flats East New
Community Development Authority
is organized as a body politic and
corporate; established the boundaries of the Development Authority
as those outlined in the Petition;
appointed four members to serve on
the Board of Trustees of the Development Authority; directed the Flats
East
Development
LLC
and
FED/Main Street LLC to appoint the
remaining three members; directed
the posting of a bond for each member of the Board of Trustees; and
authorized the Director of Economic Development and other City officers to take actions consistent with
the purpose of the Ordinance necessary for the establishment, operation and future growth of the Development Authority. Copies of Ordinance Nos. 650-08, 769-08, and 1024-08
are enclosed.
As shown above, the authority
granted in Ordinance 650-08 was
used validly and resulted in further
legislative action by the City Council. The rescission of Ordinance 65008 does not affect actions that have
been taken validly. Therefore, Ordinance 1647-14 is of no effect and
may cause confusion. For these reasons, I veto Ordinance No. 1647-14
and return it to you with my veto
noted.
Sincerely,
Frank G. Jackson
Mayor
Cc: Patricia J. Britt
Clerk of Cleveland
City Council
Received.
File No. 1648-14-B.
February 11, 2015
By Hand Delivery
The Honorable Kevin J. Kelley
President of Council
601 Lakeside Avenue
Cleveland, Ohio 44114
Re: Ordinance 1648-14
Dear Council President Kelley:
I disapprove Ordinance No. 1648-14,
passed by City Council on February
9, 2015, and return it to you with my
veto noted. My objections are outlined below.
Ordinance No. 1648-14 authorizes
the Council Clerk to execute and
sign, on behalf of the City, a Petition to create a new community
authority known as the Flats East
Bank Community Authority, and
directs the Clerk to file the Petition
with the Cuyahoga County Council.
The Ordinance further determines
that the Petition complies with the
requirements of Section 349.03(A) of
the Ohio Revised Code; adopts an
alternative method for selecting the
board of trustees of the Authority;
requires an annual financial report;

202

the
Council,
through
authorizes
future legislation, to dissolve the
Authority; and lists the proposed
community facilities to be owned,
operated, financed, constructed, and
maintained by the Authority.
The City has supported development and redevelopment in the
Flats East Bank District in which
the Authority would operate. To
date, the City’s financial commitment to development and redevelopment amounts to $37,250,000 in loans
and $18,240,000 in grants for Phase
I and $1,080,000 in grants for Phase
II. If all of the actions necessary to
finally create the Flats East Bank
Community Authority are taken by
March 22, 2015, then the Flats East
Bank Community Authority would
have the ability to impose tax surcharges based on the gross receipts
of businesses operating in the Flats
East Bank District. The tax surcharges proposed in the Petition
would mean an increase in sales,
bed, and parking taxes in the Flats
East Bank District. I do not support
additional taxes that are not for
City services or the payment of the
City’s debt obligations.
For these reasons, I veto Ordinance No. 1648-14 and return it to
you with my veto noted.
Sincerely,
Frank G. Jackson
Mayor
