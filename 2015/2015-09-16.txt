An emergency resolution supporting the Round 15 Catalytic Project
Application of Landmark Management to the Ohio Development Services Agency for State Historic
Preservation Tax Credits for the
adaptive reuse and redevelopment of
the May Company Building, located
at 200 Euclid Avenue.

1326

September 16, 2015
Whereas, each year the State of
Ohio through the Ohio Development
Services Agency allocates State Historic Preservation Tax Credits to
encourage private investment in redeveloping
historically
significant
buildings throughout Ohio using a
competitive proposal process; and
Whereas, Landmark Management
is applying for the State’s newly
enacted $25 million tax credit award
under the Catalytic Project Application that will only be awarded to one
project within the entire State of Ohio
during Round 15 for the biennium
that includes 2015 and 2016, in order to
execute its plans for redevelopment
of the May Company Building; and
Whereas, the Cleveland City Council has recognized the need for adaptive reuse and redevelopment of historic buildings in Downtown Cleveland, and desires to have the May
Company Building, that has been
vacant for twenty years, redeveloped
by Landmark Management; and
Whereas, Landmark Management
is proposing to restore and redevelop
the historic one million square foot
May Company Building into an exciting and vibrant new mixed-use development, adding 500 new residents and
commercial opportunities to the heart
of Public Square; and
Whereas, the building is located
where Euclid Avenue meets Public
Square, at a central point in Downtown Cleveland at the heart of our
transit operations where residents
and visitors enter the downtown experience to work, play or visit our community; and
Whereas, the May Company Building’s redevelopment will anchor Public Square’s $30 million transformation as Cleveland’s “front door” to
Public Square at the 2016 Republican
National Convention, and have a catalytic impact on the broader image of
Cleveland and Ohio on a national
stage; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
supports Landmark Management’s
proposal for the May Company Building as a high priority initiative for
future development in the heart of
Downtown to benefit the citizens of
the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

an application for a New C1 Liquor
Permit at Crows Nest, Inc., DBA The
Crows Nest, Inc., 614 W. Superior
Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44113, Permanent Number 1837561; and
Whereas, the granting of this application for a liquor permit to this high
crime area, which is already saturated with other liquor outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire
community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard of
the laws, regulations or local ordinances of this state or any other state;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed to
the building, safety or health requirements of the governing body of this
County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or constructed that law enforcement officers or agents of the Division of
Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based on
other legal grounds as set forth in
Revised Code Section 4303.292; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of
the public peace, prosperity, safety
and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Superintendent of Liquor Control within 30 days
of notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of

respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based on
other legal grounds as set forth in
Revised Code Section 4303.292; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of
the public peace, prosperity, safety
