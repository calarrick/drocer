“don’t walk”, means that a pedestrian
shall not start to cross the roadway in
the direction of the signal indication,
but that any pedestrian who has
already started to cross on a steady
walking person signal indication
shall proceed to the far side of the
traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise directed by a
traffic control device to proceed only
to the median of a divided highway or
only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
(c) A steady upraised hand signal
indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication.
(d) Nothing in this section shall be
construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.

be charged with a violation of division (a)(1)A. or (a)(2) and a violation of division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, but the person
may not be convicted of more than
one (1) violation of these divisions.
(d) Evidence; tests.
(1) A. In any criminal prosecution
or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle-related, the result of any
test of any blood or urine withdrawn
and analyzed at any health care
provider, as defined in RC 2317.02,
may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and competent evidence in
determining the guilt or innocence of
the defendant.
B. In any criminal prosecution for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this
section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the court may
admit evidence on the concentration
of alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled
substances, metabolites of a controlled substance or a combination of
them in the defendant’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, urine
or other bodily substance at the time
of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance
withdrawn within three (3) hours of
the time of the alleged violation. The
three (3) hour time limit specified in
this division regarding the admission
of evidence does not extend or affect
the two (2) hour time limit specified
in RC 4511.192(A) as the maximum
period of time during which a person
may consent to a chemical test or
tests as described in that section. The
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
or a combination of them as described
in this division when a person submits to a blood test at the request of a
law enforcement officer under RC
4511.191 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to
a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency medical technician-paramedic,
or a qualified technician, chemist or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood
sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the
whole blood, blood serum or blood
plasma. This limitation does not
apply to the taking of breath or urine
specimens. A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this division
may refuse to withdraw blood under
this division, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person
would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood. The bodily substance withdrawn under this division
(d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the
Ohio Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid permit issued
by the Director pursuant to RC
3701.143.

The City Record
C. As used in division (d)(1)B. of
this section, “emergency medical
technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician-paramedic”
have the same meanings as in RC
4765.01.
(2) In a criminal prosecution for a
violation of division (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle-related, if there was at the
time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than
the applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of
this section or less than the applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of division
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may
be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or
innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a criminal
prosecution for a violation of division
(b) of this section.
(3) Upon the request of the person
who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available
to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of
the chemical test analysis. If the
chemical test was obtained pursuant
to division (d)(1)B. of this section,
the person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist
of the person’s own choosing administer a chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law
enforcement officer. If the person was
under arrest as described in RC
4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer
shall advise the person at the time of
the arrest that the person may have
an independent chemical test taken at
the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest other than
described in RC 4511.191(A)(5), the
form to be read to the person to be
tested, as required under division (g)
of this section, shall state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person’s expense. The
failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall
not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or
tests taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.
(4) A. As used in division (d)(4)B.
and (d)(4)C. of this section, “National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration established as an administration of the
United States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49
U.S.C. 105.
B. In any criminal prosecution or
juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under
the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse,
or of a municipal ordinance relating
to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath,
or urine, if a law enforcement officer
has administered a field sobriety test
to the operator of the vehicle involved
in the violation and if it is shown by
clear and convincing evidence that
the officer administered the test in

1502

October 21, 2015
substantial compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible and generally accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the
time the tests were administered,
including but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were
set by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
1. The officer may testify concerning the results of the field sobriety
test so administered.
2. The prosecution may introduce
the results of the field sobriety test so
administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal prosecution
or juvenile court proceeding.
3. If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under division
(d)(4)B.1. or (d)(4)B.2. of this section
and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or evidence and the trier of fact
shall give it whatever weight the
trier of fact considers to be appropriate.
C. Division (d)(4)B. of this section
does not limit or preclude a court, in
its determination of whether the
arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of
any other matter in a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of
a type described in that division, from
considering evidence or testimony
that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
(e) Laboratory report.
(1) Subject to division (e)(3) of this
section, in any criminal prosecution
or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)E.,
(a)(1)F.,
(a)(1)D.,
(a)(1)G.,
(a)(1)H.,
(a)(1)I.
or
(a)(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3) or
(b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially
equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory
personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an
analysis as described in this division
that contains an analysis of the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath,
urine or other bodily substance tested
and that contains all of the information specified in this division shall be
admitted as prima facie evidence of
the information and statements that
the report contains. The laboratory
report shall contain all of the following:
A. The signature, under oath, of any
person who performed the analysis;
B. Any findings as to the identity
and quantity of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, a controlled substance, a
metabolite of a controlled substance,
or a combination of them that was
found;
C. A copy of a notarized statement
by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains
the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the
report, the analyst’s or test performer’s employment relationship
with the laboratory that issued the
report, and a notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is
part of the analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
D. An outline of the analyst’s or test
performer’s education, training and
experience in performing the type of
analysis involved and a certification
that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control standards in general and, in this particular analysis,

October 21, 2015
under rules of the Ohio Department of
Health.
(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type
described in division (e)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the
defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary
hearing or a grand jury proceeding,
unless the prosecutor has served a
copy of the report on the defendant’s
attorney or, if the defendant has no
attorney, on the defendant.
(3) A report of the type described in
division (e)(1) of this section shall
not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity or amount of any substance if, within seven (7) days after
the defendant to whom the report pertains or the defendant’s attorney
receives a copy of the report, the
defendant or the defendant’s attorney
demands the testimony of the person
who signed the report. The judge in
the case may extend the seven (7) day
time limit in the interest of justice.
(f) Limitation of liability.
(1) Except as otherwise provided in
this division, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified technician, chemist or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a
person pursuant to this section or RC
4511.19, 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any
hospital, first-aid station or clinic at
which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or RC
4511.19, 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune
from criminal liability and civil liability based upon a claim of assault
and battery or any other claim that is
not a claim of malpractice, for any act
performed in withdrawing blood from
the person. The immunity provided in
this division also extends to an emergency medical service organization
that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate
or
emergency medical technician-paramedic
who withdraws blood under this section. The immunity provided in this
division is not available to a person
who withdraws blood if the person
engages in willful or wanton misconduct.
(2) As used in division (f)(1),
“emergency medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical
technician-paramedic” have the same
meanings as in RC 4765.01.
(RC 4511.19(A) - (F))
(g) Implied consent.
(1) Definitions. For the purpose of
this division (g), the following definitions shall apply unless the context
clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
A. “Alcohol monitoring device”
means any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any
ignition interlock device, any immobilizing or disabling device other than
an ignition interlock device that is
constantly available to monitor the
concentration of alcohol in a person’s
system, or any other device that provides for the automatic testing and
periodic reporting of alcohol consumption by a person and that a court
orders a person to use as a sanction
imposed as a result of the person’s
conviction of or plea of guilty to an
offense.
B. “Physical control” has the same
meaning as in RC 4511.194.
(2) Implied consent to chemical
tests. Any person who operates a vehicle upon a highway or any public or

The City Record
private property used by the public
for vehicular travel or parking within
this municipality or who is in physical control of a vehicle shall be
deemed to have given consent to a
chemical test or tests of the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the
person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine if arrested
for a violation of division (a), (b) or
(o) of this section, RC 4511.19(A) or
(B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance or any
other municipal O.V.I. ordinance.
(3) Tests at request of law enforcement agent. The chemical test or tests
under division (g)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request
of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control of a vehicle in violation of a division, section or ordinance identified
in division (g)(2) of this section. The
law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate
which of the tests shall be administered.
(4) Effect of death or unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a
condition rendering the person incapable of refusal, shall be deemed to
have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of this section and the test
or tests may be administered, subject
to RC 313.12 to 313.16.
(5) Chemical tests.
A. If a law enforcement officer
arrests a person for a violation of RC
4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance
and if the person if convicted would
be required to be sentenced under RC
4511.19(G)(1)(c),
(G)(1)(d)
or
(G)(1)(e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit,
and the person shall submit, to a
chemical test or tests of the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine for the purpose of
determining the alcohol, drug of
abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath,
or urine. A law enforcement officer
who makes a request pursuant to this
division that a person submit to a
chemical test or tests is not required
to advise the person of the consequences of submitting to, or refusing
to submit to, the test or tests and is
not required to give the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of
this section, but the officer shall
advise the person at the time of the
arrest that if the person refuses to
take a chemical test the officer may
employ whatever reasonable means
are necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the
person’s whole blood or blood serum
or plasma. The officer shall also
advise the person at the time of the
arrest that the person may have an
independent chemical test taken at
the person’s own expense. Divisions
(g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section
apply to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this division.
B. If a person refuses to submit to a
chemical test upon a request made
pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this
section, the law enforcement officer

1503

15
who made the request may employ
whatever reasonable means are necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma.
A law enforcement officer who acts
pursuant to this division to ensure
that a person submits to a chemical
test of the person’s whole blood or
blood serum or plasma is immune
from criminal and civil liability based
upon a claim for assault and battery
or any other claim for the acts, unless
the officer so acted with malicious
purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton
or reckless manner.
(RC 4511.191(A))
(6) Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this section, the arresting law enforcement
officer shall give advice in accordance with this division to any person
under arrest for a violation of division (a), (b) or (o) of this section, RC
4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance. The officer shall give that
advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division
(g)(7) of this section and shall read
the advice to the person. The form
shall contain a statement that the
form was shown to the person under
arrest and read to the person by the
arresting officer. One (1) or more persons shall witness the arresting officer’s reading of the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by
signing the form. The person must
submit to the chemical test or tests,
subsequent to the request of the
arresting officer, within two (2)
hours of the time of the alleged violation and, if the person does not submit
to the test or tests within that two (2)
hour time limit, the failure to submit
automatically constitutes a refusal to
submit to the test or tests.
(7) Certification of arrest. Except
as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, if a person is under arrest as
described in division (g)(6) of this
section, before the person may be
requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug
of
abuse,
controlled
substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance
or combination content of the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the
person:
“You now are under arrest for
(specifically state the offense under
state law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which
the person was arrested – operating a
vehicle under the influence of alcohol,
a drug, or a combination of them;
operating a vehicle while under the
influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance; operating a vehicle
after underage alcohol consumption;
or having physical control of a vehicle while under the influence).
“If you refuse to take any chemical
test required by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended
immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of
O.V.I., O.V.U.A.C., or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance
under state or municipal law within
the preceding 20 years, you are now
under arrest for state O.V.I., and, if
you refuse to take a chemical test,

16
you will face increased penalties if
you subsequently are convicted of the
state O.V.I.
(Read this part unless the person is
under arrest for solely having physical control of a vehicle while under
the influence.) “If you take any chemical test required by law and are
found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine as
set by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately,
and you will have to pay a fee to have
the privileges reinstated.
“If you take a chemical test, you
may have an independent chemical
test taken at your own expense.”
(8) Actions required by arresting
officer. If the arresting law enforcement officer does not ask a person
under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) of this section or division
(g)(6) of this section to submit to a
chemical test or tests under RC
4511.191 or this section, the arresting
officer shall seize the Ohio or out-ofstate driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit of the person and
immediately forward it to the court in
which the arrested person is to appear
on the charge. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person’s
license or permit or it is not in the person’s vehicle, the officer shall order
the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the
officer within twenty-four (24) hours
after the arrest, and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the court
in which the person is to appear on
the charge. Upon receipt of the license
or permit, the court shall retain it
pending the arrested person’s initial
appearance and any action taken
under RC 4511.196.
(9) Duties of officer.
A. If a law enforcement officer asks
a person under arrest as described in
division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests under
that division and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a
metabolite of a controlled substance
in the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine at
the time of the alleged offense, or if a
law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this section to submit to
a chemical test or tests under RC
4511.191 or this section, if the officer
advises the person in accordance with
this section of the consequences of the
person’s refusal or submission, and if
either the person refuses to submit to
the test or tests or, unless the arrest
was for a violation of division (o) of
this section, RC 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test
or tests and the test results indicate a
prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance or a metabolite
of a controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath or urine at the time of
the alleged offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
1. On behalf of the Registrar of
Motor Vehicles, notify the person that,
independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person, the
person’s Ohio driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege is suspended
immediately, that the suspension will

The City Record
last at least until the person’s initial
appearance on the charge, which will
be held within five (5) days after the
date of the person’s arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person,
and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance
or during the period of time ending
thirty (30) days after that initial
appearance;
2. Seize the driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or permit of the person and immediately forward it to the
Registrar. If the arrested person is
not in possession of the person’s
license or permit or it is not in the person’s vehicle, the officer shall order
the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the
officer within twenty-four (24) hours
after the person is given notice of the
suspension, and, upon the surrender,
the officer’s employing agency immediately shall forward the license or
permit to the Registrar;
3. Verify the person’s current residence and, if it differs from that on
the person’s driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or permit, notify the
Registrar of the change;
4. Send to the Registrar, within
forty-eight (48) hours after the arrest
of the person, a sworn report that
includes all of the following statements:
a. That the officer had reasonable
grounds to believe that, at the time of

operating a vehicle in violation of RC
4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal
O.V.I. ordinance or for being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in
violation of RC 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
b. That the person was arrested and
charged with a violation of RC
4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance;
c. Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of
this section applies, that the officer
asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests, advised
the person in accordance with this
section of the consequences of submitting to, or refusing to take, the
test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of
this section;
d. Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of
this section applies, that either the
person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless the arrest
was for a violation of RC 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the person submitted to
the chemical test or tests and the test
results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath or
urine at the time of the alleged
offense;
e. If the person was under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this
section and the chemical test or tests
were performed in accordance with
that division, that the person was
under arrest as described in that division, that the chemical test or tests
were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results
indicated a prohibited concentration
of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a
metabolite of a controlled substance
in the person’s whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine at
the time of the alleged offense.

1504

October 21, 2015
B. Division (g)(9)A. of this section
does not apply to a person who is
arrested for a violation of division (o)
of this section, RC 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, who
is asked by a law enforcement officer
to submit to a chemical test or tests
under this section, and who submits
to the test or tests, regardless of the
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance that the test results indicate is present in the person’s whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath
or urine.
(10) Sworn report of arresting officer.
A. The arresting officer shall give
the officer’s sworn report that is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the arrest, or
the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall
send the report to the person by regular first-class mail as soon as possible
after receipt of the report, but not
later than fourteen (14) days after
receipt of it. An arresting officer may
give an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest,
provided the report is complete when
given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn to by the arresting
officer. As soon as possible, but not
later than forty-eight (48) hours after
the arrest of the person, the arresting
officer shall send a copy of the sworn
report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the charge
for which the person was arrested.
B. The sworn report of an arresting
officer completed under this section is
prima facie proof of the information
and statements that it contains. It
shall be admitted and considered as
prima facie proof of the information
and statements that it contains in any
appeal under RC 4511.197 relative to
any suspension of a person’s driver’s
or commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from the arrest covered by the report.
(RC 4511.192)
(11) Suspension effective immediately. A suspension of a person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or
permit or nonresident operating privilege under this section for the time
described in RC 4511.191(B) or (C) is
effective immediately from the time
at which the arresting officer serves
the notice of suspension upon the
arrested person. Any subsequent finding that the person is not guilty of the
charge that resulted in the person’s
being requested to take the chemical
test or tests under division (g)(1)
through (g)(5) of this section does
not affect the suspension.
(12) Initial appearance. If a person
arrested for operating a vehicle in
violation of division (a) or (b) of this
section, RC 4511.19(A) or (B), or any
other municipal O.V.I. ordinance, or
for being in physical control of a vehicle in violation of division (o) of this
section or RC 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the person’s driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege is or is not suspended
under RC 4511.191(B) or (C) or RC
Chapter 4510, the person’s initial
appearance on the charge resulting
from the arrest shall be held within
five (5) days of the person’s arrest or
the issuance of the citation to him or

October 21, 2015
her, subject to any continuance granted by the court pursuant to RC
4511.197 regarding the issues specified in that section.
(RC 4511.191(D))
(h) Penalty for driving under the
influence.
(1) Whoever violates any provisions of divisions (a)(1)A. through
(a)(1)I. or (a)(2) of this section is
guilty of operating a vehicle under
the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever violates division (a)(1)J. of this
section is guilty of operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance.
The court shall sentence the offender
for either offense under RC Chapter
2929, except as otherwise authorized
or required by divisions (h)(1)A.
through (h)(1)E. of this section:
A. Except as otherwise provided in
division (h)(1)B., (h)(1)C., (h)(1)D.
or (h)(1)E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the penalties and sanctions provided in RC
4511.19(G)(1)(a)(i) to (G)(1)(a)(iv).
B. Except as otherwise provided in
division (h)(1)E. of this section, an
offender who, within six (6) years of
the offense previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one (1)
violation of division (a) or (b) of this
section, or one (1) other equivalent
offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of
the first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the penalties and sanctions provided in RC
4511.19(G)(1)(b)(i) to (G)(1)(b)(v).
C. Except as otherwise provided in
division (h)(1)E. of this section, an
offender who, within six (6) years of
the offense, previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two (2)
violations of division (a) or (b) of
this section or other equivalent
offenses is guilty of a misdemeanor.

of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that
the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged
violation of division (a)(1) of this
section or the person operated a motor
vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(2) of this section. The

An emergency ordinance to establish a Fire and Smoke Damper Inspection Program for buildings owned
and operated by the City, in order to
ensure that fire and smoke dampers
are in proper working order to prevent the spread of fire and smoke
within walls and floors.
Whereas, fire and smoke dampers
are used in HVAC ducts to prevent the
spread of fire and smoke inside the
duct work through walls and floors;
and
Whereas, fire and smoke dampers
are designed to operate automatically
to close off the duct from spread of
fire and smoke, thereby saving lives;
and
Whereas, the majority of fire-related deaths are caused by inhalation of
the toxic gases contained in smoke
produced by fires; and
Whereas, an inspection program is
necessary to guarantee that fire and
smoke dampers are functioning effectively and to protect all City workers,
visitors and safety forces in Cityowned and leased buildings; and
Whereas, a fire and smoke damper
inspection program will ensure that

the City is in compliance with National Fire Protection Association regulations; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of Public Safety (Director) or his designee
is authorized to establish a Fire and
Smoke Damper Inspection Program
for buildings owned and operated by
the City, in order to ensure that fire
and smoke dampers are in working
order to prevent the spread of fire and
smoke inside walls and floors. This
program will be established so that
all fire and smoke damper units in the
most populated and utilized buildings
owned and operated by the City are
tested and inspected within eighteen
(18) months of the effective date of
this ordinance.
Section 2. The following definitions
shall be used for the Fire and Smoke
Damper Inspection Program:
A. “Fire Damper” means a listed
device installed in ducts and air
transfer openings designed to close
automatically upon detection of heat

1529

and resist the passage of flame. Fire
dampers are classified for use in
either static systems that will automatically shut down in the event of
fire, or in dynamic systems that continue to operate during a fire. A
dynamic fire damper is tested and
rated for closure under elevated temperature airflow.
B. “Smoke Damper” means a listed
device installed in ducts and air
transfer openings designed to resist
the passage of smoke. The device is
installed to operate automatically,
controlled by a smoke detection system and, where required, is capable of
being positioned from a fire command
center.
Section 3. All fire and smoke
damper units in buildings owned and
operated by the City shall be tested
and inspected every four (4) years;
the tests and inspections shall be conducted in accordance with National
Fire Protection Association standards. Testing and inspections shall
be conducted by contractors and technicians that have been certified by
the International Certification Board
and American National Standards
Institute to ensure the quality and
knowledge of the inspection process.

42
Section 4. If any fire and smoke
damper unit is found to be faulty or
inoperable, repairs or replacements
shall begin as soon as possible, with
the goal of completing the repairs
within sixty (60) business days from
the date the unit was found to be
faulty or inoperable. The repairs or
replacements of the fire and smoke
damper units shall be completed and
approved by contractors and technicians who are certified by the International Certification Board and
American National Standards Institute. Compliance with the inspections
and compliance with the repairs or
replacements shall be monitored by
the respective City department that
operates the building under inspection.
Section 5. The Director shall provide a status update to Council within
twelve (12) months of the effective
date of this ordinance, identifying the
buildings already inspected or to be
inspected, the approximate number of
fire and smoke dampers in each building to be inspected, and the proposed
timeline for inspections to ensure
compliance with this ordinance.
Section 6. All testing and inspections shall be documented indicating
the location of each fire and smoke
damper, date of the inspection, name
of the inspector, deficiencies discovered, and any repairs or replacements
completed. The results of the testing
and inspections shall be given by the
technicians to the Director within
thirty (30) days of the completion of
each building tested and inspected.
The Director shall retain these testing and inspection reports until the
next testing and inspection is completed.
Section 7. Upon twenty-four (24)
months after the effective date of this
ordinance, the Director shall report to
Council, outlining the number of fire
and smoke dampers tested pursuant
to this ordinance, the number of
dampers that needed repaired or
replaced and status of such repairs
and/or replacement. The Director
shall present a recommended timeline
to complete inspections, if any, of the
remaining fire and smoke dampers
located in buildings owned and operated by the City. In addition, the
Director shall present a proposed
timeline for the next scheduled testing and inspection of fire and smoke
dampers, in order to maintain a regular testing schedule of fire and smoke
dampers in buildings owned and operated by the City, in accordance with
this ordinance.
Section 8. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately upon its passage and approval
by the Mayor; otherwise it shall take
