FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS REFERRED
Res. No. 612-15.
By Council Member Brancatelli.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio General Assembly to enact
the same protections for tenants in
foreclosed properties as the recently
expired federal Protecting Tenants at
Foreclosure Act, and urging mortgage servicers to voluntarily apply
the protections of the act.
Whereas,
consumer
advocates
expect a rash of evictions in the
coming months on properties entering foreclosure following the expiration of the federal Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act at the end
of 2014; and
Whereas, this 2009 federal law
required that bona fide tenants in
foreclosed properties be given 90
days’ notice before being evicted;
and
Whereas, the act also allowed
bona fide tenants with leases to
occupy the property until the end of
the lease term, except a lease could
be terminated with 90 days’ notice
if the unit was sold to a purchaser
who would occupy the property; and
Whereas, nine states and Washington, D.C. have enacted the same
protections as the expired federal
law, while other states have no specific tenant protections or allow servicers to evict tenants immediately
following a foreclosure sale; and
Whereas, Ohio law allows tenants
to be evicted after a foreclosure sale
with only three days’ notice; and
Whereas, often tenants are not
aware
that
their
landlord
is
involved in a foreclosure action, as
Ohio does not require they be notified or named in the action;
Whereas, as the foreclosure crisis
continues in Cleveland, this Council
urges the General Assembly to enact
the same protections for tenants in
foreclosed properties as were provided in the federal act, as well as
notice requirements to tenants upon
a foreclosure case being filed; and
Whereas, in reaction to the federal act expiring, some mortgage servicers are voluntarily following the
tenant protections, while others are
reviewing their policies and some
are applying state and local regulations; and
Whereas, in order to provide necessary protections to tenants in foreclosed properties and avoid a rash
of
evictions
against
tenants
in
Cleveland, this Council urges local
mortgage servicers to voluntarily
apply the same protections they
have
been
applying
under
the
expired federal act; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio General Assembly to enact
the same protections for tenants in
foreclosed properties as the now
expired federal Protecting Tenants at
Foreclosure Act, and urging mortgage servicers to voluntarily apply
the protections of the act.

An emergency resolution supporting University Hospitals’ decision to
open a Level 1 trauma center on the
east side of Cleveland.
Whereas, after the closures of the
Level 1 trauma center at Mt. Sinai
Medical Center and the Level 2 trauma center at St. Luke’s Medical Center in 2000, only Cleveland Clinic’s
Huron Hospital with its Level 2
trauma center was available for
transport of high-level traumatic
injuries; and
Whereas, in 2011, the Cleveland
Clinic closed Huron Hospital leaving the east side of the city and its
neighboring suburbs with a dearth
of high-level trauma care; now, 80%
of the most severely injured or ill
patients on the city’s east side are
transported 15 minutes to the nearest Level 1 trauma center at MetroHealth Medical Center; Hillcrest
Hospital in Mayfield Heights is able
to take Level 2 trauma patients; and
Whereas,
the
Collinwood
and
Glenville neighborhoods have been
most negatively impacted by the closure of Huron Hospital and its Level
2 trauma center; and
Whereas, University Hospitals has
proposed bridge this gap in trauma
care by building a Level 1 trauma
center on the City’s east side; and
Whereas, while Cleveland has
only a single Level 1 trauma center,
Columbus, Akron and Indianapolis
have two Level 1 centers serving
smaller
populations;
Toledo
has
three Level 1 trauma centers; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports University Hospitals’ decision
to open a Level 1 trauma center on the
east side of Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit copies
of this resolution to the appropriate
persons at University Hospitals.

Cleveland City Council requests
responses from qualified parties to
provide a software solution and professional services for an integrated
legislative management system for
the Council.
Council is the legislative branch
of the municipal government of the
City of Cleveland.
The Office of
City Council conducts a wide array
of research, policy, legislative, document management, archive and
publishing activities. In 2009, Council contracted for professional services to create a comprehensive Legislative Management System (LMS),
to serve as the operational spine for
a wide array of current Council
functions, be integrated with existing office software/hardware/network infrastructure, and have the
capacity to bring additional functionality and integration in the
future. Council selected the OnBase
software as a service platform,
which has been customized for the
legislative functions of Council.
Through this RFP, Council is
the
next
seeking
proposals
for
phase of LMS development.
Council’s major goals for its LMS is to
integrate many users across multiple platforms, continue to reduce the
cost of managing Council’s workflow, and to become as “paperless”
as possible. The Council is seeking
a proven software solution to meet
these goals. The Council is also
looking for a software provider or
vendor-authorized consulting partner to configure, implement, train
core users and provide ongoing technical support.
There will be a mandatory meeting/conference call for all potential proposers on Thursday, May 28,
2015, at 2:00 p.m. (EST). Potential
proposers may attend in person at

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 529-15.
By Council Members J. Johnson,
Kelley, Reed, Pruitt, Cleveland,
Mitchell, Keane, Brady, Cimperman,
K. Johnson, Dow, Polensek, Conwell,
Brancatelli, Cummins, Kazy, and
Zone.
An emergency resolution opposing
proposed House Bill 180 and Senate
Bill 152 that would prohibit residency
requirements in local public improvement contracts.
Whereas, recently, Ohio Senator
Joe Uecker and Ohio Representative
Ron Maag proposed companion legislation that would prohibit local
governments from requiring contractors and design professionals to
use local residents in local public
improvement contracts; and
Whereas, in 2004, under its powers of local self-government derived
from the Ohio Constitution, the City
enacted the Fannie M. Lewis Cleveland Resident Employment Law
requiring that every public improvement contract of $100,000 or more
have one or more City residents perform 20% of the total construction
worker hours and that contractors
and subcontractors use significant
effort to ensure no less than 4% of
those resident construction worker
hours are performed by low-income
workers; and
Whereas, the Fannie M. Lewis
Cleveland
Resident
Employment
Law was enacted to alleviate the
lack of use of city residents on
Cleveland
construction
projects
found to exist by this Council and
this law is reviewed regularly to
determine whether there is a continuing need to ensure adequate resident employment; and
Whereas, from 2009-2011, Cleveland resident unemployment rate
was 21.2%; the 2000 U.S. Census
rated Cleveland with the highest
unemployment rate among 23 target
cities; out of the 23 target cities only
four have a smaller percentage of
their working residents employed
inside the city’s boundaries than
does Cleveland; and
Whereas, it is incumbent upon
this council to help improve the
quality of life for our residents by,
among other things, helping to
ensure that the unemployed have
the ability to get decent jobs close
to home; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes
proposed House Bill 180 and Senate
Bill 152 that would prohibit residency
requirements in local public improvement contracts.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit copies
of this resolution to all members of
the Ohio legislature.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it

shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted May 11, 2015.

make or give reports, covenants and
certifications of and on behalf of the
City, as may be appropriate to assure
the exclusion of interest from gross
income and the intended tax status of
the Refunding Bonds, and (c) to give
one or more appropriate certificates
of the City, for inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Refunding Bonds, setting forth the reasonable expectations of the City regarding the amount and use of all the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds, the
facts, circumstances and estimates on
which they are based, and other facts
and circumstances relevant to the tax
treatment of the interest on and the
tax status of the Refunding Bonds.
Section 11. Authorization of Hedging Arrangements. This Council finds
that by engaging in interest rate
hedging arrangements with respect
to Bonds the City may reduce its cost
of borrowing by optimizing the relative amounts of its fixed and variable
rate obligations or minimizing the
risk of variations in its debt service
costs or obtaining savings by confirming rates of interest on Bonds in
advance of their issuance. To permit
the City to have the flexibility to
undertake with respect to Bonds
interest rate swap, swaption, rate cap,
rate collar and other hedging transactions, from time to time, and to establish the procedures for approving
those transactions, this Council
authorizes the signing and delivery
of one or more agreements, including
amendments or supplements to existing agreements (each, a “Hedge
Agreement”), and any related agreements necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by each Hedge Agreement or to
achieve or maintain compliance with
federal regulations applicable to the
Hedge Agreement, if any, and the
payment of any amounts owed in connection with each Hedge Agreement.
The authorizations in this Section are
supplemental to and not in derogation
of any authority provided by any
other ordinance of this Council concerning hedging arrangements.

The City Record
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
that it is to the financial advantage of
the City and in the City’s best interests that a hedging arrangement be
undertaken by the City with respect
to any Bonds issued or to be issued
under the Indenture, the Director of
Finance may authorize one or more
interest rate hedge transactions in
accordance
with
the
applicable
Hedge Agreement; provided that (a)
the counterparty shall be rated at the
time of signing the Hedge Agreement
not lower than “A” by at least one rating agency or its obligations under
the Hedge Agreement shall be guaranteed or insured by an entity rated
at the time of signing the Hedge
Agreement not lower than “A” by at
least one rating agency, with such
rating in either case determined without regard to a gradation by numerical or plus or minus or other modifier
and (b) the term of each hedge transaction shall not exceed the final maturity of the Bonds to which the hedge
relates.
The Director of Finance shall negotiate the terms of each Hedge Agreement with a counterparty satisfying
the credit criteria in this Ordinance.
The City shall receive a written opinion of a Financial Advisor that the
payments to be made by the counterparty to the City, or by the City to the
counterparty, shall be fair value for
the Hedge Agreement, considering,
among other things, the credit of the
City and the counterparty and the
terms and conditions of the Hedge
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall determine the terms and conditions of the Hedge Agreement, including without limitation, the rates to be
paid by the counterparty to the City
and by the City to the counterparty
under the Hedge Agreement, the time
or times and procedures for the exercise by the counterparty or the City,
as the case may be, of any option
under the Hedge Agreement, and
whether the obligations of the City
under the Hedge Agreement shall be
secured by a Credit Support Instrument. The approval of each interest
rate hedge transaction by the Director of Finance shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing and delivery
of the applicable Hedge Agreement
by the Director of Finance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to terminate any Hedge Agreements in whole or in part or any Credit Support Instrument securing a
Hedge Agreement if the Director of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
that the City’s best interests will be
served by such termination. The
Director of Finance is further authorized to enter into amendments, novations, assignments or modifications
of a Hedge Agreement or any Credit
Support Instrument securing a Hedge
Agreement determined by the Director of Finance, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the City’s best interests will be served
by such amendment or modification.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from the Pledged Revenues and may
be payable also from other funds permitted by law to be used for the purpose, as identified by the Director of
Finance in the Hedge Agreement.
Those payments may be secured by a
pledge of Pledged Revenues that may

748

May 20, 2015
be subordinate to the pledge of
Pledged Revenues for the Bonds, to
the extent permitted by the Indenture, all as determined by the Director
of Finance and set forth in the Hedge
Agreement. The obligation of the City
to make payments under any Hedge
Agreement does not and shall not represent or constitute a general obligation, debt, bonded indebtedness or a
pledge of the faith and credit of the
City or the State of Ohio. Nothing
gives any party to any Hedge Agreement the right to have excises, ad valorem or other taxes levied by the City
or the State of Ohio for the payment of
any amounts due under any Hedge
Agreement.
Section 12. Credit Facilities and
Ratings. If, in the judgment of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
the filing of an application for a rating on the Refunding Bonds by one or
more nationally recognized rating
agencies is in the best interests of the
City, the Director of Finance is authorized to prepare and submit those
applications and to provide to each
such agency such information as may
be required for the purpose. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
contract for one or more Credit Support Instruments for any Series of
Refunding Bonds or designated portions thereof if the Director determines, based on the written advice of
a Financial Advisor, that the Credit
Support Instruments will result in
debt service savings to the City. The
cost of obtaining each rating and the
cost of obtaining each Credit Support
Instrument, except to the extent paid
by the Original Purchaser in accordance with the Bond Purchase Agreement, shall be paid from the proceeds
of Refunding Bonds or funds appropriated for that purpose.
Section 13. Financial Advisor. The
Director of Finance may obtain the
services of one or more Financial
Advisors, from time to time, to assist
the Director of Finance in making
any of the determinations required by
this Ordinance to be determined by
the Director of Finance. The Director
of Finance may rely on the written
advice of any Financial Advisor so
retained. Any Financial Advisor or
consultant
employed
under
the
authority of this Ordinance shall be
disinterested in the transaction and
be independent of the underwriters or
counterparties and any other party
interested in the transaction.
Section 14. Interpretation and Legislative Intent. Any provisions of the
Codified Ordinances of the City that
are inconsistent with the provisions
of this Ordinance shall not apply to
the Refunding Bonds or matters
authorized herein.
All terms, conditions, pledges,
covenants or agreements on the part
of the City provided for in this Ordinance are made by the voluntary act
of the City under its lawful authority,
including its authority under its Charter and Article XVIII of the Constitution of Ohio.
Nothing in this Ordinance is intended to, and no provision hereof shall be
applied in any manner as would,
impair the obligation of contract of
the City with respect to any outstanding bonds, notes, certificates of
indebtedness, other obligations, trust
indentures, trust agreements, or other
agreements or contracts made or
entered into by the City and for which

of the City have been performed and
have been met, or will at the time of
delivery of the Refunding Bonds have
been performed and have been met, in
regular and due form as required by
law, and that no limitation of indebtedness or taxation, either statutory or
constitutional, is applicable to the
issuance of the Refunding Bonds.
Section 16. Delivery to County Fiscal Officer. The Director of Finance is
directed to forward a certified copy of
this Ordinance and of the Certificate
of Award for the Refunding Bonds to
the County Fiscal Officer of Cuyahoga County and to secure a receipt
therefor.
Section 17. Captions, Headings, and
Section References. The captions and
headings in this Ordinance are solely
for convenience of reference and in no
way define, limit, or describe the
scope or intent of any Sections, subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs,
or clauses hereof. Reference to a Section means a section of this Ordinance
unless otherwise indicated.
Section 18. Severability. Each section of this Ordinance and each subdivision or paragraph of any section is
hereby declared to be independent,
and the finding or holding of any section or any subdivision or paragraph
of any section to be invalid or void
shall not be deemed or held to affect
the validity of any other section, subdivision or paragraph of this Ordinance.
Section 19. Compliance with Open
Meeting Requirements. This Council
finds and determines that all formal

committees concerning and relating
to the passage of this Ordinance were
