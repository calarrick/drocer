FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTION REFERRED
Res. No. 286-15.
By Council Member Brancatelli.
An emergency resolution urging
the U.S. Congress to pass the Marketplace Fairness Act of 2015 which
requires online retailers to charge
and collect sales tax just as brick-andmortar retailers must do.
Whereas, the Marketplace Fairness Act of 2015 will close the loophole that gives an unfair advantage
to online retailers by allowing them
to avoid charging and collecting
sales tax in states where they do
not have a warehouse or other physical presence; and
Whereas,
this
exception
gives
online sellers, like Amazon.com and
eBay.com a 7-8 percent price advantage over brick-and-mortar stores
that must charge sales tax; and
Whereas, the loophole also gives
consumers the wrong impression
that their online purchases are “tax
free”, while in reality, people in
Ohio are to keep track of online
sales, figure the sales tax and pay
it along with their state income
taxes; and
Whereas, brick-and-mortar retailers are not only forced to compete
against the online retailer that doesn’t charge a sales tax, they also
must pay higher property taxes and
higher sales taxes as a result of the
eroding tax base; and
Whereas,
U.S.
lawmakers
are
beginning to understand that it is

imperative to level the playing field
because brick-and-mortar retailers
are struggling to survive as more
people purchase goods online and
there are now more online sales
than there are department store
sales; and
Whereas, it is estimated that Ohio
lost “tens of millions of dollars in
uncollected
tax
revenue
from
Ohioans who bought their 2014 holiday gifts from online sellers”; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the U.S. Congress to pass the Marketplace Fairness Act of 2015 which
requires online retailers to charge
and collect sales tax just as brick-andmortar retailers must do.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit copies
of this resolution to all members of
the United States Congress.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immeupon
its
adoption
and
diately
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from

by law.
