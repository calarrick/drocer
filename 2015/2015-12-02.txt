Project Description:
Dealer Tire has been a longstanding employer in the City of Cleveland, with over 400 employees. Their current facility at E. 36th and Chester consists of several buildings spread over multiple blocks. They lack sufficient office space, parking, and amenities to accommodate their future growth and have been looking for a new
Headquarters location. Dealer was looking at suburban and out-of-state locations including the Victory Building.
The City put together a package to retain the company and its future growth.
The Victory Building project is a proposed $25 Million build-out of the tenant space and construction of a new
parking garage. This construction will maintain Dealer Tire in Cleveland and result in the retention of approximately 430 jobs and creation of an estimated 100 jobs in Cleveland.
Proposed TIF
• TIF (Parking Garage Site)
The TIF will provide for the repayment of project debt from TIF revenues. The proposed TIF will be a nonschool TIF, with payments made to the School District in an amount equal the School District’s share absent
the TIF. Proceeds from the TIF will be dedicated first to the repayment of the City’s debt and then to other
project debt.
Additional City Assistance:
• $4,000,000 HUD 108 Loan (Previously Approved for Victory Building) – Assists with Tenant Improvements &
Parking Garage
• Demolition Loan ($500,000) - Funds Demolition of 2 Buildings near Carnegie Avenue for parking garage construction
• Recoverable Grant for Construction ($1,000,000)
Funds are recoverable if Dealer Tire does not reach and sustain its job retention/creation goals over five
years.
• Job Creation Grant to Dealer Tire ($1,000,000)
Distributed over three years, based on Dealer Tire achieving job retention & creation targets
• TIF (Victory Building Site)
Prior legislation provided for a TIF to be implemented on the Victory Building Site. The TIF allowed for
the repayment of project debt from TIF revenues. The proposed TIF will be a non-school TIF, with payments made to the School District in an amount equal the School District’s share absent the TIF. Proceeds
from the TIF will be dedicated first to the repayment of the City’s debt and then to other project debt.
Section 3. That, under Section 5709.41 of the Revised Code, Redeveloper (or the owners of the Improvements)
shall make service payments for a period of 30 years in lieu of the exempt taxes to the Cuyahoga County Treasurer; the payments shall be charged and collected in the same manner, and shall be in an amount not less than
the taxes that would have been paid had the Improvements not been exempt from taxation.
Section 4. That a portion of the service payments collected under Section 3 of this ordinance shall be distributed by the Cuyahoga County Treasurer to the Treasurer of the District in the amount of the taxes that would
have been payable to the District had the Improvement not been exempt from taxation.

Whereas, under Ordinance No. 85607, passed May 21, 2007, and through
the authority of Section 3735.65 et seq.

amended Ordinance No. 856-07, to
establish new green building standards for construction or remodeling
performed under those ordinances
and also extended the eligibility date

Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of the Revised Code, improvements to real property may be declared to be a public purpose where fee title to the real property was, at one time, held by the City of Cleveland and the real property is then
leased or conveyed by the City; and
Whereas, the City owns fee title to the real property which consists of real property more fully described in this ordinance (the “Real Property”); and
Whereas, the subject Real Property is found, declared, and deemed to be a “Blighted Parcel” as defined in, and under
Section 1.08(B) of the Revised Code on the basis of specific conditions set forth in Sections 1.08(B)(2)(a), 1.08(B)(2)(b),
and 1.08(B)(2)(h) thereof, particularly consisting of multiple vacant, outdated warehouses with documented brownfield
conditions and, as a consequence thereof, said Real Property is found, declared, and deemed to be a “Blighted Area”, as

Redevelopment Plan, which proposes the redevelopment of residential apartments, commercial office space, and retail
and restaurant space surface parking lots and vacant buildings to multi-story, mixed-use developments, a copy of which
is placed in the file for this ordinance; and
Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of the Revised Code, the improvements declared to be a public purpose may be exempt
from real property taxation; and
Whereas, under Section 5709.42 of the Revised Code, the owners of the improvements may be required to make annual
service payments in lieu of taxes that would have been paid had the improvement not been exempt; and
Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of the Revised Code, the exemption may exceed 75% of the improvements for up to 30
years when a portion of the service payments so collected are distributed to the Cleveland City School District (“District”) in an amount equal to the amount the District would have received had the improvement not been exempt; and
Whereas, the District has been notified of the intent to enter into the agreement authorized by this ordinance in compliance with Sections 5709.41(C)(4) and 5709.83 of the Revised Code; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of a municipal
department; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of the City of Cleveland:

Snavely Property Company LLC W25d commercial, LLC or designee
Northwest/Southwest corner of West 25th & Detroit
Ward 3/Councilman Cimperman
Non-School TIF Agreement

Project Summary
w25d commercial, LLC is a single-purpose LLC created by the Snavely Property Company (Snavely) for the purpose of
acquiring and developing the W25th & Detroit project. The parcels located on the NW&SW corner of W25th & Detroit
have been a historically abandoned and blighted corridor. W25d commercial, LLC will acquire theses parcels to launch
the project on W25th & Detroit, a truly transformative development that will change the face of W25th&Detroit and
leverage this key location.
Snavely is proposing a $60 Million project on the NW&SW corner of W25th & Detroit. The project will convert two sites;
A surface parking lot, located on the NW corner of W25th & Detroit (North Building) and the existing historical building located on the SW corner of W25th& Detroit (South Building) into a mixed-use transportation oriented development.
The project includes approximately 50,000 SF of commercial space, 194 market rate apartments, 38 affordable apartments, 296 parking spaces and community park improvements for the betterment and connectivity of the neighborhood.
Apartment rentable SF approximately 143,367, average size apartment 754 SF, average monthly apartment rent approximately $1,536 and the average monthly rent/SF approximately $2.04.
The North Building will add 194 market rate residential units, 28,624 sq. ft. of commercial space and 260 parking
spaces, comprised of surface parking and structured parking on the lower level. A 19,000 SF educational facility will
anchor the project and will be occupied by The Music Settlement, a non-profit, high-quality provider of early childhood
education, music education and music therapy services. A grocery store specializing in locally-sourced and fresh foods
will occupy 1,000 SF. In addition, collaboration on healthy foods initiatives and other social programs for the surrounding community is being created by the school, the grocer and other organizations like The Greater Cleveland Foodbank,
including the operation of a “community kitchen” houses within the project. Retailers will occupy the remainder of the
commercial space.
The South Building will add 38 affordable housing units, 21,689 sq. ft. commercial space and 36 parking spaces. A coworking facility will occupy approximately 15,000 SF office space to cultivate an entrepreneurial culture in the neighborhood by providing low-cost access to office facilities and business resources. Finally, a complement of restaurants
will occupy the remainder of the commercial space.
Project Need
The project which is less than a mile from the central business district lies in a blighted area within a severely distressed census track. Over 37% of residents in the area live below the poverty level and unemployment is 1.5x the national average. The project has the capacity to have a stabilizing effect on a community that has experienced significant
disinvestment.
Proposed City Assistance:
As the Developer works to complete the financing for this project, it will be very important to get a commitment from
the City. Doing so will help the Developer to leverage other sources of financing comprising Developer’s capital stack
especially the highly competitive NMTCs and HTCs. The Department of Economic Development is seeking approval to
offer the Developer a non-school TIF as described below.

Res. No. 1414-15.
By Council Members Zone, Cleveland and Brady.
An emergency resolution supporting H. B. 392, the Intimate Partner
Violence Bill, introduced in the Ohio
House of Representatives, which
extends legal protections for victims
of domestic violence and abuse to intimate partners who have or have had a
continuing and significant relationship of a romantic nature with an
offender.
Whereas, H.B. 392, the Intimate
Partner Violence Bill, introduced in
the Ohio House of Representatives on
November 9, 2015 and sponsored by
Representatives Sykes and Kuhns,
extends legal protections for victims
of domestic violence and abuse to intimate partners who have or have had a
continuing and significant relationship of a romantic nature with an
offender; and
Whereas, all citizens of Cleveland
and Ohio communities in significant,
romantic relationships deserve protection from domestic violence and
abuse perpetrated by their partner;
and
Whereas, abuse and domestic violence-related offenses are devastating to the women, men, and children
affected, as well as damaging to communities as a whole; and
Whereas, abuse and domestic violence-related offenses are also devastating to the partners, spouses, and
families of those who engage in these
offenses; and
Whereas, currently, forty-eight
states include dating relationships in
their domestic violence statutes; and
Whereas, Ohio’s current law only
protects “families or household members,” and does not protect all individuals
in
continuing,
significant,
romantic relationships with a perpetrator; and
Whereas, the Intimate Partner Violence Bill will extend necessary protections to those persons who are in or
have been in continuing, significant,
romantic relationships with their
abusers; and
Whereas, these necessary protections include the right to petition for
a civil protection order and access to
domestic violence shelters; and
Whereas, all abuse and domestic
violence victims should have the
same legal tools at their disposal to
protect themselves from further
abuse and violence; and

1810

December 2, 2015
Whereas, expanding legal protections and remedies for abuse and
domestic violence-related offenses to
victim partners falling outside the
current definition is a crucial step in
protecting all individuals; and
Whereas, initiatives to combat
domestic violence and abuse offenses
are essential to retain and increase
population and stabilize Cleveland’s
neighborhoods; and
Whereas, this Council supports
H.B. 392 that expands protections to
victims of domestic violence and
abuse that are in intimate partner
relationships, in order to deter and
reduce domestic violence and abuse
in the City of Cleveland and all Ohio
communities; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports H. B. 392, the Intimate Partner
Violence Bill, introduced in the Ohio
House of Representatives, which
extends legal protections for victims
of domestic violence and abuse to intimate partners who have or have had a
continuing and significant relationship of a romantic nature with an
offender.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to deliver copies of this
Resolution to Governor John Kasich,
Ohio State Senate President Keith
Faber, Speaker of the Ohio State
House of Representatives Clifford A.
Rosenberger, Ohio State Representatives Emilia Strong Sykes and Christi
Bryant Kuhns, and Cincinnati City
Council President Pro Tem Yvette
Simpson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from

section. Once the threshold for remitting payment electronically for federal purposes has been met, any accrued
municipal income tax withheld from
employee qualifying wages earned
within the Municipality shall be
remitted to the Municipality at the
same time that the federal tax withholding payment is due.
(c) An employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer shall make
and file a return showing the amount
of tax withheld by the employer,
agent, or other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and

the employer’s, agent’s, or other
payer’s exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
(2) The failure of an employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer

liability for that tax unless the
employee colluded with the employer,
agent, or other payer in connection
with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
(f) Compensation deferred before
June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or

distributed.
(g) Each employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes
have been withheld, and such amount
shall be deemed to be held in trust for
the Municipality until such time as
the withheld amount is remitted to
the Tax Administrator.

supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax
or filing the reports and making payments as required by this section,
shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as
required by this section. The dissolution of an employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer does not discharge the officer’s or employee’s liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer
to file returns or pay any tax due.
(j) An employer is required to
deduct
and
withhold
municipal
income tax on tips and gratuities
received by the employer’s employees
and constituting qualifying wages
only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer’s
control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is under the
employer’s control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to the
employer for subsequent remittance
to the employee, or if the customer
pays the tip or gratuity by credit card,
debit card, or other electronic means.

shall be considered to have spent a
day performing services in a municipal corporation only if the employee
spent more time performing services
for or on behalf of the employer in
that municipal corporation than in

that a Tax Administrator and an
employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the
employer shall comply with the
requirements of Section 192.10 of this
Chapter.
(g) In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income,
an employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the
qualifying wages of such a person if
the person performs those services on

sales agent to deduct and withhold
the required amount from a person’s
prize award does not relieve that person from liability for the municipal
income tax with respect to that prize
award.
(h) If a casino operator or lottery
sales agent files a return late, fails to
file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to remit

Code.
(a) Net profit from a business or
profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a

real property and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in
the Municipality during the taxable
period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession

leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined
by multiplying the annual rental
thereon by eight;
(2) Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the
business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to
wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the same period to

are not required to be withheld under
Section 192.11 of this Chapter;
(3) Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed
during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of
the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and

(b) (1) If the apportionment factors
described in division (a) of this section do not fairly represent the extent
of a taxpayer’s business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may

issued within the period prescribed
by division (a) of Section 192.41 of
this Chapter.
(3) A Tax Administrator may
require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment
method
as
described in division (b)(1) of this
section only by issuing an assessment
to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division (a) of Section
192.41 of this Chapter.
(4) Nothing in division (b) of this
section nullifies or otherwise affects
any
alternative
apportionment
arrangement approved by a Tax

upon by both the Tax Administrator
and taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
(c) As used in division (a)(2) of
this section, “wages, salaries, and

(2) Any location at which a trial,
appeal,
hearing,
investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or legislative matter or proceeding is being
conducted, provided that the compensation is paid for services performed
for, or on behalf of, the employer or
that the employee’s presence at the
location directly or indirectly benefits the employer;
(3) Any other location, if the Tax
Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to
perform the services at the other location in lieu of a location described in
division (c)(1) or (2) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the
employer’s municipal income tax liability. If a Tax Administrator makes
such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by
establishing, by a preponderance of
the evidence, that the Tax Administrator’s determination was unreasonable.
(d) For the purposes of division
(a)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services

place within the municipal corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place
where delivery is made.
(2) Gross receipts from the sale of
services shall be sitused to the municipal corporation to the extent that
such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
(3) To the extent included in
income, gross receipts from the sale
of real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the

which the tangible personal property
is used in the municipal corporation.
(e) The net profit received by an
individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the
individual or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in which the property generating the net profit is located and the

division to the municipal corporation
in which the property is located.
(f) (1) Except as provided in division (f)(2) of this section, commissions received by a real estate agent
or broker relating to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation

everywhere in the taxable year.
(2) An individual who is a resident
of a municipal corporation that imposes a municipal income tax shall report
the individual’s net profit from all
real estate activity on the individual’s
annual tax return for that municipal
corporation. The individual may
claim a credit for taxes the individual
paid on such net profit to another
municipal corporation to the extent
that such credit is allowed under Section 192.19 of this Chapter.
(g) If, in computing a taxpayer’s
adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with

December 2, 2015
respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not
required to include in the employee’s
income any such amount or a portion
thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (k)(12) of
Section 192.06 of this Chapter, by a
municipal corporation to which the
taxpayer has apportioned a portion of
its net profit, the taxpayer shall add
the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer’s net profit that
was apportioned to that municipal
corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net
profit that was apportioned to that
municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the
employee would be required to pay
tax were the amount related to the
stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the
purpose of making an adjustment to
the amount of a taxpayer’s net profit
that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.

income tax.
(c) A taxpayer that is a member of
an affiliated group of corporations

income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal
income tax return for that taxable
year if the Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions have not been conducted at
arm’s length and that there has been
a distortive shifting of income or
expenses with regard to allocation of
net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to
file a consolidated municipal income

by substituting “an affiliated group
of corporation’s” for “a C corporation’s” wherever “a C corporation’s”
appears in that division.
(2) No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise
required under division (a) of Section
192.06 of this Chapter to the extent
that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment
has been eliminated or consolidated
in the computation of consolidated
federal taxable income.
(3) If the net profit or loss of a passthrough entity having at least eighty

1827

55
per cent of the value of its ownership
interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of
corporations is included in that affiliated group’s consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated
municipal income tax return shall do
one of the following with respect to
that pass-through entity’s net profit
or loss for that taxable year:
A. Exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group and, for the purpose
of making the computations required
in Section 192.14 of this Chapter,
exclude the property, payroll, and
gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit sitused to a
municipal corporation. If the entity’s
net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity’s net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
B. Include the pass-through entity’s
net profit or loss in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purpose of making the computations required in Section 192.14 of this Chapter, include the
property, payroll, and gross receipts
of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net
profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity’s net profit or loss is
so included, the entity shall not be
subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity’s net
profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable income of
the affiliated group.
(4) If the net profit or loss of a passthrough entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated
group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group’s consolidated
federal taxable income for a taxable
year, all of the following shall apply:
A. The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through
entity’s net profit or loss from the consolidated federal taxable income of
the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making the computations
required in Section 192.14 of this
Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the passthrough entity in the computation of
the affiliated group’s net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
and
B. The pass-through entity shall be
subject to municipal income taxation
as a separate taxpayer under this
chapter on the basis of the entity’s net
profits that would otherwise be
included in the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated
group.
(f) Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required
under Section 192.14 of this Chapter
by substituting “consolidated federal
taxable income attributable to” for
“net profit from” wherever “net profit
from” appears in that section and by
substituting “affiliated group of corporations” for “taxpayer” wherever
“taxpayer” appears in that section.
(g) Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax
return is jointly and severally liable

56
for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by
a municipal corporation under this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is
a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated group.
(h) Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal
corporation before January 1, 2016, to
file a consolidated or combined tax
return with such municipal corporation may continue to file consolidated
or combined tax returns under such
election or agreement for taxable
years beginning on and after January
1, 2016.

exceeding fifteen years. Before the
Municipality passes an ordinance
granting a credit, the Municipality
and the taxpayer shall enter into an

Section 192.17 Tax Credits to Foster
Job Retention
The Municipality, by Ordinance,
may grant a refundable or nonrefundable credit against its tax on income

retained employees of the taxpayer,
and shall be for a term not exceeding
fifteen years. Before the Municipality
passes an ordinance allowing such a
credit, the Municipality and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement
specifying all the conditions of the
credit.
Section 192.18 Declaration of Estimated Tax

the current taxable year, on the form
prescribed by the Tax Administrator,
if the amount payable as estimated
taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
For the purposes of this section:
A. Taxes withheld from qualifying
wages shall be considered as paid to
the municipal corporation for which
the taxes were withheld in equal

which all amounts were actually
withheld, the amounts withheld shall

The City Record

which the amounts were actually
withheld.
B. An overpayment of tax applied
as a credit to a subsequent taxable
year is deemed to be paid on the date
of the postmark stamped on the cover
in which the payment is mailed or, if
the payment is made by electronic

is submitted. As used in this division,
“date of the postmark” means, in the
event there is more than one date on
the cover, the earliest date imprinted
on the cover by the postal service.
C. A taxpayer having a taxable
year of less than twelve months shall
make a declaration under rules prescribed by the Tax Administrator.

(2) Taxpayers filing joint returns
shall file joint declarations of estimated taxes.
(3) The declaration of estimated
taxes shall be filed on or before the
date prescribed for the filing of
municipal income tax returns under

(4) Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal
year basis shall file a declaration on
or before the fifteenth day of the
fourth month after the beginning of
each fiscal year or period.
(5) The original declaration or any
subsequent
amendment
may
be
increased or decreased on or before
any subsequent quarterly payment
day as provided in this section.
(c) (1) The required portion of the
tax liability for the taxable year that
shall be paid through estimated taxes
made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator, including the
application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on or before
the applicable payment date, shall be
as follows:
A. On or before the fifteenth day of
the fourth month after the beginning
of the taxable year, twenty-two and

of the taxable year, forty-five per cent
of the tax liability for the taxable
year;
C. On or before the fifteenth day of
the ninth month after the beginning

1828

December 2, 2015
(3) On or before the fifteenth day of
the fourth month of the year following that for which the declaration or
amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any
balance which may be due shall be
paid with the return under Section
192.23 of this Chapter.
A. For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals and are
reporting and filing on a calendar
year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of
the federal tax return, unless extended under division (G) of section
5747.08 of the Revised Code.
B. For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and filing
on a fiscal year basis or any period
other than a calendar year, the annual return is due on the fifteenth day of
the fourth month following the end of
the taxable year or period.
(4) An amended declaration is
required whenever the taxpayer’s
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year. A change in estimated tax liability may either
increase or decrease the estimated
tax liability for the taxable year.
(d) (1) In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax liability,
penalty and interest may be imposed
under Section 192.29 of this Chapter
upon the amount of underpayment for
the period of underpayment, unless
the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division
(e) of this section. The amount of the
underpayment shall be determined as
follows:
A. For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two and
one-half per cent of the tax liability,

date prescribed for that payment;
B. For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five per
cent of the tax liability, less the

cent of the tax liability, less the
amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that payment.
(2) The period of the underpayment
shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to
the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a
payment of estimated taxes on or
before any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous
underpayment only to the extent the
payment of estimated taxes exceeds
the amount of the payment presently
required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
(e) An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be
due to reasonable cause and the
penalty imposed by this section shall
not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following
apply:
(1) The amount of estimated taxes
that were paid equals at least ninety
per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the
month immediately preceding the
month in which the payment is due.
(2) The amount of estimated taxes

December 2, 2015
that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability
shown on the return of the taxpayer
for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding
taxable year reflected a period of
twelve months and the taxpayer filed
a return with the municipal corporation under Section 192.23 of this Chapter for that year.
(3) The taxpayer is an individual
who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first
day of January of the calendar year
that includes the first day of the taxable year.
(f) A Tax Administrator may waive
the requirement for filing a declaration of estimated taxes for any class
of taxpayers after finding that the
waiver is reasonable and proper in
view of administrative costs and
other factors.
Section 192.19 Cleveland Resident
Subject to Income Tax in Other
Municipal Corporation
(a) When a resident is subject to
and has paid a municipal income tax
in another municipal corporation on
the same income taxable under this
chapter, regardless of whether such
other municipal corporation allows a
credit to its residents, and the rate of
Cleveland’s municipal income tax is
less than two and one-half percent
(2.5%), such resident may claim a
credit of the amount of income tax
paid to the other municipal corporation, but not in excess of fifty percent
(50%) of the tax imposed by this
chapter or fifty percent (50%) of the
tax imposed by the other municipal
corporation, whichever is less. When
a resident is subject to and has paid a
municipal income tax in another
municipal corporation on the same
income taxable under this chapter
regardless of whether such other
municipal corporation allows a credit
to its residents and the rate of Cleveland’s municipal income tax is two
and one-half percent (2.5%) or more,
such resident may claim a credit of
the amount of income tax paid to the
other municipal corporation which
credit shall not exceed the tax
assessed by this chapter on the resident’s taxable income subject to tax
by another municipal corporation.
(b) In the event a resident is entitled to credit for taxes paid another
municipal corporation, such resident
is required to file a return on a form in
such manner as the Tax Administrator may prescribe.
(c) Assignment of any claim for
refund to which a resident may be
entitled from another municipal corporation shall be tentatively accepted
as payment of that portion of city
income tax represented by such
assignment. However, if satisfactory
evidence is offered that the taxpayer
is entitled to the claim covered by the
assignment, such taxpayer shall not
be deprived of credit therefore
because of fault or neglect on the part
of either municipal corporation.
(d) In the event such resident fails,
neglects or refuses to file such return
or form as is prescribed by the Tax
Administrator, such resident shall not
be entitled to such credit and shall be
considered in violation of this chapter
for failure to file a return and make
payment of taxes due hereunder.
(e) A resident owner of a passthrough entity that does not conduct
business in the City and that has paid
an income tax to another municipal

The City Record
corporation may claim a credit equal
to the lesser of (i) the resident
owner’s proportionate share of the
amount, if any, of income tax paid by
the pass-through entity to another
municipal corporation in the State; or
(ii) the resident owner’s proportionate share of the amount of city income
tax that would be imposed on the
pass-through entity if the passthrough entity conducted business in
the City.
(f) In no case shall the amount of
the credit allowed under division (e)
of this section exceed the tax
assessed by this chapter on the resident owner’s taxable income subject
to tax by another municipal corporation.
(g) The credits provided in Sections
718.021 and 718.121 of the Revised
Code shall be available to residents, if
applicable.
Except as otherwise provided in
Chapter 718 of the Revised Code, this
chapter and the Rules and Regulations, where a nonresident is subject
to the tax imposed by this chapter and
is subject to tax on the same taxable
income in the municipal corporation
where such nonresident resides, no
credit against the city income tax
levied by this chapter shall be
allowed.
Section 192.20 Refundable Credit
for Qualifying Loss
(a) As used in this section:
(1) “Nonqualified deferred compensation plan” means a compensation
plan
described
in
section
3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
(2) A. Except as provided in division (a)(2)B. of this section. “qualifying loss” means the excess, if any, of
the total amount of compensation the
payment of which is deferred under a
nonqualified deferred compensation
plan over the total amount of income
the taxpayer has recognized for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer’s receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection
with
the
nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
B. If, for one or more taxable years,
the taxpayer has not paid to one or
more municipal corporations income
tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which
is deferred under a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the
“qualifying loss” is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (a)(2)A. of
this section computed without regard
to division (a)(2)B. of this section
and a fraction the numerator of which
is the portion of such compensation
on which the taxpayer has paid
income tax to one or more municipal
corporations and the denominator of
which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which is
deferred
under
a
nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
C. With respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, the taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only
in the taxable year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution
of money and property under that
nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
(3) “Qualifying tax rate” means the
applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid
income tax to a municipal corporation

1829

57
with respect to any portion of the
total amount of compensation the
payment of which is deferred under a
nonqualified deferred compensation
plan. If different tax rates applied for
different taxable years, then the
“qualifying tax rate” is a weighted
average of those different tax rates.
The weighted average shall be based
upon the tax paid to the municipal
corporation each year with respect to
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
(b) (1) Except as provided in division (d) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the
income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss
sustained by a taxpayer during the
taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax
rate.
(2) A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which
the taxpayer paid municipal income
tax with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan in one or
more taxable years.
(3) If a taxpayer has paid tax to
more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, the
amount of the credit that a taxpayer
may claim from each municipal corporation shall be calculated on the basis
of each municipal corporation’s proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax paid by
the taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
(4) In no case shall the amount of
the credit allowed under this section
exceed the cumulative income tax
that a taxpayer has paid to a municipal corporation for all taxable years
with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
(c) (1) For purposes of this section,
municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect
to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan shall be considered to have
been paid by the taxpayer with
respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
(2) Any municipal income tax that
has been refunded or otherwise credited for the benefit of the taxpayer
with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not
be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
(d) The credit allowed under this
section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer’s qualifying loss is
attributable to:
(1) The insolvency or bankruptcy
of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
(2) The employee’s failure or
inability to satisfy all of the employer’s terms and conditions necessary to
receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
Section 192.21 Credit for Person
Working in Joint Economic Development District or Zone
The Municipality shall grant a
credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the Municipality who
works in a joint economic development zone created under section
715.691 or a joint economic development district created under Section
715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Revised

58
Code to the same extent that it grants
a credit against its tax on income to
its residents who are employed in
another municipal corporation, under
Section 192.19 of this Chapter.
Section 192.22 Credit for Tax
Beyond Statute for Obtaining Refund
(a) Income tax that has been
deposited or paid to the Municipality,
but should have been deposited or
paid to another municipal corporation, is allowable by the Municipality
as a refund, but is subject to the threeyear limitation on refunds as provided in Section 192.28 of this Chapter.
(b) Income tax that should have
been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but was deposited or paid to
another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery
by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is
barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section 192.28, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable
credit equal to the tax or withholding
paid to the other municipality against
the income tax the Municipality
claims is due. If the Municipality’s
tax rate is higher, the tax representing the net difference of the tax rates
is also subject to collection by the
Municipality, along with any penalty
and interest accruing during the period of nonpayment.
(c) No carryforward of credit will
be permitted when the overpayment
is beyond the three-year limitation for
refunding of same as provided in Section 192.28 of this Chapter.
(d) Nothing in this section requires
a Municipality to allow credit for tax
paid to another municipal corporation
if the Municipality has reduced credit
for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section 192.19 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit
shall prevail.
Section 192.23 Return and Payment
of Tax
(a) (1) An annual return with
respect to the income tax levied on
Municipal Taxable Income by the
Municipality shall be completed and
filed by every taxpayer for any taxable year for which the taxpayer is

whether or not income tax is due.
(2) The Tax Administrator shall
accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by
an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under division (c) of Section 192.10
of this Chapter when the nonresident
individual taxpayer’s sole income
subject to the tax is the qualifying
wages reported by the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer,

Municipality.
(3) All resident individual taxpayers, 18 years of age and older, shall
file an annual municipal income tax

individual shall be completed and
filed by that decedent’s executor,
administrator,

other
person
charged with the property of that

guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or
other person charged with the care of
the person or property of that individual. Such duly authorized agent,
guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or
other person charged with the care of
the person or property of that individual shall provide, with the filing of
the return, appropriate documentation to support that they are authorized to file a return or notice on
behalf of the taxpayer. This notice

authorizations, and contact information including name, address, and
phone number of the duly authorized

fiduciary.
(e) The municipality shall not deny
spouses the ability to file a joint
return.
(f) (1) Each return required to be
filed under this section shall contain
the signature of the taxpayer or the
taxpayer’s duly authorized agent and

for the taxpayer, and shall include the
taxpayer’s social security number or
taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
(2) A taxpayer who is an individual
is required to include, with each annual return, amended return, or request

Internal Revenue Service form 1040
and, with respect to an amended tax

documentation necessary to support
the refund request or the adjustments
made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual

paper copies of any of the foregoing
to the Tax Administrator unless the
Tax Administrator requests such
copies after the return has been filed.
(3) A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for

return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer’s municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under
division (f) of this section apply
regardless of whether the taxpayer
files on a generic form or on a form
prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
(6) Any other documentation,
including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also
be included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax
Administrator of undocumented credits or losses.
(g) (1) A. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each individual

individual, and net profit income tax
return required to be filed by a taxpayer who is not an individual, no
remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
(2) If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the
Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and
make payments otherwise than as
provided in this section, including
taxpayers not otherwise required to
file annual returns.
(3) With respect to taxpayers to
whom Section 192.24 of this Chapter
applies, to the extent that any provision in this division conflicts with

December 2, 2015
any provision in Section 192.24 of this
Chapter, the provision in Section
192.24 of this Chapter prevails.
(h) (1) For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax
with respect to net profits if the
amount due is ten dollars or less.
(2) Any taxpayer not required to
remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year under division (h)(1) of
this section shall file with the Municipality an annual net profit return
under division (f)(3) and (4) of this
section.
(i) This division shall not apply to
payments required to be made under
division (b)(1)B. or C. of Section

or other document required to be filed,
or any payment required to be made,
within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this
chapter is delivered after that period
or that date to the Tax Administrator
or other municipal official with which
the report, claim, statement, or other
document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be
made, the date of the postmark
stamped on the cover in which the
report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment is mailed shall be
deemed to be the date of delivery or
the date of payment. “The date of
postmark” means, in the event there
is more than one date on the cover, the
earliest date imprinted on the cover
by the postal service.
(2) If a payment is required to be
made by electronic funds transfer, the
payment is considered to be made
when the payment is credited to an
account designated by the Tax
Administrator for the receipt of tax
payments, except that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to circumstances
not under the control of the taxpayer,
the payment is considered to be made
when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this section,
“submitted the payment” means the
date which the taxpayer has designated for the delivery of payment,
which may or may not be the same
date as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
(j) The amounts withheld for the
Municipality by an employer, the
agent of an employer, or other payer
as described in Section 192.10 of this
Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation as credits
against payment of the tax imposed
on the recipient unless the amounts
withheld were not remitted to the
Municipality and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure
to remit the amounts withheld.
(k) Each return required by the
Municipality to be filed under this
section shall include a box that the
taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax
return preparer who prepared the
return, to communicate with the Tax
Administrator about matters pertaining to the return. The return or
instructions accompanying the return
shall indicate that by checking the
box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax
Administrator to contact the preparer
or other person concerning questions
that arise during the examination or
other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person
only to provide the Tax Administrator

The City Record
with information that is missing from
the return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the
examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer’s
refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors,
offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the Tax
Administrator and has shown to the
preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of another person to communicate with the Tax
Administrator about matters pertaining to the return does not preclude the
Tax Administrator from contacting
the taxpayer regarding such matters.
(l) The Tax Administrator shall
accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the Municipality
under this Chapter, provided that the
generic form, once completed and
filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinances, resolutions,
or rules adopted by the Municipality
or Tax Administrator, and provided
that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of
this Chapter and of the Municipality’s
Ordinance or resolution governing
the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
(m) When income tax returns,
reports, or other documents require
the signature of a tax return preparer,
the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu
of a manual signature.
(n) (1) As used in this division,
“worksite location” has the same
meaning as in Section 192.11 of this
chapter.
(2) A person may notify the Tax
Administrator that the person does
not expect to be a taxpayer with
respect to the municipal corporation
for a taxable year if both of the following conditions apply:
A. The person was required to file a
tax return with the municipal corporation for the immediately preceding
taxable year because the person performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and the person has filed all
appropriate and required returns and
remitted all applicable income tax
and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who has not
complied with the provisions of this
chapter.
B. The person no longer provides
services in the municipal corporation,
and does not expect to be subject to
the municipal corporation’s income
tax for the taxable year
The person shall provide the notice
in a signed affidavit that briefly
explains the person’s circumstances,
including the location of the previous
worksite location and the last date on
which the person performed services
or made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also
shall include the following statement:
“The affiant has no plans to perform
any services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the
municipal corporation, or otherwise
become subject to the tax levied by
the municipal corporation during the
taxable year. If the affiant does
become subject to the tax levied by
the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly

1831

59
register as a taxpayer with the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation’s resolutions, ordinances, or
rules.” The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
C. If a person submits an affidavit
described in division (n)(2) of this
section, the Tax Administrator shall
not require the person to file any tax
return for the taxable year unless the
tax administrator possesses information that conflicts with the affidavit
or if the circumstances described in
the affidavit change, or the taxpayer
has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services
provided, sales made, or other activity
that results in municipal taxable
income reportable to the Municipality
in the taxable year. It shall be the
responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the provisions of this chapter
relating to the reporting and filing of
municipal taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even
if an affidavit has been filed with the
tax administrator for the taxable
year. Nothing in division (n) of this
section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an audit of the
person.

(a) Each member of the national
guard of any state and each member
of a reserve component of the armed
forces of the United States called to

zone or contingency operation in support of the armed forces, may apply to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality for both an extension of time
for filing of the return and an extension of time for payment of taxes
required by the Municipality under
this chapter during the period of the
member’s or civilian’s duty service
and for one hundred eighty days
thereafter. The application shall be
filed on or before the one hundred
eightieth day after the member’s or
civilian’s duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as
the Tax Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for
the extension.
(b) (1) If the Tax Administrator
ascertains that an applicant is qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in

Administrator may prescribe such
contract terms as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
(2) If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified for
an extension under this section, the
applicant shall neither be required to

document nor be required to pay any
tax otherwise due to the Municipality
before the one hundred eighty-first
day after the applicant’s active duty
or service terminates.
(3) Taxes paid under a contract
entered into under division (b)(1) of
this section are not delinquent. The

to the length of the corresponding
extension that the taxpayer receives
under the Internal Revenue Code. As

component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty

issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as
support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of
the armed forces.
B. Taxes the payment of which is
extended under division (c)(2)A. of
this section are not delinquent during
the extension period. Such taxes
become delinquent on the first day
after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior
to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of
penalties or interest in connection
with those taxes for the extension
period. The Tax Administrator shall
not include any period of extension
granted under division (c)(2)A. of
this section in calculating the penalty
or interest due on any unpaid tax.
(d) For each taxable year to which
division (a), (b), or (c) of this section
applies to a taxpayer, the provisions
of divisions (b)(2) and (3) or (c) of
this section, as applicable, apply to
the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.
Section 192.25 Use of Ohio Business
Gateway; Types of Filings Authorized
(a) Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to
the taxpayer’s net profit from a business or profession may file any

the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of

municipal income taxes or to an
appeal of a municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically
provided by law.

File
(a) Any taxpayer that has duly
requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer’s
federal income tax return shall automatically receive an extension for the

after the last day of the taxable year
to which the return relates.
(b) Any taxpayer that qualifies for
an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an
extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax
return shall be the same as that of the
extended federal income tax return.
(c) A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer’s federal
income tax return may request that
the tax administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the
date for filing the taxpayer’s municipal income tax return. If the request
is received by the tax administrator
on or before the date the municipal
income tax return is due, the tax
administrator shall grant the taxpayer’s requested extension.
(d) An extension of time to file
under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless
the Tax Administrator grants an
extension of that date.
(e) If the State Tax Commissioner
extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under
division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax
return. The extended due date of the
municipal income tax return shall be
the same as the extended due date of
the state income tax return.
Section 192.27 Amended Returns
(a) (1) A taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the Tax Administrator in such form as the Tax

tax due levied by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter must be
altered.
(2) Within sixty days after the
final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer’s municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an
amended municipal return showing
income subject to the municipal
income tax based upon such final
determination of federal or state tax
liability, and pay any additional
municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of
any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
(3) If a taxpayer intends to file an
amended
consolidated
municipal
income tax return, or to amend its

1832

December 2, 2015
type of return from a separate return
to a consolidated return, based on the
taxpayer’s
consolidated
federal
income tax return, the taxpayer shall
notify the Tax Administrator before
filing the amended return.
(b) (1) In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together
with any penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be
due is ten dollars or less, such amount
need not accompany the amended
return. Except as provided under division (b)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not reopen those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments
from a previously filed return that are
not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer’s federal or state income tax
return unless the applicable statute
of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under Section 192.41 of this
Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
(2) The additional tax to be paid
shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments were
reopened.
(c) (1) In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the
period prescribed division (a)(2) of
this section for filing the amended
return even if it is filed beyond the
period prescribed in that division if it
otherwise conforms to the requirements of that division. If the amount
of the refund is ten dollars or less, no
refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (c)(2) of this section,
a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments
resulting from alterations to only
those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments required in the taxpayer’s annual return that are affected,
either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer’s federal
or state income tax return unless it is
also filed within the time prescribed
in section 192.28 of this Chapter.
Except as set forth in division (c)(2)
of this section, the request shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not
affected, either directly or indirectly,
by the adjustment to the taxpayer’s
federal or state income tax return.
(2) The amount to be refunded shall
not exceed the amount of refund that
would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
Section 192.28 Refunds
(a) Upon receipt of a request for a
refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, under this section, shall
refund to employers, agents of
employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
(1) Overpayments of more than ten
dollars;
(2) Amounts paid erroneously if the
refund requested exceeds ten dollars.
(b) (1) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be
filed with the Tax Administrator,
within three years after the tax was
due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the
taxpayer’s claim for a refund must be

December 2, 2015
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation,
including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent factors on the return will cause
delay in processing, and / or disallowance of undocumented credits or
losses.
(2) On filing of the refund request,
the Tax Administrator shall determine the amount of refund due and
certify such amount to the appropriate Municipality official for payment.
Except as provided in division (b)(3)
of this section, the administrator
shall issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose request for refund is
fully or partially denied. The assessment shall state the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons
for the denial, and instructions for
appealing the assessment.
(3) If a Tax Administrator denies
in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer’s originally filed annual income tax return,
the Tax Administrator shall notify
the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied,
the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section 192.40 of this Chapter.
(c) A request for a refund that is
received after the last day for filing
specified in division (b) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the
following situations exist:
(1) The request is delivered by the
postal service, and the earliest postal
service postmark on the cover in
which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the
request;
(2) The request is delivered by the
postal service, the only postmark on
the cover in which the request is
enclosed was affixed by a private
postal meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for
filing the request, and the request is
received within seven days of such
last day; or
(3) The request is delivered by the
postal service, no postmark date was
affixed to the cover in which the
request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible,
and the request is received within
seven days of the last day for making
the request.
(d) Interest shall be allowed and
paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of any municipal income tax
obligation from the date of the overpayment until the date of the refund
of the overpayment, except that if any
overpayment is refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of
the annual return or ninety days after
the
completed
return
is
filed,
whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of
interest on amounts overpaid, no
amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid
before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time
for filing that return. Interest shall be
paid at the interest rate described in
division (a)(4) of Section 192.29 of
this Chapter.

shall not extinguish or otherwise
affect the liability of any other person.
(e) (1) A compromise or paymentover-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer
defaults under the compromise or
agreement or if the compromise or
agreement was obtained by fraud or
by misrepresentation of a material
fact. Any amount that was due before
the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and
any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the
compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue and be due.
(2) The Tax Administrator shall
have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest,
charges or applicable fees will be
assessed through the duration of any
compromise or payment-over-time
agreement.
(f) The Tax Administrator may
require that the taxpayer provide
detailed financial documentation and
information, in order to determine
whether or not a payment-over-time
agreement will be authorized. The
taxpayer’s failure to provide the necessary and required information by
the Tax Administrator shall preclude
consideration of a payment-over-time
agreement.
Section 192.34 Authority of Tax
Administrator; Right to Examine
(a) The Tax Administrator, or any
authorized agent or employee thereof
may examine the books, papers,
records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to,
or that the Tax Administrator
believes is subject to, the provisions
of this Chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return
made or, if no return was filed, to
ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. On written request by the Tax
Administrator or a duly authorized
agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person
subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax
Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine
such books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a
reasonable time and place designated
in the request.
(b) The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or
other person that is subject to, or that
a Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter

December 2, 2015
shall be open to the Tax Administrator’s inspection during business hours
and shall be preserved for a period of
six years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their
destruction within that period, or by
order requires that they be kept
longer. The Tax Administrator of a
municipal corporation may require
any person, by notice served on that
person, to keep such records as the
Tax Administrator determines necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by
the Municipality or for the withholding of such tax.
(c) The Tax Administrator may
examine under oath any person that
the Tax Administrator reasonably
believes has knowledge concerning
any income that was or would have
been returned for taxation or any
transaction tending to affect such
income. The Tax Administrator may,
for this purpose, compel any such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income
tax returns in such person’s possession or control. The person may be
assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does
not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
(d) No person issued written notice
by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books,
papers, records, or federal and state
income tax returns under this section
shall fail to comply.
Section 192.35 Authority of Tax
Administrator; Requiring Identifying
Information
(a) The Tax Administrator may
require any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide
identifying
information,
which may include the person’s social
security number, federal employer
identification number, or other identification number requested by the Tax
Administrator. A person required by
the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information that has
experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the
Tax Administrator of the change
before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying
information.
(b) (1) If the Tax Administrator
makes a request for identifying information and the Tax Administrator
does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of
making the request, nothing in this
chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the
person to whom the request was
directed under Section 192.29 of this
Chapter, in addition to any applicable
penalty described in Section 192.99 of
this Chapter.
(2) If a person required by the Tax
Administrator to provide identifying
information does not notify the Tax
Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as
required under division (a) of this
section within thirty days after filing
the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in
this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty
under Section 192.29 of this Chapter.

The City Record
(3) The penalties provided for
under divisions (b)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in
the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying
information is sought and are in addition to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section 192.99 of this
Chapter for a violation of Section
192.37 of this Chapter, and any other
penalties that may be imposed by the
Tax Administrator by law.
Section 192.36 Confidentiality
(a) Any information gained as a
result of returns, investigations, hearings, or verifications required or
authorized by Chapter 718 of the
Revised Code or by the charter or
ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except
under a proper judicial order or in
connection with the performance of
that person’s official duties or the
official business of the Municipality
as authorized by Chapter 718 of the
Revised Code or the charter or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax
Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies
of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related
tax information to the Internal Revenue Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of
other municipal corporations.
(b) This section does not prohibit
the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that
does not disclose information with
respect to particular taxpayers.
Section 192.37 Fraud
No person shall knowingly make,
present, aid, or assist in the preparation or presentation of a false or
fraudulent report, return, schedule,
statement, claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or state law to be
filed with the Tax Administrator, or
knowingly procure, counsel, or advise
the preparation or presentation of
such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or
knowingly procure, counsel or advise
such change, alteration, or amendment of the records upon which such
report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document is based with
intent to defraud the Municipality or
the Tax Administrator.
Section 192.38 Opinion of the Tax
Administrator
(a) An “opinion of the Tax Administrator” means an opinion issued
under this section with respect to
prospective municipal income tax liability. It does not include ordinary
correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
(b) A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how
certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be
taxed. The written response of the
Tax Administrator shall be an “opinion of the Tax Administrator” and
shall bind the Tax Administrator,
under divisions (c), (g), and (h) of
this section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
(1) The taxpayer’s request fully
and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a
determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or

1835

63
transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in
the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other
pertinent facts;
(2) The request relates to a tax
imposed by the Municipality under
this Chapter; and
(3)
The
Tax
Administrator’s
response is signed by the Tax Administrator and designated as an “opinion
of the Tax Administrator.”
(c) An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the
opinion was prepared and who reasonably relies on it from liability for
any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise chargeable on the activity or
transaction specifically held by the
Tax Administrator’s opinion to be
taxable in a particular manner or not
to be subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in
the opinion, or until the earliest of the
following dates:
(1) The effective date of a written
revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail,
return receipt requested. The effective date of the revocation shall be the
taxpayer’s date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion,
whichever is later;
(2) The effective date of any
amendment or enactment of a relevant section of the Revised Code,
uncodified state law, or the Municipality’s income tax ordinance that
would substantially change the
analysis and conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
(3) The date on which a court
issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with
respect to the Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality’s
income tax ordinance;
(4) If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the interpretation of federal law, the effective date
of any change in the relevant federal
statutes or regulations, or the date on
which a court issues an opinion establishing or changing relevant case law
with respect to federal statutes or regulations;
(5) The effective date of any
change in the taxpayer’s material
facts or circumstances; or
(6) The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified in the
opinion.
(d) (1) A taxpayer is not relieved of
tax liability for any activity or transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
(2) If the taxpayer knowingly has
misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to
defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the
taxpayer may be in violation of Section 192.37 of this Chapter.
(e) If a Tax Administrator provides
written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement
that:
(1) The tax consequences stated in
the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (c) of this section; and
(2) It is the duty of the taxpayer to
be aware of such changes.
(f) A Tax Administrator may
refuse to offer an opinion on any
request received under this section.
(g) This section binds a Tax
Administrator only with respect to

64
opinions of the Tax Administrator
issued on or after January 1, 2016.
(h) An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator
only with respect to the taxpayer for
whom the opinion was prepared and
does not bind the Tax Administrator
of any other municipal corporation.
(i) A Tax Administrator shall make
available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except
those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who has requested that the text of
the opinion remain confidential. In no
event shall the text of an opinion be
made available until the Tax Administrator has removed all information
that identifies the taxpayer and any
other parties involved in the activity
or transaction.
(j) An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under division (f) may not be appealed.
Section 192.39 Assessment; Appeal
Based on Presumption of Delivery
(a) (1) The Tax Administrator
shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or
by a delivery service authorized
under Section 5703.056 of the Revised
Code.
(2) The Tax Administrator may
deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail.
Such alternative delivery method
must be authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
(3) Once service of the assessment
has been made by the Tax Administrator or other municipal official, or
the designee of either, the person to
whom the assessment is directed may
protest the ruling of that assessment
by filing an appeal with the Local
Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The
delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is
prima facie evidence that delivery is
complete and that the assessment is
served.
(b) (1) A person may challenge the
presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person
disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears
the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the address
to which the assessment was sent was
not an address with which the person
was associated at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the
assessment by certified mail. For the
purposes of this section, a person is
associated with an address at the
time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that
time, the person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting
business at the address; or if, before
that time, the person had conducted
business at the address and, when the
assessment was mailed, the person’s
agent or the person’s affiliate was
conducting business at the address.
For the purposes of this section, a person’s affiliate is any other person
that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least
twenty per cent, as determined by voting rights, of the addressee’s business.
(2) If a person elects to appeal an
assessment on the basis described in
division (b)(1) of this section, and if

The City Record
that assessment is subject to collection and is not otherwise appealable,
the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the
Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either,
with the person. Nothing in this division prevents the Tax Administrator
or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the
person does not actually file such an
appeal with the Local Board of Tax
Review.
Section 192.40 Local Board of Tax
Review; Appeal to Local Board of Tax
Review
(a) A Board of Review, consisting
of three members, one appointed by
the mayor and two members appointed by Council, is hereby created and
shall be maintained to hear appeals
by taxpayers of assessments issued
by the Tax Administrator regarding a
municipal income tax obligation that
is subject to appeal as provided in
Chapter 718 of the Revised Code, this
chapter or the Rules and Regulations.
Said appeal shall be filed within sixty
days after the taxpayer receives the
assessment.
(b) The members appointed by
Council may not be employees of the
City of Cleveland, elected officials, or
contractors with the City of Cleveland
at any time during their term or in the
five years immediately preceding the
date of appointment.
(1) These members shall serve for a
term of two years and may be reappointed by Council an unlimited
number of times.
(2) Members appointed by Council
may be removed pursuant to Chapter
718 of the Revised Code.
(c) The member appointed by the
Mayor may be an employee of the City
of Cleveland, but may not be the
Director of Finance, Tax Administrator, or an employee directly involved
in municipal tax matters, or any
direct subordinate thereof. This member shall serve at the discretion of the
Mayor.
(d) A member of the Board who, for
any reason, ceases to meet the qualifications for the position prescribed
by this section or Chapter 718 of the
Revised Code shall resign immediately by operation of law.
(e) Any vacancy in an unexpired
term shall be filled by the appointing
authority within 60 days of when the
vacancy was created. Any member
appointed to fill a vacancy occurring
prior to the expiration of the term for
which the member’s predecessor was
appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy
on the Board shall impair the power
and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board.
(f) If a member is temporarily
unable to serve on the Board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence,
or similar reason, another individual
shall be appointed by the original
appointing authority, the Mayor or
Council, to temporarily serve in the
member’s place. The appointment of
such an individual shall be subject to
the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
(g) The Board shall follow all procedures and requirements imposed by
Chapter 718 of the Revised Code in
conducting hearings and appeals
before the Board as well as in issuing

1836

December 2, 2015
its decisions. All matters before the
Board shall be confidential as provided under Chapter 718 of the Revised
Code.
Section 192.41 Actions to Recover;
Statute of Limitations
(a) (1) A. Civil actions to recover
municipal income taxes and penalties
and interest on municipal income
taxes shall be brought within the latter of:
1. Three years after the tax was due
or the return was filed, whichever is
later; or
2. One year after the conclusion of
the qualifying deferral period, if any.
B. The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may be
extended at any time if both the Tax
Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or
taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also
extend for the same period of time the
time limit described in division (c) of
this section.
(2) As used in this section, “qualifying deferral period” means a period of
time beginning and ending as follows:
A. Beginning on the date a person
who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax
Review the request described in Section 192.40 of this Chapter. That date
shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or holding by
any administrative body or court that
the Local Board of Tax Review with
which the aggrieved person filed the
request did not have jurisdiction to
affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of that assessment.
B. Ending the later of the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final
determination of the Local Board of
Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination
of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Local
Board of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or
ultimately reversed and no further
appeal of either that affirmation, in
whole or in part, or that reversal is
available or taken.
(b) Prosecutions for an offense
made punishable under a resolution
or ordinance imposing an income tax
shall be commenced within three
years after the commission of the
offense, provided that in the case of
fraud, failure to file a return, or the
omission of twenty-five per cent or
more of income required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced
within six years after the commission
of the offense.
(c) A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in
Section 192.28 of this Chapter.
(d) (1) Notwithstanding the fact
that an appeal is pending, the petitioner may pay all or a portion of the
assessment that is the subject of the
appeal. The acceptance of a payment
by the Municipality does not prejudice any claim for refund upon final
determination of the appeal.
(2) If upon final determination of
the appeal an error in the assessment
is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or under a
final determination of the Local
Board of Tax Review created under
Section 192.40 of this Chapter, of the
Ohio board of tax appeals, or any
court to which the decision of the Ohio

December 2, 2015
board of tax appeals has been
appealed, so that the amount due from
the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than the amount
paid, there shall be issued to the
appellant or to the appellant’s assigns
or legal representative a refund in the
amount of the overpayment as provided by Section 192.28 of this Chapter,
with interest on that amount as provided by division (d) of this section.
(e) No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties or
interest shall be brought during
either of the following time periods:
(1) The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the imposition of that tax or interest or those
penalties; or
(2) The period during which an
appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties
is pending.
Section 192.42 Adoption of Rules
(a) Under Section 718.30 of the
Revised Code, the Municipality, under
this Chapter, grants authority to the
Tax Administrator to adopt rules to
administer the income tax imposed by
the Municipality.
(b) All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on
the internet.
Section 192.43 Rentals
(a) Rental income received by a
resident or nonresident taxpayer for

municipal taxable income under this
ordinance.
(b) Where the gross monthly rental
of any and all real properties, regardless of number and value, aggregates
in excess of one hundred twenty-five
dollars ($125.00) per month, it shall be
prima facie evidence that the rental,
ownership, management or operation
of such properties, is a business activity of such taxpayer, and the net
income of such rental property shall
be subject to tax. However, in the
case of commercial property, the
owner shall be considered engaged in
a business activity when the rental is
based on a fixed or fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts
or profits, of the lessee, whether or
not such rental exceeds one hundred
twenty- five dollars ($125.00) per
month; provided further that in the
case of farm property, the owner shall
be considered engaged in a business
activity when he or she shares in
crops or when the rental is based on a
percentage of the gross or net
receipts derived from the farm,
whether or not the gross income
exceeds one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125.00) per month. It is provided further that the person who operates a licensed rooming house shall
be considered in business whether or
not the gross income exceeds one hundred twenty-five dollars per month
($125.00).
Section 192.44 Unpaid Taxes Recoverable as Other Debts
All taxes imposed by this chapter
shall be collectible, together with any
interest and penalties thereon, as
other debts of like amount are recoverable, including, but not limited to,
collection by suit. Any suit shall be
brought within three (3) years after
the city income tax was due or the
return was filed, whichever is later.
Except in the case of fraud, of omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or

The City Record
more of taxable income required to be
reported, or of failure to file a return,
no additional assessment shall be
made after three (3) years from the
time the city income tax was due or
the city income tax return was filed,
whichever is later.
Section 192.45 Receipt and Records

Administrator
shall
enforce payment of all income taxes
owing to the City, keep accurate
records for a minimum of five (5)
years, showing the amount due from
each taxpayer required to file a declaration of estimated municipal income
tax and make any return, or both,
including returns of taxes withheld
and show the dates and amounts of
payments thereof.
Section 192.47 Authority to Determine Amount of Tax Due
In any case where a taxpayer has
failed to file a return or has filed a
city income tax return which does not
show the proper amount of tax due,
the Tax Administrator may determine the amount of city income tax
appearing to be due the City from the
taxpayer and may send to such taxpayer a written statement showing
the amount of tax so determined,
together with interest and penalties
thereon, if any.

or, if no return was made, to ascertain
the tax or withholding due under this
chapter. Every such employer, supposed employer, taxpayer or supposed
taxpayer is directed and required to
furnish within fifteen (15) days upon
written request by the Administrator,
or his or her duly authorized agent,
representative, or employee, the
means, facilities and opportunities
for making such examinations and
investigations as are hereby authorized.

Production of Records
The Tax Administrator is hereby
authorized to order any person presumed to have knowledge of the facts
to appear before him or her and may
examine such person, under oath, concerning any income which was or
should have been reported or withheld for city income tax purposes or
any transaction tending to affect
such income, and for this purpose may
compel the production of books,
papers, records and federal income
tax returns and the attendance of all
persons before him or her, whether as
parties or witnesses, whenever he or
she believes such persons have
