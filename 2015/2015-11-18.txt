Referred to Directors of Finance and Law; Committee on Finance.
Ord. No. 1400-15.
By Council Members Cimperman, Brancatelli and Kelley (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Economic Development to enter into a Tax Increment
Financing Agreement with Cumberland TCC, LLC, or its designee, or others, to provide for redevelopment of Sites

District; and to declare certain improvements to real property to be a public purpose.
Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of the Revised Code, improvements to real property may be declared to be a
public purpose where fee title to the real property was, at one time, held by the City of Cleveland and the real
property is then leased or conveyed by the City; and
Whereas, the City owns fee title to the real property which consists of real property more fully described in
this ordinance (the “Real Property”); and
Whereas, the Real Property is to be developed in accordance with the Cleveland Downtown Lakefront Development Plan adopted April 20, 2012, which proposes the redevelopment of residential apartments, commercial office

Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of the Revised Code, the improvements declared to be a public purpose may be
exempt from real property taxation; and
Whereas, under Section 5709.42 of the Revised Code, the owners of the improvements may be required to make
annual service payments in lieu of taxes that would have been paid had the improvement not been exempt; and
Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of the Revised Code, the exemption may exceed 75% of the improvements for
up to 30 years when a portion of the service payments so collected are distributed to the Cleveland City School
District (“District”) in an amount equal to the amount the District would have received had the improvement not
been exempt; and
Whereas, the District has been notified of the intent to enter into the agreement authorized by this ordinance
in compliance with Sections 5709.41(C)(4) and 5709.83 of the Revised Code; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the improvements to be constructed by Cumberland TCC, LLC, or its designee, or others (“Redeveloper”), are declared to be a public purpose for purposes of Section 5709.41 of the Revised Code. The Real Property is more fully described as follows:

The City Record

November 18, 2015

Project Description
In 2013, the City of Cleveland released a Request for Proposals for the Redevelopment of the Lakefront. After
reviewing three proposals, the City selected the proposal of Cumberland TCC, LLC to develop these sites. Cumberland TCC, LLC is a joint venture of Cumberland Development, LLC (a Cleveland-based development company)
and Trammell Crow Co., LLC (a national footprint developer). The principal of Cumberland Development is Dick
Pace, who has developed numerous properties in Cleveland, including the Baker Electric Building and the Fifth
Street Arcades. Pursuant to previous ordinances, the City has entered into a Multi-Phase Option to Lease Agreement for the development of these sites. The first phase option has been executed and the development team has
begun preliminary work on the development of sites A, B, and C. Cumberland TCC has proposed almost $280,000,000
in development that will transform the Cleveland Lakefront.
Because these properties have never been significantly developed, infrastructure necessary for the proposed
intensive mixed-use development is lacking.
Sites A-B-C Development
The development will develop six sites: Sites A & B are at Voinovich Park and the former Skatepark and will
consist of park redevelopments, restaurants, retail, and several floors of residential; Site C between the Rock Hall
and Science Center, which is proposed as a six-story hotel above retail. The Developer has already begun the

Project Description
In 2013, the City of Cleveland released a Request for Proposals for the Redevelopment of the Lakefront. After
reviewing three proposals, the City selected the proposal of Cumberland TCC, LLC to develop these sites. Cumberland TCC, LLC is a joint venture of Cumberland Development, LLC (a Cleveland-based development company)
and Trammell Crow Co., LLC (a national footprint developer). The principal of Cumberland Development is Dick
Pace, who has developed numerous properties in Cleveland, including the Baker Electric Building and the Fifth
Street Arcades. Pursuant to previous ordinances, the City has entered into a Multi-Phase Option to Lease Agreement for the development of these sites. The first phase option has been executed and the development team has
begun preliminary work on the development of sites A, B, and C. Cumberland TCC has proposed almost $280,000,000
in development that will transform the Cleveland Lakefront.
Because these properties have never been significantly developed, infrastructure necessary for the proposed
intensive mixed-use development is lacking.
Sites D-E-F Development
Sites D, E, & F, north of the stadium, which will be developed in three phases, and consist of approximately
1,000 apartments and 100,000sf of office. These developments will also include parks and public water access
space, including a boardwalk. This site will transform the Cleveland waterfront and make the former docks accessible for residents and visitors. The development team is currently exploring multiple prospective tenants for the
project area and is looking to begin planning development in this area in 2017.
ORC 5709.41 Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Agreement (Non-School)
The development requires the construction of significant infrastructure improvements to the public right-of-ways
and surrounding areas, including enhancement of utilities, development of greenspace, and installation of a public-access boardwalk.
Under the proposed TIF, the Developer would make Payments in Lieu of Taxes on the property equivalent to
the full amount of the assessed taxes. A share of the PILOT proceeds equal to the school district’s share would
be paid to the schools, while the remainder would be used to fund the necessary infrastructure improvements (a
non-school TIF). PILOTS received would be channeled back into the financing, construction, and/or maintenance
of the improvements to the public infrastructure in the vicinity of the site. Any PILOTS remaining after the payment of these costs would be retained by the City as a reserve for future costs or other economic development
purposes. The TIF Agreement would limit the use of the PILOTS to expenses approved by the City for the infrastructure and other publicly accessible improvements.
Because a portion of the site will be developed with residential improvements, the area surrounding sites D-EF has been designated as a blighted area in accordance with the provisions of the Ohio Revised Code, in order
for residential improvements to be included within the TIF.
City Requirements:
• Ch. 187 (MBE/FBE/CSB) Applies
• Ch. 188 (Fannie M. Lewis Resident Employment Law) Applies
• Ch. 189 (Fair Employment Wage Law) Applies

municipal income tax withholding
requirement
to
the
extent
the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time
the deferred compensation is paid or
distributed.
(g) Each employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes
have been withheld, and such amount
shall be deemed to be held in trust for
the Municipality until such time as
the withheld amount is remitted to
the Tax Administrator.
(h) On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation
Return with the Tax Administrator
listing the names, addresses, and
social security numbers of all employees from whose qualifying wages tax
was withheld or should have been

each such employee’s qualifying
wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during
the preceding calendar year, the

or filing the reports and making payments as required by this section,
shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as
required by this section. The dissolution of an employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer does not discharge the officer’s or employee’s liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer
to file returns or pay any tax due.
(j) An employer is required to
deduct
and
withhold
municipal
income tax on tips and gratuities
received by the employer’s employees
and constituting qualifying wages
only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer’s
control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is under the
employer’s control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to the
employer for subsequent remittance
to the employee, or if the customer
pays the tip or gratuity by credit card,
debit card, or other electronic means.
(k) A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at the request of an employee when
such tax is not otherwise required to
be withheld by this Chapter to be tax
required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

(3) Any other location, if the Tax
Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to
perform the services at the other location in lieu of a location described in
division (c)(1) or (2) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the
employer’s municipal income tax liability. If a Tax Administrator makes

individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the
individual or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in which the property generating the net profit is located and the

that such credit is allowed under Section 192.19 of this Chapter.
(g) If, in computing a taxpayer’s
adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with
respect to a stock option granted to an

thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (k)(12) of

1673

25
Section 192.06 of this Chapter, by a
municipal corporation to which the
taxpayer has apportioned a portion of
its net profit, the taxpayer shall add

was apportioned to that municipal
corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to its net
profit that was apportioned to that
municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the
employee would be required to pay

group of corporations is subject to the
municipal income tax in that taxable
year and if the affiliated group of corporations filed a consolidated federal
income tax return with respect to that
taxable year.
A. The election is binding for a fiveyear period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election
unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.

income tax.
(c) A taxpayer that is a member of
an affiliated group of corporations

by substituting “an affiliated group
of corporation’s” for “a C corporation’s” wherever “a C corporation’s”
appears in that division.
(2) No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise
required under division (a) of Section
192.06 of this Chapter to the extent
that the item of income or deduction

in the computation of consolidated
federal taxable income.
(3) If the net profit or loss of a passthrough entity having at least eighty
per cent of the value of its ownership
interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of
corporations is included in that affiliated group’s consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year, the

The City Record

municipal income tax return shall do
one of the following with respect to
that pass-through entity’s net profit
or loss for that taxable year:
A. Exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the consolidated federal taxable income of the
affiliated group and, for the purpose
of making the computations required
in Section 192.14 of this Chapter,
exclude the property, payroll, and
gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit sitused to a

entity’s net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
B. Include the pass-through entity’s
net profit or loss in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purpose of making the computations required in Section 192.14 of this Chapter, include the
property, payroll, and gross receipts

profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity’s net profit or loss is
so included, the entity shall not be
subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity’s net
profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable income of
the affiliated group.
(4) If the net profit or loss of a passthrough entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated
group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group’s consolidated
federal taxable income for a taxable
year, all of the following shall apply:
A. The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through
entity’s net profit or loss from the consolidated federal taxable income of
the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making the computations
required in Section 192.14 of this
Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the passthrough entity in the computation of
the affiliated group’s net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
and
B. The pass-through entity shall be
subject to municipal income taxation
as a separate taxpayer under this
chapter on the basis of the entity’s net
profits that would otherwise be
included in the consolidated federal
taxable income of the affiliated
group.
(f) Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required
under Section 192.14 of this Chapter
by substituting “consolidated federal
taxable income attributable to” for

November 18, 2015
year is deemed to be paid on the date
of the postmark stamped on the cover
in which the payment is mailed or, if
the payment is made by electronic

192.23 of this Chapter.
A. For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals and are
reporting and filing on a calendar
year basis, the annual tax return is

other than a calendar year, the annual return is due on the fifteenth day of
the fourth month following the end of
the taxable year or period.
(4) An amended declaration is
required whenever the taxpayer’s

penalty and interest may be imposed
under Section 192.29 of this Chapter

the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a
payment of estimated taxes on or
before any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous
underpayment only to the extent the
payment of estimated taxes exceeds
the amount of the payment presently
required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
(e) An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be
due to reasonable cause and the
penalty imposed by this section shall
not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following
apply:
(1) The amount of estimated taxes
that were paid equals at least ninety
per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the
month immediately preceding the
month in which the payment is due.
(2) The amount of estimated taxes
that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability
shown on the return of the taxpayer
for the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding
taxable year reflected a period of

1675

27
twelve months and the taxpayer filed
a return with the municipal corporation under Section 192.23 of this Chapter for that year.
(3) The taxpayer is an individual
who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first
day of January of the calendar year
that includes the first day of the taxable year.

Section 192.19 Cleveland Resident
Subject to Income Tax in Other
Municipal Corporation
(a) When a resident is subject to
and has paid a municipal income tax
in another municipal corporation on
the same income taxable under this
chapter, regardless of whether such
other municipal corporation allows a
credit to its residents, and the rate of
Cleveland’s municipal income tax is
less than two and one-half percent
(2.5%), such resident may claim a
credit of the amount of income tax
paid to the other municipal corporation, but not in excess of fifty percent
(50%) of the tax imposed by this
chapter or fifty percent (50%) of the
tax imposed by the other municipal
corporation, whichever is less. When
a resident is subject to and has paid a
municipal income tax in another
municipal corporation on the same
income taxable under this chapter
regardless of whether such other
municipal corporation allows a credit
to its residents and the rate of Cleveland’s municipal income tax is two
and one-half percent (2.5%) or more,
such resident may claim a credit of
the amount of income tax paid to the
other municipal corporation which
credit shall not exceed the tax
assessed by this chapter on the resident’s taxable income subject to tax
by another municipal corporation.
(b) In the event a resident is entitled to credit for taxes paid another
municipal corporation, such resident
is required to file a return on a form in
such manner as the Tax Administrator may prescribe.
(c) Assignment of any claim for
refund to which a resident may be
entitled from another municipal corporation shall be tentatively accepted
as payment of that portion of city
income tax represented by such
assignment. However, if satisfactory
evidence is offered that the taxpayer
is entitled to the claim covered by the
assignment, such taxpayer shall not
be deprived of credit therefore
because of fault or neglect on the part
of either municipal corporation.
(d) In the event such resident fails,
neglects or refuses to file such return
or form as is prescribed by the Tax
Administrator, such resident shall not
be entitled to such credit and shall be
considered in violation of this chapter
for failure to file a return and make
payment of taxes due hereunder.
(e) A resident owner of a passthrough entity that does not conduct
business in the City and that has paid
an income tax to another municipal
corporation may claim a credit equal
to the lesser of (i) the resident
owner’s proportionate share of the
amount, if any, of income tax paid by
the pass-through entity to another
municipal corporation in the State; or

28
(ii) the resident owner’s proportionate share of the amount of city income
tax that would be imposed on the
pass-through entity if the passthrough entity conducted business in
the City.
(f) In no case shall the amount of
the credit allowed under division (e)
of this section exceed the tax
assessed by this chapter on the resident owner’s taxable income subject
to tax by another municipal corporation.
(g) The credits provided in Sections
718.021 and 718.121 of the Revised
Code shall be available to residents, if
applicable.
Except as otherwise provided in
Chapter 718 of the Revised Code, this
chapter and the Rules and Regulations, where a nonresident is subject
to the tax imposed by this chapter and
is subject to tax on the same taxable
income in the municipal corporation
where such nonresident resides, no
credit against the city income tax
levied by this chapter shall be
allowed.
Section 192.20 Refundable Credit
for Qualifying Loss
(a) As used in this section:
(1) “Nonqualified deferred compensation plan” means a compensation
plan
described
in
section
3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
(2) A. Except as provided in division (a)(2)B. of this section. “qualifying loss” means the excess, if any, of
the total amount of compensation the
payment of which is deferred under a
nonqualified deferred compensation
plan over the total amount of income
the taxpayer has recognized for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer’s receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection
with
the
nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
B. If, for one or more taxable years,
the taxpayer has not paid to one or
more municipal corporations income
tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which
is deferred under a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the
“qualifying loss” is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (a)(2)A. of
this section computed without regard
to division (a)(2)B. of this section
and a fraction the numerator of which
is the portion of such compensation
on which the taxpayer has paid
income tax to one or more municipal
corporations and the denominator of
which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which is
deferred
under
a
nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
C. With respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, the taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only
in the taxable year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution
of money and property under that
nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
(3) “Qualifying tax rate” means the
applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid
income tax to a municipal corporation
with respect to any portion of the
total amount of compensation the
payment of which is deferred under a
nonqualified deferred compensation
plan. If different tax rates applied for
different taxable years, then the

The City Record
“qualifying tax rate” is a weighted
average of those different tax rates.
The weighted average shall be based
upon the tax paid to the municipal
corporation each year with respect to
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
(b) (1) Except as provided in division (d) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the
income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss
sustained by a taxpayer during the
taxable year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the
qualifying loss and the qualifying tax
rate.
(2) A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which
the taxpayer paid municipal income
tax with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan in one or
more taxable years.
(3) If a taxpayer has paid tax to
more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, the
amount of the credit that a taxpayer
may claim from each municipal corporation shall be calculated on the basis
of each municipal corporation’s proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax paid by
the taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
(4) In no case shall the amount of
the credit allowed under this section
exceed the cumulative income tax
that a taxpayer has paid to a municipal corporation for all taxable years
with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
(c) (1) For purposes of this section,
municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect
to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan shall be considered to have
been paid by the taxpayer with
respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
(2) Any municipal income tax that
has been refunded or otherwise credited for the benefit of the taxpayer
with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not
be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
(d) The credit allowed under this
section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer’s qualifying loss is
attributable to:
(1) The insolvency or bankruptcy
of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
(2) The employee’s failure or
inability to satisfy all of the employer’s terms and conditions necessary to
receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
Section 192.21 Credit for Person
Working in Joint Economic Development District or Zone
The Municipality shall grant a
credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the Municipality who
works in a joint economic development zone created under section
715.691 or a joint economic development district created under Section
715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Revised
Code to the same extent that it grants
a credit against its tax on income to
its residents who are employed in
another municipal corporation, under
Section 192.19 of this Chapter.

Section 192.22 Credit for Tax
Beyond Statute for Obtaining Refund
(a) Income tax that has been
deposited or paid to the Municipality,

as a refund, but is subject to the threeyear limitation on refunds as provided in Section 192.28 of this Chapter.
(b) Income tax that should have
been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but was deposited or paid to
another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery
by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is
barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section 192.28, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable
credit equal to the tax or withholding
paid to the other municipality against
the income tax the Municipality
claims is due. If the Municipality’s
tax rate is higher, the tax representing the net difference of the tax rates
is also subject to collection by the
Municipality, along with any penalty
and interest accruing during the period of nonpayment.
(c) No carryforward of credit will
be permitted when the overpayment
is beyond the three-year limitation for
refunding of same as provided in Section 192.28 of this Chapter.

shall prevail.

(2) The Tax Administrator shall
accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by
an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under division (c) of Section 192.10

and, with respect to an amended tax
return or refund request, any other

business gateway or a portal provided by Municipality. The department

The City Record

electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway
on or before January 1, 2016. The
department shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under
this division to the appropriate Tax
Administrator.
(5) After a taxpayer files a tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer’s municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under
division (f) of this section apply
regardless of whether the taxpayer
files on a generic form or on a form
prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
(6) Any other documentation,
including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also
be included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax
Administrator of undocumented credits or losses.
(g) (1) A. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each individual
income tax return required to be filed
under this section shall be completed
and filed as required by the Tax
Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the

on forms prescribed by the Tax
Administrator or on generic forms,
together

made
payable to the Municipality or Tax
Administrator.
B. Except as otherwise provided in
this chapter, each annual net profit
income tax return required to be filed

administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the taxpayer’s taxable year or period. The taxpayer
shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the tax
administrator or on generic forms,
together
with
remittance
made
payable to the Municipality or Tax
Administrator.
C. In the case of individual income
tax return required to be filed by an
individual, and net profit income tax
return required to be filed by a taxpayer who is not an individual, no
remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
(2) If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the
Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may
require taxpayers to file returns and
make payments otherwise than as
provided in this section, including
taxpayers not otherwise required to
file annual returns.
(3) With respect to taxpayers to
whom Section 192.24 of this Chapter
applies, to the extent that any provision in this division conflicts with
any provision in Section 192.24 of this
Chapter, the provision in Section
192.24 of this Chapter prevails.
(h) (1) For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax
with respect to net profits if the
amount due is ten dollars or less.

1677

29
(2) Any taxpayer not required to
remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year under division (h)(1) of
this section shall file with the Municipality an annual net profit return
under division (f)(3) and (4) of this
section.
(i) This division shall not apply to
payments required to be made under
division (b)(1)B. or C. of Section
192.10 of this Chapter.
(1) If any report, claim, statement,
or other document required to be filed,
or any payment required to be made,
within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this
chapter is delivered after that period
or that date to the Tax Administrator
or other municipal official with which
the report, claim, statement, or other
document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be
made, the date of the postmark
stamped on the cover in which the
report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment is mailed shall be
deemed to be the date of delivery or
the date of payment. “The date of
postmark” means, in the event there
is more than one date on the cover, the
earliest date imprinted on the cover
by the postal service.
(2) If a payment is required to be
made by electronic funds transfer, the
payment is considered to be made
when the payment is credited to an
account designated by the Tax
Administrator for the receipt of tax
payments, except that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to circumstances
not under the control of the taxpayer,
the payment is considered to be made
when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this section,
“submitted the payment” means the
date which the taxpayer has designated for the delivery of payment,
which may or may not be the same
date as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
(j) The amounts withheld for the
Municipality by an employer, the
agent of an employer, or other payer
as described in Section 192.10 of this
Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation as credits
against payment of the tax imposed
on the recipient unless the amounts
withheld were not remitted to the
Municipality and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure
to remit the amounts withheld.
(k) Each return required by the
Municipality to be filed under this
section shall include a box that the
taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax
return preparer who prepared the
return, to communicate with the Tax
Administrator about matters pertaining to the return. The return or
instructions accompanying the return
shall indicate that by checking the
box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax
Administrator to contact the preparer
or other person concerning questions
that arise during the examination or
other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person
only to provide the Tax Administrator
with information that is missing from
the return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the
examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer’s
refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors,
offsets, or return preparation that the

30
taxpayer has received from the Tax
Administrator and has shown to the
preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of another person to communicate with the Tax
Administrator about matters pertaining to the return does not preclude the
Tax Administrator from contacting
the taxpayer regarding such matters.
(l) The Tax Administrator shall
accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the Municipality
under this Chapter, provided that the
generic form, once completed and
filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinances, resolutions,
or rules adopted by the Municipality
or Tax Administrator, and provided
that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of
this Chapter and of the Municipality’s
Ordinance or resolution governing
the filing of returns, reports, or documents.
(m) When income tax returns,
reports, or other documents require
the signature of a tax return preparer,
the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu
of a manual signature.
(n) (1) As used in this division,
“worksite location” has the same
meaning as in Section 192.11 of this
chapter.
(2) A person may notify the Tax
Administrator that the person does
not expect to be a taxpayer with
respect to the municipal corporation
for a taxable year if both of the following conditions apply:
A. The person was required to file a
tax return with the municipal corporation for the immediately preceding
taxable year because the person performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and the person has filed all
appropriate and required returns and
remitted all applicable income tax
and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who has not
complied with the provisions of this
chapter.
B. The person no longer provides
services in the municipal corporation,
and does not expect to be subject to
the municipal corporation’s income
tax for the taxable year
The person shall provide the notice
in a signed affidavit that briefly
explains the person’s circumstances,
including the location of the previous
worksite location and the last date on
which the person performed services
or made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also
shall include the following statement:
“The affiant has no plans to perform
any services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the
municipal corporation, or otherwise
become subject to the tax levied by
the municipal corporation during the
taxable year. If the affiant does
become subject to the tax levied by
the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly
register as a taxpayer with the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation’s resolutions, ordinances, or
rules.” The person shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
C. If a person submits an affidavit
described in division (n)(2) of this
section, the Tax Administrator shall

The City Record
not require the person to file any tax
return for the taxable year unless the
tax administrator possesses information that conflicts with the affidavit
or if the circumstances described in
the affidavit change, or the taxpayer
has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services
provided, sales made, or other activity
that results in municipal taxable
income reportable to the Municipality
in the taxable year. It shall be the
responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the provisions of this chapter
relating to the reporting and filing of
municipal taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even
if an affidavit has been filed with the
tax administrator for the taxable
year. Nothing in division (n) of this
section prohibits the tax administrator from performing an audit of the
person.
Section 192.24 Return and Payment
of Tax; Individuals Serving in Combat Zone
(a) Each member of the national
guard of any state and each member
of a reserve component of the armed
forces of the United States called to
active duty under an executive order
issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the
United States, and each civilian serving as support personnel in a combat
zone or contingency operation in support of the armed forces, may apply to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality for both an extension of time
for filing of the return and an extension of time for payment of taxes
required by the Municipality under
this chapter during the period of the
member’s or civilian’s duty service
and for one hundred eighty days
thereafter. The application shall be
filed on or before the one hundred
eightieth day after the member’s or
civilian’s duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as
the Tax Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for
the extension.
(b) (1) If the Tax Administrator
ascertains that an applicant is qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one
hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant’s active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division (b)(3) of this section, the Tax
Administrator may prescribe such
contract terms as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
(2) If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified for
an extension under this section, the
applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax
document nor be required to pay any
tax otherwise due to the Municipality
before the one hundred eighty-first
day after the applicant’s active duty
or service terminates.
(3) Taxes paid under a contract
entered into under division (b)(1) of
this section are not delinquent. The
Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest
in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
(c) (1) Nothing in this division
denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions
(a) and (b) of this section.

document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes
required by the Municipality in accordance with this chapter. The length of
any extension granted under division
(c)(2)A. of this section shall be equal
to the length of the corresponding
extension that the taxpayer receives
under the Internal Revenue Code. As
used in this section, “qualifying taxpayer” means a member of the national guard or a member of a reserve
component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty
pursuant to either an executive order
issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the
United States, or a civilian serving as
support personnel in a combat zone or
contingency operation in support of
the armed forces.
B. Taxes the payment of which is
extended under division (c)(2)A. of
this section are not delinquent during
the extension period. Such taxes
become delinquent on the first day
after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior
to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of
penalties or interest in connection
with those taxes for the extension
period. The Tax Administrator shall
not include any period of extension
granted under division (c)(2)A. of
this section in calculating the penalty
or interest due on any unpaid tax.
(d) For each taxable year to which
division (a), (b), or (c) of this section
applies to a taxpayer, the provisions
of divisions (b)(2) and (3) or (c) of
this section, as applicable, apply to
the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year.
Section 192.25 Use of Ohio Business
Gateway; Types of Filings Authorized

employer, or other payer may report
the amount of municipal income tax
withheld from qualifying wages, and
may
make
remittance
of
such
amounts, by using the Ohio Business
Gateway.
(c) Nothing in this section affects
the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of
any required tax.
(d) The use of the Ohio Business
Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not
affect the legal rights of municipalities or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law. The State of Ohio shall not
be a party to the administration of
municipal income taxes or to an
appeal of a municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically
provided by law.
(e) Nothing in this section shall be
construed as limiting or removing the
authority of the Municipality to
administer, audit, and enforce the provisions of its municipal income tax.

Section 192.26 Extension of Time to
File
(a) Any taxpayer that has duly
requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer’s
federal income tax return shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax
return. The extended due date of the
municipal income tax return shall be
the fifteenth day of the tenth month
after the last day of the taxable year
to which the return relates.
(b) Any taxpayer that qualifies for
an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer’s federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an
extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return. The extended due
date of the municipal income tax
return shall be the same as that of the
extended federal income tax return.
(c) A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer’s federal
income tax return may request that
the tax administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the
date for filing the taxpayer’s municipal income tax return. If the request
is received by the tax administrator
on or before the date the municipal
income tax return is due, the tax
administrator shall grant the taxpayer’s requested extension.
(d) An extension of time to file
under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless
the Tax Administrator grants an
extension of that date.
(e) If the State Tax Commissioner
extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under
division (G) of Section 5747.08 of the
Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax
return. The extended due date of the
municipal income tax return shall be
the same as the extended due date of
the state income tax return.
Section 192.27 Amended Returns
(a) (1) A taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the Tax Administrator in such form as the Tax
Administrator requires if any of the

tax due levied by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter must be
altered.
(2) Within sixty days after the
final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer’s municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an
amended municipal return showing
income subject to the municipal
income tax based upon such final
determination of federal or state tax
liability, and pay any additional
municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of
any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
(3) If a taxpayer intends to file an
amended
consolidated
municipal
income tax return, or to amend its
type of return from a separate return
to a consolidated return, based on the
federal
taxpayer’s
consolidated
income tax return, the taxpayer shall
notify the Tax Administrator before
filing the amended return.
(b) (1) In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together

The City Record
with any penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be
due is ten dollars or less, such amount
need not accompany the amended
return. Except as provided under division (b)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not reopen those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments
from a previously filed return that are
not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer’s federal or state income tax
return unless the applicable statute
of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under Section 192.41 of this
Chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
(2) The additional tax to be paid
shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments were
reopened.
(c) (1) In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the
period prescribed division (a)(2) of
this section for filing the amended
return even if it is filed beyond the
period prescribed in that division if it
otherwise conforms to the requirements of that division. If the amount
of the refund is ten dollars or less, no
refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (c)(2) of this section,
a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments
resulting from alterations to only
those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments required in the taxpayer’s annual return that are affected,
either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer’s federal
or state income tax return unless it is
also filed within the time prescribed
in section 192.28 of this Chapter.
Except as set forth in division (c)(2)
of this section, the request shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not
affected, either directly or indirectly,
by the adjustment to the taxpayer’s
federal or state income tax return.
(2) The amount to be refunded shall
not exceed the amount of refund that
would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
Section 192.28 Refunds
(a) Upon receipt of a request for a
refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, under this section, shall
refund to employers, agents of
employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
(1) Overpayments of more than ten
dollars;
(2) Amounts paid erroneously if the
refund requested exceeds ten dollars.
(b) (1) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be
filed with the Tax Administrator,
within three years after the tax was
due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the
taxpayer’s claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation,
including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent factors on the return will cause
delay in processing, and / or disallowance of undocumented credits or
losses.

1679

(2) On filing of the refund request,
the Tax Administrator shall determine the amount of refund due and
certify such amount to the appropriate Municipality official for payment.
Except as provided in division (b)(3)
of this section, the administrator
shall issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose request for refund is
fully or partially denied. The assessment shall state the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons
for the denial, and instructions for
appealing the assessment.
(3) If a Tax Administrator denies
in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer’s originally filed annual income tax return,
the Tax Administrator shall notify
the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied,
the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section 192.40 of this Chapter.
(c) A request for a refund that is
received after the last day for filing
specified in division (b) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the
following situations exist:

postal service, and the earliest postal
service postmark on the cover in
which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the
request;
(2) The request is delivered by the
postal service, the only postmark on
the cover in which the request is
enclosed was affixed by a private
postal meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for
filing the request, and the request is
received within seven days of such
last day; or
(3) The request is delivered by the
postal service, no postmark date was
affixed to the cover in which the
request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible,
and the request is received within
seven days of the last day for making
the request.
(d) Interest shall be allowed and
paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of any municipal income tax
obligation from the date of the overpayment until the date of the refund
of the overpayment, except that if any
overpayment is refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of
the annual return or ninety days after
the
completed
return
is
filed,
whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of
interest on amounts overpaid, no
amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid
before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time
for filing that return. Interest shall be
paid at the interest rate described in

Section 192.30 Audit
(a) At or before the commencement
of an audit, as defined in division (c)
of Section 192.06 of this Chapter, the
Tax Administrator shall provide to
the taxpayer a written description of
the roles of the Tax Administrator
and of the taxpayer during an audit
and a statement of the taxpayer’s
rights, including any right to obtain a
refund of an overpayment of tax. At
or before the commencement of an
audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is
considered to have commenced.
(b) Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit

1680

November 18, 2015
of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable
notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer
who is unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the
grounds that the proposed time would
cause inconvenience or hardship
must offer reasonable alternative
dates for the audit.
(c) At all stages of an audit by the
Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is entitled to be assisted or represented by
an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax
Administrator shall prescribe a form
by which a taxpayer may designate
such a person to assist or represent
the taxpayer in the conduct of any
proceedings resulting from actions by
the Tax Administrator. If a taxpayer
has not submitted such a form, the
Tax Administrator may accept other
evidence, as the Tax Administrator
considers appropriate, that a person
is the authorized representative of a
taxpayer.
A taxpayer may refuse to answer
any questions asked by the person
conducting an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with
the taxpayer’s attorney, accountant,
bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
This division does not authorize the
practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
(d) A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
(e) The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a
taxpayer from payment of any taxes
owed by the taxpayer nor cure any
procedural defect in a taxpayer’s
case.
(f) If the Tax Administrator fails to
substantially comply with the provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from
penalties and interest arising from
the audit.
Section 192.31 Rounding
A person may round to the nearest
whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return,
report, voucher, or other document
required under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or
exceeds fifty cents shall be rounded
to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part of a dollar that is less than
fifty cents shall be dropped, rounding
down to the nearest whole dollar. If a
person chooses to round amounts
entered on a document, the person
shall round all amounts entered on
the document.
Section 192.32 Authority of Tax
Administrator; Administrative Powers of the Tax Administrator

authority to perform all duties and
functions necessary and appropriate
to implement the provisions of this

refunding taxes, including penalties
and interest thereon, illegally or erroneously imposed or collected, or for
any other reason overpaid, and, in
addition, the Tax Administrator may
investigate any claim of overpayment
and make a written statement of the
Tax Administrator’s findings, and, if
the Tax Administrator finds that
there has been an overpayment,
approve and issue a refund payable to
the taxpayer, the taxpayer’s assigns,
or legal representative as provided in
this chapter;
(e) Exercise the authority provided
by law relative to consenting to the

make and, pursuant to time limitations provided by law, on the Tax
Administrator’s own motion, review,
re-determine, or correct any tax findings, determinations, computations,
assessments or orders the Tax Administrator has made, but the Tax Administrator shall not review, redetermine,
or correct any tax finding, determination, computation, assessment or
order which the Tax Administrator
has made for which an appeal has
been filed with the Local Board of
Tax Review or other appropriate tribunal, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn by the appellant or
applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
(h) Destroy any or all returns or
other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
(i) Enter into an agreement with a
taxpayer to simplify the withholding
obligations described in Section

Section 192.33 Authority of Tax
Administrator; Compromise of Claim
and Payment over Time
(a) As used in this section, “claim”
means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises under
the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
(b) The Tax Administrator may do
either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
(1) Compromise a claim in accordance with the Charter and Codified
Ordinances of the Municipality; or
(2) Extend for a reasonable period
the time for payment of a claim by

The City Record
agreeing to accept monthly or other
periodic payments, upon such terms
and conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
(c) The Tax Administrator’s rejection of a compromise or payment-overtime agreement proposed by a person
with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
(d) A compromise or payment-overtime agreement with respect to a
claim shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of only the parties
to the compromise or agreement, and
shall not extinguish or otherwise
affect the liability of any other person.
(e) (1) A compromise or paymentover-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer
defaults under the compromise or
agreement or if the compromise or
agreement was obtained by fraud or
by misrepresentation of a material
fact. Any amount that was due before
the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and
any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the
compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue and be due.
(2) The Tax Administrator shall
have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest,
charges or applicable fees will be
assessed through the duration of any
compromise or payment-over-time
agreement.
(f) The Tax Administrator may
require that the taxpayer provide
detailed financial documentation and
information, in order to determine
whether or not a payment-over-time
agreement will be authorized. The
taxpayer’s failure to provide the necessary and required information by
the Tax Administrator shall preclude
consideration of a payment-over-time
agreement.
Section 192.34 Authority of Tax
Administrator; Right to Examine
(a) The Tax Administrator, or any
authorized agent or employee thereof
may examine the books, papers,
records, and federal and state income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to,
or that the Tax Administrator
believes is subject to, the provisions
of this Chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return
made or, if no return was filed, to
ascertain the tax due under this Chapter. On written request by the Tax
Administrator or a duly authorized
agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person
subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax
Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine
such books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a
reasonable time and place designated
in the request.
(b) The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or
other person that is subject to, or that
a Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter
shall be open to the Tax Administrator’s inspection during business hours
and shall be preserved for a period of
six years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their
destruction within that period, or by
order requires that they be kept
longer. The Tax Administrator of a

1681

33
municipal corporation may require
any person, by notice served on that
person, to keep such records as the
Tax Administrator determines necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by
the Municipality or for the withholding of such tax.
(c) The Tax Administrator may
examine under oath any person that
the Tax Administrator reasonably
believes has knowledge concerning
any income that was or would have
been returned for taxation or any
transaction tending to affect such
income. The Tax Administrator may,
for this purpose, compel any such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income
tax returns in such person’s possession or control. The person may be
assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does
not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
(d) No person issued written notice
by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books,
papers, records, or federal and state
income tax returns under this section
shall fail to comply.
Section 192.35 Authority of Tax
Administrator; Requiring Identifying
Information
(a) The Tax Administrator may
require any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide
identifying
information,
which may include the person’s social
security number, federal employer
identification number, or other identification number requested by the Tax
Administrator. A person required by
the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information that has
experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the
Tax Administrator of the change
before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying
information.
(b) (1) If the Tax Administrator
makes a request for identifying information and the Tax Administrator
does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of
making the request, nothing in this
chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the
person to whom the request was
directed under Section 192.29 of this
Chapter, in addition to any applicable
penalty described in Section 192.99 of
this Chapter.
(2) If a person required by the Tax
Administrator to provide identifying
information does not notify the Tax
Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as
required under division (a) of this
section within thirty days after filing
the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in
this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty
under Section 192.29 of this Chapter.
(3) The penalties provided for
under divisions (b)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in
the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying
information is sought and are in addition to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section 192.99 of this
Chapter for a violation of Section

34
192.37 of this Chapter, and any other
penalties that may be imposed by the
Tax Administrator by law.
Section 192.36 Confidentiality
(a) Any information gained as a
result of returns, investigations, hearings, or verifications required or
authorized by Chapter 718 of the
Revised Code or by the charter or
ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except
under a proper judicial order or in
connection with the performance of
that person’s official duties or the
official business of the Municipality
as authorized by Chapter 718 of the
Revised Code or the charter or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax
Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies
of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related
tax information to the Internal Revenue Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of
other municipal corporations.
(b) This section does not prohibit
the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that
does not disclose information with
respect to particular taxpayers.
Section 192.37 Fraud
No person shall knowingly make,
present, aid, or assist in the preparation or presentation of a false or
fraudulent report, return, schedule,
statement, claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or state law to be
filed with the Tax Administrator, or
knowingly procure, counsel, or advise
the preparation or presentation of
such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or
knowingly procure, counsel or advise
such change, alteration, or amendment of the records upon which such
report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document is based with
intent to defraud the Municipality or
the Tax Administrator.
Section 192.38 Opinion of the Tax
Administrator
(a) An “opinion of the Tax Administrator” means an opinion issued
under this section with respect to
prospective municipal income tax liability. It does not include ordinary
correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
(b) A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how
certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be
taxed. The written response of the
Tax Administrator shall be an “opinion of the Tax Administrator” and
shall bind the Tax Administrator,
under divisions (c), (g), and (h) of
this section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
(1) The taxpayer’s request fully
and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a
determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or
transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in
the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other
pertinent facts;
(2) The request relates to a tax
imposed by the Municipality under
this Chapter; and

The City Record
(3)
The
Tax
Administrator’s
response is signed by the Tax Administrator and designated as an “opinion
of the Tax Administrator.”
(c) An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the
opinion was prepared and who reasonably relies on it from liability for
any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise chargeable on the activity or
transaction specifically held by the
Tax Administrator’s opinion to be
taxable in a particular manner or not
to be subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in
the opinion, or until the earliest of the
following dates:
(1) The effective date of a written
revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail,
return receipt requested. The effective date of the revocation shall be the
taxpayer’s date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion,
whichever is later;
(2) The effective date of any
amendment or enactment of a relevant section of the Revised Code,
uncodified state law, or the Municipality’s income tax ordinance that
would substantially change the
analysis and conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
(3) The date on which a court
issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with
respect to the Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality’s
income tax ordinance;
(4) If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the interpretation of federal law, the effective date
of any change in the relevant federal
statutes or regulations, or the date on
which a court issues an opinion establishing or changing relevant case law
with respect to federal statutes or regulations;
(5) The effective date of any
change in the taxpayer’s material
facts or circumstances; or
(6) The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified in the
opinion.
(d) (1) A taxpayer is not relieved of
tax liability for any activity or transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
(2) If the taxpayer knowingly has
misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to
defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the
taxpayer may be in violation of Section 192.37 of this Chapter.
(e) If a Tax Administrator provides
written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement
that:
(1) The tax consequences stated in
the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (c) of this section; and
(2) It is the duty of the taxpayer to
be aware of such changes.
(f) A Tax Administrator may
refuse to offer an opinion on any
request received under this section.
(g) This section binds a Tax
Administrator only with respect to
opinions of the Tax Administrator
issued on or after January 1, 2016.
(h) An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator
only with respect to the taxpayer for
whom the opinion was prepared and
does not bind the Tax Administrator
of any other municipal corporation.

1682

November 18, 2015
(i) A Tax Administrator shall make
available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except
those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who has requested that the text of
the opinion remain confidential. In no
event shall the text of an opinion be
made available until the Tax Administrator has removed all information
that identifies the taxpayer and any
other parties involved in the activity
or transaction.
(j) An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under division (f) may not be appealed.
Section 192.39 Assessment; Appeal
Based on Presumption of Delivery
(a) (1) The Tax Administrator
shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or
by a delivery service authorized
under Section 5703.056 of the Revised
Code.
(2) The Tax Administrator may
deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail.
Such alternative delivery method
must be authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
(3) Once service of the assessment
has been made by the Tax Administrator or other municipal official, or
the designee of either, the person to
whom the assessment is directed may
protest the ruling of that assessment
by filing an appeal with the Local
Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The
delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is
prima facie evidence that delivery is
complete and that the assessment is
served.
(b) (1) A person may challenge the
presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person
disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears
the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the address
to which the assessment was sent was
not an address with which the person
was associated at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the
assessment by certified mail. For the
purposes of this section, a person is
associated with an address at the
time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that
time, the person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting
business at the address; or if, before
that time, the person had conducted
business at the address and, when the
assessment was mailed, the person’s
agent or the person’s affiliate was
conducting business at the address.
For the purposes of this section, a person’s affiliate is any other person
that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least
twenty per cent, as determined by voting rights, of the addressee’s business.
(2) If a person elects to appeal an
assessment on the basis described in
division (b)(1) of this section, and if
that assessment is subject to collection and is not otherwise appealable,
the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the
Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either,
with the person. Nothing in this division prevents the Tax Administrator
or other official from entering into a

November 18, 2015
compromise with the person if the
person does not actually file such an
appeal with the Local Board of Tax
Review.
Section 192.40 Local Board of Tax
Review; Appeal to Local Board of Tax
Review
(a) A Board of Review, consisting
of three members, one appointed by
the mayor and two members appointed by Council, is hereby created and
shall be maintained to hear appeals
by taxpayers of assessments issued
by the Tax Administrator regarding a
municipal income tax obligation that
is subject to appeal as provided in
Chapter 718 of the Revised Code, this
chapter or the Rules and Regulations.
Said appeal shall be filed within sixty
days after the taxpayer receives the
assessment.
(b) The members appointed by
Council may not be employees of the
City of Cleveland, elected officials, or
contractors with the City of Cleveland
at any time during their term or in the
five years immediately preceding the
date of appointment.
(1) These members shall serve for a
term of two years and may be reappointed by Council an unlimited
number of times.
(2) Members appointed by Council
may be removed pursuant to Chapter
718 of the Revised Code.
(c) The member appointed by the
Mayor may be an employee of the City
of Cleveland, but may not be the
Director of Finance, Tax Administrator, or an employee directly involved
in municipal tax matters, or any
direct subordinate thereof. This member shall serve at the discretion of the
Mayor.
(d) A member of the Board who, for
any reason, ceases to meet the qualifications for the position prescribed
by this section or Chapter 718 of the
Revised Code shall resign immediately by operation of law.
(e) Any vacancy in an unexpired
term shall be filled by the appointing
authority within 60 days of when the
vacancy was created. Any member
appointed to fill a vacancy occurring
prior to the expiration of the term for
which the member’s predecessor was
appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy
on the Board shall impair the power
and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board.
(f) If a member is temporarily
unable to serve on the Board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence,
or similar reason, another individual
shall be appointed by the original
appointing authority, the Mayor or
Council, to temporarily serve in the
member’s place. The appointment of
such an individual shall be subject to
the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
(g) The Board shall follow all procedures and requirements imposed by
Chapter 718 of the Revised Code in
conducting hearings and appeals
before the Board as well as in issuing
its decisions. All matters before the
Board shall be confidential as provided under Chapter 718 of the Revised
Code.
Section 192.41 Actions to Recover;
Statute of Limitations
(a) (1) A. Civil actions to recover
municipal income taxes and penalties

The City Record
and interest on municipal income
taxes shall be brought within the latter of:
1. Three years after the tax was due
or the return was filed, whichever is
later; or
2. One year after the conclusion of
the qualifying deferral period, if any.
B. The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may be
extended at any time if both the Tax
Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or
taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also
extend for the same period of time the
time limit described in division (c) of
this section.
(2) As used in this section, “qualifying deferral period” means a period of
time beginning and ending as follows:
A. Beginning on the date a person
who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax
Review the request described in Section 192.40 of this Chapter. That date
shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or holding by
any administrative body or court that
the Local Board of Tax Review with
which the aggrieved person filed the
request did not have jurisdiction to
affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of that assessment.
B. Ending the later of the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final
determination of the Local Board of
Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination
of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Local
Board of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or
ultimately reversed and no further
appeal of either that affirmation, in
whole or in part, or that reversal is
available or taken.
(b) Prosecutions for an offense
made punishable under a resolution
or ordinance imposing an income tax
shall be commenced within three
years after the commission of the
offense, provided that in the case of
fraud, failure to file a return, or the
omission of twenty-five per cent or
more of income required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced
within six years after the commission
of the offense.
(c) A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in
Section 192.28 of this Chapter.
(d) (1) Notwithstanding the fact
that an appeal is pending, the petitioner may pay all or a portion of the
assessment that is the subject of the
appeal. The acceptance of a payment
by the Municipality does not prejudice any claim for refund upon final
determination of the appeal.
(2) If upon final determination of
the appeal an error in the assessment
is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or under a
final determination of the Local
Board of Tax Review created under
Section 192.40 of this Chapter, of the
Ohio board of tax appeals, or any
court to which the decision of the Ohio
board of tax appeals has been
appealed, so that the amount due from
the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than the amount
paid, there shall be issued to the
appellant or to the appellant’s assigns
or legal representative a refund in the
amount of the overpayment as provided by Section 192.28 of this Chapter,

1683

35
with interest on that amount as provided by division (d) of this section.
(e) No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties or
interest shall be brought during
either of the following time periods:
(1) The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the imposition of that tax or interest or those
penalties; or
(2) The period during which an
appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties
is pending.
Section 192.42 Adoption of Rules
(a) Under Section 718.30 of the
Revised Code, the Municipality, under
this Chapter, grants authority to the
Tax Administrator to adopt rules to
administer the income tax imposed by
the Municipality.
(b) All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on
the internet.
Section 192.43 Rentals
(a) Rental income received by a
resident or nonresident taxpayer for
any and all properties located within
this municipality shall be taxable as
municipal taxable income under this
ordinance.
(b) Where the gross monthly rental
of any and all real properties, regardless of number and value, aggregates
in excess of one hundred twenty-five
dollars ($125.00) per month, it shall be
prima facie evidence that the rental,
ownership, management or operation
of such properties, is a business activity of such taxpayer, and the net
income of such rental property shall
be subject to tax. However, in the
case of commercial property, the
owner shall be considered engaged in
a business activity when the rental is
based on a fixed or fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts
or profits, of the lessee, whether or
not such rental exceeds one hundred
twenty- five dollars ($125.00) per
month; provided further that in the
case of farm property, the owner shall
be considered engaged in a business
activity when he or she shares in
crops or when the rental is based on a
percentage of the gross or net
receipts derived from the farm,
whether or not the gross income
exceeds one hundred twenty-five dollars ($125.00) per month. It is provided further that the person who operates a licensed rooming house shall
be considered in business whether or
not the gross income exceeds one hundred twenty-five dollars per month
($125.00).
Section 192.44 Unpaid Taxes Recoverable as Other Debts
All taxes imposed by this chapter
shall be collectible, together with any
interest and penalties thereon, as
other debts of like amount are recoverable, including, but not limited to,
collection by suit. Any suit shall be
brought within three (3) years after
the city income tax was due or the
return was filed, whichever is later.
Except in the case of fraud, of omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or
more of taxable income required to be
reported, or of failure to file a return,
no additional assessment shall be
made after three (3) years from the
time the city income tax was due or
the city income tax return was filed,
whichever is later.

36
Section 192.45 Receipt and Records
of Tax
The Tax Administrator shall collect and receive the tax imposed by
this chapter in the manner prescribed
herein from the taxpayers, keep an
accurate record thereof, and report all
monies so received.
Section 192.46 Enforcement of Collection
The
Tax
Administrator
shall
enforce payment of all income taxes
owing to the City, keep accurate
records for a minimum of five (5)
years, showing the amount due from
each taxpayer required to file a declaration of estimated municipal income
tax and make any return, or both,
including returns of taxes withheld
and show the dates and amounts of
payments thereof.
Section 192.47 Authority to Determine Amount of Tax Due
In any case where a taxpayer has
failed to file a return or has filed a
city income tax return which does not
show the proper amount of tax due,
the Tax Administrator may determine the amount of city income tax
appearing to be due the City from the
taxpayer and may send to such taxpayer a written statement showing
the amount of tax so determined,
together with interest and penalties
thereon, if any.
Section 192.48 Investigations
The Tax Administrator, or any
authorized agent, representative or
employee, is authorized to examine
the books, papers, records and federal
income tax returns of any employer or
of any taxpayer or any person subject
to, or whom the Tax Administrator
believes is subject to the provisions of
this chapter, for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made,
or, if no return was made, to ascertain

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTION REFERRED
Res. No. 1414-15.
By Council Members Zone, Cleveland and Brady.
An emergency resolution supporting H. B. 392, the Intimate Partner
Violence Bill, introduced in the Ohio
House of Representatives, which
extends legal protections for victims
of domestic violence and abuse to intimate partners who have or have had a
continuing and significant relationship of a romantic nature with an
offender.
Whereas, H.B. 392, the Intimate
Partner Violence Bill, introduced in
the Ohio House of Representatives on
November 9, 2015 and sponsored by
Representatives Sykes and Kuhns,
extends legal protections for victims
of domestic violence and abuse to intimate partners who have or have had a
continuing and significant relationship of a romantic nature with an
offender; and
Whereas, all citizens of Cleveland
and Ohio communities in significant,
romantic relationships deserve protection from domestic violence and
abuse perpetrated by their partner;
and
Whereas, abuse and domestic violence-related offenses are devastating to the women, men, and children
affected, as well as damaging to communities as a whole; and
Whereas, abuse and domestic violence-related offenses are also devastating to the partners, spouses, and
families of those who engage in these
offenses; and
Whereas, currently, forty-eight
states include dating relationships in
their domestic violence statutes; and
Whereas, Ohio’s current law only
protects “families or household members,” and does not protect all individuals
in
continuing,
significant,
romantic relationships with a perpetrator; and

1685

37
Whereas, the Intimate Partner Violence Bill will extend necessary protections to those persons who are in or
have been in continuing, significant,
romantic relationships with their
abusers; and
Whereas, these necessary protections include the right to petition for
a civil protection order and access to
domestic violence shelters; and
Whereas, all abuse and domestic
violence victims should have the
same legal tools at their disposal to
protect themselves from further
abuse and violence; and
Whereas, expanding legal protections and remedies for abuse and
domestic violence-related offenses to
victim partners falling outside the
current definition is a crucial step in
protecting all individuals; and
Whereas, initiatives to combat
domestic violence and abuse offenses
are essential to retain and increase
population and stabilize Cleveland’s
neighborhoods; and
Whereas, this Council supports
H.B. 392 that expands protections to
victims of domestic violence and
abuse that are in intimate partner
relationships, in order to deter and
reduce domestic violence and abuse
in the City of Cleveland and all Ohio
communities; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports H. B. 392, the Intimate Partner
Violence Bill, introduced in the Ohio
House of Representatives, which
extends legal protections for victims
of domestic violence and abuse to intimate partners who have or have had a
continuing and significant relationship of a romantic nature with an
offender.

Resolution to Governor John Kasich,

division (b) of Section 346.02. For applications subject to the conditional use provisions of Section 346.06, the
owner or lessor of the property shall demonstrate that the environmental condition of the property is not harmful to human health and safety and is safe for residential use. Such demonstration may be made through the
issuance of a “No Further Action” Letter by a Certified Professional pursuant to the requirements for residential
sites of RC Chapter 3746 et seq. (the “Ohio Voluntary Action Program”). A “No Further Action” Letter shall not
relieve the owner or lessor from compliance with any applicable municipal, state or federal law. If the applicant
does not possess a “No Further Action” Letter as described above, the applicant must submit a Phase I or Phase
2 environmental assessment, as applicable, to demonstrate that the site meets environmental standards for residential use. If an environmental assessment shows environmental threats to residential occupancy, then the owner
must demonstrate that those conditions have been abated.
Section 350.10 Billboards
Billboards, as defined in division (e)(1) of Section 350.03, shall be permitted only in accordance with the following regulations and other applicable regulations of this chapter:
(a) Zoning Districts. Billboards shall be permitted only in General Industry and Unrestricted Industry Districts,
except that billboards directed at any angle toward a freeway may be permitted in Semi- Industry Districts. Billboards shall not be permitted in Cleveland Landmark Districts, Public Land Protective Districts. Business Revitalization Districts or on the opposite side of any street bordering such districts. No billboards shall be permitted on the cast side of State Route 176 (the Jennings Freeway) and only one (1) billboard shall be permitted on
the west side of State Route 176 (the Jennings Freeway).
(b) Sign Types. Billboards shall be permitted as either free-standing or wall signs, unless otherwise restricted

(c) Size. Billboard sign panels shall not exceed eight hundred and twenty (820) square feet in area and shall
be further limited in size by the setback regulations in divisions (g) and (h) of this section. For purposes of
determining required setbacks, the measurement of sign panel area shall exclude “extensions” projecting beyond
the otherwise rectangular or standard geometric panel dimensions, provided that these extensions do not exceed
twenty- one percent (21%) of such standard panel area.
(d) Height. The maximum height of a billboard above the roadway surface to which it is oriented shall be
fifty (50) feet. However, in no case shall the height of the billboard as measured from the grade of the lot on
which it is placed exceed the maximum permitted height for main buildings.
(e) Spacing. Along freeways, the minimum distance between billboards located on one (1) side of the road shall
be fourteen hundred (1,400) feet. Along freeways, the minimum distance between billboards located on opposite
sides of the road and visible to approaching traffic shall have a minimum spacing of five hundred (500) feet.
Along other roads, such distance shall be seven hundred fifty (750) feet between two (2) billboards which are
each less than one hundred (100) square feet in area and shall be one thousand (1,000) feet in all other instances.
Except for double-sided (“back-to-back”) billboard panels, not more than one (1) billboard panel may be located
on a single structure.
(f) Distance from Street Lines. Billboards shall be located behind the required building setback lines of the

feet measured in any direction from the point of intersection of the right-of-way lines of two (2) intersecting
streets.
(g) Distance from Zoning District Lines. Billboards located along streets other than freeways shall be set back
at least two hundred (200) feet from Residential, Local Retail and General Retail District lines. For such billboard panels exceeding three hundred eighty (380) square feet in area, all minimum setbacks from zoning district lines shall be increased one (1) foot for each one (1) additional square foot of sign panel area. Billboards
along freeways shall be set back at least fifty (50) feet from Residential, Local Retail, and General Retail District lines.
(h) Distance from Bridges Not on Freeways and from Parkways. A billboard directed at any angle toward a
bridge, not on a freeway or toward a bridge not on a freeway or toward a parkway shall be set back from the
outer pavement edge a minimum of one (1) foot for each one (1) square foot of sign panel area. However, the
minimum such setback shall be three hundred thirty (330) feet. Furthermore, as required by State regulations,
no billboard may be located within five hundred (500) feet of the interchange of a freeway, as measured along
the right edge of the main traveled roadway in the direction of travel from the beginning or ending of pavement
widening at the exit or entrance to the freeway.
(i) Distance from Freeways. A billboard directed at any angle toward a freeway shall be located outside of
the freeway right-of-way, but in no case closer than fifty (50) feet from the freeway pavement edge.

(k) Referral to City Planning Department. Any Building Permit application for installation of a new billboard
shall be referred to the Director of the City Planning Department for a determination of compliance with the
location, spacing and setback regulations of this section. In making this determination, the Director and staff of
the Department shall utilize a map maintained by the Department showing locations of existing billboards, zoning districts and other information necessary to make such determination.
(l) Nonconforming Billboards. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 350.19, a legal nonconforming billboard
may be replaced or may be reconstructed to an extent greater than otherwise permitted if the City Planning Commission determines that such replacement or reconstruction will satisfy the following conditions:
(1) Site and Design Improvements. The site of the new or reconstructed billboard shall be landscaped and otherwise improved, through use of an ornamental base or frame, a streamlined support structure, or similar features effective in improving the appearance of the site. At a minimum, evergreen shrubs, at least three (3) feet
in height at the time of planting and four (4) feet in height after two (2) growing seasons, shall be planted at
maximum intervals of four (4) feet along any side of the base of the billboard oriented toward a public street.
Such planting shall extend at least the full width of the billboard panel. In addition, all portions of the parcel(s)
of land on which the billboard site is located shall be planted with grass or other suitable vegetative ground
cover between the billboard and all public streets abutting the parcel(s).
(2) Degree of Nonconformity. The new or reconstructed billboard shall be no greater in size, height, number
of panels, or any panel dimension than is the existing billboard, nor shall the new or reconstructed billboard be
less conforming to any zoning regulation than is the existing billboard, except that a panel or sign face may be
added to the back of a billboard where previously there had been no panel or sign face.
(3) Location. The new or reconstructed billboard shall be placed in precisely the same location as the existing
billboard unless the City Planning Commission determines that a different location on the same parcel of land
would be more effective in meeting the intent of the sign regulations, as stated in Section 350.01.
(4) Sign Type. With respect to the “sign types” defined in division (f) of Section 350.03, the new or reconstructed billboard shall be the same type as the existing billboard unless the City Planning Commission determines that a different sign type would be more compatible with the subject property or nearby properties.
(5) Changeable Copy. The new or reconstructed billboard may incorporate automatic changeable copy only if
such copy is limited to a single billboard panel or two (2) back-to-back billboard panels and only if each such
panel replaces two (2) or more billboard panels on a single parcel of property or two (2) or more billboard panels on adjacent properties. The replacement billboard panel shall not be larger than any of the billboard panels
it is replacing. In the case of a sign utilizing changeable copy, each message shall remain fixed for at least
eight (8) seconds.
Section 393.10 Duties of the Fire Division
(a) The Fire Division’s responsibilities include inspection of workplaces where hazardous chemicals are used,
manufactured or stored, based either on a complaint or a rotating inspection schedule. The Fire Chief or his or
her authorized representative upon presentation of proper credentials, may enter any building or premises at all
reasonable hours to inspect for compliance with this chapter. No person shall prevent, obstruct or delay any inspection or the performance of any lawful duty of such inspector acting within his or her official capacity. The inspector shall determine whether hazardous chemicals are properly labeled consistent with Section 393.06; shall check

(i) Each employer is obligated to comply with this chapter, with or without an inspection by the Fire Division.
Section 393.17 Trade Secrets
(a) Any employer may withhold the specific chemical name or other specific chemical identification of a hazardous chemical, if:
(1) The claim that the information withheld is a trade secret can be supported in writing;
(2) Information contained in the material safety data sheet concerning the properties and effects of the hazardous chemical is disclosed;
(3) The label and material safety data sheet indicates that the specific chemical identity is being withheld as
a trade secret; and
(4) The specific identity is made available to the Fire Chief and health professionals, in accordance with the
applicable provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
(b) The employer shall immediately disclose to the Fire Chief or a treating physician/nurse, upon request, the
specific chemical identity of the requested trade secret, without regard to trade secrecy claims and regardless of
the existence of a written statement of need or a confidentiality agreement, if:

1710

November 18, 2015

The City Record

63

(1) The Fire Chief determines that an accident has occurred which requires knowledge of specific chemical
identities; or
(2) A treating physician or nurse determines that medical emergency exists and the specific chemical identity
of a hazardous chemical is necessary for emergency or first aid treatment; or
The employer may require a written request and confidentiality agreement in the form of the standard Confidentiality Agreement contained in Section 393.21 or in accordance with the provisions of division (d) of this section as soon as circumstances permit.
(c) In situations where the employer has made a trade secret claim, the employer shall, upon written request
from the Fire Chief or a health professional (i.e., physician, nurse, industrial hygienist, toxicologist, or epidemiologist) providing medical or other occupational health services to exposed employee(s), disclose the specific
chemical name of any chemical substance if:
(1) The request is in writing;
(2) The request describes with reasonable detail one (1) or more of the following occupational health needs
for the information:
A. To assess or study the hazards or effects of the chemicals to which employees will or have been exposed;
B. To conduct or assess sampling of the workplace atmosphere to determine employee exposure levels;
C. To medically pre-screen employees or provide medical treatment to exposed employees;
D. To assess appropriate personal protective equipment, engineering controls or other protective measures for
exposed employees.
(3) The request includes a description of the procedures to be used to maintain the confidentiality of the disclosed information; and
(4) The requesting party and the employer agree in a written confidentiality agreement that the requesting
party will not use the trade secret information for any purpose other than the health need(s) asserted and agree
not to release the information under any circumstances.
(d) The confidentiality agreement provided by divisions (b) and (c) of this section:
(1) May restrict use of information to health and treatment purposes consistent with the preservation of the
trade secret information;
(2) May provide appropriate legal remedies in the event of a breach of the agreement, but not stipulation of
a reasonable pre-estimate of likely damages; and
(3) May not include requirements for the posting of a penalty bond.
(e) Nothing in this section is meant to preclude the parties from pursuing noncontractual remedies to the extent
permitted by law.
(f) If the employer denies a written request for disclosure of a specific chemical identity in non- emergency
or non-accident situations, the denial must:
(1) Be provided to the requesting party and the Fire Chief within ten (10) working days of the request;
(2) Be in writing;
(3) Include evidence to support the claim that the specific chemical identity is a trade secret;
(4) State the specific reason why the request is being denied; and
(5) Explain in detail how alternative information may satisfy the specific medical need without revealing the
specific chemical identity.
(g) The requesting party whose request for information is denied under division (f) of this section, may refer
the written request and denial to the Hazardous Chemicals Committee for consideration. Both the requesting party
and the employer shall be permitted an opportunity to submit evidence supporting their respective positions to
the Hazardous Chemicals Committee.
(h) The Hazardous Chemicals Committee shall consider the evidence to determine if:
(1) The employer has supported the claim that the specific chemical identity is a trade secret;
(2) The requesting party has supported the claim that there is medical or occupational health need for the
information; and
(3) The requesting party has demonstrated adequate means to protect its confidentiality.
(i) If the Hazardous Chemicals Committee determines that the specific chemical identity requested under division (c) of this section is not a bona fide trade secret, or that the specific chemical identity requested under division (c) of this section is a trade secret but the requesting party has a legitimate need for the information, has
executed a written confidentiality agreement, and has shown adequate means to protect the confidentiality of the
information, the employer shall provide said chemical identity to the requesting party within thirty (30) days of
the Committee’s decision. If the employer appeals the Committee’s determination pursuant to division(j) of this
section, it shall have a right to a stay, as provided in division (e)(3) of Section 3103.20 of these Codified Ordinances.
However, if the Hazardous Chemicals Committee determines that there is no medical or occupational health
need for the information or that the execution of a confidentiality agreement would not provide a sufficient protection against the potential harm from the unauthorized disclosure of a trade secret specific chemical identity,
the Hazardous Chemicals Committee may deny the request or may delay its final decision until appropriate modifications of the confidentiality agreement are made.
(j) The Hazardous Chemicals Committees’ decision under division (i) may be appealed within thirty (30) days
by either party to the Board of Building Standards and Building Appeals established pursuant to Charter Section
76-6. The Board’s decision is a final order from which either party may appeal under RC Chapter 2506.
(k) No officer, employee, agent or contractor of any City department, board or commission shall knowingly and
intentionally disclose to anyone in any manner, any trade secret information, except as is required to administer
or enforce the provisions of this chapter and perform official duties or unless authorized by the employer claiming that the data is trade secret information or a court of law. Any person who knowingly violates this provision shall be subject to discipline for malfeasance in office under the City’s Civil Service rules, and shall be subject to other applicable provisions and penalties under existing law for violations of trade secret protections. This
section shall not be construed to eliminate, abridge or detract from any remedies, either at law or in equity,
which an employer or other individual may have arising out of any breach of a confidentiality agreement or
other legal protection of trade secrets.
Section 3103.05 Permission to Enter Adjoining Premises
(a) For the purpose of performing repairs, alterations or maintenance on the exterior of any dwelling, building or structure, necessary to effect compliance with the provisions of any Ohio statute, OBBC, the City’s Building or Housing Codes or any other City ordinance, or any lawful rule adopted or order issued pursuant thereto,

Section 457.07 Screening Barriers
Except as provided in division (e) of Section 457.07, all surface parking lots with ten (10) or more spaces shall
be bordered along the entire length of all lot lines fronting on public streets or public alleys, as defined in Section 303.09 of the Codified Ordinances, except at established entrances and exits, by a visual screen and a vehicular barrier, as further described in divisions (a) and (b) of this section. Such screen and barrier shall be sufficient to prevent vehicular ingress and egress except at established entrances and exits, to prevent motor vehicles from encroaching into the public right-of-way, to restrict pedestrian movement to established sidewalk areas
and to screen parked vehicles from view from the public right-of-way.
(a) Vehicular Barriers. The vehicular barrier shall consist of a continuous concrete or cut stone curb at least
eight (8) inches high and six (6) inches wide or anchored concrete wheel stops, as necessary to prevent motor
vehicles from projecting into the public right-of- way or impacting with the visual screen.
(b) Visual Screens. All visual screens shall meet the following requirements with respect to height, opacity and
materials.
(1) Central City Area. Within the Downtown Core, Gateway and Warehouse Parking Districts, as established
in Section 457.035, visual screens shall meet the following standards. Minimum required height and opacity shall
be provided throughout the length of any required visual screen. The visual screen shall be a minimum of four
(4) feet and a maximum of six (6) feet in height and shall conform to one (1) of the following four (4) standards with respect to materials and opacity.
A. Shrubbery and Fence: A continuous hedge of shrubbery and a metal picket and rail fence, together providing one hundred percent (100%) opacity to a height of two and one-half (2.5) feet and providing a minimum of
five percent (5%) and a maximum of twenty-five (25%) opacity between a height of two and one-half (2.5) feet
and four (4) feet.

November 18, 2015

D. Wall/Fence and Shrubbery: Shrubs planted at a minimum average spacing of eight (8) feet and a combination metal picket and rail fence/masonry wall, together providing a minimum of one hundred percent (100%)
opacity to a height of two and one-half (2.5) feet and providing a minimum of five percent (5%) and a maximum of twenty-five percent (25%) opacity between two and one-half (2.5) feet and four (4) feet.

(2) Other Areas. All parking lot areas established and licensed on or after June 26, 1991 shall meet the screening standards established in division (b)(1) of this section. Outside of the Downtown Core, Gateway and Warehouse Parking Districts, as established in Section 457.035, all parking lots legally established prior to June 26,
1991 shall meet the following visual screening standards. The visual screen shall be composed of anchored concrete, wood or metal bollards, at least eight (8) inches in width or diameter and at least two and one-half (2.5)
feet in height, in uniform intervals of not more than eight (8) feet, connected through the top of each bollard
by aluminum or galvanized metal chains, at least one-half (1/2) inch in diameter. The bollards and chains shall
be supplemented by trees planted at minimum intervals of thirty (30) feet.

(c) Supplemental Standards for Visual Screens. The elements which compose a required visual screen shall meet
the following requirements:
(1) Standards for Shrubs, Trees and Ground Cover. Shrubbery used as part of a visual screen must be sufficient to meet the height and opacity requirements by the end of the second growing season after initial planting. All shrubs and trees shall be selected from lists of approved types, as adopted by the City Planning Commission. At the time of installation, deciduous trees shall be a minimum of two (2.0) inches in caliper at one (1)
foot above grade, and evergreen trees shall be a minimum of six (6.0) feet in height. Trees shall be permitted
as part of any visual screen, and the maximum height and opacity limitations shall not apply to trees. In the
event that irrigation as required under division (c)(4) of this section is not available, landscaping materials
installed on such property shall be of a type which do not require such irrigation for proper maintenance, as
determined by the Public Works, or his or her designee.
(2) Standards for Landscaped Areas. If a visual screen is set within a landscaped area, such area shall be bordered by a continuous concrete or cut stone curb at least six (6) inches wide and eight (8) inches high and such
area shall be covered by grass or other suitable vegetative ground cover, bark or decorative stones. If planted
with shrubs, the landscaped area shall be a minimum of three (3) feet in width. If planted with trees, the landscaped area shall be a minimum of four (4) feet in width.
(3) Standards for Fences and Walls. All walls and fences used as part of a visual screen shall be of uniform
appearance and shall be set in a concrete base. Required metal picket and rail fences shall be of actual or simulated wrought iron or cast iron construction. Masonry walls shall be of brick or stone construction.
(4) Irrigation Requirements.
A. General Provisions. Every landscaped area shall be served by a permanently- installed underground irrigation system. No irrigation system, however shall be required for trees provided to supplement the use of bollards
and chains as required by division (b)(2) of this section.
B. Method of Connection. For parking lots established on or after June 26, 1991, the irrigation system shall be
connected directly to City water lines. For parking lots legally established before June 26, 1991, the irrigation
system shall be either connected to City water lines or shall be configured for coupling to a hose which draws
water from any permitted source. In such instances, the selection of the water source shall be made by the applicant. In all instances, however, the Division of Water may reject a particular method of connection if it determines that such method is technically infeasible or unsafe in a particular location.
C. Responsibilities. In the case of a property, or adjoining properties under common ownership, which are not
served by City water lines, the City shall provide, at its expense, water line hook- ups to serve the irrigation
system. The City’s responsibility to dedicate a water source shall arise upon approval by the Division of Building and Housing and the Division of Water of plans, submitted by the applicant, for such irrigation, including
necessary water line hook-ups. The parking lot operator shall not be responsible for installing live landscaping

1714

November 18, 2015

materials until the City provides the water line hook up. Each applicant shall be required to install and pay for
a separate water meter or meters, vault and backflow devices and shall pay for all water used. In the case of
a system served by a fire hydrant tap, the applicant shall be responsible for payment of a single annual fee to
cover the costs of estimated water use and issuance of a permit.
(d) Maintenance. All screening materials shall be maintained in good condition at all times. Unhealthy or dead
vegetation shall be replaced with healthy plantings no later than the end of the next applicable growing season.
Fences and walls shall be kept free from peeling paint, rust, spalling, and broken, cracked or missing elements.
Fences and walls shall also be kept plumb, with no more than a two (2) inch deflection from a vertical position.
(e) Exemption for Alleys. No visual screen shall be required along public alleys except within the Downtown
Core Parking District (as established in Section 457.035), where the required visual screen shall be provided.
(f) Landscaping Requirement Reductions and Exemptions. With regard to a parking lot which otherwise complies with all requirements of Section 457.07, the City Planning Commission shall grant a reduction of or an
exemption from the requirements for shrubs, trees and landscaped areas of division (b) of Section 457.07 if full
compliance with such requirements would result in a loss of existing parking spaces which cannot be avoided
or remediated through re-design or re-configuration of the parking lot. The Commission shall take such action in
accordance with the following provisions.
(1) Evidence to Be Provided by the Applicant. An applicant seeking a reduction of or an exemption from the
requirement for landscape elements of a visual screen shall present evidence to the City Planning Commission
demonstrating that the potential loss of existing spaces cannot be avoided or remediated through re-design or reconfiguration of the parking lot.
(2) City Planning Commission Determination. Upon consideration of evidence submitted by the applicant as well
as any analysis prepared by City staff, the City Planning Commission shall determine whether strict application
of the visual screen landscaping requirements will result in an unremediable loss of parking spaces. In determining whether a loss of parking spaces can be avoided through re-design or re-striping, the Commission shall
assume continued use of existing parking space and aisle dimensions for the subject property except where such
dimensions are in excess of City standards. The Commission shall further determine whether the applicant can
comply with the visual screen landscaping requirements through the use of a legal encroachment in one (1) or
more of the public rights- of-way adjoining the parking lot.
(3) Minimum Requirement. Any reduction of standards approved by the City Planning Commission with respect
to the required visual screen shall be the minimum reduction necessary to prevent a loss of parking spaces. The
Commission may require compliance with the visual screen standards through the use of a legal encroachment
in one (1) or more of the public rights-of-way adjoining the parking lot. At a minimum, the Commission shall
require installation of a metal picket and rail fence meeting all applicable requirements of this section and, in
addition, providing a metal, brick or stone pier or post, at least two (2) inches square, at a minimum spacing of
eight (8) feet. The Commission shall also require provision of landscaped areas where such provision will not
result in a loss of parking spaces.

(g) Temporary Uses. Where the City Planning Commission deems a parking lot to be a temporary use, the barrier and screening requirements of this section shall be met if the parking lot operator installs anchored concrete wheel stops supplemented by bollards and chains, as required in division (b)(2) of this section. The requirement for bollards and chains shall not apply outside of the Downtown Core Parking District. No surface parking lot shall be deemed temporary for a period in excess of one (1) year, provided however, that the City Planning Commission may extend the temporary use for one (1) additional one (1) year period if, prior to the completion of the initial one (1) year period, a project agreement with the City is executed which requires development of the lot within one (1) year or a Building Permit application has been filed for development of the lot.
A parking lot shall also be considered as a temporary use if there exists a lease, recorded with the Cuyahoga
County Recorder, between the parking lot operator and the owner of the subject property, and the term of the
lease expires within eighteen (18) months after the compliance date for filing of plans, as specified in division
(i) of this section.
(h) Approval. The materials, design, location and construction of the screens and barriers required by this section shall be approved by the Director of City Planning Commission, in consultation with the Commissioners of
Research, Planning and Development and Traffic Engineering and shall be in accordance with the standards promulgated by the Commissioners in compliance with the provisions of this chapter. Unless otherwise permitted by
the Commissioner of Traffic Engineering, each parking place shall have one (1) common entrance and one (1)
common exit, which may or may not be combined.
(i) Compliance Dates. Parking lots legally established prior to June 26, 1991 shall comply with the requirements of this section in accordance with the following provisions:
(1) For lots within the Downtown Core Parking District, plans shall be filed by May 1, 1992, and installation
shall be completed by August 1, 1992.
(2) For lots within the Erieview, Downtown Lakefront and Flats Parking Districts, plans shall be submitted

to abide by the provisions of these Codified Ordinances or state law, or if any required health license has been
suspended or revoked.
(b) The Director shall give written notice of suspension or revocation of the permit to the permittee or his or

become final and effective ten (10) days thereafter unless, within five (5) days of receipt of notice, the permittee requests a hearing before the Director. The Director shall forthwith hold the requested hearing, at which time
the permittee shall be afforded the opportunity to give his or her version of the facts which gave rise to the

it.
