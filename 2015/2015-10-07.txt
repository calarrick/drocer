lots on which they are located. In addition, billboards shall be located a minimum distance of twenty-five (25)
feet measured in any direction from the point of intersection of the right-of-way lines of two (2) intersecting
streets.
(g) Distance from Zoning District Lines. Billboards located along streets other than freeways shall be set back
at least two hundred (200) feet from Residential, Local Retail and General Retail District lines. For such billboard panels exceeding three hundred eighty (380) square feet in area, all minimum setbacks from zoning district lines shall be increased one (1) foot for each one (1) additional square foot of sign panel area. Billboards
along freeways shall be set back at least fifty (50) feet from Residential, Local Retail, and General Retail District lines.
(h) Distance from Bridges Not on Freeways and from Parkways. A billboard directed at any angle toward a
bridge, not on a freeway or toward a bridge not on a freeway or toward a parkway shall be set back from the
outer pavement edge a minimum of one (1) foot for each one (1) square foot of sign panel area. However, the
minimum such setback shall be three hundred thirty (330) feet. Furthermore, as required by State regulations,
no billboard may be located within five hundred (500) feet of the interchange of a freeway, as measured along
the right edge of the main traveled roadway in the direction of travel from the beginning or ending of pavement
widening at the exit or entrance to the freeway.
(i) Distance from Freeways. A billboard directed at any angle toward a freeway shall be located outside of
the freeway right-of-way, but in no case closer than fifty (50) feet from the freeway pavement edge.
(j) Illumination. Billboards shall be illuminated only by means of continuous reflected light. Internally- illuminated or back-lit billboards shall not be permitted. Billboards shall not include automatic changeable copy signs
(i.e., electronic message centers) as defined in division (f)(2) of Section 350.03.
(k) Referral to City Planning Department. Any Building Permit application for installation of a new billboard
shall be referred to the Director of the City Planning Department for a determination of compliance with the
location, spacing and setback regulations of this section. In making this determination, the Director and staff of
the Department shall utilize a map maintained by the Department showing locations of existing billboards, zoning districts and other information necessary to make such determination.
(l) Nonconforming Billboards. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 350.19, a legal nonconforming billboard
may be replaced or may be reconstructed to an extent greater than otherwise permitted if the City Planning Commission determines that such replacement or reconstruction will satisfy the following conditions:
(1) Site and Design Improvements. The site of the new or reconstructed billboard shall be landscaped and otherwise improved, through use of an ornamental base or frame, a streamlined support structure, or similar features effective in improving the appearance of the site. At a minimum, evergreen shrubs, at least three (3) feet
in height at the time of planting and four (4) feet in height after two (2) growing seasons, shall be planted at
maximum intervals of four (4) feet along any side of the base of the billboard oriented toward a public street.
Such planting shall extend at least the full width of the billboard panel. In addition, all portions of the parcel(s)
of land on which the billboard site is located shall be planted with grass or other suitable vegetative ground
cover between the billboard and all public streets abutting the parcel(s).
(2) Degree of Nonconformity. The new or reconstructed billboard shall be no greater in size, height, number
of panels, or any panel dimension than is the existing billboard, nor shall the new or reconstructed billboard be
less conforming to any zoning regulation than is the existing billboard, except that a panel or sign face may be
added to the back of a billboard where previously there had been no panel or sign face.
(3) Location. The new or reconstructed billboard shall be placed in precisely the same location as the existing
billboard unless the City Planning Commission determines that a different location on the same parcel of land
would be more effective in meeting the intent of the sign regulations, as stated in Section 350.01.
(4) Sign Type. With respect to the “sign types” defined in division (f) of Section 350.03, the new or reconstructed billboard shall be the same type as the existing billboard unless the City Planning Commission determines that a different sign type would be more compatible with the subject property or nearby properties.
(5) Changeable Copy. The new or reconstructed billboard may incorporate automatic changeable copy only if
such copy is limited to a single billboard panel or two (2) back-to-back billboard panels and only if each such
panel replaces two (2) or more billboard panels on a single parcel of property or two (2) or more billboard panels on adjacent properties. The replacement billboard panel shall not be larger than any of the billboard panels
it is replacing. In the case of a sign utilizing changeable copy, each message shall remain fixed for at least
eight (8) seconds.

(1) The claim that the information withheld is a trade secret can be supported in writing;
(2) Information contained in the material safety data sheet concerning the properties and effects of the hazardous chemical is disclosed;
(3) The label and material safety data sheet indicates that the specific chemical identity is being withheld as
a trade secret; and
(4) The specific identity is made available to the Fire Chief and health professionals, in accordance with the
applicable provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
(b) The employer shall immediately disclose to the Fire Chief or a treating physician/nurse, upon request, the
specific chemical identity of the requested trade secret, without regard to trade secrecy claims and regardless of
the existence of a written statement of need or a confidentiality agreement, if:
(1) The Fire Chief determines that an accident has occurred which requires knowledge of specific chemical
identities; or
(2) A treating physician or nurse determines that medical emergency exists and the specific chemical identity
of a hazardous chemical is necessary for emergency or first aid treatment; or
The employer may require a written request and confidentiality agreement in the form of the standard Confidentiality Agreement contained in Section 393.21 or in accordance with the provisions of division (d) of this section as soon as circumstances permit.
(c) In situations where the employer has made a trade secret claim, the employer shall, upon written request
from the Fire Chief or a health professional (i.e., physician, nurse, industrial hygienist, toxicologist, or epidemiologist) providing medical or other occupational health services to exposed employee(s), disclose the specific
chemical name of any chemical substance if:
(1) The request is in writing;
(2) The request describes with reasonable detail one (1) or more of the following occupational health needs
for the information:
A. To assess or study the hazards or effects of the chemicals to which employees will or have been exposed;
B. To conduct or assess sampling of the workplace atmosphere to determine employee exposure levels;
C. To medically pre-screen employees or provide medical treatment to exposed employees;
D. To assess appropriate personal protective equipment, engineering controls or other protective measures for
exposed employees.
(3) The request includes a description of the procedures to be used to maintain the confidentiality of the disclosed information; and
(4) The requesting party and the employer agree in a written confidentiality agreement that the requesting
party will not use the trade secret information for any purpose other than the health need(s) asserted and agree
not to release the information under any circumstances.
(d) The confidentiality agreement provided by divisions (b) and (c) of this section:
(1) May restrict use of information to health and treatment purposes consistent with the preservation of the
trade secret information;
(2) May provide appropriate legal remedies in the event of a breach of the agreement, but not stipulation of
a reasonable pre-estimate of likely damages; and
(3) May not include requirements for the posting of a penalty bond.
(e) Nothing in this section is meant to preclude the parties from pursuing noncontractual remedies to the extent
permitted by law.
(f) If the employer denies a written request for disclosure of a specific chemical identity in non- emergency
or non-accident situations, the denial must:
(1) Be provided to the requesting party and the Fire Chief within ten (10) working days of the request;
(2) Be in writing;
(3) Include evidence to support the claim that the specific chemical identity is a trade secret;
(4) State the specific reason why the request is being denied; and
(5) Explain in detail how alternative information may satisfy the specific medical need without revealing the
specific chemical identity.
(g) The requesting party whose request for information is denied under division (f) of this section, may refer
the written request and denial to the Hazardous Chemicals Committee for consideration. Both the requesting party

1421

12

The City Record

October 7, 2015

and the employer shall be permitted an opportunity to submit evidence supporting their respective positions to
the Hazardous Chemicals Committee.
(h) The Hazardous Chemicals Committee shall consider the evidence to determine if:
(1) The employer has supported the claim that the specific chemical identity is a trade secret;
(2) The requesting party has supported the claim that there is medical or occupational health need for the
information; and
(3) The requesting party has demonstrated adequate means to protect its confidentiality.
(i) If the Hazardous Chemicals Committee determines that the specific chemical identity requested under division (c) of this section is not a bona fide trade secret, or that the specific chemical identity requested under division (c) of this section is a trade secret but the requesting party has a legitimate need for the information, has
executed a written confidentiality agreement, and has shown adequate means to protect the confidentiality of the
information, the employer shall provide said chemical identity to the requesting party within thirty (30) days of
the Committee’s decision. If the employer appeals the Committee’s determination pursuant to division(j) of this
section, it shall have a right to a stay, as provided in division (e)(3) of Section 3103.20 of these Codified Ordinances.
However, if the Hazardous Chemicals Committee determines that there is no medical or occupational health
need for the information or that the execution of a confidentiality agreement would not provide a sufficient protection against the potential harm from the unauthorized disclosure of a trade secret specific chemical identity,
the Hazardous Chemicals Committee may deny the request or may delay its final decision until appropriate modifications of the confidentiality agreement are made.
(j) The Hazardous Chemicals Committees’ decision under division (i) may be appealed within thirty (30) days
by either party to the Board of Building Standards and Building Appeals established pursuant to Charter Section
76-6. The Board’s decision is a final order from which either party may appeal under RC Chapter 2506.
(k) No officer, employee, agent or contractor of any City department, board or commission shall knowingly and
intentionally disclose to anyone in any manner, any trade secret information, except as is required to administer
or enforce the provisions of this chapter and perform official duties or unless authorized by the employer claiming that the data is trade secret information or a court of law. Any person who knowingly violates this provision shall be subject to discipline for malfeasance in office under the City’s Civil Service rules, and shall be subject to other applicable provisions and penalties under existing law for violations of trade secret protections. This
section shall not be construed to eliminate, abridge or detract from any remedies, either at law or in equity,
which an employer or other individual may have arising out of any breach of a confidentiality agreement or
other legal protection of trade secrets.

(b) Should consent be denied, the party seeking permission to enter the adjoining premises may apply in writing to the Commissioner who shall conduct the necessary investigation into the matter, and upon good cause
shown, may order the issuance of a permit to enter the adjoining premises. Such order may be appealed to the
Board of Building Standards and Building Appeals by the owner, agent or occupant of the adjoining premises,
or by the party seeking permission to enter the adjoining premises, if such permission is denied.
(c) The procedure for appeal under this section shall be as follows:
(1) The appeal shall be in writing and be submitted to the Board within five (5) regular business days from
the date notice is received that a permit has or has not been issued, which notice shall be given by the Commissioner to the party seeking to enter the adjoining premises, and to the owner, agent or occupant of such
premises.
(2) Upon the filing of an appeal, a hearing shall be held before the Board, at a time and place fixed by the
Board.
(3) Except in cases of emergency as set forth in division (j) of Section 3103.09 the filing of an appeal shall
suspend the issuance of a permit to enter the adjoining premises until the appeal is acted upon by the Board.

when unsafe conditions are not promptly corrected by the owner of the sign, display structure or premises.
Section 457.07 Screening Barriers
Except as provided in division (e) of Section 457.07, all surface parking lots with ten (10) or more spaces shall
be bordered along the entire length of all lot lines fronting on public streets or public alleys, as defined in Section 303.09 of the Codified Ordinances, except at established entrances and exits, by a visual screen and a vehicular barrier, as further described in divisions (a) and (b) of this section. Such screen and barrier shall be sufficient to prevent vehicular ingress and egress except at established entrances and exits, to prevent motor vehicles from encroaching into the public right-of-way, to restrict pedestrian movement to established sidewalk areas
and to screen parked vehicles from view from the public right-of-way.
(a) Vehicular Barriers. The vehicular barrier shall consist of a continuous concrete or cut stone curb at least
eight (8) inches high and six (6) inches wide or anchored concrete wheel stops, as necessary to prevent motor
vehicles from projecting into the public right-of- way or impacting with the visual screen.
(b) Visual Screens. All visual screens shall meet the following requirements with respect to height, opacity and
materials.
(1) Central City Area. Within the Downtown Core, Gateway and Warehouse Parking Districts, as established
in Section 457.035, visual screens shall meet the following standards. Minimum required height and opacity shall
be provided throughout the length of any required visual screen. The visual screen shall be a minimum of four
(4) feet and a maximum of six (6) feet in height and shall conform to one (1) of the following four (4) standards with respect to materials and opacity.
A. Shrubbery and Fence: A continuous hedge of shrubbery and a metal picket and rail fence, together providing one hundred percent (100%) opacity to a height of two and one-half (2.5) feet and providing a minimum of
five percent (5%) and a maximum of twenty-five (25%) opacity between a height of two and one-half (2.5) feet

1424

October 7, 2015

The City Record

15

(c) Supplemental Standards for Visual Screens. The elements which compose a required visual screen shall meet
the following requirements:
(1) Standards for Shrubs, Trees and Ground Cover. Shrubbery used as part of a visual screen must be sufficient to meet the height and opacity requirements by the end of the second growing season after initial planting. All shrubs and trees shall be selected from lists of approved types, as adopted by the City Planning Commission. At the time of installation, deciduous trees shall be a minimum of two (2.0) inches in caliper at one (1)
foot above grade, and evergreen trees shall be a minimum of six (6.0) feet in height. Trees shall be permitted
as part of any visual screen, and the maximum height and opacity limitations shall not apply to trees. In the
event that irrigation as required under division (c)(4) of this section is not available, landscaping materials
installed on such property shall be of a type which do not require such irrigation for proper maintenance, as
determined by the Director of Parks, Recreation and Properties, or his or her designee.
(2) Standards for Landscaped Areas. If a visual screen is set within a landscaped area, such area shall be bordered by a continuous concrete or cut stone curb at least six (6) inches wide and eight (8) inches high and such
area shall be covered by grass or other suitable vegetative ground cover, bark or decorative stones. If planted
with shrubs, the landscaped area shall be a minimum of three (3) feet in width. If planted with trees, the landscaped area shall be a minimum of four (4) feet in width.
(3) Standards for Fences and Walls. All walls and fences used as part of a visual screen shall be of uniform
appearance and shall be set in a concrete base. Required metal picket and rail fences shall be of actual or simulated wrought iron or cast iron construction. Masonry walls shall be of brick or stone construction.
(4) Irrigation Requirements.
A. General Provisions. Every landscaped area shall be served by a permanently- installed underground irrigation system. No irrigation system, however shall be required for trees provided to supplement the use of bollards
and chains as required by division (b)(2) of this section.
B. Method of Connection. For parking lots established on or after June 26, 1991, the irrigation system shall be
connected directly to City water lines. For parking lots legally established before June 26, 1991, the irrigation
system shall be either connected to City water lines or shall be configured for coupling to a hose which draws
water from any permitted source. In such instances, the selection of the water source shall be made by the applicant. In all instances, however, the Division of Water may reject a particular method of connection if it determines that such method is technically infeasible or unsafe in a particular location.
C. Responsibilities. In the case of a property, or adjoining properties under common ownership, which are not
served by City water lines, the City shall provide, at its expense, water line hook- ups to serve the irrigation
system. The City’s responsibility to dedicate a water source shall arise upon approval by the Division of Building and Housing and the Division of Water of plans, submitted by the applicant, for such irrigation, including
necessary water line hook-ups. The parking lot operator shall not be responsible for installing live landscaping
materials until the City provides the water line hook up. Each applicant shall be required to install and pay for
a separate water meter or meters, vault and backflow devices and shall pay for all water used. In the case of
a system served by a fire hydrant tap, the applicant shall be responsible for payment of a single annual fee to
cover the costs of estimated water use and issuance of a permit.
(d) Maintenance. All screening materials shall be maintained in good condition at all times. Unhealthy or dead
vegetation shall be replaced with healthy plantings no later than the end of the next applicable growing season.
Fences and walls shall be kept free from peeling paint, rust, spalling, and broken, cracked or missing elements.
Fences and walls shall also be kept plumb, with no more than a two (2) inch deflection from a vertical position.
(e) Exemption for Alleys. No visual screen shall be required along public alleys except within the Downtown
Core Parking District (as established in Section 457.035), where the required visual screen shall be provided.
(f) Landscaping Requirement Reductions and Exemptions. With regard to a parking lot which otherwise complies with all requirements of Section 457.07, the City Planning Commission shall grant a reduction of or an
exemption from the requirements for shrubs, trees and landscaped areas of division (b) of Section 457.07 if full
compliance with such requirements would result in a loss of existing parking spaces which cannot be avoided
or remediated through re-design or re-configuration of the parking lot. The Commission shall take such action in
accordance with the following provisions.
(1) Evidence to Be Provided by the Applicant. An applicant seeking a reduction of or an exemption from the
requirement for landscape elements of a visual screen shall present evidence to the City Planning Commission
demonstrating that the potential loss of existing spaces cannot be avoided or remediated through re-design or reconfiguration of the parking lot.

1425

16

The City Record

October 7, 2015

(2) City Planning Commission Determination. Upon consideration of evidence submitted by the applicant as well
as any analysis prepared by City staff, the City Planning Commission shall determine whether strict application
of the visual screen landscaping requirements will result in an unremediable loss of parking spaces. In determining whether a loss of parking spaces can be avoided through re-design or re-striping, the Commission shall
assume continued use of existing parking space and aisle dimensions for the subject property except where such
dimensions are in excess of City standards. The Commission shall further determine whether the applicant can
comply with the visual screen landscaping requirements through the use of a legal encroachment in one (1) or
more of the public rights- of-way adjoining the parking lot.
(3) Minimum Requirement. Any reduction of standards approved by the City Planning Commission with respect
to the required visual screen shall be the minimum reduction necessary to prevent a loss of parking spaces. The
Commission may require compliance with the visual screen standards through the use of a legal encroachment
in one (1) or more of the public rights-of-way adjoining the parking lot. At a minimum, the Commission shall
require installation of a metal picket and rail fence meeting all applicable requirements of this section and, in
addition, providing a metal, brick or stone pier or post, at least two (2) inches square, at a minimum spacing of
eight (8) feet. The Commission shall also require provision of landscaped areas where such provision will not
result in a loss of parking spaces.

(g) Temporary Uses. Where the City Planning Commission deems a parking lot to be a temporary use, the barrier and screening requirements of this section shall be met if the parking lot operator installs anchored concrete wheel stops supplemented by bollards and chains, as required in division (b)(2) of this section. The requirement for bollards and chains shall not apply outside of the Downtown Core Parking District. No surface parking lot shall be deemed temporary for a period in excess of one (1) year, provided however, that the City Planning Commission may extend the temporary use for one (1) additional one (1) year period if, prior to the completion of the initial one (1) year period, a project agreement with the City is executed which requires development of the lot within one (1) year or a Building Permit application has been filed for development of the lot.
A parking lot shall also be considered as a temporary use if there exists a lease, recorded with the Cuyahoga
County Recorder, between the parking lot operator and the owner of the subject property, and the term of the
lease expires within eighteen (18) months after the compliance date for filing of plans, as specified in division
(i) of this section.
(h) Approval. The materials, design, location and construction of the screens and barriers required by this section shall be approved by the Director of City Planning Commission, in consultation with the Commissioners of
Research, Planning and Development and Traffic Engineering and shall be in accordance with the standards promulgated by the Commissioners in compliance with the provisions of this chapter. Unless otherwise permitted by
the Commissioner of Traffic Engineering, each parking place shall have one (1) common entrance and one (1)
common exit, which may or may not be combined.
(i) Compliance Dates. Parking lots legally established prior to June 26, 1991 shall comply with the requirements of this section in accordance with the following provisions:
(1) For lots within the Downtown Core Parking District, plans shall be filed by May 1, 1992, and installation
shall be completed by August 1, 1992.
