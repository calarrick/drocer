FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTION REFERRED
Res. No. 238-15.
By Council Members Polensek, Conwell, J. Johnson, Brady, Cimperman,
Cummins, Cleveland, Mitchell, Reed,
Dow and Keane.
An emergency resolution urging
the Cleveland Metroparks to station
lifeguards at Euclid Beach and Villa
Angela Beach.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland is
privileged to have Euclid Beach,
Villa
Angela
and
Wildwood
Metroparks on its east shoreway,
to
have
the
Cleveland
and
Metroparks and Board of Park Commissioners managing these facilities; and
Whereas,
in
a
recent
hiring
announcement for lifeguards for the
Metroparks, Euclid Beach and Villa
Angela Beach were, once again,
excluded; and
Whereas, the community is greatly concerned about the lack of lifeguards at these two vital parks with
the only two swimming beaches on
Cleveland’s east side; and
Whereas, last summer park goers
and residents expressed concern
about the lack of lifeguards and the
number of drowning victims at
these beaches; and
Whereas, concern is growing this
year about the disparity of east side
beaches
being
neglected
again,
while at the same time Edgewater
and Huntington beaches will have
lifeguards; and
Whereas,
State
Representative
Bill Patmon along with Cuyahoga
Councilmember
Anthony
County
Hairston share this Council’s concern over the threat that not stationing lifeguards poses to public
safety at these beaches; and
Whereas, the lack of lifeguards
has been attributed to poor water
quality and the lacking number of

days the beaches were able to be
used for swimming as a result; but
regardless of the water quality and
posted signs, people, especially kids,
go in the water, so lifeguards are
crucial to ensure public safety; and
Whereas, in 2015, there must be
parity along the lakefront, and
Euclid Beach and Villa Angela
Beach must be treated equally along
with Edgewater and any of the
other lakefront parks, especially
when stationing lifeguards; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Metroparks to station lifeguards
at Euclid Beach and Villa Angela
Beach.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
Resolution to Bruce Rinker, President, Board of Commissioners, Brian
Zimmerman,
Executive
Director,
Cleveland Metroparks, Honorable Bill
Patmon, State Representative, and
Honorable Anthony Hairston, Cuyahoga County Council.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
