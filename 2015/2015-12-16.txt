AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 613-15.
By Council Members Polensek, Conwell, J. Johnson and Mitchell.
An emergency resolution supporting high quality trauma care in the
City of Cleveland including the newly

The City Record
opened University Hospitals level 1
trauma center and the continuing service of MetroHealth Medical Center’s
level 1 trauma center; and further in
support of the recent agreement
between the four hospital systems in
the area to coordinate their emergency room and trauma center practices to give the best and most immediate care to the people of Cleveland
and Northeast Ohio.
Whereas, after the closures of the
Level 1 trauma center at Mt. Sinai
Medical Center, the Level 2 trauma
center at St. Luke’s Medical Center,
and Cleveland Clinic’s Huron Hospital with its Level 2 trauma center
much of Cleveland was without a
nearby trauma center to care for
high-level traumatic injuries; and
Whereas, the level 1 adult trauma
center at MetroHealth Medical Center has for decades given severely
injured and ill Cleveland-area residents expert care quickly and efficiently; and
Whereas, on December 1, 2015,
University Hospitals opened a Level
1 trauma center at its location at
11100 Euclid Avenue; and
Whereas, the Chief Medical Officers of the Cleveland Clinic, MetroHealth Medical Center, St. Vincent
Charity Medical Center and University Hospitals have reached an
unprecedented agreement to coordinate an immediate reduction in
patient diversions and pledge to go
to zero diversions by February, 2016;
and
Whereas,
these
four
hospitals
have also agreed to reform the
Northern
Ohio
Trauma
System
(NOTS) to include University Hospitals; NOTS will continue coordinating with Cleveland Emergency
Medical Services; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports high quality trauma care in the
City of Cleveland including the newly
opened University Hospitals level 1
trauma center and the continuing service of MetroHealth Medical Center’s
level 1 trauma center; and further supports the recent agreement between
the four hospital systems in the area
to coordinate their emergency room
and trauma center practices to give
the best and most immediate care to
the people of Cleveland and Northeast
Ohio.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit copies
of this resolution to the Chief Medical
Officers of the Cleveland Clinic,
MetroHealth Medical Center, St. Vincent Charity Medical Center and University Hospitals.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its

and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from

Whereas, the City of Cleveland
already bans the use of tobacco
products from all city-owned properties and outside of municipal
buildings; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
promotes healthy lifestyle choices
for their employees, and smoking
causes preventable diseases detrimental to the health of employees;
and
Whereas, smoking causes preventable diseases that are expensive
to treat, and studies have demonstrated
that
smoking
employees
have a greater negative impact on
healthcare costs than non-smoking
employees; and
Whereas, the impacts of continued
use of tobacco products by employees increases healthcare costs, such
as insurance plan premium costs;
and
Whereas, this Council and the
Administration
will
establish
a
working group, including the Health
Department,
Human
Resources
Department, Office of Risk Management, Council, and Healthy Cleveland Clean Air Council, Healthy
Cleveland Clean Air Committee, one
representative selected from union
leadership from the largest non-public safety union that represents City
of Cleveland employees, and two
City of Cleveland residents appointed by Cleveland City Council, and a
representative from Cleveland Clinic, a representative from Metro
Health
System,
a
representative
from St. Vincent Charity Hospital,
and a representative from University Hospital to serve in an advisory
capacity to the working group to
study and consider implementing
offering
smoking
cessation
programs to current employees insert
and shall report quarterly to the
Health and Human Services Committee; and
Whereas, this working group will
study the effectiveness of tobaccofree employee hiring policies and
smoking cessation programs, including policies of the Cleveland Clinic,
the City of Bay Village, the City of
Delray Beach, Florida, and others,
and consider implementing a similar
policy for City of Cleveland employee hires by January 20016; and
Whereas, this working group will
also examine the projected health
care cost-savings of implementing
such a policy for the City of Cleveland, including reduced employee
sick days and reduction in health
insurance coverage costs; and
Whereas, this group will also
determine who and how the policies
will be implemented at the City of
Cleveland; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

1.
That
this
Council
declares that the City of Cleveland

of hiring only tobacco-free employees
and offering smoking cessation programs to current employees.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from

Whereas, Council has been notified
by the Division of Liquor Control of
an application for the transfer of ownership of a D2, D2X, D3 and D3A
Liquor Permit from Paddy Rock, Inc.,
16700 Lorain Avenue, 1st and 2nd
floors, w/end, Cleveland, Ohio 44111,
Permanent Number 6620022 to Mandd,
LLC, 16700 Lorain Avenue, 1st and 2nd

Permanent Number 5474983; and

The City Record
Whereas, the granting of this application for a liquor permit to this high
crime area, which is already saturated with other liquor outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire
community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard of
the laws, regulations or local ordinances of this state or any other state;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed to
the building, safety or health requirements of the governing body of this
County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or constructed that law enforcement officers or agents of the Division of
Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based on
other legal grounds as set forth in
Revised Code Section 4303.292; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of
the public peace, prosperity, safety
and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Superintendent of Liquor Control within 30 days
of notification; now, therefore,

Liquor Permit from Paddy Rock, Inc.,
16700 Lorain Avenue, 1st and 2nd
floors, w/end, Cleveland, Ohio 44111,

Effective December 10, 2015.

Res. No. 1532-15.
By Council Members Brady, Pruitt,
Cummins, Zone and Polensek.
An emergency resolution strongly
urging the Plain Dealer and cleveland.com to immediately stop littering public property with the “shopCLE” weekly circular and requesting

1932

December 16, 2015
that the Plain Dealer begin mailing
the circular to homes in the city of
Cleveland as has been done in Cleveland Heights and Newburgh Heights.
Whereas, the Plain Dealer and
cleveland.com have provided a “weekly circular” of advertisements and
promotions known as “shopCLE”
which is placed in plastic bags and
tossed along this city’s roadways,
sidewalks, driveways and tree lawns;
and
Whereas, the careless tossing of
these flyers violates this City’s littering ordinance, section 613.02 of the
Codified Ordinances; and
Whereas, additionally, the plastic
bags thrown all over our neighborhoods poses serious hazards to
wildlife, human health and the environment; and
Whereas, this Council has received
numerous complaints from our constituents regarding the littering of
neighborhoods with these advertisements encased in plastic bags; and
Whereas, at least two Cleveland
suburbs have complained to the Plain
Dealer and have negotiated that the
flyers will be mailed instead of
dumped onto the public right-of-way;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council strongly urges the Plain Dealer and cleveland.com to immediately stop littering public property with the “shopCLE” weekly circular and requests
that the Plain Dealer begin mailing
the circular to homes in the city of
Cleveland as has been done in Cleveland Heights and Newburgh Heights.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit copies
of this resolution to Plain Dealer
depot manager in charge of shopCLE
distribution Cathy McBride, and
Plain Dealer director of planning and
project management Chris Chimes.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted December 7, 2015.
Effective December 10, 2015.

Ord. No. 737-15.
By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency ordinance to amend
Section 607.15 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as
amended by Ordinance No. 474-14,
passed June 2, 2014, to raise the sales
and distribution age from eighteen to
twenty-one years for cigarettes,
tobacco products and alternative nicotine products, including electronic
cigarettes.
Whereas, raising the minimum age
to buy and sell cigarettes and other
tobacco products to twenty-one would
save lives by preventing adolescents
and young adults from ever taking up
smoking, according to a recent report
by the Ohio State University College
of Public Health; and

December 16, 2015
Whereas, many eighteen year olds
who legally buy cigarettes currently
share them with much younger children who become addicted to smoking; and
Whereas, youth access to tobacco
products will decrease upon raising
the minimum age to twenty-one by
putting legal purchasers outside the
social circle of most high school students, as 90% of the population that
provides cigarettes to children under
eighteen are under twenty-one; and
Whereas, when Needham, Massachusetts increased its sales age to
twenty-one in 2005, collected data
showed almost a 50% decrease in
tobacco use rates among high school
students; and
Whereas, locally, data from the
most recent Cuyahoga County Youth
Risk Behavior Survey in 2013 indicates over 22% of high school students in Cuyahoga County use tobacco products; within the City of Cleveland, rates range between 23.1% on
the west side and 25.1% on the east
side; and
Whereas, nearly all adult smokers
began smoking by the age of eighteen
and almost no one starts smoking
after twenty-one; and
Whereas, of those who begin smoking as youths, 80% will smoke into
adulthood because of the powerful
effects of nicotine, and one half of
adult smokers will die prematurely
from tobacco-related diseases; and
Whereas, also, in Franklin County,
twice as many young women ages
eighteen to twenty-one smoke during
pregnancy than those over twentyone; given the fact that smoking during pregnancy increases risks of premature infant death and birth defects,
raising the smoking age to twentyone may reduce negative birth outcomes; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland and
the State of Ohio already prohibit the
sale or distribution of cigarettes,
other tobacco products, and alternative nicotine products, including electronic cigarettes, to children under
the age of eighteen, and this Council
is compelled to raise the age to twenty-one in order to prevent Cleveland’s
children and young adults from taking up smoking and the harmful
health effects of smoking; and
Whereas, more than fifty municipalities, including New York City,
have raised the age to buy tobacco
products to twenty-one and at least
eight states have proposals pending
in their legislatures; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 607.15 of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio 1976, as amended by Ordinance
No. 474-14, passed June 2, 2014, is
amended as follows:
Section 607.15 Illegal Distribution
of Cigarettes, Other Tobacco Products or Alternative Nicotine Products
(a) As used in this section:
(1) A. “Alternative nicotine product” means, subject to division
(a)(1)B. of this section, an electronic
cigarette or any other product or
device that consists of or contains
nicotine that can be ingested into the

the Redevelopment Area located in

purpose of facilitating development
associated with the proposed construction of townhouses in that area,
in accordance with Section 9.482 of

December 16, 2015
Whereas, the City of Shaker
Heights (“Shaker Heights”) currently
owns 8 permanent parcels, constituting approximately 2.3 acres, located
along Van Aken Boulevard, Sutton
Road, and Milverton Road, and are
currently located both in the City of
Cleveland and the City of Shaker
Heights (the “Redevelopment Area”);
and
Whereas, Shaker Heights wishes to
develop this area by constructing
townhomes in connection with its
Blue Line Rapid Terminus Improvement (the “Improvement”); and
Whereas, because the Redevelopment Area is in two cities, it is an
impediment for development; and
Whereas, Shaker Heights desires to
annex the portions of the Redevelopment Area that is located in the City
of Cleveland (“Cleveland-located portion of the Redevelopment Area”);
and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
(“Cleveland”) is willing to adjust its
boundary line so the Redevelopment
Area, is located wholly in Shaker
Heights; and
Whereas, the proposed change in
the municipal boundary lines does not
involve the transfer of territory
presently inhabited by any residents;
and
Whereas, in consideration of such
boundary adjustment of the Redevelopment Area, Shaker Heights and
Cleveland agree under Revised Code
Section 9.482 and their respective
Home Rule powers, that a Tax Sharing Agreement between Shaker
Heights and Cleveland for the purpose of facilitating economic development, including the sharing of real
estate and income taxes are necessary; and
Whereas, Section 9.482 of the
Revised Code authorizes two municipal corporations to enter into such

in the global marketplace; and
Whereas, Cleveland and Shaker
Heights recognize that it is imperative that they cooperate and collaborate with one another for the benefit
of the region and its resident-taxpayers in order to attract and retain businesses and jobs; and
Whereas, Cleveland and Shaker
Heights are desirous of creating a
new model for inter-municipal cooperation and revenue sharing so that
they may mutually benefit from the
Improvement; and,
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That, under Section 709.37
of the Revised Code, Cleveland does
agree that the municipal boundary
line between Cleveland and Shaker
Heights be changed to establish a
new corporation line separating the

An emergency ordinance authorizing the purchase by one or more
requirement contracts of labor and
materials
needed
to
maintain,
replace, or repair overhead doors, for
the various divisions of City government, for a period of one year, with
two one-year options to renew, the
second of which is exercisable

more written requirement contracts

one year, with two one-year options to
renew, of the necessary items of labor
and materials needed to maintain,
replace, or repair overhead doors in
the approximate amount as purchased during the preceding term,
purchased by the Commissioner of
Purchases and Supplies on a unit
basis for the various divisions of City
government. The first of the one-year
options to renew may be exercised by
the Director of Finance, without the
necessity of obtaining additional
authority of this Council. The second

1972

of the one-year options to renew may
not be exercised without additional
legislative authority. Bids shall be
taken in a manner that permits an
award to be made for all items as a
single contract, or by separate contract for each or any combination of
the items as the Board of Control
determines. Alternate bids for a period less than the specified term may be
taken if desired by the Commissioner
of Purchases and Supplies until provision is made for the requirements for
the entire term.
Section 2. That the costs of the contract or contracts shall be charged
against the proper appropriation
accounts and the Director of Finance
shall certify the amount of any purchase under the contract, each of

December 16, 2015
which purchases shall be made on
order of the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies under a delivery
order against the contract or contracts certified by the Director of
Finance. (RQN 1501, RL 2015-47)
Section 3. That under Section 108(b)
of the Charter, the purchases authorized by this ordinance may be made
through cooperative agreements with
other governmental agencies. The
Director of Finance may sign all documents that are necessary to make
the purchases, and may enter into one
or more contracts with the vendors
selected through that cooperative
process.
Section 4. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure
and, provided it receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take
effect and be in force immediately
upon its passage and approval by the
Mayor; otherwise it shall take effect
and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.

Ord. No. 1494-15.
By Council Members Cimperman, Brancatelli and Kelley (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Economic Development to enter into a Tax Increment Financing
Agreement with w25d commercial, LLC, or its designee, or others, to provide for redevelopment of property located at W.
25th Street & Detroit Ave.; to provide for payments to the Cleveland City School District; and to declare certain improvements to real property to be a public purpose.
Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of the Revised Code, improvements to real property may be declared to be a public purpose where fee title to the real property was, at one time, held by the City of Cleveland and the real property is then
leased or conveyed by the City; and
Whereas, the City owns fee title to the real property which consists of real property more fully described in this ordinance (the “Real Property”); and
Whereas, the subject Real Property is found, declared, and deemed to be a “Blighted Parcel” as defined in, and under
Section 1.08(B) of the Revised Code on the basis of specific conditions set forth in Sections 1.08(B)(2)(a), 1.08(B)(2)(b),
and 1.08(B)(2)(h) thereof, particularly consisting of multiple vacant, outdated warehouses with documented brownfield
conditions and, as a consequence thereof, said Real Property is found, declared, and deemed to be a “Blighted Area”, as
defined in and under Section 1.08(A) of the Revised Code and as demonstrated and documented by a certain study of the
W. 25th and Detroit Area which has been placed in the file for this ordinance, and attached and incorporated with the
Ohio City District Projected Challenges and Redevelopment Plan; and
Whereas, the Real Property is to be developed in accordance with the Ohio City District Projected Challenges and
Redevelopment Plan, which proposes the redevelopment of residential apartments, commercial office space, and retail
and restaurant space surface parking lots and vacant buildings to multi-story, mixed-use developments, a copy of which
is placed in the file for this ordinance; and
Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of the Revised Code, the improvements declared to be a public purpose may be exempt
from real property taxation; and
Whereas, under Section 5709.42 of the Revised Code, the owners of the improvements may be required to make annual
service payments in lieu of taxes that would have been paid had the improvement not been exempt; and
Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of the Revised Code, the exemption may exceed 75% of the improvements for up to 30
years when a portion of the service payments so collected are distributed to the Cleveland City School District (“District”) in an amount equal to the amount the District would have received had the improvement not been exempt; and
Whereas, the District has been notified of the intent to enter into the agreement authorized by this ordinance in compliance with Sections 5709.41(C)(4) and 5709.83 of the Revised Code; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of a municipal
department; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the improvements to be constructed by w25d commercial, LLC, or its designee, or others (“Redeveloper”), which Real Property is declared to be a Blighted Area as required by Section 5709.41(B) of the Revised Code, are
declared to be a public purpose for purposes of Section 5709.41 of the Revised Code. The Real Property is more fully
described as follows:

Project Summary
w25d commercial, LLC is a single-purpose LLC created by the Snavely Property Company (Snavely) for the purpose of
acquiring and developing the W25th & Detroit project. The parcels located on the NW&SW corner of W25th & Detroit
have been a historically abandoned and blighted corridor. W25d commercial, LLC will acquire theses parcels to launch
the project on W25th & Detroit, a truly transformative development that will change the face of W25th&Detroit and
leverage this key location.
Snavely is proposing a $60 Million project on the NW&SW corner of W25th & Detroit. The project will convert two sites;
A surface parking lot, located on the NW corner of W25th & Detroit (North Building) and the existing historical building located on the SW corner of W25th& Detroit (South Building) into a mixed-use transportation oriented development.
The project includes approximately 50,000 SF of commercial space, 194 market rate apartments, 38 affordable apartments, 296 parking spaces and community park improvements for the betterment and connectivity of the neighborhood.
Apartment rentable SF approximately 143,367, average size apartment 754 SF, average monthly apartment rent approximately $1,536 and the average monthly rent/SF approximately $2.04.
The North Building will add 194 market rate residential units, 28,624 sq. ft. of commercial space and 260 parking
spaces, comprised of surface parking and structured parking on the lower level. A 19,000 SF educational facility will
anchor the project and will be occupied by The Music Settlement, a non-profit, high-quality provider of early childhood
education, music education and music therapy services. A grocery store specializing in locally-sourced and fresh foods
will occupy 1,000 SF. In addition, collaboration on healthy foods initiatives and other social programs for the surrounding community is being created by the school, the grocer and other organizations like The Greater Cleveland Foodbank,
including the operation of a “community kitchen” houses within the project. Retailers will occupy the remainder of the
commercial space.
The South Building will add 38 affordable housing units, 21,689 sq. ft. commercial space and 36 parking spaces. A coworking facility will occupy approximately 15,000 SF office space to cultivate an entrepreneurial culture in the neighborhood by providing low-cost access to office facilities and business resources. Finally, a complement of restaurants
will occupy the remainder of the commercial space.
Project Need
The project which is less than a mile from the central business district lies in a blighted area within a severely distressed census track. Over 37% of residents in the area live below the poverty level and unemployment is 1.5x the national average. The project has the capacity to have a stabilizing effect on a community that has experienced significant
disinvestment.
Proposed City Assistance:
As the Developer works to complete the financing for this project, it will be very important to get a commitment from
the City. Doing so will help the Developer to leverage other sources of financing comprising Developer’s capital stack
especially the highly competitive NMTCs and HTCs. The Department of Economic Development is seeking approval to
offer the Developer a non-school TIF as described below.
41 Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Agreement (Non-School)
The Developer has asked the City to consider using a 41 TIF to assist with costs related to the development of the project. The TIF will be immediately effective on the North and South building and will also take effect on the residential
properties after the expiration of the 15-year tax abatement for new residential construction. Using the developer’s proposed sources & uses budget, North Building to be constructed on the North West corner, will generate approximately
$880,369 in new PILOT payments, with $529,278 to be paid to the School District and $4,584,789 to be used to fund financing supported by the TIF. The South Building will be re-developed on the South West corner, will generate approximately $129,649 in annual PILOT payments, with $77,945 to be paid to the School District and $675,187 to be used to fund
financing supported by the TIF.
The 41 TIF will cover PPNs 003-14-006, 003-14-007, 003-14-008, 003-14-009, 003-14-010, 003-14-011, 003-14-012, 003-14-013, 00314-014, 003-14-015, 003-14-019, 003-14-020, 003-14-021, 003-28-005, 003-28-006, 003-28-007, 003-28-008.
