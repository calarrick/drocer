OHIO ENVIRONMENTAL
PROTECTION AGENCY,
DIVISION OF SURFACE WATER

NOTICE OF RECEIPT OF
401 APPLICATION AND
PUBLIC HEARING
Public notice is hereby given that
the Ohio Environmental Protection
Agency (Ohio EPA) Division of Surface Water (DSW) has received an
application for, and has begun to
consider whether to issue or deny, a
Clean Water Act Section 401 water
quality certification for a project to

47

perform the annual maintenance
dredging in the Cleveland Harbor
Federal navigation channels. The
application was submitted by the
U.S.
Army
Corps
of
Engineers
(USACE),
Buffalo
District.
This
year’s dredging will take place
within the Cuyahoga River, and in
Cleveland Harbor, which is located
at the mouth of the Cuyahoga River.
The Buffalo District Corps of Engineers Public Notice Number for this
project is CLEVELAND-15. The Ohio
EPA ID Number for this project is
144574.
As required by the Anti-degradation Rule, 3745-1-05, of the Ohio
Administrative Code (OAC), three
alternatives have been submitted for
the project. The applicant’s proposed
preferred alternative, if approved,
would entail the dredging of an estimated 475,000 cubic yards of material, with placement of 295,000 cubic
yards of the dredged material at the
existing Cleveland Harbor CDFs
and 180,000 cubic yards going to a
new open-lake disposal area in Lake
Erie (CLA-1). The applicant’s proposed minimal degradation alternative, if approved, would entail the
dredging of an estimated 225,000
cubic yards of material, with placement of 45,000 cubic yards of the
dredged material at the existing
Cleveland Harbor CDFs and 180,000
cubic yards going to a new openlake disposal areas in Lake Erie
(CLA-1). The applicant’s proposed
non-degradation
alternative,
if
approved, would have no direct
impacts on waters of the state.
Discharges from the activity, if
approved, would result in degradation to, or lowering of, the water
quality of the Cuyahoga River and
Lake Erie. Ohio EPA will review
the application, and decide whether
to grant or deny the application, in
accordance with OAC Chapters 37451 and 3745-32. In accordance with
OAC rule 3745-1-05, an anti-degradation review of the application will
be
conducted
before
deciding
whether to allow a lowering of
water quality. All three proposed
alternatives will be considered during the review process. No exclusions or waivers, as outlined by OAC
rule 3745-1-05, apply or may be
granted.
Starting January 6, 2015, copies of
the application and technical support information may be inspected
on Ohio EPA-DSW website:
www.epa.ohio.gov/dsw
Ohio EPA will hold a public information session and public hearing
relative to issues of lower water
quality on February 24, 2015 at 6:00
p.m. at the Cleveland Metroparks’
Watershed Stewardship Center at
West Creek, 2277 West Ridgewood
Drive, Parma, OH 44134. The public
hearing will end when all interested parties have had an opportunity
to provide testimony related to the
project.
All interested persons are entitled
to attend or be represented and give
written or oral comments on the proposed project. The purpose of the
hearing is to obtain additional information that will be considered by

action on the application.
Ohio EPA will continue to accept
written comments on the application
through the close of business on
March 3, 2015. Comments received

Ord. No. 1626-14.
By Council Member Kelley (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the issuance and sale of bonds in
the maximum principal amount of
$6,900,000 for the purpose of providing
funds for housing and neighborhood

10
Whereas, this Council desires to

amount not to exceed $6,900,000 (the
“Series 2015 Bonds”) to finance the
costs of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1; and
Whereas, the Series 2015 Bonds
shall be payable from and secured by
income tax revenues of the City
remaining after deposits required
under the General Bond Ordinance
(as defined in Section 2) are made to
the escrow agent for the City’s general obligation bonds; and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of this City, has certified to this Council that the estimated

constitutes an emergency measure
providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health and safety, and for the usual
daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed necessary to issue the Series 2015 Bonds
in an aggregate principal amount not
to exceed $6,900,000 for the purpose of
providing funds to provide housing
for individuals and families by constructing, renovating and rehabilitating single family homes by grants,

within the meaning of Section
133.01(K) of the Revised Code and
such other costs of the foregoing permanent improvements that may be
financed with the proceeds of securities
as
permitted
by

176 of the Ohio Revised Code, the
Charter of the City, and this Ordinance for the purpose stated in Section 1. The Series 2015 Bonds shall be
payable from and secured by the
income tax revenues of the City on a
basis subordinate to the security
given to the General Obligation
Bonds of the City (“General Obligation Bonds”) under Ordinance No.

2015 Bonds shall be issued and

National Association, as trustee (the
“Trustee”), as amended by Section 6.1
of the Second Supplemental Trust
Indenture, dated as of June 1, 2010,
between the City and the Trustee
(together, the “Indenture”). The
Indenture currently secures five

Tax Bonds issued on May 1, 2008 (collectively, the “Series 2008 Bonds”),
four series of Subordinate Lien
Income Tax Bonds issued on June 23,

May 30, 2013 (collectively, the “Series
2013 Bonds”), three series of Subordinate Lien Income Tax Bonds issued
on February 11, 2014 (collectively, the
“Series 2014A Bonds”), and three

Tax Bonds issued on June 11, 2014
(collectively,

subject to certain restrictions. The
Series 2008 Bonds, the Series 2010
Bonds, the Series 2012 Bonds, the
Series 2013 Bonds, the Series 2014A
Bonds, the Series 2014B Bonds, the
Series 2015 Bonds and any additional
bonds issued under the Indenture are
collectively referred to in this Ordinance as the “Bonds.”
Section 3. Pledge and Covenant to
Maintain Income Tax. So long as
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City pledges the
municipal income taxes of the City
and grants a lien thereon, subordinate to the lien granted in the General Bond Ordinance as security for the
General Obligation Bonds of the City
issued and outstanding under the
General Bond Ordinance, to the full
extent required to meet debt charges
payable on the Bonds issued and outstanding, from time to time, under the
Indenture. The City covenants to
appropriate
annually
sufficient
amounts from the income taxes to pay
all debt charges on the General Obligation Bonds, the Bonds outstanding
under the Indenture, any Parity
Obligations and the Unrestricted
Income Tax Obligations (each as
defined in the Indenture). The City
further covenants that so long as any
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City shall not repeal or
amend, or suffer the repeal of, any
ordinance for the levy or collection of
its income taxes in any manner or to
such extent that the City would not be
able to meet its obligations to the
holders of the Bonds.
Section 4. Terms of the Series 2015
Bonds. The Series 2015 Bonds shall be
issued in fully registered form. The
Series 2015 Bonds may be issued in

50

January 21, 2015
action by the City pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture and the Seventh Supplement identified in Section
7. The Series 2015 Bonds shall be designated “Housing and Neighborhood
Development Bonds, Series 2015” and
may contain such further designation
as provided in the Certificate of
Award identified below. The Series
2015 Bonds shall be issued in one lot
as fully registered Series 2015 Bonds
in denominations of $5,000 or any
whole multiple thereof. The Series
2015 Bonds shall be numbered as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance. The Series 2015 Bonds shall
be signed by the officials of the City
and in the manner set forth in the
Indenture.
The Series 2015 Bonds shall be
dated the date of their issuance and
delivery or such other date specified
in the certificate of award providing
for the final terms of the Series 2015
Bonds and the sale of the Series 2015
Bonds in accordance with this Ordinance (the “Certificate of Award”).
The Series 2015 Bonds shall bear
interest from their date until the principal amount is paid at the rate or
rates per year specified in the Certificate of Award, provided that the yield
(determined in accordance with the
arbitrage provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) of
the Series 2015 Bonds shall not exceed
8% per year, if sold as fixed rate
obligations. Interest on the Series
2015 Bonds shall be payable semiannually on April 1 and October 1, or
such other dates specified in the Certificate of Award (the “Interest Payment Dates”).
The provisions of Sections  9.98 to
9.983 of the Revised Code shall apply
to the Series 2015 Bonds and pursuant
to that authority and this Ordinance,
the Director of Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award,
based on the written advice of a financial advisor, that the City’s best interests will be served by causing all or a
portion of the Series 2015 Bonds to be
obligations bearing interest at variable rates. If the Director of Finance
so determines, then the Director of
Finance shall specify in the Certificate of Award the method and procedure by which the variable rate of
interest to be borne by the variable
rate Series 2015 Bonds shall be determined; provided that the variable rate
Series 2015 Bonds shall not bear interest at a rate in excess of 25% per year.
The Director of Finance is authorized
to enter into agreements in connection with the delivery of the variable
rate Series 2015 Bonds, and from time
to time thereafter so long as the variable rate Series 2015 Bonds are outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support Instruments (as defined in
Section 11) and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance, based on the written advice
of a financial advisor, to be necessary
or appropriate to provide for the
method of determining the variable
interest rates, permitting holders the
right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support for the payment of
the variable rate Series 2015 Bonds
upon tender for purchase or redemption, and providing for the repayment
by the City of any amounts drawn
under the Credit Support Instrument.
The Series 2015 Bonds shall mature
in the years and principal amounts
set forth in the Certificate of Award,
provided that (i) each principal payment shall occur on an Interest Payment Date, and (ii) the final maturity

January 21, 2015
date of the Series 2015 Bonds shall be
no later than August 1, 2037; provided
that the Series 2015 Bonds shall not
have more than 20 annual principal
installments. The Series 2015 Bonds
stated to mature in any year may be
issued as serial Series 2015 Bonds or
as term Series 2015 Bonds payable
prior to stated maturity pursuant to
sinking fund redemption (the “Term
Bonds”). The Director of Finance
shall determine in the Certificate of
Award whether any of the Series 2015
Bonds shall be issued as Term Bonds,
any dates (the “Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable pursuant to mandatory sinking fund installments rather than at
stated maturity and the amount of
principal to be paid on each Mandatory Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements”).
If any of the Series 2015 Bonds are
issued as Term Series 2015 Bonds, the
Term Bonds shall be redeemed pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements
at
a
redemption price of 100% of the principal amount redeemed, plus interest
accrued to the redemption date, on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates. The
aggregate of the moneys to be
deposited with the Trustee for payment of principal of and interest on
any Term Bonds shall include
amounts sufficient to redeem on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates the
principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided in
the Indenture and the Seventh Supplement).
The Series 2015 Bonds may be subject to redemption prior to maturity
by and at the option of the City, in
whole or in part on any date, in whole
multiples of $5,000, on the redemption
dates and at the redemption prices
specified in the Certificate of Award,
plus, in each case, accrued interest to
the redemption date. Based on the
written advice of a financial advisor,
the Director of Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that
it is in the best interests of the City
(i) for some or all of the Series 2015
Bonds not to be callable prior to their
stated maturity, and (ii) for a premium to be payable on the redemption of
any Series 2015 Bonds calculated in a
manner to make the bondholder
whole for the loss of the investment or
calculated as a percentage in excess
of 100% of the principal amount
redeemed.
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the City may
have the option to purchase any Bond
which is redeemable by optional
redemption at a purchase price not
less than the redemption price that
would be payable if that Bond were
called for optional redemption on the
date of the proposed purchase. That
election shall be exercised as provided in the Seventh Supplement.
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the Series 2015
Bonds may be secured by a Debt Service Reserve Fund to be held by the
Trustee under the Indenture. The
principal amount of the Series 2015
Bonds may include provision for funding the Debt Service Reserve Fund
from the proceeds of the Series 2015
Bonds, subject to compliance with
applicable federal tax laws.

The City Record
The Director of Finance shall indicate in the Certificate of Award
whether the Series 2015 Bonds are
being issued as obligations the interest on which is excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes (“Tax-Exempt Obligations”).
Section 5. Sale of Series 2015 Bonds.
The Series 2015 Bonds shall first be
offered for purchase to the Trustees
of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by them, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased for
that Account, shall be sold to the purchaser identified in the Certificate of
Award (the “Original Purchaser”).
The Certificate of Award shall specify the final terms of the Series 2015
Bonds in accordance with law, the
provisions of this Ordinance, the written advice of a financial advisor
retained under authority of Section 12
and the Original Purchaser’s offer to
purchase the Series 2015 Bonds,
including: the principal amount of the
Series 2015 Bonds (which shall not
exceed the amount stated in Section  1), the purchase price (which
shall be not less than 97% of the principal amount plus accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate or
rates, the amounts and years in which

Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements), terms and conditions
under which any Series 2015 Bonds
may be redeemed prior to maturity at
the option of the City, the Interest
Payment Dates and the date of the
Series 2015 Bonds (if different from
those set forth in Section 3) and any
other matters required in this Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. As appropriate under the Charter, the Mayor, Director of Finance,

sell the Series 2015 Bonds and the
Original Purchaser agrees to buy the
Series 2015 Bonds on terms consistent
with this Ordinance and the Indenture, that are not substantially
adverse to the City and that are
approved by the Director of Finance
on behalf of the City, all of which

51

11
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Bond Purchase
Agreement or amendments to the
Bond Purchase Agreement by the
Director of Finance. It is determined
that the terms of the Series 2015
Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance
and as may be provided in or pursuant
to the Certificate of Award, the Indenture and the Seventh Supplement, are
in the best interest of the City and in
compliance with all legal requirements.

of any Credit Support Instruments,

City. The Seventh Supplement shall

12
may be issued in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $6,900,000
(the “Notes”) upon the direction of the
Director of Finance to be set forth in a
certificate providing for the final
terms of the Notes and the sale of the
Notes and signed by the Director of
Finance (the “Note Certificate of
Award”). The Notes, if sold as fixed
rate obligations, shall bear interest at
such rate, not exceeding 3% per year,
and shall be payable on the date or
dates, as shall be determined by the
Director of Finance of the City in the
Note Certificate of Award; shall be
dated their date of issuance; shall
mature on the date set forth in the
Note Certificate of Award; shall be
subject to redemption by the City at
any time prior to maturity without
penalty, unless the Director of

premium be paid on their prior
redemption; shall be designated
“Housing and Neighborhood Development Bond Anticipation Notes” or as
otherwise provided in the Note Certificate of Award; shall be issued in
such numbers and denominations as
may be requested by the Note Purchaser (hereinafter defined); and

shall apply to the Notes and pursuant
to that authority and this Ordinance,
the Director of Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award,
based on the written advice of a financial advisor, that the City’s best interests will be served by causing all or a
portion of the Notes to be obligations
bearing interest at variable rates. If
the Director of Finance so determines, then the Director of Finance
shall specify in the Certificate of
Award the method and procedure by
which the variable rate of interest to
be borne by the variable rate Notes
shall be determined; provided that the
variable rate Notes shall not bear
interest at a rate in excess of 25% per
year. The Director of Finance is
authorized to enter into agreements
in connection with the delivery of the
variable rate Notes, and from time to
time thereafter so long as the variable rate Notes are outstanding, with
providers of Credit Support Instruments (as defined in Section 11) and
others as may be determined by the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a financial advisor,
to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the method of determining
the variable interest rates, permitting
holders the right of tender, providing
for liquidity or credit support for the
payment of the variable rate Notes
upon tender for purchase or redemption, and providing for the repayment
by the City of any amounts drawn
under the Credit Support Instrument.
The Trustee shall be the authenticating agent, registrar, transfer agent
and paying agent for the Notes. The
Notes shall be signed by the officials
of the City and in the manner set forth
in the Indenture. The Notes shall first
be offered for purchase to the
Trustees of the Sinking Fund and, if
not purchased by them, shall be
offered to the Treasury Investment
Account for purchase and, if not purchased for that Account, shall be sold

Finance based on an evaluation of the
qualifications of those firms (the
“Note Purchaser”) in the principal
amount set forth in a certificate of
award to be executed by the Director
of Finance (the “Note Certificate of
Award”). The proceeds of such sale
shall be paid into the proper fund or
funds set forth in the Note Certificate
of Award and used for the purpose for
which the Notes are being issued
under the provisions of this Ordinance.

authorized to prepare, or cause to be
prepared, and to sign and deliver, in

It is necessary and proper and in the
best interest of the City to, and the
City shall, issue the Series 2015 Bonds
in an aggregate principal amount not
to exceed $16,300,000 for the purpose
of providing the funds necessary for
the Project. The final aggregate principal amount of the Series 2015 Bonds
will be determined in the Certificate
of Award as provided in Section 6.
Section 3.    Terms of Series 2015
Bonds. The Series 2015 Bonds shall be
dated the date of issuance or such
other date as is designated in the Certificate of Award. The Series 2015
Bonds shall mature on the dates and
in the respective principal amounts to
be determined by the Director of
Finance in the Certificate of Award in
accordance with her determination of
the best interest of, and financial
advantages to, the City; provided that
the final maturity date shall be not
later than 30 years from the date of
issuance of the Series 2015 Bonds. The
Series 2015 Bonds shall bear interest
from their date at the rate or rates per
year set forth in the Certificate of
Award, or if any Series 2015 Bonds
bear interest at a variable rate, at the
rate determined pursuant to the Trust
Indenture and the Certificate of
Award. Interest on the Series 2015
Bonds shall be payable on the dates
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance in the Certificate of Award,
and the Series 2015 Bonds shall bear
interest at those rates until the principal amount of the Series 2015 Bonds is
paid or payment is provided for. If
any Series 2015 Bonds bear interest at

that the City’s best interests will be
served by causing all or a portion of
the Series 2015 Bonds to be obligations bearing interest at variable
rates, redeemable by the City without
penalty or premium on interest
adjustment dates, then the Director of
Finance is authorized to so specify in
the Certificate of Award. If the Director of Finance so determines, then the

January 21, 2015
Director of Finance shall specify in
the Certificate of Award the method
and procedure by which the variable
rate of interest to be borne by the variable rate Series 2015 Bonds shall be
determined, whether by reference to a
market index, by a remarketing
agent or otherwise; provided that the
variable rate Series 2015 Bonds shall
not bear interest at a rate in excess of
25% per year. Holders of variable rate
Series 2015 Bonds may be given the
right to tender their variable rate
Series 2015 Bonds for purchase by the
City at the times, on the terms, and
subject to the conditions set forth in
the Certificate of Award and any tender agreement; provided that tender
rights shall be exercisable only at
such times as a Credit Support Instrument is in place that provides for the
payment of the purchase price
payable to the tendering holder of a
variable rate Bond. If the Director of
Finance designates any Series 2015
Bonds as variable rate Series 2015
Bonds, and if the holders of the variable rate Series 2015 Bonds are to be
entitled to tender the variable rate
Series 2015 Bonds for purchase, then
the Director of Finance shall also designate in the Certificate of Award for
those variable rate Series 2015 Bonds
the provider or providers for any
Credit Support Instrument, the tender
agent or agents and the remarketing
agent or agents, which designations
shall be based on the determination of
the Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a financial advisor,
that the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed to
provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable. The Director of Finance is authorized to enter
into agreements in connection with
the delivery of the variable rate
Series 2015 Bonds, and from time to
time thereafter so long as the variable rate Series 2015 Bonds are outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support Instruments, tender agents
(which may be the Trustee), remarketing agents, and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance, based on the written advice
of a financial advisor, to be necessary
or appropriate to provide for the
method of determining the variable
interest rates, permitting holders the
right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support for the payment of
the variable rate Series 2015 Bonds
upon tender for purchase or redemption, and providing for the repayment
by the City of any amounts drawn
under the Credit Support Instrument.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of the
Series 2015 Bonds, and regardless of
the Series 2015 Bonds bearing interest
at variable or fixed rates, is authorized to contract for one or more Credit Support Instruments, and to pay
their costs from proceeds of the Series
2015 Bonds, if he determines that the
Credit Support Instrument or Instruments will result in a savings in the
cost of this financing to the City,
based on the written advice of a financial advisor.
The Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a financial advisor, shall further determine and specify in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Series 2015 Bonds
are subject to optional redemption
prior to maturity, the earliest date on

The City Record
which redeemable Series 2015 Bonds
shall be subject to prior redemption,
which shall not be later than ten
years from the first interest payment
date, and the applicable redemption
premium for the redeemable Series
2015 Bonds, which shall be not greater
than 103% of the principal amount
redeemed.
The Director of Finance shall indicate in the Certificate of Award
whether the Series 2015 Bonds are
being issued as obligations the interest on which is excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes (“Tax-Exempt Obligations”).
Section  4. Registration, Transfer
and Exchange. The Series 2015 Bonds
shall be issued only as fully registered Series 2015 Bonds. The Trustee
shall act as the authenticating agent,
registrar, transfer agent, and paying
agent for the Series 2015 Bonds,
except as otherwise provided in the
Trust Indenture.
Principal of the Series 2015 Bonds
shall be payable when due upon presentation and surrender of the Series
2015 Bonds at the office of the Trustee
designated in the Trust Indenture.
Interest on each Bond shall be paid on
each interest payment date by check
or draft mailed to the person in whose
name the Bond was registered, and to
that person’s address appearing on
the Register (defined below in this
Section) at the close of business on
the record date provided in the Trust
Indenture. The Trustee shall maintain and keep all books and records
necessary
for
the
registration,
exchange, and transfer of Series 2015
Bonds as provided in the Trust Indenture (the “Register”) so long as any of
the Series 2015 Bonds remain outstanding. Subject to the provisions in
the Trust Indenture, the person in
whose name a Bond is registered on
the Register shall be regarded as the
absolute owner of that Bond for all
purposes of the Proceedings. Payment of or on account of the debt
charges on any Bond shall be made
only to or upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Trustee
shall be affected by any notice to the
contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in the Trust
Indenture. All such payments shall be
valid and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the extent
of the amount or amounts so paid.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
and so long as the Series 2015 Bonds
are issued in a book entry system,
principal of and interest on the Series
2015 Bonds shall be payable in the
manner provided in any agreement
entered into by the Director of
Finance, in the name and on behalf of
the City, in connection with the book
entry system.
Series
2015
Bonds
may
be
exchanged for Series 2015 Bonds of
any authorized denomination upon
presentation and surrender at the
office designated by the Trustee,
together with a request for exchange
signed by the registered owner or by
a person legally empowered to do so
in a form satisfactory to the Trustee.
The Series 2015 Bonds may be
issued to a Depository for use in a
book entry system and, if and as long
as a book entry system is utilized, (i)
the Series 2015 Bonds may be issued
in the form of a single, fully registered Bond representing each maturity and registered in the name of the
Depository or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the

55

15
custody of the Depository; (ii) the
book entry interest owners of Series
2015 Bonds in book entry form shall
have no right to receive Series 2015
Bonds in the form of physical securities or certificates; (iii) ownership of
book entry interests in book entry
form shall be shown by book entry on
the system maintained and operated
by the Depository and its Participants, and transfers of the ownership
of book entry interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository
and its Participants; and (iv) the
Series 2015 Bonds as such shall not be
transferable or exchangeable, except
for transfer to another Depository or
to another nominee of a Depository,
without further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not to
continue to act as a Depository for the
Series 2015 Bonds for use in a book
entry system, the Director of Finance
may attempt to establish a securities
depository/book entry relationship
with another qualified Depository. If
the Director of Finance does not or is
unable to do so, the Director of
Finance, after making provision for
notification of the book entry interest
owners by the then Depository and
any other arrangements deemed necessary, shall permit withdrawal of
the Series 2015 Bonds from the Depository, and authenticate and deliver
certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance also is
authorized to the extent necessary or
required to enter into any agreements
determined necessary in connection
with the book entry system for the
Series 2015 Bonds, after determining
that the signing thereof will not
endanger the funds or securities of
the City and after the approval of the
form of any such agreement by the
Director of Law.
Section 5. Execution of Series 2015
Bonds. Series 2015 Bonds shall be
signed by the Mayor and the Director
of Finance, in the name of the City
and in their official capacities, provided that either or both of those signatures may be a facsimile, and shall
bear the seal of the City or a facsimile
thereof; provided that no Bond shall
be valid or obligatory for any purpose
or shall be entitled to any security or
benefit under the Proceedings unless
and until the certificate of authentication printed on the Bond is signed
by the Trustee as authenticating
agent, and authentication by the
Trustee shall be conclusive evidence
that the Bond so authenticated has
been duly issued, signed and delivered under, and is entitled to the security and benefit of, the Proceedings.
The certificate of authentication may
be signed by any authorized officer or
employee of the Trustee or by any
other person acting as an agent of the
Trustee and approved by the Director
of Finance on behalf of the City. The
same person need not sign the certificate of authentication on all of the
Series 2015 Bonds.
Pursuant to Section 83 of the City’s
Charter, the Director of Law shall prepare the Series 2015 Bonds and shall
endorse thereon her approval of the
form and correctness thereof by her
manual or facsimile signature. The
Series 2015 Bonds shall be issued in
the denominations as requested by

16
the Original Purchaser and approved
by the Director of Finance, in conformity with this Ordinance. The entire
principal amount may be represented
by a single bond certificate and may
be issued as fully registered securities and in book entry or other uncertificated form if it is determined by
the Director of Finance that issuance
of fully registered securities in that
form will facilitate the sale and delivery of the Series 2015 Bonds. The
Series 2015 Bonds may be issued in
the authorized denominations of
either (a) $100,000 each or in any
denomination that is the sum of (i)
$100,000 and (ii) $5,000 or any integral
multiple thereof, and not exchangeable for other Series 2015 Bonds in
denominations less than $100,000, or
(b) $5,000 or any integral multiple
thereof, as determined by the Director
of Finance in the Certificate of Award
to be in the best interests of the City.
The Series 2015 Bonds shall not have
coupons attached, shall be numbered
as determined by the Director of
Finance and shall express upon their
faces the purpose, in summary terms,
for which they are issued and that
they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 6. Sale of Series 2015 Bonds.
The Series 2015 Bonds shall be sold at
not less than 97% of par plus accrued
interest at private sale by the Director of Finance to the Original Purchaser in accordance with law and
the provisions of this Ordinance. If
the Director of Finance determines,
based on the written advice of a financial advisor, that an underwriter is
incapable of fully performing its
duties or meeting its obligations in its
capacity as Original Purchaser with
respect to the Series 2015 Bonds, the
Director of Finance is hereby authorized, in the name of and on behalf of
the City, to take whatever action may
be necessary to terminate that underwriter’s standing as Original Purchaser. The Director of Finance shall
sign the Certificate of Award referred
to in this Ordinance, evidencing that
sale to the Original Purchaser, cause
the Series 2015 Bonds to be prepared,
and have the Series 2015 Bonds signed
and delivered, together with a true
transcript of proceedings with reference to the issuance of the Series 2015
Bonds if requested by the Original
Purchaser, to the Original Purchaser
upon payment of the purchase price.
The Director of Finance is authorized
to sign and deliver, in the name and
on behalf of the City, a bond purchase
agreement between the City and the
Original Purchaser, or representative
thereof (the “Purchase Agreement”),
in a form consistent with this Ordinance and as approved by the Director of Law. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant
to the Purchase Agreement from the
proceeds of the Series 2015 Bonds to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose. The Mayor, the Director
of Finance, the Clerk, the Director of
Law, and other City officials, as
appropriate, are each authorized to
sign any transcript certificates,
financial statements and other documents and instruments and to take
such actions as are necessary or
appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance.

The City Record
Section  7. Security for the Bonds.
The Series 2015 Bonds shall be special
obligations of the City, and the debt
charges on the Series 2015 Bonds, as
well as the Series 2004 Bonds, the
Series 2013A Bonds, the Series 2014
Bonds, and any Additional Bonds,
shall be payable solely from the Net
Project Revenues and the Nontax
Revenues. The payment of debt
charges on the Bonds is secured by
the Trust Indenture and by a pledge
of and lien on the Bond Fund held by
the Trustee under the Trust Indenture. The Bonds are not and shall not
be secured by an obligation or pledge
of any money raised by taxation. The
Bonds do not and shall not represent
or constitute a debt or pledge of the
faith and credit or taxing power of
the City, and the owners thereof have
and shall have no right to have taxes
levied by the City for the payment of
debt charges thereon. The Series 2015
Bonds shall contain a statement to
that effect and to the effect that the
Bonds are payable solely from the Net
Project Revenues and the Nontax
Revenues and are not secured by an
obligation or pledge of any money
raised by taxation.
The City covenants and agrees that
while the Bonds are outstanding, it
will appropriate and maintain Nontax
Revenues at such times and in such
amounts as will be sufficient, together with the Net Project Revenues and
any other funds available for the purpose, to pay the debt charges on the
Bonds and will so restrict other obligations payable from Nontax Revenues prior to or on a parity with the
Bonds as will ensure the continuing
availability for appropriation of sufficient Nontax Revenues to pay debt
charges when due.
In accordance with the Trust Indenture, there shall be deposited in the
Bond Fund (i) any Net Project Revenues, and (ii) other Nontax Revenues on or prior to the date debt
charges on the Bonds are due, in an
amount sufficient to pay those debt
charges. There shall be deposited in
the Bond Reserve Fund from the proceeds of the Series 2015 Bonds or a
Credit
Support
Instrument,
the
amount, if any, determined by the
Director of Finance based on the written advice of a financial advisor, to
enhance the marketability of the
Series 2015 Bonds and to enable the
City to stabilize its budget against
fluctuations in the receipt of Nontax
Revenues. Money in the Bond Fund
and Bond Reserve Fund shall be
applied and invested as provided in
the Trust Indenture. Amounts drawn
on the Bond Reserve Fund shall be
restored to the extent, and over the
period of time, provided in the Trust
Indenture.
Section 8. Payment of Debt Changes
on the Series 2015 Bonds. Nothing
herein shall be construed as requiring
the City to use or apply to the payment of debt charges on the Series
2015 Bonds any funds or revenues
from any source other than Net Project Revenues and the Nontax Revenues. Subject to the requirements of
Revised Code Section 176.04, nothing
herein, however, shall be deemed to
prohibit the City, of its own volition,
from using, to the extent that it is
authorized by law to do so, any other
resources for the fulfillment of any of
the terms, conditions or obligations of
this Ordinance or of the Series 2015
Bonds.

56

January 21, 2015
The City will, solely from the proceeds of the Series 2015 Bonds or from
the Net Project Revenues or the Nontax Revenues, pay or cause to be paid
the debt charges on the Series 2015
Bonds on the dates, at the places and
in the manner provided herein and in
the Series 2015 Bonds. For that purpose, in each year while the Bonds are
outstanding, this Council, after providing for the payment of debt
charges payable on the City’s general
obligation securities in that year
from sources available for that purpose, will appropriate Nontax Revenues required to pay, and for the purpose of paying, the debt charges due
in that year on the Bonds (less other
money available for the purpose) and
any outstanding parity obligations
payable from Nontax Revenues. Further, this Council will give effect to
such appropriations in all ordinances
it passes thereafter in that year
appropriating money for expenditure
and encumbrance and limit the other
appropriations of Nontax Revenues in
that year to the amount available
after deducting the amount required
for the payment of debt charges
payable on the City’s general obligation securities and to pay those debt
charges. The City covenants that, so
long as any of the Bonds are outstanding, it shall not issue any additional obligations payable from the
Nontax Revenues on a parity with the
Bonds and any outstanding parity
obligations payable from Nontax Revenues, unless, prior to passage of the
ordinance authorizing such parity
obligations, the Director of Finance
shall have certified to this Council
that the Nontax Revenues during the
preceding calendar year, adjusted to
reflect, if necessary, changes in the
rates or charges resulting in the Nontax Revenues, aggregate in amount
not less than 100% of the highest
amount of (a) debt charges on the
Bonds and (b) required payments on
such proposed parity obligations and
any outstanding parity obligations
due in any succeeding calendar year.
Each
obligation
of
the
City
required to be undertaken pursuant to
this Ordinance and the Series 2015
Bonds is binding upon the City, and
upon each officer or employee of the
City as may from time to time have
the authority under law to take any
action on behalf of the City as may be
necessary to perform all or any part
of such obligation, as a duty of the
City and of each of those officers and
employees resulting from an office,
trust or station within the meaning of
Section  2731.01 of the Revised Code,
providing for enforcement by writ of
mandamus.
Section 9. Supplemental Trust
Indenture. The City shall enter into
the Sixth Supplement, supplementing
the original Trust Indenture, to further provide for the terms of the
Series 2015 Bonds. The Mayor and the
Director of Finance shall sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of
the City, the Sixth Supplement in a
form consistent with this Ordinance
and approved by the Director of Law.
The Mayor and the Director of
Finance and other City officials, as
appropriate, are authorized to take
such actions and sign and deliver
such related instruments as are necessary or appropriate to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this
Ordinance.
Section 10. Project Fund; Deposit of
Proceeds. The proceeds from the sale

January 21, 2015
of the Series 2015 Bonds are appropriated and shall be used for the purpose
for which the Series 2015 Bonds are
being issued. There is created by the
City, as a separate fund or account, in
the custody and control of the
Trustee, a fund designated the “Core
City Program Series 2015 Project
Fund” (the “Project Fund”). That Project Fund shall be maintained separate and apart from the fund established as the project fund for any
other series of Bonds issued under the
Trust Indenture. The proceeds from
the sale of the Series 2015 Bonds shall
be deposited in the Project Fund.
Additional funds, from whatever
source, may be voluntarily deposited
in the Project Fund by the City.
Funds in the Project Fund may be
used to pay costs of a Project, or to
make loans to others to pay costs of
that Project, consistent with Revised
Code Chapter 165, following certification of the Project by the Corporation
as being in accordance with the Economic Development Plan. Moneys in
the Project Fund are appropriated
for, and shall be used to pay, costs of
Projects consistent with the requirements of this Ordinance. The City
may establish additional accounts or
subaccounts within the Project Fund
as necessary or convenient to ascertain the dates, amounts and sources of
deposits. At such time as disbursements are to be made from the Project
Fund to pay costs of a Project, the
City shall direct the Trustee to transfer amounts in the Project Fund to the
City for subsequent disbursement by,
or reimbursement to, the City for Project purposes. Any portion of the proceeds of the Series 2015 Bonds to be
used to pay interest on the Series 2015
Bonds shall be deposited in a capitalized interest subaccount of the Project Fund. Any accrued interest
received from the sale of the Bonds
shall be deposited in the Bond Fund.
Section 11. Official Statement; Continuing Disclosure. If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a disclosure document (each, an “Official
Statement”) is appropriate or necessary in connection with the sale of the
Series 2015 Bonds, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare or
cause to be prepared on behalf of the
City an Official Statement with
respect to the Series 2015 Bonds, as
the case may be, and any necessary
supplements and to authorize the use
and distribution of each Official
Statement and any supplements. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign on behalf of the City and in her
official capacity each Official Statement and any supplements approved
by her. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign and deliver on
behalf of the City and in her official
capacity such certificates in connection with the accuracy of each Official Statement and any supplements
as may, in her judgment, be necessary
or appropriate. The Director of
Finance is also authorized to determine and certify on behalf of the City
that such disclosure document is
“deemed final” by the City within the
meaning of Securities and Exchange
Commission Rule 15c2-12 (the “SEC
Rule”). The Director of Finance is
authorized to contract for services for
the production and distribution of preliminary and final Official Statements, including by printed and electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time of

The City Record
the Series 2015 Bonds, the City agrees,
in accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Series 2015 Bonds under the SEC Rule,
to provide or cause to be provided
such financial information and operating data and notices, in such manner as may be required for purposes of
the SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for that
purpose, and thereby to implement
that agreement, including provisions
for enforcement, amendment and termination, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare, or cause to be
prepared, and to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City, a
continuing disclosure agreement or
certificate, which shall constitute the
continuing
disclosure
agreement
made by the City for the benefit of the
holders and beneficial owners of the
Series 2015 Bonds, as the case may be,
in accordance with the SEC Rule. The
performance of that agreement shall
be subject to the availability of funds
and their annual appropriation to
meet costs the City would be required
to incur to perform it. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to
establish procedures in order to
ensure compliance by the City with
its continuing disclosure agreement,
including the timely provision of
information and notices.
Section 12. Federal Tax Considerations.
The
representations
and
covenants in this Section apply only if
the Series 2015 Bonds are issued as
Tax-Exempt Obligations. The City
covenants that it will use, and will
restrict the use and investment of, the
proceeds of the Series 2015 Bonds and
any Notes in such manner and to such
extent as may be necessary so that
(i)  the Series 2015 Bonds and any
Notes will not (A) constitute private
activity bonds or arbitrage bonds
under Sections 141 or 148 of the Internal Revenue Code of l986, as amended
(the “Code”) or (B) be treated other
than as bonds the interest on which is
excluded from gross income under
Section 103 of the Code, and (ii) the
interest on the Series 2015 Bonds and
any Notes will not be an item of tax
preference under Section 57 of the
Code.
The City further covenants that (i)
it will take or cause to be taken such
actions that may be required of it for
the interest on the Series 2015 Bonds
and any Notes to be and remain
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, (ii) it will not
take or authorize to be taken any
actions that would adversely affect
that exclusion, and (iii) it, or persons
acting for it, will, among other acts of
compliance, (A) apply the proceeds of
the Series 2015 Bonds and any Notes to
the governmental purpose of the borrowing, (B) restrict the yield on
investment property, (C) make timely
and adequate payments to the federal
government, (D) maintain books and
records and make calculations and
reports and (E) refrain from certain
uses of those proceeds, and, as applicable, of property financed with such
proceeds, all in such manner and to
the extent necessary to assure such
exclusion of that interest under the
Code.
The Director of Finance or any
other officer of the City having
responsibility for issuance of the
Series 2015 Bonds and any Notes is
hereby authorized (i) to make or

57

17
effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or
waiver on behalf of the City with
respect to the Series 2015 Bonds and
any Notes as the City is permitted to
or required to make or give under the
federal income tax laws, including,
without limitation thereto, any of the
elections available under Section 148
of the Code, for the purpose of assuring, enhancing or protecting favorable tax treatment or tax status of the
Series 2015 Bonds and any Notes or
interest thereon, or assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose, reducing the burden or expense
of such compliance, reducing rebate
amounts or payments or penalties or
making payments of special amounts
in lieu of making computations to
determine, or paying, excess earnings
as rebate, or obviating those amounts
or payments, which action shall be in
writing and signed by the officer,
(ii) to take any and all other actions,
make or obtain calculations, make
payments, and make or give reports,
covenants and certifications of and on
behalf of the City, as may be appropriate to assure the intended tax status of the Series 2015 Bonds and any
Notes and (iii) to give one or more
appropriate certificates of the City,
for inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Series 2015 Bonds
and any Notes, setting forth the reasonable expectations of the City
regarding the amount and use of all
the proceeds of the Series 2015 Bonds
and any Notes, the facts, circumstances and estimates on which they
are based, and other facts and circumstances relevant to the tax treatment
of the interest on the Series 2015
Bonds and any Notes and the tax status of the Series 2015 Bonds and any
Notes.
Section 13. Credit Facilities and
Ratings. If the Director of Finance
determines it to be in the best interests of the City, based on the written
advice of a financial advisor, the
Director of Finance may obtain an
insurance policy, letter of credit,
standby bond purchase agreement or
other credit enhancement instrument
as further security for the payment
when due of the principal of and interest on all or any portion of the Series
2015 Bonds (a “Credit Support Instrument”). The Director of Finance may
request a rating on the Series 2015
Bonds from one or more nationally
recognized rating organizations, and
do any and all things and take any
and all actions required to secure a
Credit Support Instrument and/or a
rating or ratings on the Series 2015
Bonds. The Director of Finance may
enter into one or more agreements for
Credit Support Instruments containing terms not materially inconsistent
with this Ordinance or the Indenture.
The expenditure of the amounts necessary to secure Credit Support
Instruments or obtain those ratings is
authorized and approved, and the
Director of Finance is authorized to
provide for the payment of any such
amounts from the proceeds of the
Series 2015 Bonds to the extent available and otherwise from any other
funds lawfully available that are
appropriated or shall be appropriated
for that purpose.
Section 14. Authorization of Hedging Arrangements. This Council finds
that by engaging in interest rate
hedging arrangements with respect
to Bonds the City may reduce its cost
of borrowing by optimizing the relative amounts of fixed and variable

18
rate obligations, or minimizing the
risk of variations in its debt service
costs, or obtaining savings by confirming rates of interest on Bonds in
advance of their issuance. To permit
the City to have the flexibility to
undertake interest rate swap, swaption, rate cap, rate collar and other
hedging transactions, from time to
time, and to establish the procedures
for approving those transactions, this
Council authorizes the signing and
delivery of one or more agreements
(each, a “Hedge Agreement”) and any
related agreements necessary for the
consummation of the transactions
contemplated by each Hedge Agreement. The authorizations in this Section are supplemental to and not in
derogation of any authority provided
by any other ordinance of this Council
concerning hedging arrangements.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
that it is to the financial advantage of
the City and in the City’s best interests that a hedging arrangement be
undertaken by the City with respect
to any Bonds issued or to be issued
under the Trust Indenture, the Director of Finance may authorize one or
more interest rate hedge transactions
in accordance with the applicable
Hedge Agreement; provided that the
term of each hedge transaction shall
not exceed the final maturity of the
Bonds to which the hedge relates.
The Director of Finance shall negotiate the terms of each Hedge Agreement. The City shall receive a written
opinion of a Financial Advisor that
the payments made or to be made by
the counterparty to the City, or by the
City to the counterparty, shall be fair
value for the Hedge Agreement, considering, among other things, the
credit of the City, the credit of the
counterparty and the terms and conditions of the Hedge Agreement. The
Director of Finance shall determine
the terms and conditions of the Hedge
Agreement, including without limitation, the time or times and procedures
for the exercise by the counterparty
or the City, as the case may be, of any
option under the Hedge Agreement,
whether the obligations of the City
under the Hedge Agreement shall be
secured by a Credit Support Instrument, and the rates to be paid by the
counterparty to the City and by the
City to the counterparty under the
Hedge Agreement in the event of the
exercise of the option. The approval
of each interest rate hedge transaction by the Director of Finance shall
be conclusively evidenced by the
signing and delivery of the applicable
Hedge Agreement by the Director of
Finance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into an amendment,
modification or novation of any
Hedge Agreement or any Credit Support Instrument securing a Hedge
Agreement or to terminate any Hedge
Agreement, in whole or in part, if the
Director of Finance determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that (a) the
amendment, modification, novation or
termination is (i) justified by the corresponding benefit to the City, (ii)
commercially reasonable based on
then-current market conditions, and
(iii) in the City’s best interests, and
(b) any payments made or to be made
by the counterparty to the City, or by
the City to the counterparty, are fair

The City Record
value for such amendment, modification, novation or termination, given
the credit of the counterparty and the
terms and conditions of the amendment, modification, novation or termination. To the extent that any
amounts to be paid by the City in connection with any such amendment,
modification, novation or termination
are not paid from proceeds of the
Series 2015 Bonds, those amounts
shall be paid from Program Funds
and Nontax Revenues appropriated
for the purpose.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from Net Project Revenues and Nontax Revenues. The obligation of the
City to make payments under any
Hedge Agreement does not and shall
not represent or constitute a general
obligation, debt, bonded indebtedness
or a pledge of the faith and credit of
the City or the State. Nothing gives
any party to any Hedge Agreement
the right to have excises, ad valorem
or other taxes levied by the City or the
State for the payment of any amounts
due under any Hedge Agreement.
In the event the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that it
is necessary to supplement or amend
the Trust Indenture or a Supplemental Indenture in connection with any
Hedge Agreement or any amendment,
modification, novation or termination
of any Hedge Agreement, the Director
of Finance is authorized to sign and
deliver a Supplemental Indenture or
amendment of an existing Supplemental Indenture.
Section 15. Certifications of Community Improvement Corporation. Prior
to delivery of the Series 2015 Bonds,
the Core City Fund program shall be
certified to be in accordance with the
Plan by the Corporation as the agency
of the City for industrial, commercial,
distribution and research facilities
development within the City. Each
Project shall be so certified by the
Corporation prior to receiving proceeds of the Bonds by loan or otherwise.
Section 16. Captions, Headings, and
Section References. The captions and
headings in this Ordinance are solely

Ord. No. 1628-14.
By Council Member Kelley (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the issuance and sale of bonds in
the maximum principal amount of
$34,000,000 for the purpose of providing funds to improve facilities for the
discharge of governmental functions
or for services otherwise benefitting
public safety, health and welfare, and
authorizing related matters.
Whereas, this Council desires to
issue bonds in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed $34,000,000 (the
“Series 2015 Bonds”) to finance the
costs of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1; and
Whereas, the Series 2015 Bonds
shall be payable from and secured by
income tax revenues of the City
remaining after deposits required
under the General Bond Ordinance
(as defined in Section 2) are made to
the escrow agent for the City’s general obligation bonds; and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of this City, has certified to this Council that the estimated
life or usefulness of the improvements to be financed with the proceeds of the Series 2015 Bonds is at
least five years and the maximum
maturity of the Series 2015 Bonds is 14

January 21, 2015
years, as evidenced by the certificate
contained in File No. 1628-14-A; and
Whereas, the authorization for
issuance of the Series 2015 Bonds is
necessary to provide funds to pay the
costs of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1 that are
urgently needed for the benefit of the
City, and as a result, this Ordinance
constitutes an emergency measure
providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health and safety, and for the usual
daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed necessary to issue the Series 2015 Bonds
in an aggregate principal amount not
to exceed $34,000,000 for the purpose
of providing funds to improve facilities for the discharge of governmental functions or for services otherwise
benefiting the public safety, health
and welfare, including constructing,
reconstructing,
rehabilitating,
installing, renovating, enlarging and
otherwise improving buildings, structures and other facilities in, of and for
City Hall, police stations, fire stations, emergency medical centers, service stations, waste collection, transfer and disposal facilities, correctional facilities, health facilities, maintenance facilities, kennels, parking
facilities, storm water drainage facilities, centers and other facilities, the
provision of necessary fixtures, furnishings, equipment, information
technology hardware and software,
utilities, site improvements and
appurtenances, and the acquisition of
vehicles, and to pay any capitalized
interest and all expenses incurred in
connection with the issuance of the
securities, including all financing
costs within the meaning of Section
133.01(K) of the Revised Code and
such other costs of the foregoing permanent improvements that may be
financed with the proceeds of securities as permitted by Section 133.15(B)
of the Ohio Revised Code and as otherwise permitted by law.
Section 2. Authority, Security and
Source of Payment. The Series 2015
Bonds shall be issued pursuant to the
Ohio Constitution, Chapter 133 of the
Ohio Revised Code, the Charter of the
City, and this Ordinance for the purpose stated in Section  1. The Series
2015 Bonds shall be payable from and
secured by the income tax revenues of
the City on a basis subordinate to the
security given to the General Obligation Bonds of the City (“General
Obligation Bonds”) under Ordinance
No. 1749-80 passed by the Council on
October 8, 1980, as amended by Ordinance No. 1112-83 passed by the Council on May 6, 1983, and Ordinance No.
944-96, passed by the Council on June
10, 1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so
amended and as the same may further
be amended from time to time in
accordance with its provisions, is
referred to as the “General Bond Ordinance”). The debt service on the
Series 2015 Bonds shall be payable
from income tax collections remaining after depositing with the escrow
agent under the General Bond Ordinance the amount required for the
payment of debt service on the City’s
General Obligation Bonds issued and
outstanding, from time to time, under
the General Bond Ordinance. The
Series 2015 Bonds shall be issued and
secured under the terms of the Trust
Indenture, dated as of April 1, 2008,
between the City and U.S. Bank
National Association, as trustee (the

The City Record
“Trustee”), as amended by Section 6.1
of the Second Supplemental Trust
Indenture, dated as of June 1, 2010,
between the City and the Trustee
(together, the “Indenture”). The
Indenture currently secures five
series of Subordinate Lien Income
Tax Bonds issued on May 1, 2008 (collectively, the “Series 2008 Bonds”),
four series of Subordinate Lien
Income Tax Bonds issued on June 23,

May 30, 2013 (collectively, the “Series
2013 Bonds”), three series of Subordinate Lien Income Tax Bonds issued
on February 11, 2014 (collectively, the
“Series 2014A Bonds”), and three
series of Subordinate Lien Income
Tax Bonds issued on June 11, 2014
(collectively,
the
“Series
2014B
Bonds”) and permits the issuance of
additional bonds, from time to time,
subject to certain restrictions. The
Series 2008 Bonds, the Series 2010
Bonds, the Series 2012 Bonds, the
Series 2013 Bonds, the Series 2014A
Bonds, the Series 2014B Bonds, the
Series 2015 Bonds and any additional
bonds issued under the Indenture are
collectively referred to in this Ordinance as the “Bonds.”
Section 3. Pledge and Covenant to
Maintain Income Tax. So long as
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City pledges the
municipal income taxes of the City
and grants a lien thereon, subordinate to the lien granted in the General Bond Ordinance as security for the
General Obligation Bonds of the City
issued and outstanding under the
General Bond Ordinance, to the full
extent required to meet debt charges
payable on the Bonds issued and outstanding, from time to time, under the
Indenture. The City covenants to
appropriate
annually
sufficient
amounts from the income taxes to pay
all debt charges on the General Obligation Bonds, the Bonds outstanding
under the Indenture, any Parity
Obligations and the Unrestricted
Income Tax Obligations (each as
defined in the Indenture). The City
further covenants that so long as any
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City shall not repeal or
amend, or suffer the repeal of, any
ordinance for the levy or collection of
its income taxes in any manner or to
such extent that the City would not be
able to meet its obligations to the
holders of the Bonds.
Section 4. Terms of the Series 2015
Bonds. The Series 2015 Bonds shall be
issued in fully registered form. The
Series 2015 Bonds may be issued in
one or more series or subseries. The
Series 2015 Bonds may be delivered
only in book-entry form, and if so
delivered, shall be registered in the
name of the Depository (as defined in
the Indenture) or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the
custody of the Depository, and shall
not be transferable or exchangeable
(except for transfer to another Depository or its nominee) without further
action by the City pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture and the Seventh Supplement identified in Section
7. The Series 2015 Bonds shall be designated “Public Facilities Improvement Bonds, Series 2015” and may contain such further designation as provided in the Certificate of Award
identified below. The Series 2015

59

19
Bonds shall be issued in one lot as
fully registered Series 2015 Bonds in
denominations of $5,000 or any whole
multiple thereof. The Series 2015
Bonds shall be numbered as determined by the Director of Finance. The
Series 2015 Bonds shall be signed by
the officials of the City and in the
manner set forth in the Indenture.
The Series 2015 Bonds shall be
dated the date of their issuance and
delivery or such other date specified
in the certificate of award providing
for the final terms of the Series 2015
Bonds and the sale of the Series 2015
Bonds in accordance with this Ordinance (the “Certificate of Award”).
The Series 2015 Bonds shall bear
interest from their date until the principal amount is paid at the rate or
rates per year specified in the Certificate of Award, provided that the yield
(determined in accordance with the
arbitrage provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) of
the Series 2015 Bonds shall not exceed
6% per year, if sold as fixed rate
obligations. Interest on the Series
2015 Bonds shall be payable semiannually on April 1 and October 1, or
such other dates specified in the Certificate of Award (the “Interest Payment Dates”).
The provisions of Sections  9.98 to
9.983 of the Revised Code shall apply
to the Series 2015 Bonds and pursuant
to that authority and this Ordinance,
the Director of Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award,
based on the written advice of a financial advisor, that the City’s best interests will be served by causing all or a
portion of the Series 2015 Bonds to be
obligations bearing interest at variable rates. If the Director of Finance
so determines, then the Director of
Finance shall specify in the Certificate of Award the method and procedure by which the variable rate of
interest to be borne by the variable
rate Series 2015 Bonds shall be determined; provided that the variable rate
Series 2015 Bonds shall not bear interest at a rate in excess of 25% per year.
The Director of Finance is authorized
to enter into agreements in connection with the delivery of the variable
rate Series 2015 Bonds, and from time
to time thereafter so long as the variable rate Series 2015 Bonds are outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support Instruments (as defined in
Section 11) and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance, based on the written advice
of a financial advisor, to be necessary
or appropriate to provide for the
method of determining the variable
interest rates, permitting holders the
right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support for the payment of
the variable rate Series 2015 Bonds
upon tender for purchase or redemption, and providing for the repayment
by the City of any amounts drawn
under the Credit Support Instrument.
The Series 2015 Bonds shall mature
in the years and principal amounts
set forth in the Certificate of Award,
provided that (i) each principal payment shall occur on an Interest Payment Date, and (ii) the final maturity
date of the Series 2015 Bonds shall be
no later than August 1, 2031; provided
that the Series 2015 Bonds shall not
have more than 14 annual principal
installments. The Series 2015 Bonds
stated to mature in any year may be
issued as serial Series 2015 Bonds or
as term Series 2015 Bonds payable
prior to stated maturity pursuant to

20
sinking fund redemption (the “Term
Bonds”). The Director of Finance
shall determine in the Certificate of
Award whether any of the Series 2015
Bonds shall be issued as Term Bonds,
any dates (the “Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable pursuant to mandatory sinking fund installments rather than at
stated maturity and the amount of
principal to be paid on each Mandatory Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements”).
If any of the Series 2015 Bonds are
issued as Term Series 2015 Bonds, the
Term Bonds shall be redeemed pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements
at
a
redemption price of 100% of the principal amount redeemed, plus interest
accrued to the redemption date, on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates. The
aggregate of the moneys to be
deposited with the Trustee for payment of principal of and interest on
any Term Bonds shall include
amounts sufficient to redeem on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates the
principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided in
the Indenture and the Seventh Supplement).
The Series 2015 Bonds may be subject to redemption prior to maturity
by and at the option of the City, in
whole or in part on any date, in whole
multiples of $5,000, on the redemption
dates and at the redemption prices
specified in the Certificate of Award,
plus, in each case, accrued interest to
the redemption date. Based on the
written advice of a financial advisor,
the Director of Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that
it is in the best interests of the City
(i) for some or all of the Series 2015
Bonds not to be callable prior to their
stated maturity, and (ii) for a premium to be payable on the redemption of
any Series 2015 Bonds calculated in a
manner to make the bondholder
whole for the loss of the investment or
calculated as a percentage in excess
of 100% of the principal amount
redeemed.
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the City may
have the option to purchase any Bond
which is redeemable by optional
redemption at a purchase price not
less than the redemption price that
would be payable if that Bond were
called for optional redemption on the
date of the proposed purchase. That
election shall be exercised as provided in the Seventh Supplement.
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the Series 2015
Bonds may be secured by a Debt Service Reserve Fund to be held by the
Trustee under the Indenture. The
principal amount of the Series 2015
Bonds may include provision for funding the Debt Service Reserve Fund
from the proceeds of the Series 2015
Bonds, subject to compliance with
applicable federal tax laws.
Section 5. Sale of Series 2015 Bonds.
The Series 2015 Bonds shall first be
offered for purchase to the Trustees
of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by them, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account for

that Account, shall be sold to the purchaser identified in the Certificate of

The City Record

the option of the City, the Interest

adverse to the City and that are
approved by the Director of Finance
on behalf of the City, all of which
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Bond Purchase
Agreement or amendments to the
Bond Purchase Agreement by the
Director of Finance. It is determined
that the terms of the Series 2015
Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance
and as may be provided in or pursuant
to the Certificate of Award, the Indenture and the Seventh Supplement, are
in the best interest of the City and in
compliance with all legal requirements.

(the “Notes”) upon the direction of the

of the Revised Code shall apply to the
Notes and pursuant to that authority
and this Ordinance, the Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award, based on the written
advice of a financial advisor, that the
City’s best interests will be served by
causing all or a portion of the Notes to
be obligations bearing interest at
variable rates. If the Director of
Finance so determines, then the
Director of Finance shall specify in
the Certificate of Award the method
and procedure by which the variable
rate of interest to be borne by the variable rate Notes shall be determined;
provided that the variable rate Notes
shall not bear interest at a rate in
excess of 25% per year. The Director
of Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements in connection with the
delivery of the variable rate Notes,
and from time to time thereafter so
long as the variable rate Notes are
outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support Instruments (as defined in
Section 11) and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance, based on the written advice
of a financial advisor, to be necessary
or appropriate to provide for the
method of determining the variable
interest rates, permitting holders the
right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support for the payment of
the variable rate Notes upon tender
for purchase or redemption, and providing for the repayment by the City
of any amounts drawn under the Credit Support Instrument. The Trustee
shall be the authenticating agent,
registrar, transfer agent and paying
agent for the Notes. The Notes shall
be signed by the officials of the City
and in the manner set forth in the
Indenture. The Notes shall first be
offered for purchase to the Trustees
of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by them, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased for
that Account, shall be sold at not less
than par and accrued interest to one
or more firms that have proposed to
underwrite the Notes and have been
selected by the Director of Finance
based on an evaluation of the qualifications of those firms (the “Note Purchaser”) in the principal amount set
forth in a certificate of award to be
executed by the Director of Finance
(the “Note Certificate of Award”).
The proceeds of such sale shall be
paid into the proper fund or funds set
forth in the Note Certificate of Award
and used for the purpose for which
the Notes are being issued under the
provisions of this Ordinance.

Section 10. Federal Tax Considerations. The City covenants that it will
use, and will restrict the use and
investment of, the proceeds of the
Series 2015 Bonds and any Notes in
such manner and to such extent as
may be necessary so that (i)  the
Series 2015 Bonds and any Notes will
not (A) constitute private activity
bonds or arbitrage bonds under Sections 141 or 148 of the Internal Revenue Code of l986, as amended (the
“Code”) or (B) be treated other than

61

21
as bonds the interest on which is
excluded from gross income under
Section 103 of the Code, and (ii) the
interest on the Series 2015 Bonds and
any Notes will not be an item of tax
preference under Section 57 of the
Code.
The City further covenants that (i)

actions that may be required of it for
the interest on the Series 2015 Bonds
and any Notes to be and remain
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, (ii) it will not
take or authorize to be taken any
actions that would adversely affect
that exclusion, and (iii) it, or persons
acting for it, will, among other acts of
compliance, (A) apply the proceeds of

January 21, 2015
Whereas, this Council desires to
issue bonds in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed $11,000,000 (the
“Series 2015 Bonds”) to finance the
costs of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1; and
Whereas, the Series 2015 Bonds
shall be payable from and secured by
income tax revenues of the City
remaining after deposits required
under the General Bond Ordinance
(as defined in Section 2) are made to
the escrow agent for the City’s general obligation bonds; and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of this City, has certified to this Council that the estimated
life or usefulness of the improvements to be financed with the proceeds of the Series 2015 Bonds is at
least five years and the maximum
maturity of the Series 2015 Bonds is 26
years, as evidenced by the certificate
contained in File No. 1629-14-A; and
Whereas, the authorization for
issuance of the Series 2015 Bonds is
necessary to provide funds to pay the
costs of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1 that are
urgently needed for the benefit of the
City, and as a result, this Ordinance
constitutes an emergency measure
providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health and safety, and for the usual
daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed necessary to issue the Series 2015 Bonds
in an aggregate principal amount not
to exceed $11,000,000 for the purpose
of providing funds to improve municipal parks and recreation facilities by
constructing, reconstructing, rehabilitating,
installing,
renovating,
enlarging and otherwise improving
parks and recreation centers and
areas, pools, aquatic facilities, skating rinks, greenhouses, bicycle paths,
playgrounds,
playfields,
tracks,
fields and related buildings, structures, walkways, pavement, safety
surfaces and facilities, and providing
necessary water systems, drainage,
lighting, signage, fixtures, furnishings, equipment, safety modifications
and site improvements, together with
all necessary and incidental appurtenances and the acquisition of any
required real estate and interests in
real estate and the demolition of any
existing buildings, structures, walkways and facilities, and to pay any
capitalized interest and all expenses
incurred in connection with the
issuance of the securities, including
all financing costs within the meaning of Section 133.01(K) of the
Revised Code and such other costs of
the foregoing permanent improvements that may be financed with the
proceeds of securities as permitted by
Section 133.15(B) of the Ohio Revised
Code and as otherwise permitted by
law.
Section 2. Authority, Security and
Source of Payment. The Series 2015
Bonds shall be issued pursuant to the
Ohio Constitution, Chapter 133 of the
Ohio Revised Code, the Charter of the
City, and this Ordinance for the purpose stated in Section  1. The Series
2015 Bonds shall be payable from and
secured by the income tax revenues of
the City on a basis subordinate to the
security given to the General Obligation Bonds of the City (“General
Obligation Bonds”) under Ordinance
No. 1749-80 passed by the Council on

accordance with its provisions, is
referred to as the “General Bond Ordinance”). The debt service on the
Series 2015 Bonds shall be payable
from income tax collections remaining after depositing with the escrow
agent under the General Bond Ordinance the amount required for the
payment of debt service on the City’s
General Obligation Bonds issued and
outstanding, from time to time, under
the General Bond Ordinance. The
Series 2015 Bonds shall be issued and
secured under the terms of the Trust

“Trustee”), as amended by Section 6.1
of the Second Supplemental Trust
Indenture, dated as of June 1, 2010,

four series of Subordinate Lien
Income Tax Bonds issued on June 23,

2013 Bonds”), three series of Subordinate Lien Income Tax Bonds issued
on February 11, 2014 (collectively, the
“Series 2014A Bonds”), and three

Tax Bonds issued on June 11, 2014
(collectively,
the

Bonds, the Series 2012 Bonds, the
Series 2013 Bonds, the Series 2014A
Bonds, the Series 2014B Bonds, the
Series 2015 Bonds and any additional
bonds issued under the Indenture are
collectively referred to in this Ordinance as the “Bonds.”
Section 3. Pledge and Covenant to
Maintain Income Tax. So long as
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City pledges the
municipal income taxes of the City
and grants a lien thereon, subordinate to the lien granted in the General Bond Ordinance as security for the
General Obligation Bonds of the City
issued and outstanding under the
General Bond Ordinance, to the full
extent required to meet debt charges
payable on the Bonds issued and outstanding, from time to time, under the
Indenture. The City covenants to
appropriate
annually
sufficient
amounts from the income taxes to pay
all debt charges on the General Obligation Bonds, the Bonds outstanding
under the Indenture, any Parity
Obligations and the Unrestricted
Income Tax Obligations (each as
defined in the Indenture). The City
further covenants that so long as any
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City shall not repeal or

ordinance for the levy or collection of
its income taxes in any manner or to
such extent that the City would not be
able to meet its obligations to the

and may contain such further designation as provided in the Certificate
of Award identified below. The Series
2015 Bonds shall be issued in one lot
as fully registered Series 2015 Bonds
in denominations of $5,000 or any
whole multiple thereof. The Series
2015 Bonds shall be numbered as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance. The Series 2015 Bonds shall
be signed by the officials of the City
and in the manner set forth in the
Indenture.
The Series 2015 Bonds shall be
dated the date of their issuance and
delivery or such other date specified
in the certificate of award providing
for the final terms of the Series 2015
Bonds and the sale of the Series 2015
Bonds in accordance with this Ordinance (the “Certificate of Award”).
The Series 2015 Bonds shall bear
interest from their date until the principal amount is paid at the rate or
rates per year specified in the Certificate of Award, provided that the yield
(determined in accordance with the
arbitrage provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) of
the Series 2015 Bonds shall not exceed
6% per year, if sold as fixed rate
obligations. Interest on the Series
2015 Bonds shall be payable semiannually on April 1 and October 1, or
such other dates specified in the Certificate of Award (the “Interest Payment Dates”).
The provisions of Sections  9.98 to
9.983 of the Revised Code shall apply
to the Series 2015 Bonds and pursuant
to that authority and this Ordinance,
the Director of Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award,
based on the written advice of a financial advisor, that the City’s best interests will be served by causing all or a
portion of the Series 2015 Bonds to be
obligations bearing interest at variable rates. If the Director of Finance
so determines, then the Director of
Finance shall specify in the Certificate of Award the method and procedure by which the variable rate of
interest to be borne by the variable
rate Series 2015 Bonds shall be determined; provided that the variable rate
Series 2015 Bonds shall not bear interest at a rate in excess of 25% per year.
The Director of Finance is authorized
to enter into agreements in connection with the delivery of the variable
rate Series 2015 Bonds, and from time
to time thereafter so long as the variable rate Series 2015 Bonds are outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support Instruments (as defined in
Section 11) and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance, based on the written advice
of a financial advisor, to be necessary

63

23
or appropriate to provide for the
method of determining the variable
interest rates, permitting holders the
right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support for the payment of
the variable rate Series 2015 Bonds
upon tender for purchase or redemption, and providing for the repayment
by the City of any amounts drawn
under the Credit Support Instrument.
The Series 2015 Bonds shall mature
in the years and principal amounts
set forth in the Certificate of Award,
provided that (i) each principal payment shall occur on an Interest Payment Date, and (ii) the final maturity
date of the Series 2015 Bonds shall be
no later than August 1, 2043; provided
that the Series 2015 Bonds shall not
have more than 26 annual principal
installments. The Series 2015 Bonds
stated to mature in any year may be
issued as serial Series 2015 Bonds or
as term Series 2015 Bonds payable
prior to stated maturity pursuant to
sinking fund redemption (the “Term
Bonds”). The Director of Finance
shall determine in the Certificate of
Award whether any of the Series 2015
Bonds shall be issued as Term Bonds,
any dates (the “Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable pursuant to mandatory sinking fund installments rather than at
stated maturity and the amount of
principal to be paid on each Mandatory Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements”).
If any of the Series 2015 Bonds are
issued as Term Series 2015 Bonds, the
Term Bonds shall be redeemed pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements
at
a
redemption price of 100% of the principal amount redeemed, plus interest
accrued to the redemption date, on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates. The
aggregate of the moneys to be
deposited with the Trustee for payment of principal of and interest on
any Term Bonds shall include
amounts sufficient to redeem on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates the
principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided in
the Indenture and the Seventh Supplement).
The Series 2015 Bonds may be subject to redemption prior to maturity
by and at the option of the City, in
whole or in part on any date, in whole
multiples of $5,000, on the redemption
dates and at the redemption prices
specified in the Certificate of Award,
plus, in each case, accrued interest to
the redemption date. Based on the
written advice of a financial advisor,
the Director of Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that
it is in the best interests of the City
(i) for some or all of the Series 2015
Bonds not to be callable prior to their
stated maturity, and (ii) for a premium to be payable on the redemption of
any Series 2015 Bonds calculated in a
manner to make the bondholder
whole for the loss of the investment or
calculated as a percentage in excess
of 100% of the principal amount
redeemed.
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the City may
have the option to purchase any Bond
which is redeemable by optional
redemption at a purchase price not
less than the redemption price that

24
would be payable if that Bond were
called for optional redemption on the
date of the proposed purchase. That
election shall be exercised as provided in the Seventh Supplement.
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the Series 2015
Bonds may be secured by a Debt Service Reserve Fund to be held by the
Trustee under the Indenture. The
principal amount of the Series 2015
Bonds may include provision for funding the Debt Service Reserve Fund
from the proceeds of the Series 2015
Bonds, subject to compliance with
applicable federal tax laws.
Section 5. Sale of Series 2015 Bonds.
The Series 2015 Bonds shall first be
offered for purchase to the Trustees
of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by them, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased for
that Account, shall be sold to the purchaser identified in the Certificate of
Award (the “Original Purchaser”).
The Certificate of Award shall specify the final terms of the Series 2015

Requirements), terms and conditions

the option of the City, the Interest
Payment Dates and the date of the

and as may be provided in or pursuant

Director of Finance shall specify in
the Certificate of Award the method

by
the
Director
of

for enforcement, amendment and termination, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare, or cause to be
prepared, and to sign and deliver, in

use, and will restrict the use and
investment of, the proceeds of the
Series 2015 Bonds and any Notes in

any Notes will not be an item of tax

interest thereon, or assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose, reducing the burden or expense
of such compliance, reducing rebate
amounts or payments or penalties or
making payments of special amounts
in lieu of making computations to
determine, or paying, excess earnings
as rebate, or obviating those amounts
or payments, which action shall be in
writing and signed by the officer,
(ii) to take any and all other actions,
make or obtain calculations, make
payments, and make or give reports,
covenants and certifications of and on
behalf of the City, as may be appropriate to assure the intended tax status of the Series 2015 Bonds and any

when due of the principal of and interest on all or any portion of the Series

shall be payable from and secured by
income tax revenues of the City
remaining after deposits required
under the General Bond Ordinance
(as defined in Section 2) are made to

Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

Section 3. Pledge and Covenant to
Maintain Income Tax. So long as
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City pledges the
municipal income taxes of the City
and grants a lien thereon, subordinate to the lien granted in the General Bond Ordinance as security for the
General Obligation Bonds of the City
issued and outstanding under the
General Bond Ordinance, to the full
extent required to meet debt charges
payable on the Bonds issued and outstanding, from time to time, under the
Indenture. The City covenants to
appropriate
annually
sufficient
amounts from the income taxes to pay
all debt charges on the General Obligation Bonds, the Bonds outstanding
under the Indenture, any Parity
Obligations and the Unrestricted
Income Tax Obligations (each as
defined in the Indenture). The City
further covenants that so long as any
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City shall not repeal or
amend, or suffer the repeal of, any

its income taxes in any manner or to
such extent that the City would not be
able to meet its obligations to the
holders of the Bonds.
Section 4. Terms of the Series 2015
Bonds. The Series 2015 Bonds shall be
issued in fully registered form. The
Series 2015 Bonds may be issued in
one or more series or subseries. The
Series 2015 Bonds may be delivered
only in book-entry form, and if so
delivered, shall be registered in the
name of the Depository (as defined in
the Indenture) or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the
custody of the Depository, and shall

(except for transfer to another Depository or its nominee) without further
action by the City pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture and the Seventh Supplement identified in Section
7. The Series 2015 Bonds shall be designated
“Bridges
and
Roadway
Improvement Bonds, Series 2015” and
may contain such further designation
as provided in the Certificate of
Award identified below. The Series
2015 Bonds shall be issued in one lot
as fully registered Series 2015 Bonds
in denominations of $5,000 or any
whole multiple thereof. The Series
2015 Bonds shall be numbered as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance. The Series 2015 Bonds shall
be signed by the officials of the City
and in the manner set forth in the
Indenture.
The Series 2015 Bonds shall be
dated the date of their issuance and
delivery or such other date specified
in the certificate of award providing
for the final terms of the Series 2015
Bonds and the sale of the Series 2015
Bonds in accordance with this Ordinance (the “Certificate of Award”).
The Series 2015 Bonds shall bear
interest from their date until the principal amount is paid at the rate or
rates per year specified in the Certificate of Award, provided that the yield
(determined in accordance with the
arbitrage provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) of
the Series 2015 Bonds shall not exceed
6% per year, if sold as fixed rate
obligations. Interest on the Series
2015 Bonds shall be payable semiannually on April 1 and October 1, or

The City Record
such other dates specified in the Certificate of Award (the “Interest Payment Dates”).
The provisions of Sections  9.98 to
9.983 of the Revised Code shall apply
to the Series 2015 Bonds and pursuant
to that authority and this Ordinance,
the Director of Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award,
based on the written advice of a financial advisor, that the City’s best interests will be served by causing all or a
portion of the Series 2015 Bonds to be
obligations bearing interest at variable rates. If the Director of Finance
so determines, then the Director of
Finance shall specify in the Certificate of Award the method and procedure by which the variable rate of
interest to be borne by the variable
rate Series 2015 Bonds shall be determined; provided that the variable rate
Series 2015 Bonds shall not bear interest at a rate in excess of 25% per year.
The Director of Finance is authorized
to enter into agreements in connection with the delivery of the variable
rate Series 2015 Bonds, and from time
to time thereafter so long as the variable rate Series 2015 Bonds are outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support Instruments (as defined in
Section 11) and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance, based on the written advice
of a financial advisor, to be necessary
or appropriate to provide for the
method of determining the variable
interest rates, permitting holders the
right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support for the payment of
the variable rate Series 2015 Bonds
upon tender for purchase or redemption, and providing for the repayment
by the City of any amounts drawn
under the Credit Support Instrument.
The Series 2015 Bonds shall mature
in the years and principal amounts
set forth in the Certificate of Award,
provided that (i) each principal payment shall occur on an Interest Payment Date, and (ii) the final maturity
date of the Series 2015 Bonds shall be
no later than August 1, 2038; provided
that the Series 2015 Bonds shall not
have more than 21 annual principal
installments. The Series 2015 Bonds
stated to mature in any year may be
issued as serial Series 2015 Bonds or
as term Series 2015 Bonds payable
prior to stated maturity pursuant to
sinking fund redemption (the “Term
Bonds”). The Director of Finance
shall determine in the Certificate of
Award whether any of the Series 2015
Bonds shall be issued as Term Bonds,
any dates (the “Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable pursuant to mandatory sinking fund installments rather than at
stated maturity and the amount of
principal to be paid on each Mandatory Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements”).
If any of the Series 2015 Bonds are
issued as Term Series 2015 Bonds, the
Term Bonds shall be redeemed pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements
at
a
redemption price of 100% of the principal amount redeemed, plus interest
accrued to the redemption date, on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates. The
aggregate of the moneys to be
deposited with the Trustee for payment of principal of and interest on
any Term Bonds shall include
amounts sufficient to redeem on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates the

67

27
principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided in
the Indenture and the Seventh Supplement).
The Series 2015 Bonds may be subject to redemption prior to maturity
by and at the option of the City, in
whole or in part on any date, in whole
multiples of $5,000, on the redemption
dates and at the redemption prices
specified in the Certificate of Award,
plus, in each case, accrued interest to
the redemption date. Based on the
written advice of a financial advisor,
the Director of Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that
it is in the best interests of the City
(i) for some or all of the Series 2015
Bonds not to be callable prior to their
stated maturity, and (ii) for a premium to be payable on the redemption of
any Series 2015 Bonds calculated in a
manner to make the bondholder
whole for the loss of the investment or
calculated as a percentage in excess
of 100% of the principal amount
redeemed.
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the City may
have the option to purchase any Bond
which is redeemable by optional
redemption at a purchase price not
less than the redemption price that
would be payable if that Bond were
called for optional redemption on the
date of the proposed purchase. That
election shall be exercised as provided in the Seventh Supplement.
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the Series 2015
Bonds may be secured by a Debt Service Reserve Fund to be held by the
Trustee under the Indenture. The
principal amount of the Series 2015
Bonds may include provision for funding the Debt Service Reserve Fund
from the proceeds of the Series 2015
Bonds, subject to compliance with
applicable federal tax laws.
Section 5. Sale of Series 2015 Bonds.
The Series 2015 Bonds shall first be
offered for purchase to the Trustees
of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by them, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased for
that Account, shall be sold to the purchaser identified in the Certificate of
Award (the “Original Purchaser”).
The Certificate of Award shall specify the final terms of the Series 2015
Bonds in accordance with law, the
provisions of this Ordinance, the written advice of a financial advisor
retained under authority of Section 12
and the Original Purchaser’s offer to
purchase the Series 2015 Bonds,
including: the principal amount of the
Series 2015 Bonds (which shall not
exceed the amount stated in Section  1), the purchase price (which
shall be not less than 97% of the principal amount plus accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate or
rates, the amounts and years in which
principal installments are payable
(at stated maturity or pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements), terms and conditions
under which any Series 2015 Bonds
may be redeemed prior to maturity at
the option of the City, the Interest
Payment Dates and the date of the
Series 2015 Bonds (if different from
those set forth in Section 3) and any
other matters required in this Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. As appropriate under the Charter, the Mayor, Director of Finance,

28
Director of Law, Clerk of Council and
other appropriate officers of the City
are, and each of them is, authorized to
take such actions as are necessary,
appropriate and in the best interest of

establish the date, location, procedures, and conditions for the delivery
of the Series 2015 Bonds to the Original Purchaser, to give all appropriate
notices and certificates, to cause a
true transcript of proceedings with
reference to the issuance of the Series
2015 Bonds to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript
certificates, financial statements and
other documents and instruments and

or appropriate to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this
Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Series 2015 Bonds. The Director of
Finance is authorized to sign and
deliver on behalf of the City a bond
purchase agreement between the City
and the Original Purchaser (the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”),
approved as to form by the Director of
Law, setting forth the terms and conditions on which the City agrees to
sell the Series 2015 Bonds and the
Original Purchaser agrees to buy the
Series 2015 Bonds on terms consistent
with this Ordinance and the Indenture, that are not substantially
adverse to the City and that are
approved by the Director of Finance
on behalf of the City, all of which

Ordinance.
Section 8. Bond Anticipation Notes.
For the purpose of raising money in
anticipation of the issuance of the
Series 2015 Bonds for the purpose set
forth in Section 1, notes of the City
may be issued in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $42,400,000
(the “Notes”) upon the direction of the
Director of Finance to be set forth in a
certificate providing for the final
terms of the Notes and the sale of the
Notes and signed by the Director of
Finance (the “Note Certificate of
Award”). The Notes, if sold as fixed
rate obligations, shall bear interest at
such rate, not exceeding 3% per year,
and shall be payable on the date or
dates, as shall be determined by the
Director of Finance of the City in the
Note Certificate of Award; shall be
dated their date of issuance; shall
mature on the date set forth in the
Note Certificate of Award; shall be
subject to redemption by the City at
any time prior to maturity without
penalty, unless the Director of
Finance, based on the advice of a
financial advisor, determines that it
is in the best interest of the City in
order to enhance the marketability of
the Notes, that the Notes not be
redeemable prior to maturity or that a
premium be paid on their prior
redemption; shall be designated
“Bridges and Roadway Improvement
Bond Anticipation Notes” or as otherwise provided in the Note Certificate
of Award; shall be issued in such numbers and denominations as may be
requested by the Note Purchaser
(hereinafter defined); and shall be
issued in fully registered form (which
may be in a book entry only system).
The provisions of Sections 9.98 to 9.983
of the Revised Code shall apply to the
Notes and pursuant to that authority
and this Ordinance, the Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award, based on the written
advice of a financial advisor, that the
City’s best interests will be served by
causing all or a portion of the Notes to
be obligations bearing interest at
variable rates. If the Director of

68

January 21, 2015
Finance so determines, then the
Director of Finance shall specify in
the Certificate of Award the method
and procedure by which the variable
rate of interest to be borne by the variable rate Notes shall be determined;
provided that the variable rate Notes
shall not bear interest at a rate in
excess of 25% per year. The Director
of Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements in connection with the
delivery of the variable rate Notes,
and from time to time thereafter so
long as the variable rate Notes are
outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support Instruments (as defined in
Section 11) and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance, based on the written advice
of a financial advisor, to be necessary
or appropriate to provide for the
method of determining the variable
interest rates, permitting holders the
right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support for the payment of
the variable rate Notes upon tender
for purchase or redemption, and providing for the repayment by the City
of any amounts drawn under the Credit Support Instrument. The Trustee
shall be the authenticating agent,
registrar, transfer agent and paying
agent for the Notes. The Notes shall
be signed by the officials of the City
and in the manner set forth in the
Indenture. The Notes shall first be
offered for purchase to the Trustees
of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by them, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased for
that Account, shall be sold at not less
than par and accrued interest to one
or more firms that have proposed to
underwrite the Notes and have been
selected by the Director of Finance
based on an evaluation of the qualifications of those firms (the “Note Purchaser”) in the principal amount set
forth in a certificate of award to be
executed by the Director of Finance
(the “Note Certificate of Award”).
The proceeds of such sale shall be
paid into the proper fund or funds set
forth in the Note Certificate of Award
and used for the purpose for which
the Notes are being issued under the
provisions of this Ordinance.
Section 9. Official Statement; Continuing Disclosure. If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a disclosure document (each, an “Official
Statement”) is appropriate or necessary in connection with the sale of the
Notes or the Series 2015 Bonds, the
Director of Finance is authorized to
prepare or cause to be prepared on
behalf of the City an Official Statement with respect to the Notes or the
Series 2015 Bonds, as the case may be,
and any necessary supplements and
to authorize the use and distribution
of each Official Statement and any
supplements. The Director of Finance
is authorized to sign on behalf of the
City and in her official capacity each
Official Statement and any supplements approved by her. The Director
of Finance is authorized to sign and
deliver on behalf of the City and in
her official capacity such certificates
in connection with the accuracy of
each Official Statement and any supplements as may, in her judgment, be
necessary or appropriate. The Director of Finance is also authorized to
determine and certify on behalf of the
City that such disclosure document is
“deemed final” by the City within the
meaning of Securities and Exchange
Commission Rule 15c2-12 the “SEC

January 21, 2015
Rule.” The Director of Finance is
authorized to contract for services for
the production and distribution of preliminary and final Official Statements, including by printed and electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time of
the Notes or the Series 2015 Bonds, the
City agrees, in accordance with, and
as the only obligated person with
respect to the Notes and the Series
2015 Bonds under the SEC Rule, to
provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for that
purpose, and thereby to implement
that agreement, including provisions
for enforcement, amendment and termination, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare, or cause to be
prepared, and to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City, a
continuing disclosure agreement or
certificate, which shall constitute the
continuing
disclosure
agreement
made by the City for the benefit of the
holders and beneficial owners of the
Notes or the Series 2015 Bonds, as the
case may be, in accordance with the
SEC Rule. The performance of that
agreement shall be subject to the
availability of funds and their annual
appropriation to meet costs the City
would be required to incur to perform
it. The Director of Finance is further
authorized to establish procedures in
order to ensure compliance by the
City with its continuing disclosure
agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices.
Section 10. Federal Tax Considerations. The City covenants that it will
use, and will restrict the use and
investment of, the proceeds of the
Series 2015 Bonds and any Notes in
such manner and to such extent as
may be necessary so that (i)  the
Series 2015 Bonds and any Notes will
not (A) constitute private activity
bonds or arbitrage bonds under Sections 141 or 148 of the Internal Revenue Code of l986, as amended (the
“Code”) or (B) be treated other than
as bonds the interest on which is
excluded from gross income under
Section 103 of the Code, and (ii) the
interest on the Series 2015 Bonds and
any Notes will not be an item of tax
preference under Section 57 of the
Code.
The City further covenants that (i)
it will take or cause to be taken such
actions that may be required of it for
the interest on the Series 2015 Bonds
and any Notes to be and remain
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, (ii) it will not
take or authorize to be taken any
actions that would adversely affect
that exclusion, and (iii) it, or persons
acting for it, will, among other acts of
compliance, (A) apply the proceeds of
the Series 2015 Bonds and any Notes to
the governmental purpose of the borrowing, (B) restrict the yield on
investment property, (C) make timely
and adequate payments to the federal
government, (D) maintain books and
records and make calculations and
reports and (E) refrain from certain
uses of those proceeds, and, as applicable, of property financed with such
proceeds, all in such manner and to
the extent necessary to assure such
exclusion of that interest under the
Code.

other officer of the City having
responsibility for issuance of the
Series 2015 Bonds and any Notes is

Section 11. Credit Facilities and
Ratings. If the Director of Finance
determines it to be in the best interests of the City, based on the written

insurance policy, letter of credit,
standby bond purchase agreement or
other credit enhancement instrument
as further security for the payment
when due of the principal of and interest on all or any portion of the Series
2015 Bonds or any Notes (a “Credit
Support Instrument”). The Director of

Series 2015 Bonds or Notes from one or
more nationally recognized rating
organizations, and do any and all
things and take any and all actions
required to secure a Credit Support
Instrument and/or a rating or ratings
on the Series 2015 Bonds or Notes. The

containing
terms not materially inconsistent
with this Ordinance or the Indenture.
The expenditure of the amounts necessary to secure Credit Support
Instruments or obtain those ratings is
authorized and approved, and the
Director of Finance is authorized to
provide for the payment of any such
amounts from the proceeds of the
Series 2015 Bonds or Notes to the
