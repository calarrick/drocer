Project Description:
To build off of the success of Phase I,
First Interstate Properties, Ltd. is
ready to move forward with the Phase
II expansion of Steelyard Commons.
Phase II will be located on the empty
19.5 acre parcel at Steelyard Commons

The first installment (or Phase IIA)
will add 90,000 SF of retail space in
which they have secured leases from
several tenants, including the anchor
tenant that will occupy 70,000 SF. The
total budget for this portion of Phase
II is $24.2M. Construction is expected
to begin in Summer 2013. This initial
development is expected to create 140
jobs with an estimated 110 going to
Cleveland residents. Conservative
projections call for sales of $20M per
year. The rest of Phase II is expected
to be completed in 2019 and will add
another 160 jobs, with an additional
107,000 SF in retail space. The preliminary budget of Phase IIB is $21.5M.
In order for this project to move forward and for the city to experience
the many benefits this expansion will
bring, the Borrower needs assistance
from the City of Cleveland. This
expansion will not happen without
assistance from the City of Cleveland.
Proposed City Assistance:

Development

extend the life of the existing TIF

TIF, Economic Development will
amend the existing TIF agreement
to divert $300,000 per year from the
non-school portion to be made
available to the Borrower to support Bonds to help finance Phase
II.
• Economic Development will pull
out the Phase II parcel (008-37-005)
from the existing TIF by amending
the existing TIF ordinance. (parcel 008-37-005 will be split as part of
this project)
City Requirements:
• Not subject to the Fair Employment Wage Law since retail jobs
are being created.
• Subject to the Fannie M. Lewis
Cleveland Resident Employment
Law due to construction exceeding
$100,000.
• Subject to MBE/FBE/CSB due to
