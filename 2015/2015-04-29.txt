No. 567-14, passed 5-19-14, relating to
the Energy Adjustment Charge.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes

Section 523.21 Energy Adjustment

may be applied to the rates prescribed
in Sections 523.02 to 523.065 and any
other rate schedule as may be adopted
by the City.
(b) The incremental charge shall
be based on the fuel and purchase
power cost per kilowatt hour delivered calculated under divisions
(c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.

The City Record
(c) (1) The fuel and purchase
power cost per kilowatt hour sold to
residential ratepayers shall be determined by dividing the sum of the cost
of the kilowatt hours purchased from
the Power Authority of the State of
New York and the average cost of
kilowatt hours purchased from other
sources needed to supply the residential customers by the total kilowatt
hours distributed to residential customers. The incremental charge calculated herein shall be adjusted by
subtracting fifteen (15) mils per kilowatt hour for residential customers
who provide the Division of Cleveland
Public Power with a certificate of
reduction of taxes obtained pursuant
to the Homestead Exemption provisions of Sections 323.151 through
323.157 of the Revised Code, and nine
and three-quarters (9.75) mils per
kilowatt hour for all other residential
customers.
(2) Except as provided in Section
523.048, the fuel and purchase power
cost per kilowatt hour sold to all
ratepayers, other than residential
ratepayers, during the twelve (12)
months of the year, shall be determined by dividing the sum of the total
cost of coal, oil, gas and purchase
power by the total kilowatt hours distributed, except that the computation
shall exclude the cost of PASNY
power and the amount of PASNY
power allocable to kilowatt hours distributed, and shall exclude the costs
of all purchase power and kilowatt
hours from a specific source or
sources purchased by the Division for
distribution to ratepayers pursuant to
Sections 523.048 and 523.049. The
incremental charge calculated herein
shall be adjusted by subtracting three
(3.0) mils per kilowatt hour.
(d) The costs of the Division’s energy efficiency and conservation programs may be included in the calculation of the applicable power and
transmission charges.
(e) At the end of each month, the
Division of Cleveland Public Power
shall determine the actual fuel and
power costs during such month as
herein provided and may adjust the
additional incremental charge for
future months to defer or over-recover
the total cost of power in order to stabilize customer bills.
Section 5. That Section 523.21 of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, as amended by Ordinance
No. 567-14, passed May 19, 2014, is

Brady, J. Johnson, Cleveland, Kelley,
Zone, Cummins and Mitchell.
An emergency resolution supporting marriage equality and the work
of Why Marriage Matters Ohio.

598

April 29, 2015
Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
host of the 2014 Gay Games, is home
to a culturally diverse population
who prides itself on its inclusiveness, is one of the first cities in the
region to have a domestic partnership registry, and is committed to
continued social progress, celebrating the great diversity of our community; and
Whereas, Why Marriage Matters
Ohio is working to open the hearts
and minds of all Ohioans to the
importance of allowing all loving,
committed couples to legally marry;
Whereas,
the
United
States
Supreme Court has ruled that marriage is one of the basic civil rights
of the American people, fundamental to our very existence and survival; and
Whereas, in 1974, the Supreme
Court declared that: “This court has
long recognized that freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage
and family life is one of the liberties protected by the [Constitution]”;
and
Whereas,
marriages
that
are
deemed legally valid by the federal
and state governments provide the
married couple with more than 1,000
federal rights, privileges, economic
advantages and legal protections,
including access to health care,
inheritance of social security benefits and eligibility for significant
taxation advantages; and
Whereas, protections afforded to
each spouse in a legal marriage
include protection of their parental
relationship with their children, protection of the inheritance rights of
their spouse and children, ensuring
hospital visitation rights and the
ability to make medical decisions
for their spouse, and protection of
property rights; and
Whereas, without being declared
legally valid, the spouses of samesex marriages cannot receive these
rights, privileges, advantages and
protections; and
Whereas, recent national polls
show that a majority of Americans
now
believe
same-sex
marriage
should be recognized by law as
valid; and
Whereas, thirty-seven states and
the District of Colombia in this
nation have legalized marriage for
same-sex couples; and
Whereas, in 2013, the Supreme
Court ruled Section 3 of the Defense
of Marriage Act (“DOMA”) as unconstitutional under the Due Process
Clause of the Fifth Amendment; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that every Ohioan should be allowed
to marry the person they love, and
fully endorses the efforts of Why
Marriage Matters Ohio.
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports marriage equality and the work
of Why Marriage Matters Ohio.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit a copy of this
resolution to Chris Geggie, Executive
Director, Why Marriage Matters Ohio
and Alana Jochum, Equality Ohio.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all

April 29, 2015
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.

By Council Members Cummins,
Zone, Brancatelli and Reed.
An emergency resolution supporting the renewal of the Cuyahoga
County Arts and Culture tax and urging the Cuyahoga County Council to
place the renewal referendum on the
November ballot.
Whereas, the Cuyahoga County
Arts and Culture tax, a 10-year, 30cents
per
cigarette
pack
tax
approved by voters in 2006, will
expire at the end of 2016; and
Whereas, the board of trustees of
Cuyahoga Arts and Culture will vote
on a resolution asking the County
Council to place a referendum for
renewal of the Cuyahoga County
Arts and Culture tax on the November ballot; and
Whereas, the renewal tax must
gain approval from the County
Council
and
County
Executive
Armond Budish in order to be placed
on the November ballot; and
Whereas, many arts and cultural
across
Cuyahoga
organizations
County receive annual operating
grants from the tax, making up significant portions of their budgets;
and
Whereas,
if
this
tax
is
not
renewed, revenue for these arts and
cultural organizations would disappear after 2017; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,

Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby
supports the renewal of the Cuyahoga
County Arts and Culture tax and

to place the renewal referendum on
