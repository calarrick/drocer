legislation adopted by City Council in
accordance with the provisions of this
section. Each Home Entrepreneur
Residence District shall be shown on
the Zoning Map of the City of Cleveland as a residential district.

Saturday;
ii. Parking. One parking space is
required for each dwelling unit;
accessory uses shall not require additional off-street parking;
iii. Signs or Accessory Business
Uses. In the Home Entrepreneur Residence District, a business or home
occupation permitted as an accessory
use may be identified by means of a
permitted nameplate sign. Such sign
may be displayed as either a wall or
window sign not exceeding six
square feet in area. These signs shall

The City Record
be non-illuminated. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have no authority
to grant a variance for any sign that
deviates from these specifically designated standards.
iv. Employees. Not more than three
non-resident employees shall work at
any one time in home occupations
located in a particular residential
unit.

ii. Drug stores;
iii. Banks; and
iv. Dry cleaners and laundries.
(2) All other uses permitted and as
regulated in a Two-Family District.
