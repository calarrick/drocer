PUBLIC NOTICE
DATE OF PUBLIC NOTICE:
JANUARY 6, 2015
OHIO ENVIRONMENTAL
PROTECTION AGENCY,
DIVISION OF SURFACE WATER

NOTICE OF RECEIPT OF
401 APPLICATION AND
PUBLIC HEARING
Public notice is hereby given that
the Ohio Environmental Protection
Agency (Ohio EPA) Division of Surface Water (DSW) has received an

30

application for, and has begun to
consider whether to issue or deny, a
Clean Water Act Section 401 water
quality certification for a project to
perform the annual maintenance
dredging in the Cleveland Harbor
Federal navigation channels. The
application was submitted by the
U.S.
Army
Corps
of
Engineers
(USACE),
Buffalo
District.
This
year’s dredging will take place
within the Cuyahoga River, and in
Cleveland Harbor, which is located
at the mouth of the Cuyahoga River.
The Buffalo District Corps of Engineers Public Notice Number for this
project is CLEVELAND-15. The Ohio
EPA ID Number for this project is
144574.
As required by the Anti-degradation Rule, 3745-1-05, of the Ohio
Administrative Code (OAC), three
alternatives have been submitted for
the project. The applicant’s proposed
preferred alternative, if approved,
would entail the dredging of an estimated 475,000 cubic yards of material, with placement of 295,000 cubic
yards of the dredged material at the
existing Cleveland Harbor CDFs
and 180,000 cubic yards going to a
new open-lake disposal area in Lake
Erie (CLA-1). The applicant’s proposed minimal degradation alternative, if approved, would entail the
dredging of an estimated 225,000
cubic yards of material, with placement of 45,000 cubic yards of the
dredged material at the existing
Cleveland Harbor CDFs and 180,000
cubic yards going to a new openlake disposal areas in Lake Erie
(CLA-1). The applicant’s proposed
non-degradation
alternative,
if
approved, would have no direct
impacts on waters of the state.
Discharges from the activity, if
approved, would result in degradation to, or lowering of, the water
quality of the Cuyahoga River and
Lake Erie. Ohio EPA will review
the application, and decide whether
to grant or deny the application, in
accordance with OAC Chapters 37451 and 3745-32. In accordance with
OAC rule 3745-1-05, an anti-degradation review of the application will
be
conducted
before
deciding
whether to allow a lowering of
water quality. All three proposed
alternatives will be considered during the review process. No exclusions or waivers, as outlined by OAC
rule 3745-1-05, apply or may be
granted.
Starting January 6, 2015, copies of
the application and technical support information may be inspected
on Ohio EPA-DSW website:
www.epa.ohio.gov/dsw
Ohio EPA will hold a public information session and public hearing
relative to issues of lower water
quality on February 24, 2015 at 6:00
p.m. at the Cleveland Metroparks’
Watershed Stewardship Center at
West Creek, 2277 West Ridgewood
Drive, Parma, OH 44134. The public
hearing will end when all interested parties have had an opportunity
to provide testimony related to the
project.
All interested persons are entitled
to attend or be represented and give
written or oral comments on the proposed project. The purpose of the
hearing is to obtain additional information that will be considered by
Ohio EPA prior to any further
action on the application.

January 14, 2015
Ohio EPA will continue to accept
written comments on the application
through the close of business on
March 3, 2015. Comments received
after this date may not be considered as part of the official record of
the hearing. Anyone may submit
written comments or requests to be
placed on a mailing list for information by writing to: Ohio EPADSW, Attention: Permits Processing
Unit, P.O. Box 1049, Columbus, Ohio

Whereas, Cleveland City Council
has recognized the need for affordable housing in our neighborhoods;
and
Whereas, the Catholic Charities
Housing Corporation has developed
a comprehensive plan to identify
those areas that would be appropriate for housing developments for
seniors; and
Whereas, the Catholic Charities
Housing Corporation has proposed
the new construction of up to 40
units in a three story elevator building comprised of one and two bedroom units designed to accommodate
and will be affordable to seniors;
and
Whereas, the development will
meet the Enterprise Green Communities Version 3.0 criteria or LEED
Certification
by
the

Green
Building Council, and will also
include amenities such as community gathering space, laundry facilities, green space and parking; and
Whereas, Catholic Charities Housing Corporation will apply for funding under the Low Income Housing
Tax Credit Program and the City of
Cleveland Housing Trust Fund; and
Whereas, the proposal involves
utilizing an under-used parking lot,
including demolition of two structures which are no longer in use;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the efforts of Catholic Charities
Housing Corporation to develop a

units on the campus of St. Vincent de
Paul Parish located at 13400 Lorain

Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all

Res. No. 25-15.
By Council Member Brancatelli.
An emergency resolution declaring
this Council’s support of the Cleveland Housing Network Inc.’s application to the Ohio Housing Finance
Agency for low-income housing tax
credits for the Slavic Village Green
Homes I project.

14
Whereas, each year the Ohio

low-income

for
affordable
housing
developments
throughout Ohio using a competitive
proposal process; and
Whereas, the Cleveland City Council has recognized the need to maintain affordable housing in Cleveland’s neighborhoods; and
Whereas, Slavic Village Green

support the existing housing investment within the Slavic Village
neighborhood, including Opportunity
Housing, a for-sale market rate project, Cleveland Green Homes, Cleveland Green Homes East, Cleveland
Green Homes II, Cleveland NSP
Homes I, Cleveland Green Homes
III, Trailside Homes and Habitat for
Humanity homes; and
Whereas, Slavic Village is nationally recognized as the epicenter of
the national home mortgage foreclosure crisis that continues to hit
Ohio, and in particular, the City of
Cleveland; and
Whereas, working together for
over 30 years, Cleveland Housing
Network, Inc. and its non-profit
development partners and the City
of Cleveland have demonstrated the
ability to use tax credits to leverage
local resources and complete successful projects that meet community development objectives concerning vacant properties and provide
needed affordable housing to lowincome families; and
Whereas, in the current environment of large numbers of vacant
single family homes, a weak homeownership market, and an increasing poverty rate, this tool is needed
more than ever; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
remains committed to a continued
partnership
with
the
Cleveland
Housing Network Inc. and the development of Slavic Village Green
Homes I project, as we work together to address the foreclosure crisis
and meet the needs of our low
income families for decent affordable housing; and

immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports Cleveland Housing Network
Inc.’s application to the Ohio Housing
Finance Agency for low-income housing tax credits for the Slavic Village

state; and

constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Division of
Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;

substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good

in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
