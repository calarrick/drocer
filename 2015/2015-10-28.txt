this Chapter. If approved, the Director may accept the painting of
designs on the pavement of City
streets as a donation.

be made to the Director of Capital
Projects upon a form provided by the

received by the Director. If the notification to the Director is in the nature
of a comment rather than an objection, then the Councilmember(s) shall
have an additional fifteen (15) days
in which to submit an objection.

The Director, consistent with the
provisions of this Chapter, shall
establish rules and regulations as the

this Chapter.

design as approved for as long as the
design exists, as long as the design

maintained as required under the provisions of this Chapter. A request to
