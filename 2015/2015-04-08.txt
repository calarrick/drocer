Res. No. 364-15.
By Council Members Brady, Cummins, Reed, Mitchell, Polensek, Cimperman, J. Johnson, Conwell, Keane,
Kazy, Pruitt, Dow, Zone, Brancatelli,
Cleveland, and Kelley.
An emergency resolution urging
the U.S. Congress to consider adding

446

April 8, 2015
to The Affordable Care Act, provisions for affordable and effective
long term care insurance for the
increasing senior population in the
United States.
Whereas, long-term care (LTC) is
the help someone needs if he or she
is no longer able to care for him or
herself because of, for example, prolonged physical illness, a disability
or
cognitive
impairment
like
Alzheimer’s disease; and
Whereas, LTC may be provided in
a variety of settings, including nursing home care, home health care,
respite care, hospice care, adult day
care and assisted living facility
care; and
Whereas, neither Medicare nor traditional health insurance plans will
cover most costs of LTC; and
Whereas, the costs of LTC depend
on the level of care needed, where
it is given and for how long; inhome care can be up to $50/hour;
nursing home care in Ohio can cost
more than $200/day; and
Whereas, recent federal figures
show: Medicaid pays about
of all
nursing home costs; patients pay
out-of-pocket
for
about
40%;
Medicare pays about 10%; and
Whereas, LTC insurance policies
cover specific care, but you still
need Medicare and/or private health
insurance because LTC insurance
generally does not pay other medical or hospital bills; and
Whereas, LTC insurance may be
one of the most expensive policies a
person will ever purchase; a premium will be more than $1,000/year for
a person age 65 or older and is
expected to increase in the future;
and
Whereas, Medicaid will pay for
LTC when you no longer have the
resources to pay your own bills; and
Whereas, baby boomers continue
to age so that by 2029, when the last
round of boomers reaches retirement
age, the number of Americans 65 or
older will reach more than 71 million – a 73% increase from 2011; and
Whereas, this increase in seniors
in the United States who will need
LTC necessitates that the federal
government find a way to provide
for affordable and effective longterm health care; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the U.S. Congress to consider adding
to The Affordable Care Act, provisions for affordable and effective
long term care insurance for the
increasing senior population in the
United States.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit copies
of this resolution to President Barack
Obama, Secretary of Health and
Human Services Sylvia Mathews Burwell and all members of the United
States Congress.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
