Storer
Avenue (Ward 14)
Eric Poole, owner, proposes to

and noise be confined to the premises and the lot upon which the kennel is located is greater than one
hundred feet from a residence district and this property abuts a residential district.
2. Section 352.07 which states that
the property is non-conforming in
regards to required landscaping: a
ten (10) foot wide landscape transition strip providing 75% year round
opacity is required where property
abuts a residential district: none are
proposed. The Board of Zoning
Appeals must determine whether the
nonconforming
landscaping
may
continue. (Filed April 1, 2015)

An emergency ordinance authorizing the submission to the electors of
the City of Cleveland of a proposal to
amend Sections 131 and 133 of the
Charter of the City of Cleveland relating to civil service appointments and
promotions wherever practicable.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the immediate preservation of the
public peace, property, health or safety in that it must be certified to the
election authorities immediately in
order for the question to appear at a
special municipal election to be held
on November 3, 2015 and providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council authorizes the submission to the electors of
the City of Cleveland at a special
municipal election to be held at the
usual places of voting in the City of
Cleveland on Tuesday, November 3,
2015, of a proposal to amend the Charter of the City of Cleveland by amending existing Sections 131 and 133 to
read as follows:
Section 131. Appointments
When any position in the classified
service, except the general labor
class, is to be filled, the appointing
authority shall notify the Commission
of the fact and the Commission shall
certify to the authority the names and
addresses of the ten candidates standing highest on the eligible list for the
class or grade to which that position
belongs. The appointing authority
shall appoint to that position one of
the ten persons whose names are certified. When the eligible list contains
less than ten names, those names
shall be certified, from which the
appointing authority may appoint one
for that position. A person certified
from the eligible list more than four
times to the same appointing authority for a position of the same or similar
classification may be omitted from
future certification, but certification
for a temporary appointment shall not
be counted as one of the certifications.
When any position in the general
labor class is to be filled, the appointing authority shall notify the Commission of that fact, and the number
to be appointed whereupon the Commission shall certify to the appointing officer the names and addresses
of twice the number of candidates
required to fill the position or positions in the order of their standing on
the appropriate eligible list. The
appointing officer shall, without
restriction as to order, appoint to the

1259

47
position or positions from among the
candidates so certified. The name of a
person, not selected for appointment,
whose standing on the eligible list is
above the names of the last person
appointed from that certification,
shall not be again certified, except
upon request, to the same appointing
officer. The name of a person not
selected for appointment, after being
certified to two separate appointing
officers shall not again, except upon
request of an appointing officer, be
certified, but certification for a temporary appointment shall not be
counted as one of the certifications.
All
original
and
promotional
appointments shall be for a probationary period of not to exceed six months
to be fixed by the rules of the Commission, and no appointment or promotion shall be deemed finally made
until the appointee has satisfactorily
served his or her probationary period.
At the end of the probationary period,
the appointing officer shall transmit
to the Commission a record of the
employee’s service certifying that the
service has been satisfactory or
unsatisfactory and if the service is
unsatisfactory, the employee may,
with the approval of the Commission,
be removed or reduced without
restriction; but dismissal or reduction
may be made during that period, as is
provided for in Section  121  of the
Charter.
When no eligible list for a position
exists, or when the eligible list has
become exhausted and until a new list
can be created, names may be certified from the eligible list most nearly
appropriate to the position to be
filled.
Section 133 Promotions Wherever
Practicable
Wherever practicable, vacancies
shall be filled by promotion. Any
advancement in rank or increase in
salary beyond the limits fixed for the
grade shall constitute a promotion.
Lists shall be created and promotions
made therefrom of candidates in the
same manner as in original appointments, except that the Commission
shall certify the names and addresses
of the three candidates standing highest on the eligible list for the class or
grade to which the promotional position belongs and the appointing
authority shall appoint one of the
three persons whose names are certified; and provided, however, that less
than three shall constitute an eligible
list, and the appointing authority
shall appoint from the eligible list.
Section 2. That the foregoing proposed amendments to the Charter, on
receiving at least a majority of the
votes cast at the November 3, 2015 special municipal election, shall become
effective immediately on their adoption.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council
is authorized to promptly forward a
certified copy of this ordinance to the
Board of Elections of Cuyahoga County.
Section 4. That the Board of Elections of Cuyahoga County shall cause
an appropriate notice to be given of
the election to be held on November 3,
2015, on the foregoing amendments to
the Charter of this City and otherwise
to provide for the election in the manner provided by the general laws of
the State of Ohio.
Section 5. That the Clerk of Council
is authorized to cause the full text of
the proposed amendments to the Charter to be published once a week for
two consecutive weeks in a newspaper published in the City of Cleveland, with the first publication to be

Article XVIII, Section 9 of the Constitution of the State of Ohio, Section
731.211 of the Revised Code, and Section 200 of the Charter of the City of
Cleveland.

the amendments shall read as follows:
PROPOSED CHARTER
AMENDMENT
CITY OF CLEVELAND

authority the names and addresses of
the ten candidates that are highest on
the eligible list for the class or grade
to which the position belongs; 2) the
appointing authority shall appoint to
that position one of the ten persons
whose names are certified for that
position; 3) when the eligible list contains less than ten names, then all of

addresses of the three candidates
standing highest on the eligible list
for the class or grade to which the promotional position belongs and the
