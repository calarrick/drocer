City Assistance:
Non-School TIF (City Debt Reserve)
Project Background
Hemingway Development has proposed to purchase and develop the
City-owned property at E. 59th Street
and Euclid Avenue and E. 61st Street
and Chester Avenue for the development of the MidTown Urban Medical
Campus.
Hemingway’s
proposed
development of over 140,000 square
feet of new mixed-use space will complement the University Hospitals
development on the neighboring site.
This development team brings
strong expertise in real estate development and environmental sustainability. Hemingway’s three main
partners have developed over 32 million square feet of design/build
office, warehouse, and industrial
space. Hemingway is committed to
the concept of responsible environmental design, and the company recycles over 80% of its construction
waste. Many of Hemingway’s projects over the last 5 years have
focused on the Midtown neighborhood
of the City, including Midtown Tech
Park, and have been catalytic projects to the overall synergy of the corridor. Hemingway is confident the
market will support additional space.
