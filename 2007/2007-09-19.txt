An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Public Service to
make alterations and modifications
in Contract No. 85504 with Fabrizi
Trucking and Paving for improvements to Jennings Road from Spring
Road to the Jennings Freeway
Ramp, for the Department of Public
Service.

Section 1. That the Director of
Public Service is authorized to make
the following alterations and modifications in Contract No. 85504 with
Fabrizi Trucking and Paving for
improvements to Jennings Road to
the Jennings Freeway Ramp, for the
Department of Public Service:
Subsidiary Additions
1. This project was designed in
conjunction with The towpath trail
initiative which follows Jennings

September 19, 2007
Rd. from Crestline Ave. to Harvard
Ave. A bike lane and sidewalk are
in place to convey the towpath traffic along Jennings Rd. However, a
means
of
conveying
pedestrians
from the Jennings Rd. section to the
Harvard Ave. bridge was overlooked
during design. In order to complete
this aspect of the Jennings Rd. Project, 1100 ft of new sidewalk on the
south side of Harvard Ave. is required.
Estimated cost:
$ 35,000.00
2. The draining near Bradley Rd.
does
not
function
properly
as
designed and installed. Two additional catch basins are necessary on
the east side of Jennings north of
Bradley Rd. in order to handle the
expected flow. Also, the existing
catch basin behind the sidewalk on
the west side of Jennings Rd. near
Bradley
needs
improvements
in
order to alleviate occasional flooding during heavy rain due to a large
runoff area. A new 24" lateral and
a new high capacity inlet grate are
required in order to handle the
expected flow.
Estimated cost:
$ 30,072.00
3. As W. 11th approaches Jennings
Rd., it descends a steep hill. The profile of this hill as designed resulted
in a large grade break at the intersection with Jennings and did not
allow for safe vehicle passage. A revised design was received for this
area from the Consultant and in
order to construct this transition
properly, the limits of construction
need to extend further up the hill
on W. 11th St. Additional layout, excavation and pavement will be necessary to construct In accordance with
the revised design.
Estimated cost:
$ 35,000.00
TOTAL SUBSIDIARY
ADDITIONS
$ 100,072.00
Original Contract Amount $4,436,785.35
Total Subsidiary Additions +100,072.00
REVISED CONTRACT
AMOUNT
$4,536,857.35
which alteration has been recommended in writing by the Director
of Public Service, countersigned by
the Mayor, and consented to by the
surety on the contract, which price
to be paid has been agreed on in
writing and signed by the Director
of Public Service and the Contractor. This alteration will cause an
increase in the amount of the original
contract
in
the
sum
of
$100,072.00, payable from Fund Nos.
20 SF 364, 20 SF 373, 20 SF 380, 20

500, 20 SF 506 and 20 SF 510,
Request No. 175436.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency resolution congratulating the people of our Sister City
of Bahir Dar, Ethiopia, and the
Amhara National Regional State on
the occasion of the second millennium of Ethiopia on September 12,
2007.
Whereas, Ethiopia is a proud
country with a long, rich history;
and
Whereas,
the
earliest
known
hominid, internationally known as
Lucy and classified as Australopithecus Afarensis, was found in
Ethiopia by a team from the Cleveland Museum of Natural History in
1974; and
Whereas, Ethiopia is the only
country in Africa that was never
colonized, with the exception of the
5 years of occupation by the government of Italy; and
Whereas, legend is written of the
Queen of Sheba, known as Maq’da
in Ethiopia, who journeyed to visit
King Solomon, returned to Ethiopia
and gave birth to Solomon’s son who
subsequently became the first Emperor of Ethiopia, Menelik I; and
Whereas, in 330 A.D. Ethiopia was
proclaimed a Christian empire; and
Whereas,
in
the
9th
century
Ethiopians discovered coffee in the
region called Kaffa; and
Whereas,
the
first
Christian
Monastery on Lake Tana, Ethiopia’s
largest lake, was the island church
of Sana Qirqos founded during the
latter part of the 13th century; and
Whereas, in 1889 King Menelik II
of Shoa became Emperor of Ethiopia
and ruled until 1913 with the able
assistance of his wife, Empress
Taytu; and

Whereas, the proud and courageous people of Ethiopia under
Menelik II and Taytu defeated the
invading Italian army in the Battle
of Adwa in 1896; and
Whereas, United States-Ethiopian
relations were established on December 27, 1903, by Emperor Menelik and President Theodore Roosevelt; and
Whereas, in 1930, Ras Tafari
Mekonnen was crowned as Emperor
Haile Selassie of Ethiopia; and
Whereas, Emperor Haile Selassie
modernized
Ethiopia,
kept
the
country united and largely peaceful; and
Whereas, Ethiopia played a pivotal role in creating the Organization of African Unity (OAU), which
was founded on May 25, 1963; and
Whereas, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,
became the headquarters of the OAU
and remains the headquarters of its
successor, the African Union; and
Whereas, in 1974, Emperor Haile
Selassie was ousted from power
through a military junta known as
the Derg; and
Whereas, in May 1991, the brutal
dictatorship of the Derg came to an
end after a 17-year reign of terror;
and
Whereas, since then, the Ethiopian-American community has grown
to become the second largest African immigrant group in the United
States; and
Whereas, the capital of the Amhara National Regional State of
Ethiopia is the beautiful City of
Bahir Dar, on the southern shore of
Lake Tana; and
Whereas, the City of Bahir Dar
arose in the middle ages around St
George Orthodox Church from a
cluster of previously pagan villages
along the shore of Lake Tana, situated at the mouth of the famous
Abay River (Blue Nile), with the
thunderous Tis Abay (Blue Nile
Falls) 30 km downstream; and
Whereas, the City has 26 medieval
island and lakeside Orthodox church
monasteries,
beautifully
painted
with the lives of the saints, surviving to this day in continual use –
living ‘museums’ of the rich heritage of Ethiopia; and
Whereas, it is home to the Waito
people who continue to build the
Nile reed boats, known as ‘Tanqua’,
which have been in constant use on
the Nile River and Lake Tana since
antiquity; and
Whereas, the City began a period
of modernization during the bitterly
resisted Italian occupation of 193641; and was home to Belay Zallaqa,
a charismatic leader of the resistance against the Italian occupation,
whose statue stands in the center of
Bahir Dar; and
Whereas, Bahir Dar has a current
population of 250,000 with an annual growth rate of over 7%, and has
a fully developed Mayoral and City
Council Government, with a recently completed Bahir Dar Integrated
Development Plan; and
Whereas, it is a destination and
hub of the popular Ethiopian Historical Route Tour; and
Whereas, it is home of Bahir Dar
University, founded in 1999 by the
union of the School of Pedagogy and
the Polytechnic Institute, now with

1742

September 19, 2007
a fulltime student enrollment of
over 15,000 and faculty of almost
900; and
Whereas, the City of Bahir Dar
became a sister city to Cleveland,
Ohio, also on the southern shore of
a great inland lake, on July 21, 2004,
with the visit of a traditional delegation of 12 Ethiopians from Bahir
Dar who participated in the signing
of a sister city covenant dedicated
to commercial, educational, cultural,
and humanitarian development and
exchange, and;
Whereas, it is home of the newly
designated Abay (Blue Nile) Millennium Riverside Park, 30 km in
length, on both sides of the river,
commissioned by Regional President
Ayalew Gobeze, to be developed and
supervised
by
the
municipality
under Mayor Yayeh Addis for environmental restoration and recreational development; and
Whereas, Bahir Dar is a cheerful
and relaxing city to stay in, combining the bustle of city life with
the gentler pace of the rural suburbs, and
Whereas, the 8th African Union
Summit, held from January 29-30,
2007, officially declared the second
Ethiopian Millennium as the second
African Millennium; and
Whereas, this Council congratulates the people of Bahir Dar, the
Amhara National Regional State,
and Ethiopia on the second millennium of Ethiopia, and recognizes
the long rich history of Ethiopia;
Whereas, this Council commends
Ethiopia’s contribution to peace and
stability on the African continent
through the role it played in the creation of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU);
Whereas, this Council recognizes
the longstanding relationship between Ethiopia and the United
States, and recognizes the unique
sister-city
relationship
between
Bahir Dar, Ethiopia and Cleveland,
Ohio; and
Whereas, this Council wishes for
a peaceful and jubilant celebration
of the second millennium in Bahir
Dar and throughout Ethiopia; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council congratulates the people of our Sister
City of Bahir Dar, Ethiopia, and the
Amhara National Regional State on
the occasion of the second millennium of Ethiopia on September 12,
2007.

Res. No. 1437-07.
By Council Members Coats and
Cummins.
An emergency resolution calling
upon the Ohio General Assembly to
create and support legislation to
offer educational assistance to all
Ohio veterans.
Whereas, many veterans currently
serving our country have put their
college educations on hold until
returning from active duty; and
Whereas, by law in Ohio, public
and private colleges and universities are required to grant leave to
students called to active duty and to
either refund or offer credit for
tuition paid; and
Whereas, with the exception of
the Ohio National Guard, which
offers 100% tuition assistance, the
State of Ohio does not offer any
assistance to its active duty veterans to obtain higher education; and
Whereas, many other states, including Texas, Minnesota, Wisconsin and New York, offer monetary
assistance to its active duty veterans to pursue a college education,
which
assistance
often
includes
100% tuition payment; and
Whereas, these and other states
help fill the gap left by federal
assistance in aiding veterans to
achieve a higher education; and
Whereas, it is only right that the
State of Ohio come to the assistance
of its veterans seeking a college
education;
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby calls upon the Ohio General
Assembly to create and support legislation to offer educational assistance to all Ohio veterans.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
all members of the Ohio General
Assembly.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted September 10, 2007.
Effective September 12, 2007.

Res. No. 1438-07.
By Council Members Pierce Scott
and Cummins.
An emergency resolution supporting the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA) that instructs the Federal Reserve Board
to protect consumers from predatory
lending.

The City Record
Whereas, the sub-prime lending
industry has grown rapidly in Cleveland during the last few years; and
Whereas, some mortgage brokers
and sub-prime lenders aggressively
market high-cost home loans that
borrowers are unable to repay and
engage in other unfair credit practices that strip retirees and working
families of the equity they have in
their homes; and
Whereas, approximately 80% of
sub-prime loans have adjustable
interest rates that will increase
after two years;
Whereas, sub-prime lenders have
made these adjustable rates mortgages without regard for whether
the borrower will be able to afford
the payments after the rate increases;
Whereas, many borrowers with
adjustable
rate
sub-prime
loans
were never given a choice between
an adjustable or fixed rate or were
promised a fixed rate but given an
adjustable rate;
Whereas, approximately 70% of
the sub-prime loans were refinancing loans for families who had
already bought a home; and
Whereas, more than two-thirds of
sub-prime loans have prepayment
penalties, compared to just 2% of
prime loans
Whereas,
prepayment
penalties
trap borrowers into sub-prime loans
with high or adjustable rates and
strip their equity; and
Whereas, less than half of all subprime loans include taxes and insurance in the monthly payment; and
Whereas, many borrowers of subprime loans want to have their
taxes and insurance included in
their monthly payment, and many
borrowers have been mislead to
believe their payment includes taxes
and insurance; and
Whereas, many borrowers end up
in foreclosure when they have to
make a lump sum payment of their
taxes and insurance; and
Whereas, these practices are commonly referred to as “predatory
lending”; and
Whereas, these predatory loans
have led to an increase in foreclosure rates which hurts the families
who are losing their homes as well
as the neighborhoods where there
are a concentration of foreclosed
homes; and
Whereas,
these
vacant
homes
attract crime and cost Cleveland
money in crime prevention and the
deterioration of neighborhoods; and
Whereas, many families have not
had an opportunity to modify their
loans to make them affordable; and
Whereas, the federal Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act
(HOEPA) instructs the Federal Reserve Board to protect consumers
from predatory lending (15 U.S.C.
§1639 (L) (2)); and
Whereas, any regulations issued
by the Federal Reserve Board would
have the same effect as law and
would cover all mortgage lenders in
the country;
Whereas, this Council calls on the
Federal Reserve Board to use its
authority to: 1) prohibit lenders
from making mortgages that quickly become unaffordable after the
interest rate increases; 2) stop the
misuse and abuse of stated income

1743

23
loans;
3)
eliminate
prepayment
penalties on subprime loans; and 4)
designate the failure to escrow
taxes and insurance in subprime
loans as an unfair and deceptive
practice; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the Home Ownership and
Equity Protection Act (HOEPA)
that instructs the Federal Reserve
Board to protect consumers from
predatory lending.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
Senator Dodd, Association of Community Organizations for Reform
Now (ACORN), and Mayor Frank
Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

with younger arrestees more likely to possess and use guns; and
Whereas, the proposed legislation will give the police another
tool to do their job and give our
citizens a stronger sense of security; and
Whereas, the proposed amendment

of 21; and
