FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTION REFERRED
Res. No. 1659-07.
By Council Members Reed, Polensek, Westbrook, Zone, White, Brancatelli and Cimperman.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Supreme Court to adopt the
Senate Bill 2 judicial reporting rule
requiring common pleas judges to
maintain a public file that includes
race and gender information of defendants sentenced for felony offenses.

The City Record
Whereas,
in
1993
the
Ohio
Supreme Court and the Ohio State
Bar Association created the Ohio
Commission on Racial Fairness to
address the perception that the justice system treats blacks and other
minorities differently from whites;
and
Whereas,
the
commission’s
research included holding public hearings around the state and surveying
hundreds of judges and thousands
of attorneys; and
Whereas, in 1995 the Ohio General Assembly passed Senate Bill 2,
which
former
Governor
George
Voinovich signed into law; and
Whereas, this criminal-sentencing
law asked the Ohio Supreme Court
to adopt a rule requiring common
pleas judges to maintain a public
file that includes the name, case
number, race, gender, ethnicity and
religion of each defendant sentenced
for a felony offense; and
Whereas, four years later in 1999,
the high court had still not adopted
the rule, and the Commission on
Racial Fairness issued an extensive
report that recommended that statistical data, including race, be kept
for all criminal sentences – whether
felony, misdemeanor, juvenile or
traffic cases; and
Whereas, with still no data collected in 2002, the Racial Fairness
Task
Force,
appointed
by
the
Supreme Court, released a “working
plan” to implement the commission’s
recommendations from 1999; and
Whereas,
the
Racial
Fairness
Task Force said that the Supreme
Court should enforce the judicial
reporting requirements of Senate
Bill 2, claiming that “this data could
provide the building blocks upon
which
self-assessment,
court-wide
assessment and sentencing reform
could be based . . . . The Supreme
Court of Ohio should place a high
priority upon the immediate implementation of these provisions”; and
Whereas, Ohio Supreme Court Chief
Justice
Thomas
Moyer
acknowledged in September 2007 that the
data collection still has not happened, stating that “there has been
a good deal of resistance to doing
it by the common pleas judges . . .
so, it’s sort of dormant”; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the Ohio Supreme Court to
adopt the Senate Bill 2 judicial
reporting rule requiring common
pleas judges to maintain a public
file that includes race and gender
information of defendants sentenced
for felony offenses.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to the Ohio Supreme
Court
Justices
and
the
Ohio
Supreme
Court
Racial
Fairness
Task Force.
Section 3. This resolution is hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

of
Facilities
must
be
replaced or restored as nearly as
may be practicable, to the condition
existing prior to performance of
work as determined by the Commissioner of Urban Forestry, except to
the extent that tree trimming is
necessary to prevent the interference of tree branches with Overhead
Facilities. If, in the opinion of the
Commissioner of Urban Forestry,
any trees cannot be replaced or
restored in the same location, an
equal number of trees shall be planted in the Public Right-of-Way at a
location or locations determined by
the
Commissioner
of
Urban
Forestry.
(2) All restoration work within
the Public Right-of-Way shall be
done under landscape plans approved by the Director.
(s) Responsibility of Owner. The
owner of the Facilities to be Constructed, Reconstructed, installed,
located,
operated,
maintained
or
repaired and, if different, the Service Provider, are responsible for
performance of and compliance with
all provisions of this Section.
Section 510.05
Location, Relocation and Removal of Facilities
(a) Location of Facilities. All
Facilities
shall
be
Constructed,
Reconstructed, installed and located
under the following guidelines and
requirements:
(1) Facilities should be installed
within an existing compatible underground duct or conduit whenever
Excess Capacity exists within the
Facility.
(2) A Service Provider registered
to install Overhead Facilities should
install its Facilities on pole attachments to existing utility poles if
Surplus Overhead Space is available.
(3) A Service Provider registered
to install Underground Facilities
should install its Facilities in space
the Service Provider currently occupies or in Surplus Underground
Space if available.
(4) Except for Overhead Facilities
as provided in this section, no AGF
or AGF Clusters shall be located
above ground in a Public Right-ofWay without a AGF Installation
Permit issued under Section 510.06.
(5) No Facilities shall be located
under ground in the Public Right-ofWay without, as applicable, a Street
Opening Permit issued under Section
503.01 or a Sidewalk Construction
Permit issued under Sections 505.04
to 505.06, as deemed appropriate by
the Director.
(b) Excess Capacity. To reduce
Excavation in the Public Right-ofWay, it is the City’s goal to encourage Service Providers to share occupancy of underground conduit as
well as to construct, whenever possible, excess conduit capacity for
occupancy of future Facilities in the
Public Right-of-Way. Therefore, if a
Service
Provider
is
constructing
underground conduit in the Public

The City Record
Right-of-Way for its own Facilities,
and the City reasonably determines
the construction is in an area in
which other Service Providers would
likely construct Facilities in the
future, the City may require, to the
extent permitted by law, the Service
Provider to construct the conduit in
the
Public
Right-of-Way
with
Excess
Capacity
in
the
Public
Right-of-Way, provided the Service
Provider shall be reimbursed for the
use of the Excess Capacity by
another Service Provider. The Service Provider may charge a reasonable market lease rate for occupancy of the additional conduit space as
reimbursement. Division (b) of this
section shall not apply where no
practical operational, engineering or
safety standards will support the
need for Excess Capacity.
(c) City Owned Conduit. If the
City owns or leases conduit in the
path of a Service Provider’s proposed Facilities, the City determines
that there is Excess Capacity in the
conduit, and provided it is technologically feasible for the Service
Provider’s Facilities to Occupy the
conduit owned or leased by the City,
the
Service
Provider
may
be
required, to the extent permitted by
law to Occupy the conduit owned or
leased by the City in order to reduce
the necessity to Excavate the Public Right-of-Way. If required, the
Service Provider shall pay to the
City a fee for Occupancy which
shall be a reasonable market lease
rate for occupancy of the conduit.
The City and the Service Provider
may agree to amortize the fee
through annual payments to the
City.
(d) Relocation or Removal of
Facilities. Within thirty (30) days
following written notice from the
City and in accordance with law, a
Service Provider shall, at its own
expense, temporarily or permanently remove, relocate, change or alter
the position of any Facilities in the
Public Right-of-Way whenever the
City shall have determined that
such removal, relocation, change or
alteration is reasonably necessary
for:
(1) The Construction, Reconstruction, repair, maintenance or installation of any City public improvement in or on the Public Right-ofWay; or
(2) The operations of the City or
other governmental entity in or on
the Public Right-of-Way.
(e)
Removal
of
Unauthorized
Facilities. Within thirty (30) days
following written notice from the
City, and to the extent permitted by
law any Service Provider or other
Person that owns, controls or maintains
any
unregistered
System,
Facility or related appurtenances in
the Public Right-of-Way shall, at its
own expense, remove those Facilities or appurtenances from the Public Right-of-Way of the City or shall
arrange to sell the System, Facilities or appurtenances to the City.
After the thirty (30) days have
expired, the City may remove the
Facilities or appurtenances from the
Public Right-of-Way at the other
party’s expense. A System or Facility is unauthorized and subject to
removal in any of the following circumstances:

1846

October 10, 2007
(1) If the System or Facility was
Constructed, Reconstructed, installed, operated, located or maintained
without registering, except as otherwise provided by this Chapter;
(2) On abandonment of a Facility
in the Public Right-of-Way of the
City, with the exception of underground facilities abandoned in a
manner authorized and approved by
the City;
(3) If the System or Facility was
Constructed, Reconstructed, installed, operated, located or maintained,
or any Excavation of a Public
Right-of-Way was performed, without prior issuance of a required permit from the City, except as otherwise provided by this Chapter;
(4) If the System or Facility was
Constructed, Reconstructed, installed, operated, located or maintained,
or any Excavation of a Public
Right-of-Way was performed, at a
location not identified in the City’s
registration to Occupy or Use the
Public Right-of-Way; or
(5) If the Service Provider fails to
comply with the Registration requirements of this Chapter.
Division (e) of this section does
not apply to the extent that abandonment of Facilities is governed by
federal or State law.
(f) Emergency Removal or Relocation of Facilities. To the extent
permitted by law, the City retains
the right and privilege to cut or
move any Facilities, or stop work on
any
Construction,
Reconstruction,
installation, operation or Excavation, located in the Public Right-ofWay of the City, as the City may
determine to be necessary, appropriate or useful in response to any
need to protect the public health,
safety or welfare; except to the
extent that the City’s actions would
cause a dangerous or potentially
dangerous situation.

By Council Members Zone, Kelley

An emergency resolution urges
support for Governor Strickland’s
Energy, Jobs and Progress for Ohio
Program and urging the Ohio Legislature to enact all legislation in
support of the Governors energy program.
Whereas, Energy is at the core of
Ohio’s economic and environmental
health. Energy built our past, sustains our present, and energy holds
promise of an even brighter future;
and
Whereas, In early May 2007, Governor Ted Strickland articulated
principles to guide the development
of an Ohio Energy Compact as we
construct a plan to secure Ohio’s
electricity security; and
Whereas, The Governor and his
staff then met with representatives
of all key stakeholder groups, listening and learning from those different perspectives on the electricity challenge and its possible solutions; and
Whereas, The governor proposes a
non-partisan solution that will treat
all stakeholders fairly to protect
jobs, stimulate economic growth and
protect our environment; and
Whereas, The Governor has established seven principles for a comprehensive energy policy; and
Whereas, Those seven principles
are:
1. We must establish a stable balance between the protections of regulation and the opportunities of
competitive markets;
2. Policies to stimulate renewable
and advanced energy production in
Ohio are instrumental in attracting
investment in related energy technology manufacturing;
3. Transparency and accountability are priorities throughout the
Strickland Administration;
4. Customers deserve equal footing with utilities;
5. Modernizing Ohio’s electric infrastructure must be a high priority;
6. Energy efficiency must be central element in addressing electric
regulation;
7. Ohio’s electric power sector
must be prepared for the ever-growing influence that will be exerted by
environmental
issues,
especially
global climate change; and
Whereas, These principles represent specific energy plan measures
and, therefore;
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Urges support for Governor Strickland’s Energy, Jobs and
Progress for Ohio Program and
urges the Ohio Legislature to enact
all legislation in support of the Governors energy program
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit

By Council Member Britt.
An emergency resolution supporting the Ohioans for Healthy Families Campaign in its effort to submit legislation known as the Ohio
Healthy Families Act to the Ohio
General Assembly requiring businesses with more than 25 workers
to allow full-time employees to earn
7 paid sick days per year and parttime workers to earn a pro-rated
number of paid sick days.
Whereas, 94 million working Americans do not have paid sick days to
use to care for a sick child; and
Whereas, nearly half of all private sector workers in the United
States are not provided any paid
sick time; and
Whereas, two-thirds of part-time
female employees also forgo pay
when they miss work to care for
their children; and
Whereas, too many Ohioans are
forced to choose between a sick
child or parent and their paycheck;
and
Whereas, the average cost to
allow workers to earn paid sick
days would be 35 cents per day per
full-time employee; and
Whereas,
the
proposed
Ohio
Healthy Families Act would require
businesses with more than 25 workers to allow full-time employees to
earn 7 paid sick days per year, and
part-time workers could earn a prorated number of paid sick days
depending on the number of hours
worked; and
Whereas, under the proposed Act,
earned sick time could be used by
an employee for an absence to care
for themselves, children, parent or
spouse who has a physical or mental illness, injury or medical condition or needs a diagnosis or preventative medical care; and
Whereas, it is the goal of the Ohio
Healthy Families Campaign to submit the proposed Act and over
120,000 valid signatures to the Ohio
General Assembly by the end of
December, 2007; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,

The City Record
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports the Ohioans for Healthy
Families Campaign in its effort to
submit proposed legislation known
as the Ohio Healthy Families Act to
the Ohio General Assembly requiring businesses with more than 25
workers to allow full-time employees to earn 7 paid sick days per year
and part-time workers to earn a prorated number of paid sick days.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to submit copies of
this resolution to Gloria J. Fauss of
Ohioans for Healthy Families.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
