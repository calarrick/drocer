ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 377-07.
By Council Members Polensek,
White, Brancatelli, Cimperman, Coats,
Conwell, Kelley, Lewis, Reed, Santiago, Turner, Westbrook, Zone, Cummins, Sweeney, Brady, Britt, Cleveland, Dolan, Johnson and Pierce
Scott.
An emergency resolution urging
Cleveland stores to discontinue sales
of the caffeinated beverage “Cocaine TM”, canned and copyrighted
by Redux Beverages, LLC.
Whereas, the caffeinated beverage
trademarked “Cocaine” is starting to
be sold in many Cleveland community stores; and
Whereas, the “Cocaine” beverage
can displays the terms “The Legal
Alternative” and “Energy Supplement,” and is not recommended for
pregnant women, children, or people
sensitive to caffeine; and

409

27
Whereas, the sale of “Cocaine,”
may desensitize children and young
adults to the use of illegal drugs,
including cocaine and other addictive substances; and
Whereas,
Cleveland
community
stores that sell “Cocaine” participate
in glamorizing illegal drug use and
send the wrong message to Cleveland citizens, especially children
and young adults.
Whereas, it is incumbent upon
Cleveland community stores to discontinue sales of “Cocaine” in order
to preserve the integrity and quality of life in our community; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges Cleveland stores to discontinue sales of the highly caffeinated beverage “Cocaine TM”,
canned and copyrighted by Redux
Beverages, LLC.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to William
Mason, Cuyahoga County Prosecutor, Gregory White, the United
States Attorney for the Northern
District of Ohio, and Mayor Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted March 5, 2007.
Effective March 9, 2007.

Res. No. 380-07.
By Council Members Pierce Scott,
Conwell, Britt, Cleveland, Coats,
Lewis, Turner, White, Cummins,
Sweeney, Brady, Brancatelli, Cimperman, Dolan, Johnson, Kelley,
Polensek,
Reed,
Santiago,
Westbrook and Zone.
An emergency resolution urging
the State of Ohio to enact legislation that prohibits racial profiling
and mandates data collection during
traffic stops.
Whereas, racial profiling is the
stop, detention, or other disparate
treatment of an individual using the
racial, ethnic or minority group status of such individual as a factor,
other than in the case of a physical
description used to apprehend a specific suspect; and
Whereas, the majority of states
have some form of racial profiling
legislation regarding data collection
during traffic stops; and
Whereas, Ohio is only one of ten
states that have no racial profiling
legislation passed or under consideration; and
Whereas, some Ohio agencies collect data voluntarily or as the result
of litigation, but the vast majority
of Ohio agencies do not collect data

28
during traffic stops – counter to the
national trend; and
Whereas, data collected by officers is essential in order to identify
any pattern of racial and ethnic disparities during traffic and pedestrian stops by police and make recommendations to eliminate any disparities; and
Whereas, data collected must include stop, driver, and vehicle characteristics, stop outcomes, and identification information in order to be
useful in racial profiling traffic stop
studies; and
Whereas, data collection assists in
identifying potential problem areas
and increases officers’ legitimacy
with the public; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the State of Ohio to enact
legislation that prohibits racial profiling and mandates data collection
during traffic stops.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to the Ohio
General Assembly, Governor Strickland, the NAACP, and Mayor Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted March 5, 2007.
Effective March 9, 2007.

Res. No. 381-07.
By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency resolution objecting to the transfer of ownership of
a D5 and D6 Liquor Permit to 1740
East 17th Street, 1st floor and basement.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Department of Liquor

44114, Permanent Number 6548846;
and
Whereas, the granting of this

this high crime area, which is

Whereas, the applicant does not

of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed

The City Record
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department

An emergency resolution supporting reauthorization of the federal

the United States supports medical

poor, underinsured, and uninsured

fully takes into account the impact
local economic conditions have on a
region’s ability to help people gain
access to HIV/AIDS care and treatment.
Whereas, since 1990 the Ryan

the discontinued collection of certain neighborhood mail boxes and
engage members of Cleveland City
Council to evaluate the impact of

neighborhoods; and further to maintain mail boxes in areas such as

an essential service relating to the
quality of life in communities across
Cleveland; and
Whereas, numerous neighborhood
mail boxes were removed over the

of their basic services within their
own neighborhoods; and
Whereas, the lack of access to
neighborhood mail boxes causes
risks to neighborhood residents in
transacting needed business and
personal communication including
paying bills, undertaking sensitive
