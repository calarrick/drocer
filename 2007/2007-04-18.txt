An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Public Utilities
to execute a Power Schedule, amending and restating the Power Schedule, dated as of January 1, 2006,
between American Municipal PowerOhio, Inc. (“AMP-Ohio”) and the
City of Cleveland, and relating to
the purchase by the City from AMPOhio of power and associated energy available to AMP-Ohio pursuant
to a long term purchase by AMPOhio from J. Aron & Company (“J.
Aron”).
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
owns and operates an electric utility system, Cleveland Public Power,
for the sale of electric power and
associated energy for the benefit of
its citizens and taxpayers; and
Whereas, in order to satisfy the
electric power and energy requirements of its electric utility system,
the City of Cleveland has purchased
economical and reliable power and
energy from AMP-Ohio, of which
the City is a Member, or has purchased power arranged by AMPOhio; and

6
Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
acting individually and along with
other municipalities which own and
operate electric utility systems jointly through AMP-Ohio, endeavors to
arrange
for
reliable,
reasonably
priced supplies of electric power and
energy for ultimate delivery to its
customers; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has executed a Master Services
Agreement with AMP-Ohio which
sets forth the general terms and
conditions
for
the
provision
of
power supply and other services by
AMP-Ohio to the City; and
Whereas, AMP-Ohio has acquired
by contract with J. Aron (the “Original J. Aron Contract”) economical
long-term power and energy which
has been made available for resale
to certain AMP-Ohio Members, including
the
City
of
Cleveland
(“Municipalities”), on a long-term
basis; and
Whereas, under the authority of
Ordinance No. 244-06, passed March
20, 2006, the City of Cleveland previously determined that it could beneficially utilize a portion of such
energy and executed an agreement
(the “Original Power Schedule) with
AMP-Ohio for a share of the power
and energy from the Original J.
Aron Contract at the stated contract
price to the City of $0.04455 per
kWh, excluding taxes, transmission
costs, replacement power and AMPOhio service fees (the “Contract
Price”); and
Whereas, AMP-Ohio is renegotiating the terms of the Original J. Aron
Contract for purposes of prepaying
all or a portion of AMP-Ohio’s obligations under the Original J. Aron
Contract, in a discounted lump sum
(the “Prepayment”), in exchange for
a reduction in the Contract Price;
and
Whereas, the amount of the Prepayment will correspond to the
shares of power and energy of the
City of Cleveland and Municipalities
authorizing power schedules substantially
identical
to
the
New
Power Schedule (“Participants”); and
Whereas, not all Municipalities
may become Participants; and
Whereas, an amendment to the
Original J. Aron Contract relating to
the Prepayment will enable AMPOhio to offer long-term power and
energy to Participants at a discount
price, excluding taxes, transmission
costs, replacement power and AMPOhio service fees (the “Discount
Price”), from the Contract Price that
would otherwise be charged by
AMP-Ohio to service its obligations
under the Original J. Aron Contract;
and
Whereas, AMP-Ohio intends to
issue bonds to finance the Prepayment and the City of Cleveland
requests it to do so; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
desires to obtain the benefit of the
Discount Price and consents to the
issuance of bonds by AMP-Ohio on
its behalf to effect the Prepayment;
and
Whereas, AMP-Ohio has offered to
enter into an agreement (the “New
Power Schedule”), supplementary to
its Master Services Agreement with

The City Record
the City of Cleveland, that will
amend and restate the Original
Power Schedule to provide that
AMP-Ohio will agree to obtain and
sell to the City, and the City will
agree to take and pay for, a share
of the power and energy acquired
by AMP-Ohio under an amendment
to the Original J. Aron Contract (the
Original J. Aron Contract, as so
amended, the “Prepayment Agreement”); and
Whereas, it is understood by the
City of Cleveland that the ability of
AMP-Ohio to offer power and energy to the City at the Discount Price
will be governed by the terms of the
Prepayment Agreement, and that,
under certain conditions, the Prepayment Agreement may be terminated prior to December 31, 2012;
and
Whereas, it is further understood
by the City of Cleveland that, in the
event the Prepayment Agreement
shall be terminated by J. Aron or
AMP-Ohio for any reason, the New
Power Schedule will require AMPOhio to continue to sell, and the City
to purchase, power and energy at
the Contract Price, rather than the
Discount Price, effective on the date
of the termination; and
Whereas, it is understood by the
City of Cleveland that all payments
made by the City under the New
Power Schedule will continue to constitute an operation and maintenance obligation of the City’s electric utility system, payable from the
revenues thereof in accordance with
the New Power Schedule, and the
City agrees, as specified in the New
Power Schedule, to fix, charge and
collect rates sufficient to pay its
obligations along with all other
legally required obligations of the
City’s electric utility system; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of

New
Power
Schedule,

anticipated present value savings to
the City of Cleveland from its participation in the Prepayment will

term of the New Power Schedule.

Date” of the New Power Schedule
