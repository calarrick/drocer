which was passed by City Council on Monday, June 15, 1992, attached is a listing of firms that have applied for
certification and were denied. However, these firms are not prohibited from doing business as prime contractors with
the City of Cleveland. Denials were based upon the purported owner’s inability to clearly define that they were bona fide
minority and/or female owned and controlled firms, or they applied for certification and were out of the geographic area
that met the requirements of the MBE/FBE Ordinances and the Regulations that govern the MBE/FBE certification
status, or they failed to respond to OEO’s written requests for additional information in order to process the file.

By Council Members Brady and

An emergency ordinance authorizing the purchase by one or more requirement contracts of various types
of furniture, fixtures, and equipment, for the Division of Architecture, Department of Public Service.

485-07, 486-07, 487-07, 488-07, 489-07,
and 490-07, for the period of one or
two years, to be purchased by the
Commissioner of Purchases and
Supplies upon a unit basis for the
Division of Architecture, Department of Public Service. Bids shall
be taken in a manner that permits
an award to be made for all items
as a single contract, or by separate
contract for each or any combination of the items as the Board of
Control determines. Alternate bids
for a period less than one year may
be taken if deemed desirable by
the Commissioner of Purchases and
Supplies until provision is made for
the requirements for the entire
term. The Director of Public Service is authorized to enter into one
or more contracts with a term of
two years instead of one year when
there is a financial advantage to
the City. For purposes of this ordinance, a financial advantage shall
be determined by the Director of
Public Service by comparing the
bids received for both terms.
Section 2. That the costs of the
contract or contracts shall be paid

credited proceeds from the sale of
2007 general obligation bonds issued
for this purpose and Fund Nos. 20
SF 362, 20 SF 371, 20 SF 381, 20 SF
391, and 20 SF 503 and shall be
charged against the proper appropriation accounts and the Director of Finance shall certify the
amount of the initial purchase,
which purchase, together with all
later purchases, shall be made on
order of the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies under a requisition against the contract or contracts certified by the Director of
Finance. (RL 156216)
Section 3. That under Section
108(b) of the Charter, the purchases
authorized by this ordinance may be
made through cooperative agreements using state procedures. The
Director of Public Service may sign
all documents with the State of Ohio
or any of its political subdivisions
that are necessary to make the purchases, and may enter into one or
more contracts with the vendors
selected through that cooperative
process.
Section 4. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
