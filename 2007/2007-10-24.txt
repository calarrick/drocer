Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Finance is authorized to make one
or more written requirement contracts under the Charter and the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, for the requirements for
a one year period of the necessary
items of office supplies, in the
approximate amount as purchased
during the preceding term, with a
one-year option to renew, exercisable by the Director of Finance, to
be purchased by the Commissioner
of Purchases and Supplies on a
unit basis for the various divisions
of City government. Bids shall be
taken in a manner that permits an
award to be made for all items as
a single contract, or by separate
contract for each or any combination of the items as the Board of
Control determines. Alternate bids
for a period less than the specified
term may be taken if desired by
the Commissioner of Purchases and
Supplies until provision is made for
the requirements for the entire
term.

of Finance shall certify the amount
of the initial purchase, which purchase, together with all later purchases, shall be made on order of

An emergency resolution urging
the United States Congress to make
fundamental changes needed to enhance and strengthen traditional
Medicare.
Whereas, Medicare is an essential
national social insurance program
that has a major impact on the quality of life for over 43 million Americans young and old; and
Whereas, Medicare provides major
funding for the health care of virtually all of our nation’s seniors and
several million younger adults with
permanent disabilities; and
Whereas, additional millions of
younger people benefit indirectly by
being relieved of a major financial
burden when an older member of
the family encounters major health
expense; and
Whereas, Medicare policy is a
social contract between the American people and their government;
and
Whereas, policy change undertaken to assure fiscal solvency in the
future should guarantee both fairness and adequacy in the provision
of health care; and
Whereas, this Council supports
Medicare reform based on foundational principals listed below; and
Whereas, Medicare should remain
affordable and accessible for all
qualified persons; and
Whereas,
traditional
Medicare
should be retained and strengthened; and
Whereas, the percentage of the
increase
in
Medicare
premiums
should not exceed the percentage of
the increase in Social Security benefits; and
Whereas, Medicare should continue to expand and emphasize preventative services; and
Whereas, Medicare beneficiaries
should be issued a single card to
cover all Medicare or Medicare-related benefits, including prescription
drugs; and
Whereas, Medicare should offer a
uniform prescription benefit to all
beneficiaries at the same cost; and
Whereas, the federal government
should be encouraged to negotiate
the best prescription drug costs for
beneficiaries; and
Whereas, Qualified Medicare Beneficiary Program (QMB), Specified
Low-Income Medicare Beneficiaries
(SLMB) and Qualified Individual
(Q-I 1) programs should be retained
as well as existing related benefits
through Medicaid; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the United States Congress to make

Public Utilities shall retain authority to determine the extent of aid
committed and to decline to respond
to a request for assistance if the

ability to provide the proper level of
services to its own customers. The
Director of Law shall review all
agreements to determine that the
terms and conditions are appropriate and consistent with the City’s
interests.
Section 3. That this ordinance is
