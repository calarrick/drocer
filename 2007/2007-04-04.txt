FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 545-07.
By Council Members Brancatelli,
Westbrook, Cummins, Santiago, Sweeney, Brady, Britt, Cimperman, Cleveland, Coats, Conwell, Johnson, Keane,
Kelley, Lewis, Pierce Scott, Polensek, Reed, Turner, White and Zone.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio House of Representatives
to support the passage of H.B. 138,
which will better identify ownership
of property after a foreclosure occurs, and assist local governments,
building and housing official with
identifying purchasers of property
subsequent to sheriff sales for the
purposes of better code enforcement
and tracking responsible parties
who are avoiding local taxes and
fees.
Whereas, Ohio has the worst foreclosure rate in the country, with a
loan default rate more than three
times the national average; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
had approximately 9,000 foreclosures
in 2006 with the rate of foreclosures
predicted to worsen; and
Whereas, the increasing number
of foreclosures result in sheriff
sales; and
Whereas, the purchasers of sheriff sale properties, which by default
is frequently the mortgage company
who began the foreclosure, fail to
file the deed with the Recorders
Office; and
Whereas, there is no state law
which requires the recording of the
deed pursuant to a sheriff sale; and
Whereas, the sheriff sale purchaser of foreclosed property is
attempting to stay hidden trying to
avoid notification of housing code
violations; and
Whereas, the sheriff sale purchaser of foreclosed property is
attempting to stay hidden trying to
avoid notification of local taxes and
fees; and
Whereas, local government officials would be greatly assisted to
perform the duties to enforce building code violations by having timely information of a properties deed
holder; and
Whereas, local government officials would be greatly assisted to
perform their duties to collect all
legally due property taxes and fees
by having timely information of
property deed holder’s identification;
and
Whereas, vacant foreclosed properties often become a breeding
ground for crime and fires, and require a disproportionate amount of
government maintenance, from securing
properties
against
criminal
activity to removal of garbage and
rodents to demolition, all at a cost
to taxpayers; and
Whereas, vacant properties reduce
city tax revenue in three ways: they
are often tax delinquent; their low
value means they generate little in
taxes; and they depress property
values across an entire neighborhood; and
Whereas, the cost of living in a
neighborhood with many vacant and
abandoned properties makes obtaining homeowner’s insurance, mort-

12
gages and loans for home improvements more difficult; and
Whereas, vacant properties degrade and devalue the quality of
life for remaining residents, isolating and weakening the neighborhood, and increasing the likelihood
that property values will continue to
decline and further abandonment
will set in; and
Whereas, it is incumbent the Ohio
Legislature to assist local government with the tools and information
to reduce the impacts of foreclosed
and vacant properties and provide
local government the ability to identify any properties deed holder in an
efficient and timely manner; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urge the Ohio House of Representatives to support the passage of
H.B. 138, which will better identify
ownership of property after a foreclosure occurs, and assist local governments, building and housing official with identifying purchasers of
property subsequent to sheriff sales
for the purposes of better code
enforcement and tracking responsible parties who are avoiding local
taxes and fees.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Ted
Strickland, the Governor of the State
of Ohio, John Husted, the Speaker
of the House, Mike Foley, Ohio
House of Representatives, and Lou
Blessing, Ohio House of Representatives, Frank G. Jackson, Mayor,
City of Cleveland, James Rokakis,
the Cuyahoga County Treasurer.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it

and Cummins.
An emergency resolution opposing
Ohio Senate Bill 117 and any state
legislation that would preempt local
government regulation of video service providers using the right-of-way
in their jurisdiction, and which would
eliminate and severely limit franchise
fee payments and PEG channel and
access support currently existing
under federal law and further urging
members of the Ohio Legislature to
oppose SB 117 and any other similar
legislation that impinges on the City’s
home rule authority.

The City Record
Whereas, the regulatory authority
to require a local franchise to provide video services stems from the
City of Cleveland’s constitutional
home rule powers over its local
rights-of-way; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
welcomes competition of video service and broadband and encourages
new providers of these services to
invest in new communications and
video programming infrastructure in
the City and to provide competitive
video and broadband service to all
of the City’s residents and businesses; and
Whereas, Senate Bill (“SB”) 117
has been introduced in the Ohio Legislature to enable telecommunications companies to enter the video
service market with minimal regulation and accountability in order to
compete with incumbent cable operators by providing competitive video
service to Ohio residents of their
choice; and
Whereas, current federal statutory
law regulating the provision of
video service maintains a fair and
equitable balance between local government interests, powers and obligations, and the interests of incumbent cable operators as well as new
providers of competitive video service, and provides a reasonable
mechanism by which competitive
video service providers can obtain
local permission to provide video
services; and
Whereas, SB 117 would eliminate
local and state regulation of cable
and other video service providers
using the City’s rights-of-way and
replace it with minimal oversight
and enforcement powers by the Ohio
Director of Commerce; and
Whereas, SB 117 would permit
cable operators to unilaterally abrogate existing cable contracts with
municipalities even if no new competitive video service is offered in
those communities; and
Whereas, despite claims that SB
117 preserves important local government interests such as control
over rights-of-way, franchise fee
payments and Public, Educational
and Governmental (PEG) access
channels, the terms of SB 117 unreasonably restrict and severely impair
these and other important local
interests; and
Whereas, it is incumbent on the
City of Cleveland to protect the
cable and video service interests of
all its residents with respect to reasonable build-out requirements, local
PEG programming, payment of franchise fees for use of public rightsof-way, and rights-of-way management, and
Whereas, SB 117 would cut the
City’s franchise fees paid by cable
operators and video service providers in exchange for using the
City’s rights-of-way by 10-12% or
more going forward, and would
severely impair the City’s ability to
audit cable and competitive video
service providers’ franchise fee payments; and
Whereas, SB 117 would substantially reduce, if not eliminate, the
City’s Public, Educational and Governmental (PEG) access channels
and would entirely eliminate all
other PEG funding and other services, such as free cable service to

556

April 4, 2007
City buildings and public schools
entirely; and
Whereas, SB 117 would severely
impair the City’s ability to require
and enforce basic customer service
standards in cable television and
other video services; and
Whereas, the provisions of SB 117
requiring a competitive video service provider to build-out its system
to include service to lower income
residents is such that very few
lower income City residents will receive competitive video and broadband service; and
Whereas, although SB 117 states
that current local franchise requirements present “barriers to entry”
and “inordinate delays”, companies
such as AT&T and Verizon are not
yet providing competitive video service, and has not committed to a
date by which it will begin providing competitive service, in Ohio communities that have already granted
AT&T permission to provide such
service; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby opposes Ohio Senate Bill 117 and
any state legislation that would preempt local government regulation of
video service providers using the
right-of-way in their jurisdiction,
and
that
would
eliminate
and
severely limit franchise fee payments and PEG channel and access
support currently existing under
federal law and further urges members of the Ohio Legislature to
oppose SB 117 and any other similar
legislation that impinges on the
City’s home rule authority.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to forward certified copies of this resolution to
Governor Srickland and all members
of the Ohio legislature.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

An emergency resolution calling

Ohio and the state legislature to
seek legislation that would require
the state’s pension system to divest
or restrict investments in Sudan
because of human rights atrocities
in the country’s Darfur region.
Whereas, Sudan has been in a
civil war for more than 20 years,
with violence in the western region
of the county leaving as many as
450,000 people dead; and
Whereas, Sudan’s government has
destroyed villages across Darfur in
an attempts to crush a rebel movement; and
Whereas, more than 2.5 million
Sudanese from the Darfur region are
homeless; and
Whereas,
in
response,
several
states have already passed laws to
completely divest from Sudan because of its human rights atrocities
in Darfur, including California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, New Jersey
and Oregon; and
Whereas, if the state of Ohio has
any investments in Sudan, or if it
has
any
economic
ties
to
the
Sudanese government, the state of
Ohio should join the growing list of
states that have begun divesting or
restricting investments in Sudan; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

An emergency resolution encouraging the Jackson administration to
consider
multiple
approaches
of
addressing childhood lead poisoning, including education, advocacy
and
litigation;
and
encouraging
local, state, and federal governments to increase funding to expand
childhood lead testing and environmental intervention.
Whereas, each year nationally,
some 400,000 children under 5 have
lead poisoning; and

566

April 4, 2007
Whereas, in Cuyahoga County
alone over 2,000 children under age
5 are diagnosed with lead poisoning
each year; and
Whereas, children who have lead
poisoning often suffer from learning
disabilities, hyperactivity and brain
damage; and
Whereas, lead poisoning costs the
nation $43.4 billion yearly in lost
wages and healthcare costs; and
Whereas, 38 million housing units
have lead paint, and screening and
interim controls of these units costs
$38 billion; and
Whereas, currently there is a lawsuit against paint companies SherwinWilliams Companies, NL Industries,
Inc., Millenium Holdings LLC, Conagra Grocery Products Company and
E.I. Du Pont De Nemours and Company asking them to fund the lead
paint clean up in several cities; and
Whereas, based on well-documented court evidence dating back to
1904, the suit alleges the companies
knew the harmful effects of lead
based paint, particularly on children, but continued to sell the paint
until it was banned in 1978; and
Whereas, it is time for the industry manufacturers that began this
public health crisis and contributed
to the problem to accept responsibility and help solve the problem; and
Whereas, Cleveland and Cuyahoga
County government agencies and
non-profit groups have been working with the health care community
to educate homeowners and landlords, test children, and remedy the
effects when a child has tested positive for lead poisoning, but a more
proactive approach with the help of
the industry manufacturers is paramount; and
Whereas, the Greater Cleveland
Lead Advisory Council has recommended lowering the blood lead
level that triggers environmental
interventions to > or = to 5-10
micrograms per deciliter; and
Whereas, lowering the lead level
that triggers environmental interventions will require increased funding and services to expand testing
and environmental intervention; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby encourages the Jackson administration to consider multiple approaches of addressing childhood
lead poisoning, including education,
advocacy and litigation; and encouraging local, state, and federal governments to increase funding to
expand childhood lead testing and

it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
