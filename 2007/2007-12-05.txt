FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 1976-07.
By Mayor Jackson and Council
Members Brady, Brancatelli, Cimperman, Coats and Cummins.
An emergency resolution urging
the United States Congress to address revenue issues to fully fund
City of Cleveland SAFETEA-LU projects to previously authorized levels.
Whereas, in 2005, President George
W. Bush signed the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users
(“SAFETEA-LU”), which authorized,
among
other
things,
guaranteed
funding for improving highways,
highway safety and public transportation; and
Whereas, the Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency (“NOACA”)
is the metropolitan planning organization for the counties of Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Lorain, and
Medina; and
Whereas, NOACA has an approved
list of projects to be funded with
Highway Trust Fund resources, as
authorized through SAFETEA-LU,
for 2008 through 2011; and
Whereas, at a recent NOACA meeting, the City was advised that,
unless Congress takes action to
address revenue issues, there may
be a significant shortfall in Highway Trust Fund resources, as authorized by SAFETEA-LU, which could
result in a potential 36-42% cut in
federal transportation funds; and
Whereas, a cut in federal transportation funds will impact the City
of Cleveland and Northeast Ohio
including the following City of
Cleveland projects: St. Clair Road
Rehabilitation, Bessemer Avenue Extension Phase 2, East 93rd Street
Bridge, Aetna Road Bridge, West
77th Street Bridge, Detroit Avenue
Streetscape Project, Cleveland Towpath Trail, Stage 1, RTA Fare-Free
Downtown Cleveland Trolleys, Cleveland Car Sharing Demonstration Program, and the Cleveland Innerbelt
and bridge improvements; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health,
or safety in that unless Congress
takes action to address revenue
issues, this potential shortfall will
negatively impact, by either postponing, diminishing, or eradicating
many City of Cleveland transportation projects; and
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the United States Congress to address revenue issues to fully fund
SAFETEA-LU projects to previously
authorized levels.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is authorized and directed to
transmit certified copies of this resolution to United States congressional representatives of the City of
Cleveland.

the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

An emergency resolution urges
the Ohio House of Representatives,
Public Utilities Committee not to
revise Section 4928.142(b)(2) of Substitute Senate Bill 221 that would
allow utilities to avoid the 25%
Advanced Energy Portfolio Standard
by 2025 if the cost of advanced energy is greater than 3% of the cost of
non-advanced energy.
Whereas, energy is at the core of
Ohio’s economic and environmental
health; energy built our past, sustains our present, and energy holds
promise of an even brighter future;
and
Whereas, in early May 2007, Governor Ted Strickland articulated
principles to guide the development
of an Ohio Energy Compact as we
construct a plan to ensure Ohio’s
electricity security; and
Whereas, the Governor and his
staff then met with representatives
of all key stakeholder groups, listening and learning from those different perspectives on the electricity challenge and its possible solutions; and
Whereas, the Governor proposes a
non-partisan solution that will treat
all stakeholders fairly to protect
jobs, stimulate economic growth and
protect our environment; and
Whereas, the Governor has established the following seven principles for a comprehensive energy
policy:
1. a stable balance between the
protections of regulation and the
opportunities of competitive markets;
2. policies to stimulate renewable
and advanced energy production in
Ohio to attract investment in related energy technology manufacturing;
3. transparency and accountability
in rates;
