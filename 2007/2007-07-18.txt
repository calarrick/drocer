FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS REFERRED
Res. No. 1173-07.
By Council Member Conwell.
An emergency ordinance encouraging the Jackson Administration to
urge area banks and lenders to offer
loan modifications to mortgage borrowers who are falling behind on
payments and heading toward default and foreclosure.
Whereas, last year, 11,076 new
foreclosure cases were filed in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court;
and
Whereas, homeowners and citizens all over the City of Cleveland
are negatively affected by the high
number of mortgage foreclosures;
and
Whereas, foreclosures often result
in vacant properties that become a
breeding ground for crime, depress
property values, and reduce city tax
revenue; and
Whereas, vacant and abandoned
properties require a disproportionate
amount of government maintenance,
from securing properties against
criminal activity to removal of
garbage and rodents to demolition,
all at a cost to taxpayers; and
Whereas, vacant properties degrade and devalue the quality of
life for remaining residents, isolating and weakening the neighborhood, and increasing the likelihood
that property values will continue to
decline and further abandonment
will set in; and
Whereas, foreclosures are rising
fast partly because lenders in recent
years rushed to make no-moneydown loans to people with weak
credit records and didn’t always verify their income; and
Whereas, the decline in housing
prices in Cleveland and Cuyahoga
County makes it hard for borrowers
who fall behind to sell their homes
for enough money to pay off the
loan; and
Whereas, according to the Wall
Street Journal, when borrowers fall
behind on payments, lenders typically consider offering a loan modification,
involving
lowering
the
interest rate or stretching out the
term; and
Whereas, lenders have used loan
modifications for years, but the
practice is expected to proliferate as
defaults rise, possibly peaking at
several times the usual 2% of outstanding loans; and
Whereas, area lenders and banks
could prevent mortgages borrowers
from foreclosure, and the resulting
vacant housing crisis in Cleveland
by offering loan modifications; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby encourages the Jackson Administration to urge area banks and
lenders to offer loan modifications
to mortgage borrowers who are
falling behind on payments and
heading toward default and foreclosure.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Mayor
Jackson.

Res. No. 1174-07.
By Council Members Polensek,
Reed, Cummins, Conwell, Brancatelli. Lewis.
An emergency ordinance urging
the Cuyahoga County Commissioners
to put their intended 1/4 cent sales
tax increase up for a vote in an
upcoming general election in order
for voters to determine whether the
increase should be imposed.
Whereas, Cuyahoga County already has the highest sales tax rate
in the state of Ohio at 7.50%; and
Whereas, in order to build a medical mart, a new convention center
to house the mart, and a new county headquarters, Cuyahoga County
Commissioners want to increase this
sales tax by one quarter of one percent, costing consumers in Cuyahoga County 25 cents more on a $100
purchase; and
Whereas, the Commissioners want
to impose this tax increase unilaterally, without allowing voters in
Cuyahoga
County
to
determine
whether such a tax increase should
go into effect; and
Whereas, this Council is a proponent of investing in our city’s convention facilities in order to bring
the medical mart to Cleveland; however, we believe that the voters
should have a say in whether their
taxes should be increased to pay for
this; and
Whereas, it is already difficult to
do business in Cuyahoga County due
to the high sales tax: people living
close to county borders often go outside Cuyahoga County to a county
with inevitably lower sales taxes in
order to purchase high ticket items;
and
Whereas, difficulty in selling high
priced items, such as automobiles,
causes businesses to move outside
the county, and inhibits other businesses from making a move into
Cuyahoga County; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that
the
County
Commissioners
should not impose an increased
sales tax on the voters of this county, but instead should allow the people of Cuyahoga County determine
whether they want their sales tax
to increase, by putting the tax
increase up to a vote; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the Cuyahoga County Commissioners to put their intended 1/4
cent sales tax increase up for a vote
in an upcoming general election in
order
for
voters
to
determine
