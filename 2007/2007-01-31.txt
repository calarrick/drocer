An emergency resolution urging
the National Baseball Hall of Fame
and Museum to recognize the attendance record set at Cleveland’s
Brookside Park.
Whereas, Brookside Park in Cleveland’s Old Brooklyn neighborhood
played an important role in the historical development of the game of
baseball;
Whereas, Brookside Park hosted
the largest recorded baseball crowd
in history on October 10, 1915; and
Whereas, on this date when the

Luxus of Omaha in the World Amateur
Baseball
Championship,
a
crowd of 115,000 gathered along and
below the Park’s northern bluff,
directly west of today’s Fulton Road
Bridge, and cheered the home team

Whereas, The National Baseball
Hall of Fame and Museum’s mission
is to foster an appreciation of the
historical development of the game
and its impact on our culture by collecting, preserving, exhibiting and
interpreting its collections for a
global audience.
Whereas, the National Baseball

An emergency resolution supporting health care for all children and
encouraging the federal government
to reauthorize the successful State
Children’s Health Insurance Program.

January 31, 2007
Whereas, the State Children’s Health
Insurance Program (SCHIP), enacted
in 1997, is a critical source of health
insurance coverage for over 6 million children; and
Whereas, SCHIP expanded healthcare coverage to fill the void for
millions of children under age 19
whose family income levels are too
high to qualify for Medicaid or too
low to afford private healthcare coverage; and
Whereas, SCHIP is a block grant
program, jointly funded with federal and state dollars, however, states
receive enhanced matching funds
for SCHIP enrollees; and
Whereas, unlike Medicaid, SCHIP
funding is capped, not open ended,
and allocated to states based on a
distribution formula; although states
may carry over unspent funds for up
to three years before redistribution
to other states, Ohio has never
returned any unspent SCHIP dollars
to the federal government; and
Whereas, Congress will consider
SCHIP reauthorization this year,
which could result in opportunities
to make positive changes for children and children’s hospitals; and
Whereas, this Council encourages
the federal government to seek
increased funding of SCHIP so that
more eligible children may enroll
and so that the program may be
expanded to additional populations
in need of healthcare; and
Whereas, it is clear that SCHIP
must be supported and funded as a
separate insurance for children, in
order to fill the gap for children
who are not eligible for Medicaid
and whose families cannot afford
private coverage; and
Whereas, this Council encourages
the federal government to debate
and determine how to make Medicaid and SCHIP work together to be
stronger programs; and
Whereas, SCHIP must be funded,
but not as a result of cuts to the
Medicaid program; and
Whereas, this resolution is a follow-up to the National Town Hall
Meeting held at Rainbow Babies
and Children’s Hospital on January
11, 2007; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports health care for all children
and encourages the federal government to reauthorize the successful
State Children’s Health Insurance
Program.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to forward a copy of
this resolution to Senators Sherrod
Brown and George Voinovich, the
members of the House of Representatives representing Northeast Ohio,
and U.S. Secretary of Health &
Human Services Michael Leavitt.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
