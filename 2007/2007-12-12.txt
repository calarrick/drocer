An emergency resolution urging
the United States Congress to address revenue issues to fully fund
City of Cleveland SAFETEA-LU projects to previously authorized levels.
Whereas,
in
2005,
President
George W. Bush signed the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for
Users
(“SAFETEA-LU”),
which
authorized,
among
other
things,

Whereas, NOACA has an approved
list of projects to be funded with
Highway Trust Fund resources, as
authorized through SAFETEA-LU,
for 2008 through 2011; and
Whereas, at a recent NOACA meeting, the City was advised that,
unless Congress takes action to
address revenue issues, there may
be a significant shortfall in Highway Trust Fund resources, as authorized by SAFETEA-LU, which could

issues, this potential shortfall will
negatively impact, by either postponing, diminishing, or eradicating
many City of Cleveland transportation projects; and

this section, upon the exemption
from tax in case of admissions to

Monthly Reports, Payment of Tax
(a) Every person receiving any
payment on which a tax is levied
under this chapter shall collect the
amount of the tax imposed by Section 195.02 from the person making
the admission payment. The tax
required to be collected under this
chapter shall be deemed to be held
in trust for the benefit of the City
and deemed to be trust funds in the
hands of the person required to collect the tax until all such tax collected is paid to the Commissioner
of Assessments and Licenses as
herein provided. Any person required to collect the tax imposed
under this chapter who fails, refuses or neglects to collect the tax, or
having collected the tax, fails, refuses or neglects to remit the tax to
the Commissioner in the manner prescribed by this chapter and the
Rules and Regulations, whether
such failure, refusal or neglect is
the result of his own act or the
result of acts or conditions beyond
his control, shall nevertheless be
personally liable to the City for the
amount of such tax, whether or not
such tax has been collected.
(b) (1) The tax imposed by this
chapter shall be collected at the
time the admission charge is paid
by the person seeking admission to
any place and shall be reported and

44
remitted by the person receiving
the tax to the Commissioner in
monthly installments and remittances therefor on or before the
thirtieth day of the month next succeeding the end of the monthly
period in which the tax is collected or received. Payment or remittance of the tax collected may be
made by check, unless payment or
remittance is otherwise required by
the Commissioner, but payment by
check shall not relieve the person
collecting the tax from liability for
payment and remittance of the tax
to the Commissioner, unless the
check is honored and is in the full
and correct amount. The person
receiving any payment for admissions shall make out a return upon
such forms prescribed by or acceptable to the Commissioner and set
forth such information as the Commissioner may require, showing the
amount of the tax collected upon
admissions for which he is liable
for the preceding monthly period,
and shall sign and transmit the
same to the Commissioner with a
remittance for the amount of tax
due. Failure to receive or procure
any form prescribed by the Commissioner shall not excuse any person from timely filing the return
due or from paying any admissions
tax due.
(2) The Commissioner may in his
discretion require verified annual
returns from any person receiving
admission payments setting forth
such additional information as he
may deem necessary to determine
correctly the amount of tax collected and payable. Whenever any theater, circus, show, exhibition, entertainment or amusement makes an
admission charge which is subject
to the tax herein levied, and the
same is of a temporary or transitory nature, of which the Commissioner shall be judge, the Commissioner may require the report and
remittance of the admission tax
immediately upon the collection of
the tax, at the conclusion of the performance or exhibition, or at the
conclusion of the series of performances or exhibitions or at such
other times as the Commissioner
shall determine. Failure to comply
with any requirement of the Commissioner as to report and remittance of the tax shall be a violation
of this chapter.
Section 195.05 Assessments of Tax
(a) Except as otherwise provided
in division (b), no assessment shall
be made or issued against any person charged with the duty of collecting, receiving and remitting the
tax levied and imposed under this
chapter, more than three (3) years
after the return date for the period
in which the admission charge was
paid, or more than three (3) years
after the return for such period is
filed, whichever is later.
(b) Division (a) shall not bar or
limit an assessment beyond three
years where the taxpayer fails to
file any report or return required by
this section; files a fraudulent report
or return; or where the Commissioner has evidence that admissions
tax collected have not been remitted
to the City.

The City Record
Section 195.06 Price to be Marked
on Ticket
The price, inclusive of any federal and city tax, at which every
admission ticket or card is sold

face or back of that part of the ticket which is to be taken up by the
management of the theater, opera,
or other place of amusement, together with the name of the vendor if
sold other than at a ticket office of
the place of amusement.
Section 195.07 Form and Content
of Return
The admissions tax return shall
be filed by the person receiving payment of any admission charge with
the Commissioner on a form prescribed by or acceptable to the Commissioner, setting forth:
(a) The aggregate amounts of all
admissions paid by persons seeking
admission to any place for the end
of the monthly period in which the
tax is collected and received;
(b) The total tax imposed by this
chapter for the end of the monthly
period in which the tax is collected
and received; and
(c) Such other pertinent statements, schedules, records or information as the Commissioner may
require to correctly determine the
amount of tax collected and due.
(d) The failure of any person to
receive or procure any form prescribed by the Commissioner shall
not excuse such person from filing
the return due.
Section 195.08 Amended Returns
Where
necessary
an
amended
return shall be immediately filed in
order to report additional admission
received but not reported and additional tax due. Such amended return
shall be on a form prescribed by or
acceptable to the Commissioner.
Section 195.09 Payment of Tax on
Filing of Return
Persons filing returns required by
this chapter shall, at the time of the
filing thereof, pay to the Commissioner the total amount of tax
shown as due thereon.
Section 195.10 Certificate of Registration Required; Application
Any person conducting or operating any place for entrance to which
an admission charge is made shall,
prior to the commencement of any
such activity, and on a form prescribed by the Commissioner make
application to and procure from the
Commissioner a certificate of registration to conduct such amusement,
entertainment or exhibition, etc. No
person who is the owner, lessee or
custodian of any building, lots, or
place where an amusement, entertainment, exhibition, etc. shall take
place within the City and to which
an admission shall be paid, shall
allow any such activity to occur
without first obtaining a certificate
of registration therefore as provided
in this Section. Any such owner,
lessee or custodian who leases or
permits such premises to be used for
any amusement, entertainment, exhibition, etc. by a person who is not

and remittance of the admissions
tax levied under Section 195.02 of
this chapter. An application for the
certificate of registration required
under this Section shall be made on
forms prescribed by and obtainable
upon request from the Commissioner and shall be made whether or not
the person conducting the activity
has received an exemption from collection of the admissions tax under
Section 195.03 of this chapter. The
certificate of registration or duplicate original copies thereof to be
issued by the Commissioner, shall be
posted in a conspicuous place in
each ticket or box office where tickets of admission are sold.
Section 195.11 Certificate of Registration for Temporary Amusement
Whenever a certificate of registration is obtained for the purpose
of operating or conducting a temporary or transitory amusement, entertainment or exhibition by persons
who are not the owners, lessees or
custodians of the building, lots or
place where the amusement is to be
conducted, the tax imposed by this
chapter shall be reported and remitted as provided in Section 195.04 by
the owner, lessee or custodian,
unless paid by the person conducting such temporary or transitory
activity. No person who is the
owner, lessee or custodian of any
building, lots, or place where an
amusement, entertainment, exhibition, etc. shall take place within the
City and to which an admission
shall be paid, shall allow any such
activity
to
occur
without
first
requiring the person conducting the
temporary or transitory amusement,
entertainment, exhibition, etc. to
obtain a certificate of registration
therefor. An application for the certificate
of
registration
required
under this Section, shall be made on
forms prescribed by and obtainable
upon request from the Commissioner. The applicant for a license and
certificate of registration for such
purpose
shall
furnish
with
the
application the name and address of
the owner, lessee or custodian of the
premises upon which the amusement
is to be conducted. Such owner,
lessee or custodian shall be jointly
and severally liable with the person
conducting the temporary or transitory
amusement,
entertainment,
exhibition, etc. for collection and
remittance of the admissions tax
levied under Section 195.02 of this
chapter.

(a) If a taxpayer files what purports to be a report required by this
chapter that does not contain information upon which the substantial
correctness of the report may be
judged or contains information that
on its face indicates that the report
is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the report in that manner
is due to a position that is frivolous
or a desire that is apparent from the
report to delay or impede the administration of the tax levied by this
chapter, a penalty of five hundred
dollars shall be imposed.
(b) If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting
or payment of the tax required to be

refunds to a consumer the admission
upon which the tax levied under
this chapter has been paid, such person may request a refund or credit
of the amount of admissions tax so
refunded. If a person charged with
collecting the tax levied under this
chapter has erroneously paid to the
Commissioner an amount in excess
of the admissions tax due based on
the total admissions reported during
a monthly reporting period, such
person may request a refund or credit of the amount of admissions tax
erroneously paid.
(b) No refund or credit for the tax
refunded or overpayment of tax
shall be made unless such claim for

in the case of overpayment, within
three (3) years from the date on
which such payment was made or
the return was due, whichever is
later, on a form prescribed by and
obtainable upon request from the
Commissioner. Upon the filing of an
application for refund or credit, the

any tax refunded or credited overpayment.
(d) In the event any person who
is entitled to a refund or credit is
indebted to the City for any tax or
fee administered by the Commissioner that is paid to the City, or
any charge, penalty or interest arising from such a tax or fee, the
amount refundable shall first be
applied in satisfaction of that debt.
If the amount refundable is less
than the amount of the debt, it may
be applied in partial satisfaction of
the debt. If the amount refundable
is greater than the amount of the
debt, the amount remaining after
satisfaction of the debt shall be
credited as provided in this Section.
If the person has more than one
such debt, any debt subject to Sections 195.04, 195.10, and 195.11 dealing
with
personal
liability
for
admissions tax owed shall be satisfied first.

under this chapter. Every person is
hereby directed and required to furnish within fifteen (15) days upon
written request by the Commissioner, or his duly authorized agent, representative, or employee, the means,
facilities and opportunities for making such examinations and investigations as are hereby authorized.

is
hereby
authorized to order any person presumed to have knowledge of the
facts to appear before him and may
examine such person, under oath,

admissions tax purposes or any
transaction tending to affect such
tax, and for this purpose may compel the production of books, papers,
records and other information and

him, whether as parties or witnesses, whenever he believes such persons have knowledge pertinent to
any inquiry of any admissions paid
or admissions tax charged, collected
or received or required to have been
charged, collected or received.
Section 195.30 Refusal to Produce
Records

If any sentence, clause, section or
part of this chapter, or any tax
imposed against or exemption from
collecting tax granted to any person is found to be unconstitutional,
illegal or invalid, such unconstitutionality, illegality or invalidity
shall affect only such clause, sentence, section or part of this chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections
