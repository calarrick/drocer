Res. No. 457-07.
By Council Member Sweeney.
An emergency resolution opposing
Ohio House Bill 3 and Ohio House
Bill 4 which, if passed, would repeal
the Estate Tax.
Whereas, House Bills 3 and 4
would repeal the State of Ohio’s
estate tax; and
Whereas, the estate tax affects
less than 2% of Ohioans and benefits received by these 2% are minimal; and
Whereas,
Ohio
must
maintain
steady streams of revenue and
repealing or eliminating taxes must
be done in a responsible way ensuring maximum benefits to Ohioans
and to compensate for the budget
shortfalls predicted by the governor’s office; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has averaged $4.3 million dollars in
revenue from the estate tax; and
Whereas, there has been no discussion as to what revenue would
replace the revenue lost to cities
and the state if the estate tax is
repealed; and
Whereas, there is little evidence
to
support
the
argument
that
Ohioans are leaving the state to
avoid paying the estate tax; and

10
Whereas, there is no evidence
showing that repealing the estate
tax would have any economic benefit to Ohioans; and
Whereas, the legislation allows
communities the option of repealing
the estate tax, thereby giving Ohio
communities another way to compete against each other; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby opposes Ohio House Bill 3 and
Ohio House Bill 4 which, if passed,
would repeal the Estate Tax.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to Governor Bob
Taft, all members of the Ohio General Assembly representing Cuyahoga County.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
