season

his
breaking Major League Baseball’s
color barrier; and encouraging the
City of Cleveland, through its Director of Parks, Recreation, and Properties to dedicate its Cleveland

22

by Baseball Writers in 1962; and
Whereas, during this 60th anniversary season, the national baseball community is celebrating not
only the impact Robinson had on
baseball, but how even well before
the civil-rights movement, he opened
the eyes of the whole country and
showed that we can live together;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby honors the late Jackie Robinson
