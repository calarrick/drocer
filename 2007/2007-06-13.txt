RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL

Res. No. 997-07.
By Council Members Polensek,
Westbrook, Keane, Santiago, Brady,
Brancatelli,
Britt,
Turner,
Zone,
Cummins, Pierce Scott, Reed, Kelley,
Coats, Cimperman, Cleveland and
Conwell.
An emergency resolution urging
Cleveland Catholic Diocese, Bishop
Richard Lennon to meet with Cleveland City Council to present and discuss the Diocese’s urban strategy in
the wake of recent proposed church
and school closings throughout the
City of Cleveland.
Whereas, Cleveland Catholic Diocese
recently
instructed
its
69
regional clusters to develop plans to
close at least 23 or up to 48 churches of its 231 parishes, and report
plans to the diocese by the end of
2008; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
will take the hardest hit with a
potential loss of up to 25 churches
slated to close; and
Whereas, Bishop Richard Lennon
also urged clusters to study enrollment trends and consider closing or
merging Catholic schools;
Whereas, the reorganization is
part of a six-year effort to address
massive demographic shifts from
the cities to the suburbs, growing
financial pressures, and a worsening clergy shortage; and
Whereas, Bishop Lennon said that
reorganization plans include the
possibility of building churches in
growing suburban areas; and
Whereas, parish communities and
schools play a vital role in maintaining
racially
and
ethnically
diverse neighborhoods and community stability; and
Whereas, City Council is concerned that the Diocese’s reorganization will lead to a greater migration out of the City and disinvestment in City neighborhoods that
will negatively impact the quality
of life for its citizens; and
Whereas, City Council desires to
meet with Bishop Lennon to discuss
the Diocese’s urban strategy to continue social services and educational programs in the City, continue
use of closed churches, and maintain
and rebuild its urban parishioner
base; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges Cleveland Catholic Diocese, Bishop Richard Lennon to
meet with Cleveland City Council to
present and discuss the Diocese’s
urban strategy in the wake of
recent proposed church and school
closings throughout the City of
Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Bishop
Richard Lennon and Mayor Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives

By Council Members Cummins,
Westbrook, Kelley, Cleveland, Lewis,
Santiago, Pierce Scott, Brancatelli,
Conwell, Coats, Zone, Britt, Brady,
Keane, Cimperman, Polensek, Johnson, Turner and White.
An emergency resolution calling
on the United States government to
commit and develop a firm strategy
and timetable to begin the orderly
and comprehensive withdrawal of
U.S. military personnel and bases
from Iraq as soon as possible; urging the United States Congress to
pass
legislation
prohibiting
the
President from spending taxpayer
dollars on any new escalation in
Iraq,
expansion
of
the
conflict
beyond Iraqi borders, or military
operations against Iran; further urging the United States government to
provide the people of Iraq with all
necessary non-military material aid
necessary for the security of Iraq’s
citizens and for the rebuilding of
Iraq; and further urging the U.S.
Congress to redirect financial resources used to prosecute the war in
order to address the pressing needs
of Americans, including health, education, and homeland security.
Whereas, the United States has
been engaged in a war in Iraq for
more than four years; and
Whereas, U.S. involvement in Iraq
has resulted in the deaths of more
than 3,500 U.S. soldiers, including
148 soldiers from Ohio, and the
wounding and disabling of more
than 25,350 U.S. military personnel
to date, including 1,056 soldiers from
Ohio; and
Whereas, in Resolution No. 100-03,
adopted January 27, 2003, this Council unilateral military action against
Iraq and called for President Bush
to seek a peaceful resolution of
issues with Iraq as a alternative to
war; and
Whereas, in Resolution No. 132-06,
adopted January 23, 2006, this Council called for an immediate and comprehensive withdrawal of United
States military personnel and bases
from Iraq with no such actions having been taken or officially planned
for thus far by the U. S. Government; and
Whereas, the war will further
extend National Guard tours in Iraq,
that the costs to the states of the
call-up of National Guard members
for deployment in Iraq have been
significant, as reckoned in lost
lives, combat injuries and psychic
trauma, disruption of family life,
financial hardship for individuals,
families and businesses, interruption of careers and damage to the
fabric of civic life in our communi-

June 13, 2007
ties, including natural disaster recovery; and
Whereas, the American troops
have valiantly upheld their duty in
Iraq under dire circumstances; and
Whereas, more than $432 billion
has been appropriated by Congress
to fund military operations and reconstruction in Iraq to date, money
that could fund desperately needed
education,
health
care,
housing,
nutrition and other social services in
our
communities
in
the
United
States or humanitarian assistance
abroad; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland’s
share in that is more than $405 million toward costs associated with
the war in Iraq. And further that
the cost to Ohioans is more than $15
billion, and
Whereas, previous budgets that
have prioritized Iraq have led to
cuts in critical block grants for
states and have increased the federal debt, which compounded by
interest payments, will likely lead
to even larger cuts in funding for
critical needs in the States; and
Whereas, a vast majority of Americans do not support continuing
American involvement in Iraq and
favor a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops as indicated by a
majority of polls; and
Whereas, legal experts on all
sides have determined that Congress
has not only broad authority, but a
long tradition of limiting escalation
or forcing redeployment of troops
through the Constitutionally-designated power of the purse; and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
that the stability of Iraq is crucial
to the security of the citizens of
Cleveland and to all Americans; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council calls
on the United States government to
commit and develop a firm strategy
and timetable to begin the orderly
and comprehensive withdrawal of
U.S. military personnel and bases
from Iraq as soon as possible.
Section 2. That this Council urges
the United States Congress to pass
legislation prohibiting the President
from spending taxpayer dollars on
any new escalation in Iraq, expansion of the conflict beyond Iraqi borders, or military operations against
Iran.
Section 3. That this Council further urges the United States government to provide the people of
Iraq with all necessary non-military
material aid necessary for the security of Iraq’s citizens and for the
rebuilding of Iraq.
Section 4. That this Council further urges the U.S. Congress to redirect financial resources used to prosecute the war in order to address
the pressing needs of Americans,
including health, education, and

this resolution to President George
W. Bush, United States Senator
George Voinovich, United States Sen-

By Council Member Santiago.
An emergency resolution declaring
June, 2007 as LGBT (lesbian, gay,
bisexual and transgender) Pride
Month in Cleveland.
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
recognizes and values diversity in
the City’s residents; and
Whereas, this City has reaffirmed
its commitment to diversity and tolerance by prohibiting discrimination
in City employment based upon sexual orientation as well as race, religious, sex, disability and ethnic status under Section 187.11(B) of the
Codified Ordinances; and
Whereas, many communities and
organizations
across
the
United
States will celebrate June, 2007 as
“LGBT Pride Month” to recognize
the significance that LGBT (lesbian,
gay,
bisexual
and
transgender)
Americans have made throughout
our nation’s history; and
Whereas, in an effort to further
build and strengthen our communities and nation, we must move
beyond
merely
“tolerating”
the
LGBT community, but instead value
them as our colleagues and neighbors, daughters and sons, sisters
and brothers, and friends and partners; and
Whereas, much has been accomplished over the last generation to
promote equality and justice, as
society and our laws reflect the
recognition that diversity and tolerance is strength in a progressive
culture, yet many challenges still
remain, as prejudice against members of the LGBT community can
still erupt into acts of hatred, violence and discrimination; now therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council declares June, 2007 as LGBT (lesbian,
gay,
bisexual
and
transgender)
Pride Month.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby directed to transmit copies of

1009

decency, sobriety, peace or good

An emergency resolution urging
the Governor to reevaluate the Ohio
Graduation Test (OGT) so that it is
less likely to cause hardship for
high school seniors planning to
graduate and to provide additional
funding for supplemental training
and tutoring to students in need of
extra academic assistance.
Whereas, the graduating class of
2007 is the first class required to
take
the
Ohio
Graduation
Test
(OGT) in order to graduate from
high school; and
Whereas, the OGT is a five-part
exam that tests students in five subjects; it is the new standard by
which high school seniors can graduate; and
Whereas, as of last March, as
many as 30,000 seniors in the state
still needed to pass one or more sections of the OGT in order to graduate in May; and
Whereas, the OGT is more demanding than the former Ohio proficiency test; and
Whereas, seniors from all over
Ohio are unable to graduate this
year due to failure of the OGT; and
Whereas, a senior can have all the
credits required to graduate, and
have passed all the classes, however, failing the test in even one subject will keep a senior from graduating with his or her class; and
Whereas, this Council respects the
statutory requirements and strongly
supports the mandate of standards
for students to earn a diploma in the
State of Ohio, however, considering
the high failure rate of 30,000 students, it is imperative that some
consideration is given to students
who have invested 13 years in earning high school credits that under
different circumstances would have
allowed them to graduate with their
diplomas;
Whereas, school officials should
at least allow those seniors who
failed a portion of the test by a
small margin, to march in the graduation ceremony with their class.
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Governor to reevaluate the Ohio
Graduation Test (OGT) so that it is
less likely to cause hardship for
Ohio’s high school seniors planning
to graduate and encourages school
officials to allow those seniors failing the OGT by a very small margin to at least march in graduation
ceremonies with their classmates.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby directed to send copies of the resolution to Governor Ted Strickland,
the members of the state board of
education, Eugene Sanders, CEO of
Cleveland Public Schools, and the
superintendents of all local boards
of education.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
