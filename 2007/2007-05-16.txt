agriculture, our culture, and almost
every other aspect of our way of
life; and

and
industry,
energy
producers,
agriculture, colleges and universities, and government to play a larger role than just the environmental
community in order to solve the
problems of global climate change
in Ohio; and

board consisting of the directors of
Environmental Protection, Natural
Resources, and Development, four
members of the Ohio General Assembly, a representative of a statewide
environmental organization, a representative of Ohio’s energy industries, and experts in global climate
change; and

be empowered to work in cooperation with agencies in other states or
the federal government, and would
issue a preliminary report by June
30, 2008, and a final report by
December 31, 2008; and
Whereas, proposed House Bill 128,
if passed, will benefit the City of
Cleveland by providing information
