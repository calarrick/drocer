An emergency ordinance determining the method of making the
public improvement of repairing
and maintaining runways, taxiways, ramps, roads, and other concrete surfaces for the various divisions of the Department of Port
Control, and authorizing the Director to enter into one or more public improvement requirement contracts
for
the
making
of
the
improvement.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

Section 1. That, under Section 167
of the Charter of the City of Cleveland, this Council determines to
make the public improvement of
repairing and maintaining runways,
taxiways, ramps, roads, and other

duly let to the lowest responsible
bidder or bidders on a unit basis for
the improvement.
Section 2. That the Director of
Port Control is authorized to make
one or more written requirement
contracts under the Charter and the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,

a period up to two years, with two
one-year options to renew, for the
making of the above public improvement with the lowest responsible bidder or bidders after competitive bidding on a unit basis for the
improvement for a period not to
exceed the specified term, purchased
by the Commissioner of Purchases
and Supplies on a unit basis for the
various divisions of the Department
of Port Control. The first of the oneyear options to renew shall not be
exercised without additional legislative authority. If such additional
legislation authority is granted and
the first of the one-year options to
renew is exercised, then the second
of the one-year options to renew
shall be exercisable at the option of
the Director of Port Control without
the necessity of obtaining additional
authority of this Council. Bids shall
be taken in a manner that permits
an award to be made for all items
as a single contract, or by separate
contract for each or any combination of the items as the Board of
Control determines. Alternate bids
for a period less than the specified
term may be taken if desired by the
Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies until provision is made for the
requirements for the entire term.
Section 3. That the costs of the
contract
or
contracts
shall
be
charged against the proper appropriation accounts and the Director
of Finance shall certify the amount
of the initial purchase, which purchase, together with all later purchases, shall be made on order of
the Commissioner of Purchases and
Supplies under a requisition against
the contract or contracts certified by
the Director of Finance. (RL 158683)
Section 4. That under Section
108(b) of the Charter, the purchases
authorized by this ordinance may be
made
through
cooperative
agreements using state procedures. The
Director of Port Control may sign all
documents with the State of Ohio or
any of its political subdivisions that
are necessary to make the purchases,
and may enter into one or more contracts with the vendors selected
through that cooperative process.
Section 5. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

to a long term purchase by AMPOhio from J. Aron & Company (“J.
Aron”).
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
owns and operates an electric utility system, Cleveland Public Power,
for the sale of electric power and
associated energy for the benefit of
its citizens and taxpayers; and
Whereas, in order to satisfy the
electric power and energy requirements of its electric utility system,
the City of Cleveland has purchased
economical and reliable power and
energy from AMP-Ohio, of which the
City is a Member, or has purchased
power arranged by AMP-Ohio; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
acting individually and along with
other municipalities which own and
operate electric utility systems jointly through AMP-Ohio, endeavors to
arrange
for
reliable,
reasonably
priced supplies of electric power and
energy for ultimate delivery to its
customers; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has executed a Master Services
Agreement with AMP-Ohio which
sets forth the general terms and
conditions
for
the
provision
of

May 23, 2007
power supply and other services by
AMP-Ohio to the City; and
Whereas, AMP-Ohio has acquired
by contract with J. Aron (the “Original J. Aron Contract”) economical
long-term power and energy which
has been made available for resale
to certain AMP-Ohio Members, including
the
City
of
Cleveland
(“Municipalities”), on a long-term
basis; and
Whereas, under the authority of
Ordinance No. 244-06, passed March
20, 2006, the City of Cleveland previously determined that it could beneficially utilize a portion of such
energy and executed an agreement
(the “Original Power Schedule) with

Aron Contract at the stated contract
price to the City of $0.04455 per
kWh, excluding taxes, transmission

a reduction in the Contract Price;
and
Whereas, the amount of the Prepayment will correspond to the
shares of power and energy of the
City of Cleveland and Municipalities
authorizing power schedules substantially
identical
to
the
New
Power Schedule (“Participants”); and
Whereas, not all Municipalities
may become Participants; and
Whereas, an amendment to the
Original J. Aron Contract relating to
the Prepayment will enable AMPOhio to offer long-term power and
energy to Participants at a discount
price, excluding taxes, transmission
costs, replacement power and AMPOhio service fees (the “Discount
Price”), from the Contract Price that
would otherwise be charged by
AMP-Ohio to service its obligations
under the Original J. Aron Contract;
and
Whereas, AMP-Ohio intends to
issue bonds to finance the Prepayment and the City of Cleveland
requests it to do so; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
desires to obtain the benefit of the
Discount Price and consents to the
issuance of bonds by AMP-Ohio on
its behalf to effect the Prepayment;
and
Whereas, AMP-Ohio has offered to
enter into an agreement (the “New
Power Schedule”), supplementary to
its Master Services Agreement with
the City of Cleveland, that will
amend and restate the Original
Power Schedule to provide that
AMP-Ohio will agree to obtain and
sell to the City, and the City will
agree to take and pay for, a share
of the power and energy acquired
by AMP-Ohio under an amendment
to the Original J. Aron Contract (the
Original J. Aron Contract, as so
amended, the “Prepayment Agreement”); and
Whereas, it is understood by the
City of Cleveland that the ability of
AMP-Ohio to offer power and energy to the City at the Discount Price
will be governed by the terms of the
Prepayment Agreement, and that,
under certain conditions, the Pre-

The City Record
payment Agreement may be terminated prior to December 31, 2012;
and
Whereas, it is further understood
by the City of Cleveland that, in the
event the Prepayment Agreement
shall be terminated by J. Aron or
AMP-Ohio for any reason, the New
Power Schedule will require AMPOhio to continue to sell, and the City
to purchase, power and energy at
the Contract Price, rather than the
Discount Price, effective on the date
of the termination; and
Whereas, it is understood by the
City of Cleveland that all payments
made by the City under the New
Power Schedule will continue to constitute an operation and maintenance obligation of the City’s electric utility system, payable from the
revenues thereof in accordance with
the New Power Schedule, and the
City agrees, as specified in the New
Power Schedule, to fix, charge and
collect rates sufficient to pay its
obligations along with all other
legally required obligations of the
City’s electric utility system; and
