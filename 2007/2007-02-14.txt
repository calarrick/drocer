February 14, 2007
Whereas, Chapter 187 of the Cleveland Codified Ordinances was enacted to remedy the present and past
discrimination against minority and
female business enterprises (MBE/FBE)
in Cleveland; and
Whereas, the historical purpose of
Chapter 187 is to increase the utilization of MBE/FBE participation
in City contracting; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council

187 through the use of “front organizations”; and
Whereas, contractors who violate
Chapter 187 can be prohibited from
obtaining further contracts with the
City; and
Whereas, all contractors doing
business with the City of Cleveland
are required to acknowledge and
agree to abide by Chapter 187 of the
Codified Ordinances; and
Whereas, due to comments reported in the media attributed to Ricardo Teamor made during a federal
investigation, the City of Cleveland
retained attorney Craig White of the
Hahn Loeser & Parks law firm on
August 26, 2005 for the purpose of
conducting an investigation to determine whether any contractors, including, Anthony Allega Cement
Contractors, Inc., Chem Ty Environmental, Inc. and/or RMC, Inc. violated Chapter 187; and
Whereas, attorney White concluded that Anthony Allega Cement Contractors, Inc., inflated its reported
use MBE/FBE subcontractors on
City Contract No. 57337 for Project
E205, New Runway 5L-23R, now designated as Runway 6L-24R, at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport;
and

found Anthony Allega Cement Contractors, Inc., RMC, Inc. and Chem
Ty
Environmental
had
violated
Chapter 187 through the intentional
use of “front organizations” on Contract No. 57337; and
Whereas, the Administrator of the
City of Cleveland Office of Equal
Opportunity also determined that
RMC, Inc. and Chem Ty were front
organizations for Anthony Allega
Cement Contractors, Inc., and that
said companies never performed any
commercially use function as a subcontractor on City Contract No. 57337
despite being paid millions of dollars to do so; and
Whereas, the Administrator specifically found that Anthony Allega
Cement Contractors, Inc defrauded
the City of Cleveland by soliciting,
inducing and employing front organizations in the execution of City

the Administration to take appropriate
civil
and
criminal
legal
action, and send recent Office of

Opportunity
findings
of
Minority Business and Female Business Enterprise Code violations by
the airport runway expansion contractors to the Cuyahoga County
Prosecutor’s Office and the United
States Department of Justice, United States Attorney’s Office to investigate and take legal action if warranted.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
Office of Equal Opportunity’s investigation found that the majorityowned contractor firm, paid $130
million by the City for the airport
runway expansion, solicited businesses headed by minorities and
women as front companies; and
Whereas, the City’s investigation
found that two of the front companies did no work, though paid
more than $11.5 million, other than
to funnel money back to the majority-owned main contractor firm;
and
Whereas, the City’s investigation
further found that the majorityowned main contractor firm submitted false statements on the companies’ performance, and fraudulently
obtained and aided others in obtaining public money for work to which
they were not entitled; and
Whereas,
the
majority-owned
main contractor should pay damages based on what would have
been paid to minority subcontractors if they had actually done the
work as promised, and should face
criminal
prosecution
if
further
investigation confirms allegations
of fraud; and
Whereas, the main purpose of the
Minority
Business
and
Female

increase the number of legitimate
minority contractors granted City
contracts, not to grant money to
fronts; and

Administration, the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor’s Office and the United States Department of Justice,
United States Attorney’s Office to
investigate and take legal action if
warranted against these contractors
in order to deter abusers of the public trust and taxpayers’ money, and

Res. No. 206-07.
By Council Members Kelley, Cummins, Britt, Zone, Cimperman, Sweeney, Coats, Brancatelli and Conwell.
An emergency resolution supporting an alternatives analysis investigating the benefits, costs and environmental impacts of various transportation improvement alternatives
in the West Shore Corridor in accordance with NEPA and FTA requirements; and requesting the Northeast
Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency
(NOACA) to secure a federal transportation appropriation of approximately $1.5 million in federal fiscal
years 2008 and 2009 through the
Lorain-Cleveland Commuter Rail funding authorization in SAFETEA-LU
for the West Shore Corridor alternatives analysis.
Whereas, West Shore communities’ residents see improved public
transportation services as an opportunity to improve the region’s economic
development
opportunities
and the quality of life for all Northeast Ohioans regardless of their age,
income or physical mobility; and
Whereas, a locally based constituency is growing for the creation of
improved regional public transportation linking the businesses and residents between West Shore communities and Downtown Cleveland; and
Whereas, higher quality public
transportation services will connect
communities and stimulate investment in commercial, office and residential development in transit station-area districts; and
Whereas, improved public transportation to Downtown Cleveland
increases the chances of improving
other
community
infrastructure,
such as roadways, railroad gradecrossings, hiking/biking routes, improved way-finding signage, better
transit waiting environments and
related features; and
Whereas, the alternatives for developing higher-quality transit service in the West Shore Corridor are
varied and the impacts of these
alternatives on the natural and built
environments must be better understood; and
Whereas, the actual capital, operating and maintenance costs and
benefits associated with these alternatives need to be defined and analyzed; and
Whereas, an alternatives analysis
in compliance with the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
and Federal Transit Administration
(FTA) New Starts regulations requires significant public participation so a locally preferred alternative can be selected and adopted by
the region; and
Whereas, the Lorain – Cleveland
Commuter Rail project is authorized
in the federal surface transportation law entitled Safe, Accountable,
Flexible, Efficient Transportation
Equity Act: A Legacy for Users
(SAFETEA-LU) and that an appropriation is needed to fund the alternatives analysis under Section 5339
of SAFETEA-LU; and
Whereas, this Council embraces
the vision of improving public transportation services from the West
Shore Corridor to Downtown Cleveland; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the

The City Record
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports an alternatives analysis
investigating the benefits, costs and
environmental impacts of various
transportation improvement alternatives in the West Shore Corridor in
accordance with NEPA and FTA
requirements;
and
requests
the
Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency (NOACA) to secure a
federal transportation appropriation
of approximately $1.5 million in federal fiscal years 2008 and 2009
through the Lorain-Cleveland Commuter Rail funding authorization in
SAFETEA-LU for the West Shore
Corridor alternatives analysis.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to each member of the Ohio congressional delegation, to appropriate state legislators, the board of the Northeast Ohio
Areawide Coordinating Agency, the
Ohio Department of Transportation’s
Public Transit Division, and the
Ohio Rail Development Commission.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

and

An emergency resolution urging
the Federal Drug Administration to
review its policy that bans gay men
from donating blood.
Whereas, The American Red Cross
and other organizations that collect
donated blood are urging the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) to
review its policy in effect since the
early 1980s that prohibits men who
have sex with men – regardless of
sexual activity, safer-sex practices
or HIV status – from donating
blood; and
Whereas, potential blood donors
are asked to fill out a questionnaire
before donating, and men who have
had sex with another man, even
once, since 1977 are prohibited from
donating; and
Whereas, the American Association of Blood Banks and America’s
Blood Centers say that the likelihood of receiving a unit of HIVinfected blood is one in two million,
and that blood banks now use nucleic acid testing that detects HIV with
over 99% accuracy in a matter of
weeks after infection; and
Whereas,
the
current
policy’s
focus on gay men is discriminatory,
because HIV is increasingly trans-

256

February 14, 2007
mitted through heterosexual sex,
and women account for more than
one-quarter of all new HIV/AIDS
cases in the United States, according to the Center for Disease Control; and
Whereas, the American Red Cross
and other organizations that collect
donated blood worry that the FDA
policy is outdated and is cutting off
a potential source of blood that is
sorely needed; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the Federal Drug Administration to review its policy that
bans gay men from donating blood.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to the American Red
Cross, the AIDS Taskforce of Greater
Cleveland, and the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Community Center of Greater Cleveland.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Res. No. 222-07.
By Council Members Zone, Cummins, Dolan and Turner.
An emergency resolution strongly
encouraging Ohio’s Attorney General to investigate and determine how
to stop used car dealers from issuing predatory loans.
Whereas, many independent used
car dealers market to people who
have poor or no credit; and
Whereas, these independent used
car dealers use the strategy of “buy
here, pay here” to bring in such people to purchase cars at very high
interest rates; and
Whereas, these independent used
car dealers often sell cars that
already have high mileage, often at
an interest rate of as much as 60%;
and
Whereas, people purchasing these
used cars buy them “as is” and,
because Ohio law does not protect a
buyer whose purchase is “as is”, the
buyer ends up responsible for any
problems that occur with the car
after the sale; and
Whereas, consumer protection laws
in Ohio do not regulate used car
sales, and Ohio’s Lemon Law does
not apply to used cars; and
Whereas, the tactics of some of
these independent used car dealers
prey on people who can least afford
it; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,

February 14, 2007
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
strongly encourages Ohio’s Attorney
General to investigate and determine how to stop used car dealers
from issuing predatory loans.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to Governor Strickland, Lt. Governor Fisher, Marc
Dann, Attorney General, all members
of the Ohio House of Representatives
and Ohio Senate, Cuyahoga County
Commissioners,
Cuyahoga
County
Mayors and Managers Association,
and the members of the Northeast
Ohio City Council Association.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

February 14, 2007
In the event that the Director of
Finance, based on the written advice of a Financial Advisor, determines that the City’s best interests
will be served by causing a Series
of 2007 Bonds to be obligations bearing interest at variable interest
rates, then the Director of Finance
is authorized to so specify in the
Certificate of Award for that Series.
If the Director of Finance so determines, then the method and procedure by which the variable rate of
interest to be borne by the 2007
Bonds of that Series shall be determined as provided in the applicable
Supplemental Indenture, whether by
auction, by reference to a market
index, by a remarketing agent or
otherwise; provided that no Series of
2007 Bonds shall bear interest at a
rate in excess of sixteen percent
(16%) per year. Notwithstanding
that limitation, a Series of 2007
Bonds held by a provider of a Credit Support Instrument may bear
interest at a rate not in excess of
twenty-five percent (25%) per year
as provided in the agreement with
the provider of the Credit Support
Instrument. The Director of Finance
may determine that the terms of a
variable rate Series of 2007 Bonds
may or may not permit the Holders
to tender their variable rate 2007
Bonds for purchase by the City. If
the Director of Finance designates
any Series of 2007 Bonds as variable
rate 2007 Bonds, and if the Holders
of that Series of 2007 Bonds are to
be entitled to tender those 2007
Bonds for purchase, then the Director of Finance shall also designate
in the Certificate of Award for those
variable rate 2007 Bonds, the tender
agent or agents and the remarketing agent or agents, which designations shall be based on the determination of the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the parties
so designated possess the requisite
resources and experience to provide
the services required of them and
that the terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide
such services are fair and commercially reasonable. The Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements in connection with the
delivery of the 2007 Bonds, and from
time to time thereafter so long as
the 2007 Bonds are outstanding,
with providers of Credit Support
Instruments, tender agents (which
may be the Trustee), remarketing
agents (which may be any of the
Original Purchasers) and others as
may be determined by the Director
of Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the method of
determining the variable interest
rates, permitting holders the right
of tender and providing for payment
of the purchase price of, or debt service on, the variable rate 2007
Bonds. In the event the variable rate
2007 Bonds are issued as auction
rate obligations, the Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements with auction agents and
others, or to cause the Trustee to
enter into those agreements, based
on the written advice of a Financial
Advisor that the parties so designated
possess
the
requisite
resources and experience to provide

The City Record
the services required of them and
that the terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide
such services are fair and commercially reasonable. The Director of
Finance is authorized to pay any
fees associated with agreements
entered into pursuant to this Section
from proceeds of the 2007 Bonds, to
the extent permitted by the Indenture, and from the Net Revenues of
the Utility (as each term is defined
in the Indenture).
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of
any Series of 2007 Bonds, and
regardless of whether that Series of
2007 Bonds bears interest at variable or fixed rates, is authorized to
contract for one or more Credit Support Instruments, and to pay the
costs of Credit Support Instruments
from proceeds of the 2007 Bonds, if
she determines, based on the written advice of a Financial Advisor,
that the Credit Support Instrument
will result in a savings in the cost
of the financing to the City.
The Refunded Bonds shall be designated by the Director of Finance
in the Certificate of Award and
shall consist of those Outstanding
Revenue Bonds the refunding of
which from proceeds of a Series of
2007 bonds will provide to the City
net present value debt service savings of not less than three percent
(3%). The Director of Finance may
rely on the written advice of the
Financial Advisor in making that
determination. The Refunded Bonds
shall be called for redemption or
retired on the date or dates specified in the Certificate of Award. The
redemption dates so specified shall
be the dates required under the
Code for compliance with Section
149(d) of the Code and other applicable federal tax laws.
Section 3. Sale of 2007 Bonds. The
Director of Finance shall sign and
deliver a Certificate of Award for
the 2007 Bonds. In the event the 2007
Bonds are issued in more than one
Series sold at different times, a separate Certificate of Award shall be
signed and delivered for each separately delivered Series. The sale of
the 2007 Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchasers selected by
the Director of Finance and identified in the Certificate of Award, following consultation with the Director of Public Utilities and based on
an evaluation of the qualifications

the
applicable
Supplemental
Indenture, and any determination as

Debt Service Reserve Fund;
(j) the Paying Agent; and
(k) whether any 2007 Bonds are to

Section 9. Interest Hedge Agreements. This Council finds that by
engaging in interest rate hedging
arrangements with respect to Water
Revenue Bonds, from time to time,
in which different interest costs or
receipts at, between, or among fixed
or floating interest rates, including
at different floating interest rates,
are exchanged on stated amounts
with reference to Water Revenue
Bonds, the City may reduce its cost
of borrowing or optimize the relative amounts of its fixed and variable rate obligations or minimize
the risk of variations in its debt service costs. To permit the City to
have the flexibility to undertake
interest rate swaps, swap options,
rate caps, rate collars and other
hedging transactions with respect to
Water Revenue Bonds, from time to
time, and to establish the procedures
for approving those transactions,
this Council authorizes the signing
and delivery of one or more agreements (each, a “Hedge Agreement”)
in anticipation of the issuance of
the 2007 Bonds or subsequent to the
issuance of any Outstanding Revenue Bonds and further authorizes
the signing and delivery of any
related agreements necessary for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by each Hedge
Agreement. The authorizations in
this Section 9 are supplemental to
and not in derogation of any authority provided by any other ordinance
of this Council concerning hedging
arrangements.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is to the financial advantage of the City and in the City’s
best
interests
that
a
hedging
arrangement be undertaken by the
City with respect to any Outstanding Revenue Bonds or any Series of
2007 Bonds, the Director of Finance
may authorize one or more interest
rate hedge transactions in accordance with the applicable Hedge
Agreement; provided that (a) the

261

29
counterparty shall be rated at the
time of signing the Hedge Agreement not lower than A+ or A1 by
at least one rating agency or its
obligations under the Hedge Agreement shall be guaranteed or insured
by an entity rated at the time of
signing the Hedge Agreement not
lower than A+ or A1 by at least one
rating agency, and (b) the term of
each hedge transaction shall not
exceed the final maturity of the
Bonds to which the hedge relates or
(in the case of an option or forward
delivery) will relate.
The Director of Finance shall
negotiate the terms of each Hedge
Agreement with a counterparty satisfying the credit criteria in this
Ordinance. The City shall receive a
written opinion of a Financial Advisor that the upfront payment or the
periodic payments, as the case may
be, to be made by the counterparty
to the City, or by the City to the
counterparty, shall be fair value for
the Hedge Agreement, given the
credit of the counterparty and the
terms and conditions of the Hedge
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall determine the terms and conditions of the Hedge Agreement,
including without limitation, the
time or times and procedures for the
exercise by the counterparty or the
City, as the case may be, of any
option under the Hedge Agreement,
whether the obligations of the City
under the Hedge Agreement shall be
secured by a Credit Support Instrument, and the rates to be paid by
the counterparty to the City and by
the City to the counterparty under
the Hedge Agreement. The approval
of each hedge transaction by the
Director of Finance shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing and
delivery of the applicable Hedge
Agreement
by
the
Director
of
Finance.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from the Net Revenues of the Utility (each term as defined in the
Indenture) and may be secured by
a pledge of the Net Revenues on a
parity with the pledge given under
the Indenture to secure Bonds, subject to the requirements of Article
XI of the Indenture with respect to
Parity Obligations. The obligation
of the City to make payments under
a Hedge Agreement does not and
shall not represent or constitute a
general obligation, debt, bonded
indebtedness or a pledge of the faith
and credit of the City. Nothing shall
give any party to a Hedge Agreement the right to have excises, ad
valorem or other taxes levied by the
City or the State for the payment of
any amounts due under a Hedge
Agreement.
Section 10. Covenants of the City.
The City, by issuance of the 2007
Bonds, covenants and agrees with
the Holders of the 2007 Bonds, that:

30

Indenture and will comply with all
requirements of law applicable to
the Waterworks System and the
operation thereof.

2731.01, Ohio Revised Code.
(e) The City will use, and will
restrict the use and investment of,
the proceeds of the 2007 Bonds in

may be necessary so that (a) the
2007 Bonds will not (i) constitute
private activity bonds, arbitrage
bonds or hedge bonds under Sections
141, 148 or 149 of the Code or (ii) be
treated other than as bonds to which
Section 103(a) of the Code applies,
and (b) the interest thereon will not
be treated as an item of tax preference under Section 57 of the Code.
(f) The City covenants that (a) it
will take or cause to be taken such
actions that may be required of it
for the interest on the 2007 Bonds to
be and to remain excluded from
gross income for federal income tax
purposes, (b) it will not take or
authorize to be taken any actions
that would adversely affect that
exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting for it, will, among other acts of
compliance, (i) apply the proceeds
of the 2007 Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing,
(ii) restrict the yield on investment
property acquired with those proceeds, (iii) make timely rebate payments to the federal government,
(iv) maintain books and records and
make calculations and reports, and
(v) refrain from certain uses of proceeds, and, as applicable, of property financed with such proceeds, all
in such manner and to the extent
necessary to assure such exclusion
of that interest under the Code.
Each covenant made in this section with respect to the 2007 Bonds
is also made with respect to all
issues for which any portion of the

The City Record
debt service is paid from proceeds
of the 2007 Bonds (and, if different,
the original issue and any refunding issues in a Series of refundings), to the extent such compliance
is necessary to assure exclusion of
interest on the 2007 Bonds from
gross income for federal income tax
purposes,
and
the
Director
of
Finance, or any other officer having
responsibility with respect to the
2007 Bonds, is authorized to take
such actions with respect to those
issues as they are authorized in this
section to take with respect to the
2007 Bonds.
The
Mayor,
the
Director
of
Finance or any other appropriate
officer of the City is authorized (a)
to make or effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent,
approval or waiver on behalf of the
City with respect to the 2007 Bonds
as the City is permitted or required
to make or give under the federal
income tax laws, including, without
limitation, any of the elections
available under Section 148 of the
Code, for the purpose of assuring,
enhancing or protecting the favorable tax treatment or status of the
2007 Bonds or interest thereon or
assisting
compliance
with
requirements for that purpose, reducing the burden or expense of compliance, reducing the rebate amount
or payments or penalties, or making
payments of special amounts in lieu
of making computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as
rebate, or obviating those amount or
payments, as determined by that
officer, (b) to take any and all other
actions, make or obtain calculations,
make payments, and make or give
reports, covenants and certifications
of and on behalf of the City, as may
be appropriate to assure the exclusion of interest from gross income
and the intended tax status of the
2007 Bonds, and (c) to give one or
more appropriate certificates of the
City, for inclusion in the transcript

they are based, and other facts and
circumstances relevant to the tax
treatment or status of the 2007
Bonds and interest thereon.

Rating and Credit Enhancement. If,
in the judgment of the Director of
