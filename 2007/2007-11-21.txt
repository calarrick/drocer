Res. No. 1902-07.
By Council Member Britt.
An emergency resolution encouraging the Jackson administration
and State of Ohio to examine the
City of Cleveland retirement system’s investments to determine if
funds are invested in scrutinized
companies operating in Sudan; and
if such companies are found in the
City’s retirement portfolio, encourage those companies to cease scrutinized business operations in Sudan, and cease investments in scrutinized companies until the Sudanese government stops military
forces from committing genocide in
Darfur.
Whereas, the government of Sudan has engaged in a policy of
genocide against its own civilians in
Darfur through use of its military
and through sponsorship of attacks
by armed militias known as the janjaweed; and
Whereas, the janjaweed and military of the Sudanese government
are responsible for razing over 80%
of Darfur’s villages, gang-raping
civilians,
slaughtering
at
least
200,000 victims, displacing 2.5 million more, using forced starvation as
a weapon of war, and impeding
access of humanitarian aid to the up
to 3.5 million Darfurians that are
now reliant on assistance; and
Whereas, the Sudanese government and janjaweed militias have
continued their attacks despite the
signing of the Darfur Peace Agreement; and
Whereas, the Darfur crisis represents the first time the US Congress,
State Department, and President

26
have declared a genocide while the
atrocities are ongoing; and
Whereas,
certain
international
companies operating in Sudan bring
significant revenue, cover, and arms
to the Sudanese government while
providing little benefit to the majority of Sudan’s citizens; and
Whereas, Khartoum has funneled
the majority of foreign direct investment from these companies into military expenditures used to perpetuate the genocide while neglecting
needed development projects in the
Darfur region; and
Whereas, the government of Sudan has a history of remedying
egregious behavior in response to
economic pressure; and
Whereas, the current Sudan divestment movement now encompasses
nearly 100 universities, cities, states,
and private pension plans; and
Whereas, the divestment movement has already gained the attention of the Sudanese government
and altered the behavior of some
companies operating in Sudan;
Whereas, this Council encourages
the Jackson administration and the
State of Ohio investment managers
to examine City retirement investments and short-term investment
pool to determine if funds are
invested in scrutinized companies
operating in Sudan.
Whereas, scrutinized companies
shall be defined as those companies
that:
1. Engage in business with actors
or projects that directly or indirectly benefit the government of Sudan
through providing revenue or arms
to the government or by enhancing
the government’s capacity to resist
international pressure on Darfur;
2. Provide minimal benefit to
those outside of government or the
small circle of government supporters based mainly in the Khartoum
state;
3. Have no significant corporate
governance policy to address how a
company’s business in Sudan may
contribute to the genocide in Darfur;
and
Whereas, Companies that meet
any of the following criteria shall
not be considered scrutinized companies:
1. Companies contracting exclusively with the Government of South
Sudan;
2. Companies primarily participating in the provision of goods or services that principally and directly
benefit marginalized populations in
Sudan;
3. Companies involved in the distribution of general downstream
consumer goods and services within
the country;
4. Companies whose primary purpose in Sudan is humanitarian, medical, journalistic, educational, or any
other “social good;”
5. Companies whose activities in
Sudan are currently dormant; and
Whereas, this Council encourages
the
Jackson
administration
and
State of Ohio to identify scrutinized
companies to implement the above
policy by consulting, on a quarterly
basis, a list promulgated by the
Sudan Divestment Task Force; and
Whereas, if it is found that the
City of Cleveland’s retirement funds
are being invested in scrutinized

The City Record
companies operating in Sudan, this
Council encourages the City retirement system and its investment
managers to undertake the following procedure with respect to these
identified companies:
1. Engage these companies for a
period of no longer than three
months in an effort to convince
them to alter or cease scrutinized
business operations in Sudan, using
engagement letters are available
from the Sudan Divestment Task
Force;
2. If a scrutinized company undertakes any of the following actions
during the engagement period, they
shall no longer be considered a scrutinized company: adopting, publicizing, and implementing a formal plan
to cease Scrutinized Business Operations within one year and to
refrain from any such new Business
Operations; undertaking humanitarian efforts in conjunction with an
international organization, the government of Sudan, the regional government of southern Sudan, or a
non-profit entity and evaluated and
certified by an independent third
party to be substantial in relationship to the company’s Sudan business operations and of benefit to
one or more marginalized populations of Sudan; or through engagement with the Government of Sudan,
materially improving conditions for
the genocidally victimized population in Darfur;
3. If a scrutinized company does
not exhibit any of these changes
during the engagement period, this
Council encourages the City’s retirement system and investment managers to divest all public securities
held in scrutinized companies, excluding public securities held in
commingled accounts or securities
where
no
financially
equivalent
alternative is available;
4. If the city is found to hold
securities in commingled funds that
contain scrutinized companies, this
Council encourages the City’s retirement system to submit letters to
the managers of such funds containing scrutinized companies requesting that they consider removing such companies from the fund
or create a similar actively managed fund with commingled holdings devoid of such companies, and
if the manager creates a similar
fund, the City’s retirement system
will replace all applicable investments with investments in the similar fund in an expedited timeframe
consistent with prudent investing
standards; and
Whereas, this Council encourages
the City retirement system’s investment
managers
to
continue
to
review your investments and take
action to restrict investments in
scrutinized companies as described
above on a quarterly basis; and
Whereas, this Council encourages
the City retirement system’s investment managers not to enter into further investments in offending companies until the Sudanese government stops its military and militia
forces from committing genocide in
Darfur; and
Whereas, this Council calls upon
the State of Ohio to follow the example of the City’s retirement system
and identify and divest from all

2100

November 21, 2007
companies meeting the above criteria, aiding Sudan’s genocidal government
without
benefiting
the
country’s marginalized populations.
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby encourages the Jackson administration and State of Ohio to examine the City of Cleveland retirement
system’s investments to determine if
funds are invested in scrutinized
companies operating in Sudan; and
if such companies are found in the
City’s retirement portfolio, encourage those companies to cease scrutinized
business
operations
in
Sudan, and cease investments in
scrutinized
companies
until
the
Sudanese government stops military
forces from committing genocide in
Darfur.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to the Sudan Divestment Task Force, State of Ohio
PERS, and Mayor Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force

Res. No. 1832-07.
By Council Members Coats, Conwell, Turner, Westbrook, Brancatelli, Cimperman, Zone, White, Britt,
Brady and Santiago.
An emergency resolution encouraging the protection of children
from the harmful effects of media
violence, and drawing attention to
media violence as a key community
concern.

The City Record
Whereas, the average American
youth spends more than 45 hours per
week exposed to various types of
media — television, film, video
games, the Internet and music —
and will witness 40,000 killings and
200,000 violent incidents through
these media by the time they turn
18 years old; and
Whereas, nearly 1,000 different
scientific studies have led to the
conclusion that media violence increases levels of aggression among
children and youth in the short term
and is a significant risk factor that
increases the likelihood of violent
behavior over the long term; and
Whereas, national experts from
the U.S. Surgeon General’s office,
the National Institutes of Mental
Health, the American Academy of
Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association have all concluded that repeated exposure to
media violence can lead children to
view violence as acceptable means
of settling conflicts, become emotionally desensitized to violence and
be more likely to exhibit violent
behavior themselves; and
Whereas, the health and welfare
of youth in the City of Cleveland is
of utmost importance to the quality
of life enjoyed by our residents; and
Whereas,
the
2007
National
League of Cities President Bart
Peterson, mayor of Indianapolis,
Indiana, has called on America’s
local elected officials to raise the
level of parental awareness about
the impact that media violence can
have on children; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
will work with PTAs and other community groups to encourage and
assist parents in taking a more
active role in monitoring the types
of media to which their children
have access; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
will hold a Public Safety Committee
hearing on December 12, 2007 for
community members, elected officials, youth residents and business
owners to discuss the impact of
media violence on youth and what
actions the community should take
to combat this impact; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
will engage local businesses that
sell and/or rent media products in
all discussions regarding our efforts
to inform and educate parents, particularly as it relates to established
rating systems; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
will increase public awareness about
and encourage young people to participate in community-sponsored activities for youth that serve as positive alternatives to media-related
activities; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby encourages the protection of children from the harmful effects of
media violence, and draws attention
to media violence as a key community concern.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to send certified copies of this resolution to the
National League of Cities President
Bart Peterson, mayor of Indianapolis, Indiana and Mayor Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of

2109

all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

Res. No. 1833-07.
By Council Members Coats, Keane,
Conwell, Britt, Turner, Brancatelli,
Westbrook, Santiago, Cimperman,
Pierce Scott, Polensek and Zone.
An emergency resolution encouraging the General Assembly of the
State of Ohio to pass a bill to designate State Route 2 known as
“Memorial Shoreway” within Cuyahoga County only as the “Carl B.
Stokes Memorial Highway.”
Whereas, Carl Stokes (1927-1996)
was elected to the Ohio House of
Representatives in the November
1962 election and was reelected in
1964 and 1966; and
Whereas, Mr. Stokes ran unsuccessfully for the office of mayor of
Cleveland in 1965, but was elected
to that post in the 1967 election, thus
becoming the first African-American
to serve as mayor of a major American city; and
Whereas, this month marks the
40th anniversary of Carl Stokes’
election to mayor of Cleveland, as
the first African-American mayor of
a major American City.
Whereas, reelected in 1969, Mr.
Stokes chose not to run for reelection in 1971 and was succeeded by
Ralph Perk; and
Whereas, he served as a municipal court judge from 1983-1994; and
Whereas, President Clinton appointed Mr. Stokes ambassador to
the Seychelles in 1994, and he served
that post until he developed cancer
and died in Cleveland in 1996; and
Whereas, currently the Cuyahoga
County portion of State Route 2
known as “Memorial Shoreway” does
not have a designation in the Ohio
Revised Code, and the State of Ohio
General Assembly has drafted a bill
at the Council’s request to enact a section of the Revised Code to designate
this portion of State Route 2 the “Carl
B. Stokes Memorial Highway.”
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby encourages the General Assembly of the State of Ohio to pass a
bill to designate State Route 2
known
as
“Memorial
Shoreway”
within Cuyahoga County only as the
“Carl B. Stokes Memorial Highway.”
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
two certified copies of this resolution to the General Assembly of the
State of Ohio, the Honorable Eugene
R. Miller, Ohio House of Representatives, and Mayor Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Section 1. That the Director of

the following alterations and modifications in Contract No. 65504 with
Fabrizi Trucking and Paving for
improvements to Jennings Road to
the Jennings Freeway Ramp, for the
Department of Public Service:
Subsidiary Additions
1. This project was designed in
conjunction with The towpath trail
initiative which follows Jennings
Rd. from Crestline Ave. to Harvard
Ave. A bike lane and sidewalk are
in place to convey the towpath traffic along Jennings Rd. However, a
means
of
conveying
pedestrians
from the Jennings Rd. section to the
Harvard Ave. bridge was overlooked
during design. In order to complete
this aspect of the Jennings Rd. Project, 1100 ft of new sidewalk on the
south side of Harvard Ave. is required.
Estimated cost:
$ 35,000.00
2. The draining near Bradley Rd.
does not function properly as designed and installed. Two additional
catch basins are necessary on the
east side of Jennings north of
Bradley Rd. in order to handle the
expected flow. Also, the existing
catch basin behind the sidewalk on
the west side of Jennings Rd. near
Bradley
needs
improvements
in
order to alleviate occasional flooding during heavy rain due to a large
runoff area. A new 24" lateral and
a new high capacity inlet grate are
required in order to handle the
expected flow.
Estimated cost:
$ 30,072.00
3. As W. 11th approaches Jennings
Rd., it descends a steep hill. The profile of this hill as designed resulted
in a large grade break at the intersection with Jennings and did not
allow for safe vehicle passage. A revised design was received for this
area from the Consultant and in
order to construct this transition
properly, the limits of construction
need to extend further up the hill
on W. 11th St. Additional layout, excavation and pavement will be necessary to construct In accordance with
the revised design.
Estimated cost:
$ 35,000.00
4. The Cleveland Water Department expressed concern with the
shallow cover over their water
mains located at the intersection of
Old Denison and Jennings Road.
Their consultant investigated the
option of lowering the water main
at a cost of $60,000 or raising the
west gutter line of Jennings Road
at the Old Denison intersection at
an additional cost of $15,000. The
City recommends raising the west
gutter line of Jennings Road to
increase the depth of cover over
their water mains.
