The Director of Public Service is
authorized to enter into one or more

requirement contracts for construction and demolition debris disposal
services, for the Division of Waste

Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Public Service is authorized to make
one or more written requirement
contracts under the Charter and the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, for the requirements for
the term of one or two years, for the
necessary items of construction and
demolition debris disposal services
in the approximate amount as purchased during the preceding term,

term may be taken if desired by the
Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies until provision is made for the
requirements for the entire term.
The Director of Public Service is
authorized to enter into one or more
contracts with a term of two years
instead of one year when there is a
financial advantage to the City. For
purposes of this ordinance, a financial advantage shall be determined
by the Director of Public Service by

terms.
Bids shall also be taken so as to
permit an award to be made for provision of such services citywide or
by separate contracts for the districts determined by the Director of
Public Service.
Section 2. That notwithstanding
any provision of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, to
the contrary, the Director of Public
Service may require that each bid
be accompanied by a single bond
securing both the execution of a
contract and the performance of
the term of each contract. If a single bond securing both execution
and performance is required by the
Director, it shall be substantially
in accordance with the form attached as Exhibit “A”. Each bond,
whether to secure the execution of
a contract, its performance, or
both, shall be in an amount determined by the Director of Public
Service. Each bond submitted to
secure the contract or contracts
authorized by this ordinance shall
be executed by a surety authorized
to do business in the State of Ohio
and shall be acceptable to the
Director of Law.
Section 3. That the cost of the contract or contracts shall be charged
against the proper appropriation
account and the Director of Finance
shall certify the amount of the initial
purchase,
which
purchase,
together with all later purchases,
shall be made on order of the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies
under a requisition against the contract or contacts certified by the
Director of Finance. (RL 130768)

declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL

Res. No. 1622-07.
By Council Member Britt.
An emergency resolution supporting the Ohioans for Healthy Families Campaign in its effort to submit legislation known as the Ohio
Healthy Families Act to the Ohio
General Assembly requiring businesses with more than 25 workers
to allow full-time employees to earn
7 paid sick days per year and parttime workers to earn a pro-rated
number of paid sick days.
Whereas,
94
million
working
Americans do not have paid sick
days to use to care for a sick child;
and
Whereas, nearly half of all private sector workers in the United
States are not provided any paid
sick time; and
Whereas, two-thirds of part-time
female employees also forgo pay
when they miss work to care for
their children; and

1809

13
Whereas, too many Ohioans are
forced to choose between a sick
child or parent and their paycheck;
and
Whereas, the average cost to
allow workers to earn paid sick
days would be 35 cents per day per
full-time employee; and
Whereas,
the
proposed
Ohio
Healthy Families Act would require
businesses with more than 25 workers to allow full-time employees to
earn 7 paid sick days per year, and
part-time workers could earn a prorated number of paid sick days
depending on the number of hours
worked; and
Whereas, under the proposed Act,
earned sick time could be used by
an employee for an absence to care
for themselves, children, parent or
spouse who has a physical or mental illness, injury or medical condition or needs a diagnosis or preventative medical care; and
Whereas, it is the goal of the Ohio
Healthy Families Campaign to submit the proposed Act and over
120,000 valid signatures to the Ohio
General Assembly by the end of
December, 2007; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby
supports
the
Ohioans
for
Healthy Families Campaign in its
effort to submit proposed legislation known as the Ohio Healthy
Families Act to the Ohio General
Assembly requiring businesses with

days per year and part-time workers to earn a pro-rated number of
paid sick days.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to submit copies of
this resolution to Gloria J. Fauss of
Ohioans for Healthy Families.

of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the

An emergency resolution supporting The Ohio Coalition for Responsible Lending in its effort to encourage Ohio legislators to adopt legislation to help protect consumers
from high cost payday loans.
Whereas, Ohio working families
pay millions of dollars in excessive
fees every year, as payday lenders
across the state routinely flip small
cash advances into long-term, highcost loans with an annual percentage rate (“APR”) up to 391 percent;
and
Whereas, the average payday borrower is getting 13 or more payday
loans per year, putting them in a
financial debt trap; and
Whereas, the average payday borrower pays $600 to borrow $325
through repeat borrowing; and
Whereas, payday lending traps
several hundred thousand Ohio families annually in a cycle of chronic
borrowing, as over half of payday
revenues are extracted from borrowers who take out 12 or more
loans per year; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,

An emergency ordinance determining the Video Service Provider
Fees to be paid by a video service
provider offering video service in
the City of Cleveland pursuant to
state authorization; and authorizing
the Director of Public Utilities to
give notice to authorized video service providers of the Video Service
Provider Fees.
Whereas, the Ohio General Assembly enacted Sections 1332.21 through
1332.34 of the Revised Code, effective September 24, 2007, to provide a
statewide “uniform regulatory framework” for the provision of cable television and/or other video service,
which will substantially reduce the
City of Cleveland’s existing authority to regulate cable and/or video
service offered in the City using
facilities located in the City’s public
rights-of-way; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
entered into a cable television franchise agreement with Time Warner and pursuant to which Time
Warner pays franchise fees in the
amount of five percent (5%) of
gross revenues which are defined
by the franchise to include advertising revenues; and
Whereas, under Section 1332.23 of
the Revised Code, any new video
service provider intending to provide video service to subscribers in
the City must apply for and obtain
a video service authorization from
the Director of the Ohio Department
of Commerce; and

The City Record
Whereas, Section 1332.23 of the
Revised Code also permits a cable
operator with an effective franchise agreement to terminate its
franchise with the City, at its
option, by applying for a stateissued video service authorization
when a competitive video service
provider either gives notice that it
will begin providing service to subscribers in the City or actually
begins providing service to subscribers in the City, or if the FCC
determines that the cable operator
is subject to “effective competition”
in the City pursuant to 47 CFR
76.907; and
Whereas, under Section 1332.32 of
the Revised Code, a video service
provider that is providing service to
subscribers in the City pursuant to
a state-issued video service authorization must pay the City Video
Service Provider Fees (“VSP Fees”)
based
on
a
percentage
of
the
provider’s “gross revenues” derived
from providing video service in the
City, not to exceed five percent
(5%) of such revenues; and
Whereas, Section 1332.32 of the
Revised Code requires that the percentage of gross revenues on which
VSP Fees is paid must be the same
as the percentage of gross revenues that a cable operator pays
pursuant to a franchise agreement
that is in effect, or, if there is no
effective
franchise
agreement
under which franchise fees are
payable for a given calendar quarter, the VSP Fees shall be zero percent (0%) of gross revenues, unless
the City determines by Ordinance
that the VSP Fees will be a percentage of gross revenues not to
exceed five percent (5%) of gross
revenues; and
Whereas, division (C)(2) of Section 1332.32 of the Revised Code further requires the City to provide all
video service providers offering service in the City with notice of the
VSP Fees within ten (10) days of
receiving notice from the video service provider that it will begin
offering service in the City, or the
video service provider is not required to pay VSP Fees to the City;
and
Whereas, division (B)(2)(g) of
Section 1332.32 of the Revised Code
provides that the VSP Fees are
paid on a base of gross revenues
consisting of revenues received
from subscribers only, unless the
City specifically determines, by
Ordinance uniformly applicable to
all video service providers, that
advertising
revenues
also
be
included in the base of gross revenues on which the VSP Fees are
paid; and
Whereas, division (B)(2)(g) of
Section 1332.32 of the Revised Code
requires the City to promptly notify
affected video service providers of
the
Ordinance
determining
to
include advertising revenues in the
base of gross revenues on which the
VSP Fees are paid, but provides that
the requirement to include advertising revenues in the base of gross
revenues does not take effect until
the first day of the first calendar
quarter that begins more than thir-

1816

October 3, 2007
ty (30) days after giving such
notice; and
Whereas, in order to minimize the
negative financial impact on the
City it is the intent of this Council
to charge the maximum VSP Fees
with the most expansive definition
of Gross Revenues allowed by law;
and
Whereas, in order to provide timely notice to a video service provider
of the VSP Fees, it is necessary for
this Council to determine now that
the percentage of gross revenues on
which the VSP Fees will be paid is
five percent (5%) and that advertising revenues shall be included in
the base of gross revenues on which
the VSP Fees are paid, and to authorize the Director of Public Utilities
to provide notice of the VSP Fees to
a video service provider within ten
(10) days of the City receiving
notice that a video service provider
will begin providing service in the
City; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health,
safety and welfare in order to
ensure that the City continues to
receive appropriate fees from persons providing video and/or cable
service in the City using the City’s
rights-of-way and for the usual daily
operation of a municipal department; now therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That, in accordance
with the requirements of Section
1332.32 of the Revised Code, all
video service providers providing
video service in the City pursuant to
a
video
service
authorization
obtained from the Director of the
Ohio Department of Commerce shall
pay Video Service Provider Fees
(“VSP Fees”) in the amount of five
percent (5%) of gross revenues
received from providing video service in the City, which gross revenue base shall include advertising
revenues. The VSP Fee shall be paid
quarterly, not sooner than forty-five
(45) days nor later than sixty (60)
days after the end of each calendar
quarter.
Section 2. That, no later than ten
(10) days from receipt of notice
from a video service provider that
it will begin providing video service in the City pursuant to a stateissued video service authorization,

notice of the VSP Fees as determined by this Council under Section 1 of this ordinance, which
