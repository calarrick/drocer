An emergency resolution urging
Cleveland Catholic Diocese, Bishop
Richard Lennon to meet with Cleveland City Council to present and discuss the Diocese’s urban strategy in
the wake of recent proposed church
and school closings throughout the
City of Cleveland.
Whereas, Cleveland Catholic Diocese
recently
instructed
its
69
regional clusters to develop plans to
close at least 23 or up to 48 churches of its 231 parishes, and report
plans to the diocese by the end of
2008; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
will take the hardest hit with a
potential loss of up to 25 churches
slated to close; and
Whereas, Bishop Richard Lennon
also urged clusters to study enrollment trends and consider closing or
merging Catholic schools;
Whereas, the reorganization is
part of a six-year effort to address
massive demographic shifts from
the cities to the suburbs, growing
financial pressures, and a worsening clergy shortage; and
Whereas, Bishop Lennon said that
reorganization plans include the
possibility of building churches in
growing suburban areas; and
Whereas, parish communities and
schools play a vital role in maintaining
racially
and
ethnically
diverse neighborhoods and community stability; and
Whereas, City Council is concerned that the Diocese’s reorganization will lead to a greater migration out of the City and disinvestment in City neighborhoods that
will negatively impact the quality
of life for its citizens; and
Whereas, City Council desires to
meet with Bishop Lennon to discuss
the Diocese’s urban strategy to continue social services and educational programs in the City, continue
use of closed churches, and maintain
and rebuild its urban parishioner
base; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the

The City Record
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges Cleveland Catholic Diocese, Bishop Richard Lennon to
meet with Cleveland City Council to
present and discuss the Diocese’s
urban strategy in the wake of
recent proposed church and school
closings throughout the City of
Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Bishop
Richard Lennon and Mayor Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force

By Council Members Cummins,
Westbrook, Kelley, Cleveland, Lewis,
Santiago, Pierce Scott, Brancatelli,
Conwell, Coats, Zone, Britt, Brady,
Keane, Cimperman, Polensek, Johnson, Turner and White.
An emergency resolution calling
on the United States government to
commit and develop a firm strategy
and timetable to begin the orderly
and comprehensive withdrawal of
U.S. military personnel and bases
from Iraq as soon as possible; urging the United States Congress to
pass
legislation
prohibiting
the
President from spending taxpayer
dollars on any new escalation in
Iraq,
expansion
of
the
conflict
beyond Iraqi borders, or military
operations against Iran; further urging the United States government to
provide the people of Iraq with all
necessary non-military material aid
necessary for the security of Iraq’s
citizens and for the rebuilding of
Iraq; and further urging the U.S.
Congress to redirect financial resources used to prosecute the war in
order to address the pressing needs
of Americans, including health, education, and homeland security.
Whereas, the United States has
been engaged in a war in Iraq for
more than four years; and
Whereas, U.S. involvement in Iraq
has resulted in the deaths of more
than 3,500 U.S. soldiers, including
148 soldiers from Ohio, and the
wounding and disabling of more
than 25,350 U.S. military personnel
to date, including 1,056 soldiers from
Ohio; and
Whereas, in Resolution No. 100-03,
adopted January 27, 2003, this Council unilateral military action against
Iraq and called for President Bush
to seek a peaceful resolution of
issues with Iraq as a alternative to
war; and
Whereas, in Resolution No. 132-06,
adopted January 23, 2006, this Council called for an immediate and
comprehensive withdrawal of United

1106

June 20, 2007
States military personnel and bases
from Iraq with no such actions having been taken or officially planned
for thus far by the U. S. Government; and
Whereas, the war will further
extend National Guard tours in Iraq,
that the costs to the states of the
call-up of National Guard members
for deployment in Iraq have been
significant, as reckoned in lost
lives, combat injuries and psychic
trauma, disruption of family life,
financial hardship for individuals,
families and businesses, interruption of careers and damage to the
fabric of civic life in our communities, including natural disaster recovery; and
Whereas, the American troops
have valiantly upheld their duty in
Iraq under dire circumstances; and
Whereas, more than $432 billion
has been appropriated by Congress
to fund military operations and reconstruction in Iraq to date, money
that could fund desperately needed
education,
health
care,
housing,
nutrition and other social services in
our
communities
in
the
United
States or humanitarian assistance
abroad; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland’s
share in that is more than $405 million toward costs associated with
the war in Iraq. And further that
the cost to Ohioans is more than $15
billion, and
Whereas, previous budgets that
have prioritized Iraq have led to
cuts in critical block grants for
states and have increased the federal debt, which compounded by
interest payments, will likely lead
to even larger cuts in funding for
critical needs in the States; and
Whereas, a vast majority of Americans do not support continuing
American involvement in Iraq and
favor a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops as indicated by a
majority of polls; and
Whereas, legal experts on all
sides have determined that Congress
has not only broad authority, but a
long tradition of limiting escalation
or forcing redeployment of troops
through the Constitutionally-designated power of the purse; and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
that the stability of Iraq is crucial
to the security of the citizens of
Cleveland and to all Americans; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council calls
on the United States government to
commit and develop a firm strategy
and timetable to begin the orderly
and comprehensive withdrawal of
U.S. military personnel and bases
from Iraq as soon as possible.
Section 2. That this Council urges
the United States Congress to pass
legislation prohibiting the President
from spending taxpayer dollars on
any new escalation in Iraq, expansion of the conflict beyond Iraqi borders, or military operations against
Iran.
Section 3. That this Council further urges the United States government to provide the people of

June 20, 2007
Iraq with all necessary non-military
material aid necessary for the security of Iraq’s citizens and for the
rebuilding of Iraq.
Section 4. That this Council further urges the U.S. Congress to redirect financial resources used to prosecute the war in order to address
the pressing needs of Americans,
including health, education, and
homeland security.
Section 5. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to President George
W. Bush, United States Senator
George Voinovich, United States Senator Sherrod Brown, the Congressional delegation of Ohio and to all
members of the United States Congress.
Section 6. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Res. No. 1007-07.
By Council Member Santiago.
An emergency resolution declaring
June, 2007 as LGBT (lesbian, gay,
bisexual and transgender) Pride
Month in Cleveland.
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
recognizes and values diversity in
the City’s residents; and
Whereas, this City has reaffirmed
its commitment to diversity and tolerance by prohibiting discrimination
in City employment based upon sexual orientation as well as race, religious, sex, disability and ethnic status under Section 187.11(B) of the
Codified Ordinances; and
Whereas, many communities and
organizations
across
the
United
States will celebrate June, 2007 as
“LGBT Pride Month” to recognize
the significance that LGBT (lesbian,
gay,
bisexual
and
transgender)
Americans have made throughout
our nation’s history; and
Whereas, in an effort to further
build and strengthen our communities and nation, we must move
beyond
merely
“tolerating”
the
LGBT community, but instead value
them as our colleagues and neighbors, daughters and sons, sisters
and brothers, and friends and partners; and
Whereas, much has been accomplished over the last generation to
promote equality and justice, as
society and our laws reflect the
recognition that diversity and tolerance is strength in a progressive
culture, yet many challenges still
remain, as prejudice against members of the LGBT community can
still erupt into acts of hatred, violence and discrimination; now therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council declares June, 2007 as LGBT (lesbian,
gay,
bisexual
and
transgender)
Pride Month.

The City Record
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to director of LGBT
Community Center of Greater Cleveland.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

exempt from real property taxation;
requiring annual service payments
in lieu of taxes; finding the property to be in a blighted area of an

Code Sections 5709.41, 5709.42 and
5709.43.

The City Record
Whereas, Ohio Revised Code (“R.C.”)
Section 5709.41 provides that this
Council may, under certain circumstances,
declare
improvement
to
parcels of real property located in
the City of Cleveland (the “City”) to
be a public purpose, and thereby
exempt
a
percentage
of
that
improvement from real property taxation, provided the City has held fee
title to such real property prior to
the adoption of the ordinance providing for the exemption; and
Whereas, pursuant to R.C. Section
5709.41(C)(2), said exemption may
exceed 75% of such improvement
and be for a period of up to thirty
(30) years with approval of the
board of education of the city, local
or exempted village school district
within the territory of which the
improvement is or will be located;
and
Whereas, the real property shown
on the map and more fully described
in the legal description contained in
File No. 2006-06-B, and incorporated
herein by reference (the “Property”)
is located in the State of Ohio (the
“State”), County of Cuyahoga (the
“County”), and the City; and
Whereas, the current and future
owners of the Property and/or any
structures located thereon (each an
“Owner” and collectively the “Owners”) wish to develop the Property,
provided that the appropriate development incentives are available to
support this redevelopment; and
Whereas, Veterans Development,
LLC (the “Developer”), in cooperation with the Cleveland-Cuyahoga
County Port Authority (the “Port
Authority”), desires to construct a
domiciliary, office building, parking
garage and related improvements on
the Property for use by the Veterans Administration (the “VA Project”); and
Whereas, the Port Authority plans
to issue bonds (the “Port Authority
Bonds”) to help finance certain VA
Project costs, including certain public infrastructure improvements and
related appurtenances; and
Whereas, in connection with the
City’s urban redevelopment efforts,
the City acquired the Property and
conveyed the Property to the Developer; and
Whereas, this Council has determined that it is necessary and
appropriate and in the best interests
of the City to provide for service
payments in lieu of real property
taxes (“Service Payments,” as further defined below) with respect to
the Property pursuant to R.C. Section 5709.42; and
Whereas, the City, through its
activities in connection with the VA
Project and through other activities,
has been and will continue to be
engaged in urban redevelopment;
and
Whereas, this Council desires to
enter into a compensation agreement
(the “Compensation Agreement”)
with the Board of Education of the
Cleveland Municipal School District
(the “School District”), which Compensation Agreement would provide
for the payment of compensation by
the City to the School District; and
Whereas, in connection with the
negotiation of the Compensation
Agreement, the Board of Education
of the School District has agreed to

1113

21
waive the notice periods prescribed
in R.C. Sections 5709.41 and 5709.83
and has approved a 100% exemption
for the Property under R.C. Section
5709.41 for a period of thirty years;
and
Whereas, an emergency exists in
the usual daily operations of the
City in that it is immediately necessary to approve tax exemptions
for the Property for the preservation
of the public health, peace, property
and safety, that preservation being
related to the City’s need for the
Developer to construct the VA Project on the Property to create new
job opportunities immediately; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. The VA Project, the
improvement of the Property and
the increase in assessed value of the
Property after the acquisition of the
Property by the City (an “Improvement” as defined in R.C. Section
5709.41 and which Improvement is
further described in the summary
placed in the above-mentioned file
and incorporated by reference herein) are hereby declared to be a public purpose for purposes of R.C. Sections 5709.41 and 5709.42. One hundred percent (100%) of the Improvement is hereby exempted from real
property taxation for a period commencing on the effective date of
this Ordinance and ending at the
end of a period of exemption of thirty (30) years. On such ending date,
the Improvement shall cease to be a
public purpose.
Section 2. That this Council adopts
the
City
Planning
Commission’s
finding of blight and the adoption
of a building condition and blight
study of the Property and this Council concludes that the Property is in
a blighted area of an impacted City,
as those terms are used in R.C. Section 1728.01.
Section 3. As provided in R.C.
Section 5709.42, the Owners are required hereby to make annual service payments in lieu of taxes to
the County Treasurer with respect
to the period in which the Improvement (or any part thereof) is exempt from real property taxation,
on or before the final dates for payment of real property taxes. Each
such payment (including interest
and penalties) shall be charged and
collected in the same manner and
in the same amount as the real
property taxes that would have
been charged and payable against
the Improvement if it were not
exempt from taxation (the service
payments in lieu of taxes, including any penalties and interest, are
referred to herein as the “Payments
in Lieu of Taxes”). Any late payments shall be subject to penalty
and bear interest at the then current rate established under R.C.
Sections 323.121 and 5703.47, as may
be amended from time to time, or
any successor provisions thereto, as
the same may be amended from
time to time. The County Treasurer shall remit all Payments in Lieu
of Taxes, together with any associated roll back payments received

22
in accordance with R.C. Section
319.302 (the “Property Tax Rollback
Payments”)
in
respect
of
the
Improvement,
to
the
City
for
deposit in the Veterans Administration Urban Redevelopment Tax
Increment Equivalent Fund established in Section 4 hereof. Payments in Lieu of Taxes and Property Tax Rollback Payments are
collectively referred to herein as
the “Service Payments.” This Council hereby authorizes the Mayor or
the Director of Finance (the “Director”) or other appropriate officers
of the City to provide such information and certifications and execute and deliver, or accept delivery
of, such instruments as are necessary and incidental to collect the
Service Payments and to make such
arrangements as are necessary and
proper for payment of the Service
Payments. The Service Payments
shall be allocated and deposited in
accordance with Sections 4 and 5 of
this Ordinance.
No Owner shall, under any circumstances, be required in any tax
year to both pay Service Payments
with respect to an Improvement and
reimburse local taxing authorities
for the amount of real property
taxes that would have been payable
to local taxing authorities had the
Improvement not been exempted
from taxation pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 4. This Council hereby
