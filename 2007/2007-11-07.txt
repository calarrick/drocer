Pledge of Allegiance.

We received a total of thirty-four
(34) part petitions containing eight
hundred and twelve (812) signatures. Of these signatures, seven
hundred and three (703) were found
to be valid signatures in that they
were registered voters residing in

and voted in Ward 14 in the November 8, 2005 General Election.
Two thousand nine hundred and
ninety (2990) ballots were cast in
Cleveland Ward 14 in the November
8, 2005 General Election. Twenty
percent (20%) of the 2990 ballots
cast in that election in Ward 14 is
a total of five hundred and ninetyeight (598) ballots. As a result, the
Board of Elections has determined
that the number of valid signatures
of registered voters in Ward 14 of
the City of Cleveland who voted in
the November 8, 2005 General Election represents more than 20% of
ballots cast in Ward 14 of the City
of Cleveland in that election. Also,
we have verified that each part petition circulator is a registered voter
in the City of Cleveland.
Additionally, please find attached a
timeline that we respectfully submit
for your consideration if a recall
election is scheduled. Due to the
remaining 2007 election cycle and

An emergency resolution urging
the U.S. Senate to support the passage of S. 2136, cited as the “Helping Families Save Their Homes in
Bankruptcy Act of 2007”, which will
allow homeowners to modify their
mortgages in bankruptcy to avoid
foreclosure.
Whereas, the foreclosure crisis is
due in part to lax regulation of
mortgage lending and predatory
actions of certain lenders, it is
incumbent that the Federal government to assist homeowners with
additional opportunities to negotiate
a workout on their mortgages; and
Whereas, the collapse of the subprime mortgage market has put
approximately 2.2 million families
in danger of losing their homes;
and
Whereas, there is a need to provide families every reasonable tool
to ensure they can keep a roof over
their heads; and
Whereas, virtually every type of
personal debt, including vacation
homes and family farms, can be
restructured in bankruptcy with the
exception of a mortgage on a primary residence; and
Whereas, the mortgage market
has changed considerably since the
1970’s when most mortgages were
fixed rate, long term agreements
between local bankers and their
neighborhood customers; and
Whereas, the bill would help the
bankruptcy code catch up with the
shift in the home mortgage market;
and
Whereas, vacant foreclosed properties often become a breeding
ground for crime and fires, and require a disproportionate amount of
government maintenance, from securing properties against criminal activity to removal of garbage and
rodents to demolition, all at a cost
to taxpayers; and
Whereas, vacant properties reduce
city tax revenue in three ways: they
are often tax delinquent; their low
value means they generate little in
taxes; and they depress property
values across an entire neighborhood; and
Whereas, the citizens who live in
a neighborhoods with many vacant
and abandoned homes have great
difficulty obtaining homeowner’s insurance, mortgages and loans for
home improvements; and
Whereas, vacant properties degrade and devalue the quality of
life for remaining residents, isolat-

ing and weakening the neighborhood, and increasing the likelihood
that property values will continue to
decline and further abandonment
will set in; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Urging the U.S. Senate
to support the passage of S. 2136,
cited as the “Helping Families Save
Their Homes in Bankruptcy Act of
2007”, which will allow homeowners

Whereas, the foreclosure crisis is
due in part to lax regulation of
mortgage lending and predatory
actions of certain lenders, it is incumbent that the Federal government to assist local government
with the additional funding to reduce the impacts of vacant properties and provide local government
the ability to demolish large inventories of vacant housing; and
Whereas, the vacant housing problem is growing, especially in vulnerable communities which have
been highly impacted by mortgage
foreclosures and weak housing markets; and
Whereas, Senator Clinton and Congressman Brian Higgins, representing the State of New York have
introduced a bill, H.R. 3498 to authorize an appropriation of $100,000,000
over the next three years to provide
a new residential housing demolition program; and
Whereas, the authorized appropriation is recommended by Cleveland
City Council to be a minimum of
$500,000,000 over the next three
years; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
