matters.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland

(the “Port Authority”) and the Rock
and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum,
Inc. (the “Museum”) entered into a
Cooperative Agreement dated as of
February 26, 1993 (the “Original
Cooperative Agreement”) and an
Amendment
and
Restatement
of
Cooperative Agreement dated as of
December 15, 2003 (the “Amended
Cooperative Agreement”) pursuant
to special state legislation to provide for the ownership, financing
and refinancing, construction, maintenance and operation of the Rock

the Port Authority and leased to the
Museum; and
Whereas, pursuant to the Original
Cooperative Agreement and Amended Cooperative Agreement, the Port
Authority has issued revenue bonds

Hall; and
Whereas, pursuant to the Original

September 26, 2007
