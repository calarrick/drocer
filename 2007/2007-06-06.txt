Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Finance is authorized to make one
or more written requirement contracts under the Charter and the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,

of
commercial
gases, in the approximate amount as
purchased
during
the
preceding
term, to be purchased by the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies
on a unit basis for the various divisions of City government. Bids shall

an award to be made for all items
as a single contract, or by separate
contract for each or any combination of the items as the Board of
Control determines. Alternate bids
for a period less than the specified
term may be taken if desired by the
Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies until provision is made for the
requirements for the entire term.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into one or more contracts with a term of two years
instead of one year when there is a
financial advantage to the City. For
purposes of this ordinance, a financial advantage shall be determined
by the Director of Finance by com-

Section 2. That the costs of the
contract
or

more contracts with the vendors
selected through that cooperative
process.
Section 4. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

An emergency resolution urging
the Governor to reevaluate the Ohio
Graduation Test (OGT) so that it is
less likely to cause hardship for
high school seniors planning to
graduate and to provide additional
funding for supplemental training
and tutoring to students in need of
extra academic assistance.
Whereas, the graduating class of
2007 is the first class required to
take
the
Ohio
Graduation
Test
(OGT) in order to graduate from
high school; and
Whereas, the OGT is a five-part
exam that tests students in five subjects; it is the new standard by
which high school seniors can graduate; and
Whereas, as of last March, as
many as 30,000 seniors in the state
still needed to pass one or more sections of the OGT in order to graduate in May; and
Whereas, the OGT is more demanding than the former Ohio proficiency test; and

957

33
Whereas, seniors from all over
Ohio are unable to graduate this
year due to failure of the OGT; and
Whereas, a senior can have all the
credits required to graduate, and
have passed all the classes, however, failing the test in even one subject will keep a senior from graduating with his or her class; and
Whereas, this Council respects the
statutory requirements and strongly
supports the mandate of standards
for students to earn a diploma in the
State of Ohio, however, considering
the high failure rate of 30,000 students, it is imperative that some
consideration is given to students
who have invested 13 years in earning high school credits that under
different circumstances would have
allowed them to graduate with their
diplomas;
Whereas, school officials should
at least allow those seniors who
failed a portion of the test by a
small margin, to march in the graduation ceremony with their class.
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Governor to reevaluate the Ohio
Graduation Test (OGT) so that it is
less likely to cause hardship for
Ohio’s high school seniors planning
to graduate and encourages school
officials to allow those seniors failing the OGT by a very small margin to at least march in graduation
ceremonies with their classmates.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby directed to send copies of the resolution to Governor Ted Strickland,
the members of the state board of
education, Eugene Sanders, CEO of
Cleveland Public Schools, and the
superintendents of all local boards
of education.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
