ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 1173-07.
By Council Member Conwell.
An emergency resolution encouraging the Jackson Administration to
urge area banks and lenders to offer
loan modifications to mortgage borrowers who are falling behind on
payments and heading toward default and foreclosure.
Whereas, last year, 11,076 new foreclosure cases were filed in Cuyahoga
County Common Please Court; and
Whereas, homeowners and citizens
all over the City of Cleveland are
negatively affected by the high number of mortgage foreclosures; and
Whereas, foreclosures often result
in vacant properties that become a
breeding ground for crime, depress
property values, and reduce city tax
revenue; and
Whereas, vacant and abandoned
properties require a disproportionate
amount of government maintenance,
from securing properties against
criminal activity to removal of
garbage and rodents to demolition,
all at a cost to taxpayers; and
Whereas, vacant properties degrade and devalue the quality of
life for remaining residents, isolating and weakening the neighborhood, and increasing the likelihood
that property values will continue to
decline and further abandonment
will set in; and
Whereas, foreclosures are rising
fast partly because lenders in recent
years rushed to make no-moneydown loans to people with weak
credit records and didn’t always verify their income; and
Whereas, the decline in housing
prices in Cleveland and Cuyahoga
County makes it hard for borrowers
who fall behind to sell their homes
for enough money to pay off the
loan; and
Whereas, according to the Wall
Street Journal, when borrowers fall
behind on payments, lenders typically consider offering a loan modification,
involving
lowering
the
interest rate or stretching out the
term; and
Whereas, lenders have used loan
modifications for years, but the
practice is expected to proliferate as
defaults rise, possibly peaking at
several times the usual 2% of outstanding loans; and
Whereas, area lenders and banks
could prevent mortgages borrowers
from foreclosure, and the resulting
vacant housing crisis in Cleveland
by offering loan modifications; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby encourages the Jackson Administration to urge area banks and
lenders to offer loan modifications to
mortgage borrowers who are falling
behind on payments and heading
toward default and foreclosure.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Mayor
Jackson.

August 22, 2007
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted August 8, 2007.
Effective August 16, 2007.

Res. No. 1292-07.
By Council Members Pierce Scott,
Britt, Conwell, Kelley, Lewis, Santiago,
Turner,
Westbrook,
White,
Zone and Cummins.
An emergency resolution supporting House of Representatives Bill
1506, introduced by Representatives
Markey and Platts, to raise fuel efficiency standards to 35 miles per gallon by 2018, and opposing House of
Representatives
Bill
2927,
introduced by Representatives Hill and
Terry, to reduce the increase in fuel
efficiency standards to only 32 miles
per gallon by 2022.
Whereas, support for increasing
fuel efficiency standards is strong
due to high gas prices, dependence
on foreign oil, and concern over
global warming.
Whereas, the Markey-Platts bill
builds on the bipartisan vote in the
Senate to raise fuel efficiency standards to 35 miles per gallon by 2020,
and expedites this standard by 2018.
Whereas, this 4% annual increase
in fuel efficiency standards for all
cars and light trucks is supported
by President George W. Bush, national security experts, and the
National Academy of Sciences, whose
findings show this standard both
technologically
and
economically
feasible.
Whereas, by the year 2020, the
Markey-Platts bill would reduce oil
use by 1.6 million barrels per day
and save drivers $37 billion per year
at the pump.
Whereas,
the
counter-proposal
Hill-Terry bill would prevent this
significant progress by reducing the
increase in fuel efficiency standards
to only 32 miles per gallon by 2022.
Whereas, the Hill-Terry bill would
only increase fuel efficiency annually by 1.8%, and bars the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration from setting standards beyond
a 35 mile-per-gallon level.
Whereas, the Hill-Terry bill also
allows automakers to delay fuel economy compliance for up to five years
based on promises of future improvement, and threatens greenhouse gas
limits for vehicles enacted by California and adopted by other states.
Whereas, proposed House Bill 1506,
if passed, will benefit the City of
Cleveland by saving drivers the most
money at the gas pump, reducing
dependence on foreign oil, and reducing global warming, while House
Bill 2927, if passed, provides little
positive impact and contains negative loopholes and provisions; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

The City Record
Section 1. That this Council supports House of Representatives Bill
1506, introduced by Representatives
Markey and Platts, to raise fuel
efficiency standards to 35 miles per
gallon by 2018, and opposes House
of Representatives Bill 2927, introduced by Representatives Hill and
Terry, to reduce the increase in fuel
efficiency standards to only 32 miles
per gallon by 2022.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
Representative Markey, Representative Platts, House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi, and Mayor Frank Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted August 8, 2007.
Effective August 16, 2007.

Res. No. 1293-07.
By Council Member Brady.
An emergency resolution withdrawing objection to a New C1 Liquor
Permit at 10330 Lorain Avenue and repealing Resolution No. 598-07, objecting to said permit.
Whereas, this Council objected to
a New C1 Liquor Permit to 10330
Lorain Avenue by Resolution No.
598-07 adopted by the Council on
April 16, 2007; and
Whereas, this Council wishes to
withdraw its objection to the above
permit and consents to said permit;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That objection to a New
C1 Liquor Permit to Sophia Tirado,
DBA Lucky’s, 10330 Lorain Avenue,
Cleveland, Ohio 44111, Permanent
Number 8945413, be and the same is
hereby withdrawn and Resolution
No. 598-07, containing such objection,
be and the same is hereby repealed
and that this Council consents to the
immediate permit thereof.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period

Res. No. 1294-07.
By Council Member Brancatelli.
An emergency resolution objecting
to the renewal of a D2, D2X, D3 and
D3A Liquor Permit at 3795 East 71st
Street, 1st floor and basement.

1583

11
Whereas, the uniform date for
renewal of liquor permits in the
State of Ohio is October 1st; and
Whereas,
pursuant
to
Section
4303.271 of the Revised Code, the legislative authority of a municipal corporation may object to the renewal
of a permit based upon legal grounds
as set forth in division (A) of
Revised Code Section 4303.292; and
Whereas, the applicant is unfit to
continue to engage in the liquor permit business in that he has operated his liquor permit business in a
manner that demonstrates a disregard for the laws, regulations or
local ordinances of the state, and
that this objection is based on other
legal grounds as set forth in Revised Code Section 4303.292; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.271 of the Ohio Revised Code,

An emergency resolution supporting the Cuyahoga County Commissioners’ majority vote to raise the
county sales tax by a quarter of a
cent to help pay for a Medical Mart
and convention center in downtown
Cleveland.

August 22, 2007
Whereas, Cuyahoga County commissioners voted 2 to 1 to raise the
county sales tax a quarter of a cent
as part of plans to attract a Medical
Mart linked to a new convention
center; and
Whereas, the majority Commissioners decided to raise the tax
without a public vote in part because they wanted to move the project forward quickly and convince
the Merchandise Mart’s board of
directors the region is serious about
doing the project; and
Whereas, Cleveland has suffered
serious losses in manufacturing employment but significant gains in
the health care industry with an
international reputation for quality
medical care and cutting edge innovations and research; and
Whereas, the Medical Mart would
have an undeniably positive effect
upon the economy and people of
Cleveland in numerous ways; and
Whereas, the Medical Mart would
bring new hope and stability for
Cleveland citizens that are employed
in the hospitality and construction
industries; and
Whereas, according to the Convention and Visitors Bureau of
Greater Cleveland, nearly two-thirds
of those employed in the hospitality
industry live in the City of Cleveland, and slightly more than half
are minorities; and
Whereas, Cleveland’s hospitality
sector, which has demonstrated success in moving employees up the
ranks faster than other industries,
has suffered as a result of declining
convention business in Cleveland,
but the proposed Medical Mart and
convention and Trade Show Facility
will grow our hospitality sector, create new jobs, and protect existing
jobs; and
Whereas, many Cleveland residents are benefiting from downtown
investments, providing a range of
employment opportunities, including
entry-level jobs need by those leaving welfare roles; and
Whereas, the Medical Mart will
reinvigorate downtown Cleveland
by attracting thousands of new visitors annually for medical trade
shows and other industry conventions that will result in increased
spending at downtown businesses
such as restaurants and hotels; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
will be the primary beneficiary of
increased income tax revenues as a
result of job creation from the new
facility, and the attraction of new
business in hospitality and medicalrelated industries; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
will benefit from higher property
taxes from downtown businesses,
directly benefiting the Cleveland
Municipal School District; and
Whereas, the Medical Mart would
help prepare Cleveland citizens for
jobs in the growing health care
industry and train our young people
for the jobs of the future; and
Whereas, our City, Cuyahoga County, the Cleveland Municipal School
District, higher educational institutions including Cuyahoga Community
College and Cleveland State University, along with the private sector
partners have already recognized the
need for increased workforce development in degreed and non-degreed
health care and technology jobs; and

The City Record
Whereas, this Council will work
with the developer, Merchandise
Mart Properties, Inc. to assure that
we maximize the Medical Mart to
integrate with and further continue
progress of workforce development
aimed at training young people and
displaced workers to prepare for
jobs in our growing medical and
health care industry; and
Whereas, the increase in business
at Cleveland Hopkins International
Airport from the thousands of new
visitors who would come to Cleveland annually from across the country because of the one-or-a-kind medical mart, would help preserve the
airport as an airline hub; and
Whereas, the Medical Mart is an
opportunity that makes economic
sense and allows the City to take
control of our future by leveraging
our strengths in the medical industry, hospitality sector, technology,
bioscience and manufacturing sectors; and
Whereas, people from all over the
world take advantage of our health
care assets, and with the proposed
Medical Mart and Trade Show and
Convention Facility, we have the
opportunity to capitalize on our
health care strengths and spark a
real turn-around for the City’s economy and image; and
Whereas, this Council supports
jobs and investing in the future of
citizens, our workforce and our
economy; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Supporting the Cuyahoga County Commissioners’ majority vote to raise the county sales tax
by a quarter of a cent to help pay

five one-year options to renew, as
approved by Council after obtaining
additional legislative authority. Expenditures for marketing shall not

program. The contracts shall also
provide, but not be limited to, the
following:
a. To qualify for the program, new

the CLE logo or mention Cleveland
Hopkins International Airport within the promotion and/or advertisements unless otherwise approved by
the Director of Port Control. Any

enhance the areas leased by the airline at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport; or 2) in lieu of receiving up to 50% of the funds otherwise allowable under this ordinance
for non-promotional or advertising
purposes, the airline may request
that the Director of Port Control
approve issuing a landing fee credit in the amount that would otherwise be payable to the airline as an
incentive payment under this ordinance, but only if the airline has
provided the full match described in
Section 2.b.
Section 3. That the Airline Incentive Program shall provide a commensurate benefit to general aviation users of the Airport System pursuant to a formula consistent with
the covenants of the City in the
