An emergency resolution urging
the Federal government to increase
crucial funding for autism research
and services.
Whereas, about one in 150 American children has autism, according
to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s largest study
done so far on the urgent public
health concern; and
Whereas, the new study results,
based on 2002 data from 14 states,
are higher than previously reported,
and underscore how common autism
is; and
Whereas, the study calculated an
average autism rate of 6.6 per 1,000,
an increase from last year’s estimated rate of 5.5 in 1,000; and
Whereas, autism is a complex disorder characterized by a range of
behaviors, including difficulty in

312

February 28, 2007
expressing needs and inability to
socialize; and
Whereas, autism is usually not
diagnosed in children until after age
three, even though early intervention is beneficial to progress; and
Whereas, the cause of autism is
not known, although some parents
and advocates contend that autism
is linked to a vaccine preservative;
and
Whereas, Autism Speaks, the nation’s largest organization advocating more services for autistic children, believes the new data shows
the need for more early intervention
services, more therapists, and legislators to stand up for autistic children and their families; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the Federal government to
increase crucial funding for autism
research and services.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to Autism
Speaks, the United States Congress,
and the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it

An emergency resolution calling
upon the Jackson administration to
adequately inspect the canopy roofs
of all businesses in the City, including gas service stations, to ensure
compliance with the City’s Building
Code and the Ohio Building Code,
and supporting an amendment to the
codified ordinances to require regular maintenance of all flat canopy
roofs and also requiring any newly
constructed
canopy
roofs
to
be
pitched, not flat
Whereas, on February 14th, a
canopy roof covered with heavy
snow collapsed at a gas service station at Fulton and Lorain on Cleveland’s west side, injuring one person
and crushing three cars; and
Whereas, less than 6 days later,
on February 19th, another snowladen canopy roof completely collapsed at a gas service station at
West 14th and Clark in the City,
sending one person to the hospital;
and
Whereas, also on February 19th, a
canopy roof collapsed under the
weight of heavy snow at a business
in Elyria, trapping a woman for 25
minutes; and
Whereas, under the City’s Building Code, which adopts Ohio’s Build-

February 28, 2007
ing Code, all roofs, whether flat or
pitched, must be designed to bear
snow loads as set forth in the law;
and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
that doing everything possible to
ensure that canopy roofs bear the
weight of heavy snow is a matter
of grave importance to the health
and safety of the citizens of the
City; and
Whereas, City building and housing
inspectors
must
adequately
inspect all canopy roofs prior to
winter weather to ensure that these
roofs
can
hold
snow
loads
as
required by the code; and
Whereas, owners of flat canopy
roofs should be required to clean
snow from the structures regularly
during any snowfall; and
Whereas, engineers have stated
that flat canopy roofs are less sturdy in holding heavy snow than
pitched roofs and flat canopy roofs
are more likely to collapse under
the weight of heavy snow; and
Whereas, given the obvious engineering problems with flat canopy
roofs bearing heavy snow, all newly
constructed canopy roofs should be
required to have pitched roofs, not
flat; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council calls
upon the Jackson administration to
adequately inspect the canopy roofs
of all businesses in the City, including gas service stations, to ensure
compliance with the City’s Building
Code and the Ohio Building Code,
and supports an amendment to the
