Cleveland, Ohio 44114
Mr. President:
It is with pride that I submit
notice of my resignation to this honorable body, effective 7 p.m. today,
so that I may join the cabinet of
Governor Ted Strickland as Director
of the Ohio Lottery. It is my distinct
honor to have been elected to serve
the wonderful citizens of Ward 21
for three (3) consecutive terms.
As a member in good standing of
the Democratic caucus of this Council, I nominate, and respectfully
request, that Martin J. Keane be
appointed Councilman of Ward 21
until the residents of the ward elect
my successor via a special election.
Martin was born and reared in
Ward 21. He is a graduate Our Lady
of Angels school, St. Ignatius High
School, The Ohio State University
and Cleveland Marshall College of
Law. He currently serves as an
Assistant
County
Prosecutor
of
Cuyahoga County. He resides on
Colletta Rd. with his wife and four
(4) children.
Martin hails from a family rich in
service to the City of Cleveland. His
grandfather served as Chief of the
Cleveland
Fire
Department,
his
father as Councilman of Ward 4 and
his
brothers
currently
serve
in
Cleveland Police and Fire departments. He will be an asset to this
distinguished body and the legislative branch.
I extend my personal thanks to
my fellow council-persons, past and
present. I certainly am a better person as a result of my service in this
august body. If I may be of service
to you as Director of the Ohio Lottery, please let me fail not.

By Council Members Zone and

An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Public Utilities to
enter into a Hydro Projects Developmental Cost Sharing Agreement with
American Municipal Power – Ohio,
Inc., to study the feasibility of developing several hydroelectric plants.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
(the “Municipality”) owns and operates an electric utility system for
the benefit of the Municipality and
its citizens; and
Whereas, by working jointly with
American
Municipal
Power-Ohio,
Inc. (“AMP-Ohio”) and the other
municipalities which are members
of AMP-Ohio, the Municipality can
supply its electric utility consumers
with reliable service at reasonable
rates; and
Whereas, a need has been identified for an environmentally sound,
reasonably priced and reliable long
term power source for the Municipality’s electric utility consumers;
and
Whereas, a number of licenses for
the construction and operation of
several regional hydroelectric facilities at existing dams may be available to AMP-Ohio or its members via
purchase, application to the FERC
or other cooperative arrangements;
and
Whereas, AMP-Ohio desires to provide Municipality with the opportunity to participate in the development of new regional hydroelectric
facilities, primarily located on the
Ohio River, utilizing conventional as
well as newer technologies, in order
to provide the Municipality’s electric
utility consumers this reasonably
priced, environmentally sound and
reliable source of long term power;
and
Whereas, AMP-Ohio anticipates that
no less than 30,000 kilowatts (kW),
and potentially 250,000 kW of hydroelectric capacity may be available;
and
Whereas, it is necessary for the
Municipality to enter into an Agreement with AMP-Ohio to provide for
preconstruction development funding to allow for analyzing the technical,
permitting,
and
economic
aspects of the potential new hydroelectric projects (the “Hydro Projects”) and determine if the Municipality, in conjunction with AMPOhio and other participating munic-

503

5
ipalities, should proceed to construct, own and operate one or more
new Hydro Projects; and
Whereas, under the terms of the
Agreement, AMP-Ohio will report
the results of the developmental
studies to the Municipality prior to
the Municipality committing to proceed with construction of one or
more Hydro Projects if and only if
in the Municipality’s sole discretion
it determines to do so; and
Whereas, Municipality desires to
obtain, under the Agreement, rights
to an amount of up to a nominal
50,000 kW of capacity of the Hydro
Projects on the same terms and conditions as the other participating
municipalities; and
Whereas, it is necessary for the
Municipality to commit itself to pay,
under the Agreement, a pro rata
share of the developmental costs of
the Hydro Projects in proportion to
the kW of capacity from the Hydro
Projects that Municipality chooses
to reserve to the total kW reserved
by all participating municipalities,
such commitment limited, however
to a financial obligation of no more
than $6.50 per kW reserved; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the form of the
Hydro Projects Developmental Cost
Sharing Agreement on file with the
Clerk shall be substantially in the
form placed File No. 484-07-A, and is

Section 2. That the Director of
Public Utilities is authorized to execute a Hydro Projects Developmental Cost Sharing Agreement substantially in the form placed in the
above-mentioned file, for up to a
nominal amount of 50,000 kW, with
the cost to the Municipality capped
at $6.50 per kW which cannot be
exceeded without further action of
this Council.
Section 3. That the authorization
contained in this ordinance shall not
obligate the Municipality to incur
any liability for the actual construction of any Hydro Project without further action of this Council.
Section 4. That the Hydro Developmental Cost Sharing Agreement
with AMP-Ohio shall limit the City’s
share of the developmental costs to
a sum not to exceed $325,000 from
the date of execution of the agreement through December 31, 2009.
Section 5. That this Council deems
the costs of the agreement with
AMP-Ohio authorized by this ordinance to be “power production” costs
that shall be included in the calculation of Cleveland Public Power’s
Energy Adjustment charge under
Section 523.21 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976.
Section 6. That the costs of the
contract with AMP-Ohio authorized
by this ordinance shall be paid from
the revenues derived from the sale
of electricity by Cleveland Public
Power.
Section 7. This Council finds and
determines that all formal actions of

to the adoption of this Ordinance, to
the extent required to be, were

6
taken in an open meeting of this
Council and that all deliberations of
this Council and any of its committees that resulted in those formal
action were in compliance with the
Law.
Section 8. That this ordinance is

An emergency resolution calling
upon the Governor of the State of
Ohio and the state legislature to
seek legislation that would require
the state’s pension system to divest
or restrict investments in Sudan
because of human rights atrocities
in the country’s Darfur region.
Whereas, Sudan has been in a
civil war for more than 20 years,
with violence in the western region
of the county leaving as many as
450,000 people dead; and
Whereas, Sudan’s government has
destroyed villages across Darfur in
an attempts to crush a rebel movement; and
Whereas, more than 2.5 million
Sudanese from the Darfur region are
homeless; and
Whereas,
in
response,
several
states have already passed laws to
completely divest from Sudan because of its human rights atrocities
in Darfur, including California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, New Jersey
and Oregon; and
Whereas, if the state of Ohio has
any investments in Sudan, or if it

The City Record
has
any
economic
ties
to
the
Sudanese government, the state of
Ohio should join the growing list of
states that have begun divesting or
restricting investments in Sudan;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby calls upon the Governor of the
State of Ohio and the state legislature to seek legislation that would
require the state’s pension system to
divest or restrict investments in
Sudan because of human rights
atrocities in the country’s Darfur
region.

By Council Members Britt, Conwell, Santiago, Pierce Scott, White,
Westbrook, Cummins, Turner, Coats,
Zone, Lewis, Kelley, Polensek, Brancatelli and Cleveland.
An emergency resolution encouraging the Jackson administration to
consider
multiple
approaches
of
addressing childhood lead poisoning, including education, advocacy
and
litigation;
and
encouraging
local, state, and federal governments to increase funding to expand
childhood lead testing and environmental intervention.
Whereas, each year nationally,
some 400,000 children under 5 have
lead poisoning; and
Whereas, in Cuyahoga County
alone over 2,000 children under age
5 are diagnosed with lead poisoning
each year; and
Whereas, children who have lead
poisoning often suffer from learning
disabilities, hyperactivity and brain
damage; and
Whereas, lead poisoning costs the
nation $43.4 billion yearly in lost
wages and healthcare costs; and
Whereas, 38 million housing units
have lead paint, and screening and
interim controls of these units costs
$38 billion; and
Whereas, currently there is a lawsuit against paint companies Sherwin-Williams Companies, NL Industries, Inc., Millenium Holdings LLC,

514

March 28, 2007
Conagra Grocery Products Company
and E.I. Du Pont De Nemours and
Company asking them to fund the
lead paint clean up in several cities;
and
Whereas,
based
on
well-documented court evidence dating back
to 1904, the suit alleges the companies knew the harmful effects of
lead based paint, particularly on
children, but continued to sell the
paint until it was banned in 1978;
and
Whereas, it is time for the industry manufacturers that began this
public health crisis and contributed
to the problem to accept responsibility and help solve the problem;
and
Whereas, Cleveland and Cuyahoga
County government agencies and
non-profit groups have been working with the health care community
to educate homeowners and landlords, test children, and remedy the
effects when a child has tested positive for lead poisoning, but a more
proactive approach with the help of
the industry manufacturers is paramount; and
Whereas, the Greater Cleveland
Lead Advisory Council has recommended lowering the blood lead
level that triggers environmental
interventions to > or = to 5-10
micrograms per deciliter; and
Whereas, lowering the lead level
that triggers environmental interventions
will
require
increased
funding and services to expand
testing and environmental intervention; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby encourages the Jackson administration to consider multiple approaches of addressing childhood
lead poisoning, including education,
advocacy and litigation; and encouraging local, state, and federal governments to increase funding to
expand childhood lead testing and
environmental intervention.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to the Greater Cleveland
Lead
Advisory
Council,
ACORN, Lutheran and Metropolitan
Ministry, federal and state legislators, and Mayor Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives

it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

DENIALS OF CERTIFICATION – 2006

Pursuant to Chapter 187 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland and its amendment, Ordinance No. 1186-92,
which was passed by City Council on Monday, June 15, 1992, attached is a listing of firms that have applied for
certification and were denied. However, these firms are not prohibited from doing business as prime contractors with
the City of Cleveland. Denials were based upon the purported owner’s inability to clearly define that they were bona fide
minority and/or female owned and controlled firms, or they applied for certification and were out of the geographic area
that met the requirements of the MBE/FBE Ordinances and the Regulations that govern the MBE/FBE certification
status, or they failed to respond to OEO’s written requests for additional information in order to process the file.

No. 85-07 adopted by the Council on
January 22, 2007; and
Whereas, this Council wishes to
withdraw its objection to the above

Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of

Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

Res. No. 457-07.
By Council Member Sweeney.
An emergency resolution opposing
Ohio House Bill 3 and Ohio House
Bill 4 which, if passed, would repeal
the Estate Tax.
Whereas, House Bills 3 and 4
would repeal the State of Ohio’s
estate tax; and
Whereas, the estate tax affects
less than 2% of Ohioans and benefits received by these 2% are minimal; and
Whereas,
Ohio
must
maintain
steady streams of revenue and
repealing or eliminating taxes must
be done in a responsible way ensuring maximum benefits to Ohioans
and to compensate for the budget
shortfalls predicted by the governor’s office; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has averaged $4.3 million dollars in
revenue from the estate tax; and
Whereas, there has been no discussion as to what revenue would
replace the revenue lost to cities
and the state if the estate tax is
repealed; and
Whereas, there is little evidence
to
support
the
argument
that
Ohioans are leaving the state to
avoid paying the estate tax; and

The City Record
Whereas, there is no evidence
showing that repealing the estate
tax would have any economic benefit to Ohioans; and
Whereas, the legislation allows
communities the option of repealing
the estate tax, thereby giving Ohio
communities another way to compete against each other; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby opposes Ohio House Bill 3 and
Ohio House Bill 4 which, if passed,
would repeal the Estate Tax.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to Governor Bob
Taft, all members of the Ohio General Assembly representing Cuyahoga County.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
