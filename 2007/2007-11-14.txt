An emergency resolution encouraging the protection of children
from the harmful effects of media
violence, and drawing attention to
media violence as a key community
concern.
Whereas, the average American
youth spends more than 45 hours per
week exposed to various types of
media — television, film, video
games, the Internet and music —
and will witness 40,000 killings and
200,000 violent incidents through
these media by the time they turn
18 years old; and
Whereas, nearly 1,000 different
scientific studies have led to the
conclusion that media violence increases levels of aggression among
children and youth in the short term
and is a significant risk factor that
increases the likelihood of violent
behavior over the long term; and
Whereas, national experts from
the U.S. Surgeon General’s office,
the National Institutes of Mental
Health, the American Academy of
Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association have all concluded that repeated exposure to
media violence can lead children to
view violence as acceptable means
of settling conflicts, become emotionally desensitized to violence and
be more likely to exhibit violent
behavior themselves; and
Whereas, the health and welfare
of youth in the City of Cleveland is
of utmost importance to the quality
of life enjoyed by our residents; and
Whereas, the 2007 National League
of Cities President Bart Peterson,
mayor of Indianapolis, Indiana, has
called on America’s local elected
officials
to
raise
the
level
of
parental awareness about the impact that media violence can have
on children; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
will work with PTAs and other community groups to encourage and
assist parents in taking a more
active role in monitoring the types
of media to which their children
have access; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
will hold a Public Safety Committee
hearing on December 12, 2007 for
community members, elected officials, youth residents and business
owners to discuss the impact of
media violence on youth and what
actions the community should take
to combat this impact; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
will engage local businesses that
sell and/or rent media products in
all discussions regarding our efforts
to inform and educate parents, particularly as it relates to established
rating systems; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
will increase public awareness about
and encourage young people to participate in community-sponsored activities for youth that serve as positive alternatives to media-related
activities; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,

the City of Cleveland:

An emergency resolution encouraging the General Assembly of the
State of Ohio to pass a bill to designate State Route 2 known as

Whereas, reelected in 1969, Mr.
