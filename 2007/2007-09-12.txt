Whereas, Ethiopia is a proud
country with a long, rich history;
and
Whereas,
the
earliest
known
hominid, internationally known as
Lucy and classified as Australopithecus Afarensis, was found in
Ethiopia by a team from the Cleveland Museum of Natural History in
1974; and
Whereas, Ethiopia is the only
country in Africa that was never
colonized, with the exception of the
5 years of occupation by the government of Italy; and
Whereas, legend is written of the
Queen of Sheba, known as Maq’da
in Ethiopia, who journeyed to visit

and gave birth to Solomon’s son who
subsequently became the first Emperor of Ethiopia, Menelik I; and
Whereas, in 330 A.D. Ethiopia was

end after a 17-year reign of terror;
and

1693

21
Whereas, since then, the Ethiopian-American community has grown
to become the second largest African immigrant group in the United
States; and
Whereas, the capital of the Amhara National Regional State of
Ethiopia is the beautiful City of
Bahir Dar, on the southern shore of
Lake Tana; and
Whereas, the City of Bahir Dar
arose in the middle ages around St
George Orthodox Church from a
cluster of previously pagan villages
along the shore of Lake Tana, situated at the mouth of the famous
Abay River (Blue Nile), with the
thunderous Tis Abay (Blue Nile
Falls) 30 km downstream; and
Whereas, the City has 26 medieval
island and lakeside Orthodox church
monasteries,
beautifully
painted
with the lives of the saints, surviving to this day in continual use –
living ‘museums’ of the rich heritage of Ethiopia; and

people who continue to build the
Nile reed boats, known as ‘Tanqua’,
which have been in constant use on
the Nile River and Lake Tana since
antiquity; and

of modernization during the bitterly
resisted Italian occupation of 193641; and was home to Belay Zallaqa,

900; and
Whereas, the City of Bahir Dar
became a sister city to Cleveland,
Ohio, also on the southern shore of
a great inland lake, on July 21, 2004,
with the visit of a traditional delegation of 12 Ethiopians from Bahir
Dar who participated in the signing
of a sister city covenant dedicated
to commercial, educational, cultural,
and humanitarian development and
exchange, and;
Whereas, it is home of the newly
designated Abay (Blue Nile) Millennium Riverside Park, 30 km in
length, on both sides of the river,
commissioned by Regional President
Ayalew Gobeze, to be developed and
supervised
by
the
municipality
under Mayor Yayeh Addis for environmental restoration and recreational development; and
Whereas, Bahir Dar is a cheerful
and relaxing city to stay in, combining the bustle of city life with
the gentler pace of the rural suburbs, and
Whereas, the 8th African Union
Summit, held from January 29-30,
2007, officially declared the second

sister-city
relationship
between
Bahir Dar, Ethiopia and Cleveland,
Ohio; and
Whereas, this Council wishes for
a peaceful and jubilant celebration
of the second millennium in Bahir
Dar and throughout Ethiopia; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

An emergency resolution calling
upon the Ohio General Assembly to
create and support legislation to
offer educational assistance to all
Ohio veterans.
Whereas, many veterans currently
serving our country have put their
college educations on hold until
returning from active duty; and
Whereas, by law in Ohio, public
and private colleges and universities are required to grant leave to
students called to active duty and to
either refund or offer credit for
tuition paid; and
Whereas, with the exception of
the Ohio National Guard, which
offers 100% tuition assistance, the

The City Record
State of Ohio does not offer any
assistance to its active duty veterans to obtain higher education; and
Whereas, many other states, including Texas, Minnesota, Wisconsin and New York, offer monetary
assistance to its active duty veterans to pursue a college education,
which
assistance
often
includes
100% tuition payment; and
Whereas, these and other states
help fill the gap left by federal
assistance in aiding veterans to
achieve a higher education; and
Whereas, it is only right that the
State of Ohio come to the assistance
of its veterans seeking a college
education;
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of

An emergency resolution supporting the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA) that instructs the Federal Reserve Board
to protect consumers from predatory
lending.
Whereas, the sub-prime lending
industry has grown rapidly in Cleveland during the last few years; and
Whereas, some mortgage brokers
and sub-prime lenders aggressively
market high-cost home loans that
borrowers are unable to repay and
engage in other unfair credit practices that strip retirees and working
families of the equity they have in
their homes; and
Whereas, approximately 80% of
sub-prime loans have adjustable
interest rates that will increase
after two years;
Whereas, sub-prime lenders have
made these adjustable rates mortgages without regard for whether
the borrower will be able to afford
the payments after the rate increases;
Whereas, many borrowers with
adjustable
rate
sub-prime
loans
were never given a choice between

1694

September 12, 2007
an adjustable or fixed rate or were
promised a fixed rate but given an
adjustable rate;
Whereas, approximately 70% of
the sub-prime loans were refinancing loans for families who had
already bought a home; and
Whereas, more than two-thirds of
sub-prime loans have prepayment
penalties, compared to just 2% of
prime loans
Whereas,
prepayment
penalties
trap borrowers into sub-prime loans
with high or adjustable rates and
strip their equity; and
Whereas, less than half of all subprime loans include taxes and insurance in the monthly payment; and
Whereas, many borrowers of subprime loans want to have their
taxes and insurance included in
their monthly payment, and many
borrowers have been mislead to
believe their payment includes taxes
and insurance; and
Whereas, many borrowers end up
in foreclosure when they have to
make a lump sum payment of their
taxes and insurance; and
Whereas, these practices are commonly referred to as “predatory
lending”; and
Whereas, these predatory loans
have led to an increase in foreclosure rates which hurts the families
who are losing their homes as well
as the neighborhoods where there
are a concentration of foreclosed
homes; and
Whereas,
these
vacant
homes
attract crime and cost Cleveland
money in crime prevention and the
deterioration of neighborhoods; and
Whereas, many families have not
had an opportunity to modify their
loans to make them affordable; and
Whereas, the federal Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act
(HOEPA) instructs the Federal Reserve Board to protect consumers
from predatory lending (15 U.S.C.
§1639 (L) (2)); and
Whereas, any regulations issued
by the Federal Reserve Board would
have the same effect as law and
would cover all mortgage lenders in
the country;
Whereas, this Council calls on the
Federal Reserve Board to use its
authority to: 1) prohibit lenders
from making mortgages that quickly become unaffordable after the
interest rate increases; 2) stop the
misuse and abuse of stated income
loans;
3)
eliminate
prepayment
penalties on subprime loans; and 4)
designate the failure to escrow
taxes and insurance in subprime
loans as an unfair and deceptive
practice; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the Home Ownership and
Equity Protection Act (HOEPA)
that instructs the Federal Reserve
Board to protect consumers from
predatory lending.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
Senator Dodd, Association of Com-

will give the police another tool to
do their job and give our citizens a

the state gun law while providing
exemptions to allow for adult supervision of those under 21 for lawful
hunting, sporting, and educational
purposes as well as law enforcement
and military officials under the age
of 21; and
