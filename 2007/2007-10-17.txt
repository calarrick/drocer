Scott,

An emergency resolution urging
the United States Congress to make
fundamental changes needed to enhance and strengthen traditional
Medicare.
Whereas, Medicare is an essential
national social insurance program
that has a major impact on the quality of life for over 43 million Americans young and old; and
Whereas, Medicare provides major
funding for the health care of virtually all of our nation’s seniors and
several million younger adults with
permanent disabilities; and
Whereas, additional millions of
younger people benefit indirectly by
being relieved of a major financial
burden when an older member of
the family encounters major health
expense; and
Whereas, Medicare policy is a
social contract between the American people and their government;
and
Whereas, policy change undertaken to assure fiscal solvency in the
future should guarantee both fairness and adequacy in the provision
of health care; and
Whereas, this Council supports
Medicare reform based on foundational principals listed below; and
Whereas, Medicare should remain
affordable and accessible for all
qualified persons; and
Whereas,
traditional
Medicare
should be retained and strengthened; and
Whereas, the percentage of the
increase
in
Medicare
premiums
should not exceed the percentage of
the increase in Social Security benefits; and
Whereas, Medicare should continue to expand and emphasize preventative services; and
Whereas, Medicare beneficiaries
should be issued a single card to
cover all Medicare or Medicare-related benefits, including prescription
drugs; and
Whereas, Medicare should offer a
uniform prescription benefit to all
beneficiaries at the same cost; and
Whereas, the federal government
should be encouraged to negotiate
the best prescription drug costs for
beneficiaries; and
Whereas, Qualified Medicare Beneficiary Program (QMB), Specified
Low-Income Medicare Beneficiaries
(SLMB) and Qualified Individual
(Q-I 1) programs should be retained
as well as existing related benefits
through Medicaid; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

issues,

Section 510.05
Location, Relocation and Removal of Facilities
(a) Location of Facilities. All
Facilities
shall
be
Constructed,
Reconstructed, installed and located

1903

23
under the following guidelines and
requirements:
(1) Facilities should be installed
within
an
existing
compatible
underground duct or conduit whenever Excess Capacity exists within
the Facility.
(2) A Service Provider registered
to install Overhead Facilities should
install its Facilities on pole attachments to existing utility poles if
Surplus Overhead Space is available.
(3) A Service Provider registered
to install Underground Facilities
should install its Facilities in space
the Service Provider currently occupies or in Surplus Underground
Space if available.
(4) Except for Overhead Facilities
as provided in this section, no AGF
or AGF Clusters shall be located
above ground in a Public Right-ofWay without a AGF Installation
Permit issued under Section 510.06.
(5) No Facilities shall be located
under ground in the Public Right-ofWay without, as applicable, a Street
Opening Permit issued under Section
503.01 or a Sidewalk Construction
Permit issued under Sections 505.04
to 505.06, as deemed appropriate by
the Director.
(b) Excess Capacity. To reduce
Excavation in the Public Right-ofWay, it is the City’s goal to encourage Service Providers to share occupancy of underground conduit as
well as to construct, whenever possible, excess conduit capacity for
occupancy of future Facilities in the
Public Right-of-Way. Therefore, if a
Service
Provider
is
constructing
underground conduit in the Public
Right-of-Way for its own Facilities,
and the City reasonably determines
the construction is in an area in
which other Service Providers would
likely construct Facilities in the
future, the City may require, to the
extent permitted by law, the Service
Provider to construct the conduit in
the
Public
Right-of-Way
with
Excess
Capacity
in
the
Public
Right-of-Way, provided the Service
Provider shall be reimbursed for the
use of the Excess Capacity by
another Service Provider. The Service Provider may charge a reasonable market lease rate for occupancy of the additional conduit space as
reimbursement. Division (b) of this
section shall not apply where no
practical operational, engineering or
safety standards will support the
need for Excess Capacity.
(c) City Owned Conduit. If the City
owns or leases conduit in the path of
a Service Provider’s proposed Facilities, the City determines that there
is Excess Capacity in the conduit,
and provided it is technologically
feasible for the Service Provider’s
Facilities to Occupy the conduit
owned or leased by the City, the Service Provider may be required, to the
extent permitted by law to Occupy
the conduit owned or leased by the
City in order to reduce the necessity
to Excavate the Public Right-of-Way.
If required, the Service Provider
shall pay to the City a fee for Occupancy which shall be a reasonable
market lease rate for occupancy of
the conduit. The City and the Service
Provider may agree to amortize the
fee through annual payments to the
City.

24
(d) Relocation or Removal of
Facilities. Within thirty (30) days
following written notice from the
City and in accordance with law, a
Service Provider shall, at its own
expense, temporarily or permanently remove, relocate, change or alter
the position of any Facilities in the
Public Right-of-Way whenever the
City shall have determined that
such removal, relocation, change or
alteration is reasonably necessary
for:
(1) The Construction, Reconstruction, repair, maintenance or installation of any City public improvement in or on the Public Right-ofWay; or
(2) The operations of the City or
other governmental entity in or on
the Public Right-of-Way.
Removal
of
Unauthorized
(e)
Facilities. Within thirty (30) days
following written notice from the
City, and to the extent permitted by
law any Service Provider or other
Person that owns, controls or maintains
any
unregistered
System,
Facility or related appurtenances in
the Public Right-of-Way shall, at its
own expense, remove those Facilities or appurtenances from the Public Right-of-Way of the City or shall
arrange to sell the System, Facilities or appurtenances to the City.
After the thirty (30) days have
expired, the City may remove the
Facilities or appurtenances from the
Public Right-of-Way at the other
party’s expense. A System or Facility is unauthorized and subject to
removal in any of the following circumstances:
(1) If the System or Facility was
Constructed, Reconstructed, installed, operated, located or maintained
without registering, except as otherwise provided by this Chapter;
(2) On abandonment of a Facility

fee to the PUCO within thirty (30)
days after the fee is assessed by the
City.
(b) Regulatory Fees and Compensation Not a Tax. The fees and costs

that
a
Service
Provider
believes that a conflict exists between the provisions of this Chapter
and other provisions contained in
