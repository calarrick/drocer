NO MEETING

THE CALENDAR
The following measures will be on
its final passage at the next meeting:
ORDINANCE
Ord. No. 408-07.
By Council Members Kelley, Cimperman and Sweeney (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance determining the method of making the
public improvement of repairing and
maintaining runways, taxiways, ramps,
roads, and other concrete surfaces
for the various divisions of the Department of Port Control, and authorizing the Director to enter into one
or more public improvement requirement contracts for the making of
the improvement.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That, under Section 167
of the Charter of the City of Cleveland, this Council determines to
make the public improvement of

899

repairing and maintaining runways,
taxiways, ramps, roads, and other
concrete surfaces for the various
divisions of the Department of Port
Control, by one or more public
improvement requirement contracts
duly let to the lowest responsible
bidder or bidders on a unit basis for
the improvement.
Section 2. That the Director of
Port Control is authorized to make
one or more written requirement
contracts under the Charter and the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, for the requirements for
a period up to two years, with two
one-year options to renew, for the
making of the above public improvement with the lowest responsible bidder or bidders after competitive bidding on a unit basis for the
improvement for a period not to
exceed the specified term, purchased
by the Commissioner of Purchases
and Supplies on a unit basis for the
various divisions of the Department
of Port Control. The first of the oneyear options to renew shall not be
exercised without additional legislative authority. If such additional
legislation authority is granted and
the first of the one-year options to
renew is exercised, then the second
of the one-year options to renew
shall be exercisable at the option of
the Director of Port Control without
the necessity of obtaining additional
authority of this Council. Bids shall
be taken in a manner that permits
an award to be made for all items
as a single contract, or by separate
contract for each or any combination of the items as the Board of
Control determines. Alternate bids
for a period less than the specified
term may be taken if desired by the
Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies until provision is made for the
requirements for the entire term.
Section 3. That the costs of the
contract
or
contracts
shall
be
charged against the proper appropriation accounts and the Director
of Finance shall certify the amount
of the initial purchase, which purchase, together with all later purchases, shall be made on order of
the Commissioner of Purchases and
Supplies under a requisition against
the contract or contracts certified by
the Director of Finance. (RL 158683)
Section 4. That under Section
108(b) of the Charter, the purchases
authorized by this ordinance may be
made
through
cooperative
agreements using state procedures. The
Director of Port Control may sign all
documents with the State of Ohio or
any of its political subdivisions that
are necessary to make the purchases,
and may enter into one or more contracts with the vendors selected
through that cooperative process.

declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
