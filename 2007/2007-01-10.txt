By Council Member Coats.
An emergency resolution encouraging the Federal Government to
address the disparities in healthcare
access and treatment between racial
and
ethnic
minority
population
groups and Caucasians by following
the recommendations of the National Healthcare Disparities Report,
the Institute of Medicine study and
the President’s New Freedom Commission.
Whereas, the United States has
achieved significant increases in the
life expectance of most residents
and reductions in the incidence of
injury, disability and disease; and
Whereas, the gap between the
health status and death rates for
racial and ethnic minority population groups and Caucasians has not
decreased and in some cases has
widened; and
Whereas, racial and ethnic minority populations face substantial cultural, social and economic barriers
to obtaining access to adequate and
competent health care; and
Whereas, the 2005 National Healthcare Disparities Report (NHDR)
finds that disparities related to race,
ethnicity and socioeconomic status
still pervade the American health
and behavioral health care system
in almost all aspects of healthcare;
and
Whereas, in 1999, Congress requested an Institute of Medicine
(IOM) study to assess the extent of
disparities in the types and quality
of health services received by U.S
racial and ethnic minorities and
non-minorities; and
Whereas, Congress charged the
IOM with the task of exploring the
factors
that
may
contribute
to
inequities in care and to provide recommendations on policies and practices to eliminate these inequities;
and
Whereas, the report from that
study, “Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in
Health Care”, found that a consistent body of research demonstrates
significant variation in the rates of

19

9
medical procedures by race, even
when insurance status, income, age
and severity of conditions are comparable; and
Whereas, this research indicates
that U.S. racial and ethnic minorities
are less likely to receive even routine medical procedures and experience a lower quality of health services; and
Whereas, the report states that a
large body of research underscores
the existence of disparities in treatment such as minorities being less
likely to receive appropriate cardiac
medications, undergo bypass surgery or receive kidney dialysis or
transplants; and
Whereas, by contrast, minorities
are more likely to receive certain
less-desirable procedures, such as
lower limb amputations for diabetes
and other conditions; and
Whereas, the future health of the
nation will be determined to a large
extent by how effectively we work
with communities to reduce and
eliminate health disparities between
non-minority and minority populations experiencing disproportionate
burdens of disease, disability and
premature death; and
Whereas, the President’s New Freedom Commission Report for 2005
underscored the disparity in recovery and resilience for ethnic/racial
minorities and identified several
goals to be achieved by 2010 that
included the elimination of disparities; and
Whereas, eliminating health disparities will require new knowledge
about the determinants of disease,
causes of health disparities and
effective interventions for prevention and treatment; and
Whereas, eliminating health disparities will also require improving
access to the benefits of society,
including quality preventive and
treatment services, as well as innovative ways of working in partnership with health and behavioral
health care systems, federal, state
and local governments, advocacy
groups academia and communitybased organizations; and
Whereas, the recommendation of
the NHDR, IOM study and the President’s New Freedom Commission Report include: increasing the awareness about health disparities among
the general public, health care providers insurance companies and policy-makers; recruiting more minority health and behavioral health care
providers especially since they are
more likely to serve in minority and
medically underserved communities;
and recruiting more interpreters for
health clinics and hospitals to overcome language barriers that may
affect the quality of care; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby encourages the Federal Government to address the disparities in
healthcare access and treatment
between racial and ethnic minority
population groups and Caucasians
by following the recommendations
of the National Healthcare Disparities Report, the Institute of Medicine study and the President’s New
Freedom Commission.

An emergency resolution supporting a township-wide celebration of
the Euclid Township Charter Bicentennial, 1809-2009.
Whereas, on July 22, 1796 General
Moses Cleaveland and a team of surveyors of the Connecticut Land Company came to this area to settle a
capital of the Western Reserve
lands of Connecticut and to establish a settlement here; and
Whereas, Moses Cleaveland’s team
not only established Cleaveland as
a settlement but some also surveyed
land some seven miles east to establish the Euclid Township; and
Whereas, Euclid Township’s boundaries covered all or most of current
Cleveland Heights, Collinwood Village, East Cleveland, Euclid, Lyndhurst, Nottingham Village, Richmond Heights and South Euclid; and
Whereas, in November, 1809, the
State of Ohio gave Euclid Township
residents a charter to hold elections,
pass ordinances and levy taxes; the
first election was on April 10, 1810;
and
Whereas, these dates mark the
beginning of local democratic government on Cleveland’s East Side;
and
Whereas, two hundred years after
founding, it is time to revisit the
historic event of Euclid Township
by
celebrating
a
township-wide
charter bicentennial; and
Whereas, impetus for a substantial yet light-hearted event comes
from the City of Euclid’s “Sesquicentennial” for the 1809 charter; and
Whereas, celebratory events for
the Euclid Township Charter Bicentennial celebration will be held in
venues across the old township during the fall of 2009 and the winter
and spring of 2010; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,

all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it

An emergency resolution endorsing the City of Cleveland’s AntiIdling Policy and encouraging other
municipalities to adopt Anti-Idling
Policies; announcing City Council’s
intent to enact Anti-Idling legislation that regulates private commercial fleet vehicles.
Whereas, unnecessary running an
engine at low speed (idling) wastes
fuel and pollutes the air; and
Whereas, idling causes twice the
wear on internal parts compared to
driving at regular speeds; and
Whereas, idling of vehicles consumes approximately 17% of the
fuel that a vehicle has on board; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
and
Northeast
Ohio
have
been
attempting to lessen pollutants that
pose a detriment to the region’s air
quality, but the region is still in a
non-attainment status; and
Whereas, reducing idling is necessary to protect public health and
the environment by reducing emissions while conserving fuel; and
Whereas, effective June 1, 2006,
the City of Cleveland adopted an
Anti-Idling Policy that applies to all
City vehicles, equipment, and operators, that is available on the City of
Cleveland’s Division of Water website sustainability page and a copy
is in File No. 14-07-A, and
