Section 195.04 Collection of Tax,
Monthly Reports, Payment of Tax
(a) Every person receiving any
payment on which a tax is levied
under this chapter shall collect the
amount of the tax imposed by Section 195.02 from the person making
the admission payment. The tax
required to be collected under this
chapter shall be deemed to be held
in trust for the benefit of the City
and deemed to be trust funds in the
hands of the person required to collect the tax until all such tax collected is paid to the Commissioner
of Assessments and Licenses as
herein provided. Any person required to collect the tax imposed
under this chapter who fails, refuses or neglects to collect the tax, or
having
collected
the
tax,
fails,
refuses or neglects to remit the tax
to the Commissioner in the manner
prescribed by this chapter and the
Rules and Regulations, whether
such failure, refusal or neglect is
the result of his own act or the
result of acts or conditions beyond
his control, shall nevertheless be
personally liable to the City for the
amount of such tax, whether or not
such tax has been collected.
(b) (1) The tax imposed by this
chapter shall be collected at the
time the admission charge is paid
by the person seeking admission to
any place and shall be reported and
remitted by the person receiving the
tax to the Commissioner in monthly
installments and remittances therefor on or before the thirtieth day of
the month next succeeding the end
of the monthly period in which the
tax is collected or received. Payment or remittance of the tax collected may be made by check,
unless payment or remittance is otherwise required by the Commissioner, but payment by check shall not
relieve the person collecting the tax
from liability for payment and
remittance of the tax to the Commissioner, unless the check is honored and is in the full and correct
amount. The person receiving any

November 28, 2007
payment for admissions shall make
out a return upon such forms prescribed by or acceptable to the Commissioner and set forth such information as the Commissioner may
require, showing the amount of the
tax collected upon admissions for
which he is liable for the preceding
monthly period, and shall sign and
transmit the same to the Commissioner with a remittance for the
amount of tax due.
(2) The Commissioner may in his
discretion require verified annual
returns from any person receiving
admission payments setting forth
such additional information as he
may deem necessary to determine
correctly the amount of tax collected and payable. Whenever any theater, circus, show, exhibition, entertainment or amusement makes an
admission charge which is subject
to the tax herein levied, and the
same is of a temporary or transitory nature, of which the Commissioner shall be judge, the Commissioner may require the report and
remittance of the admission tax
immediately upon the collection of
the tax, at the conclusion of the performance or exhibition, or at the
conclusion of the series of performances or exhibitions or at such
other times as the Commissioner
shall determine. Failure to comply
with any requirement of the Commissioner as to report and remittance of the tax shall be a violation
of this chapter.
Section 195.05 Assessments of Tax
(a) Except as otherwise provided
in division (b), no assessment shall
be made or issued against any person charged with the duty of collecting, receiving and remitting the
tax levied and imposed under this

in which the admission charge was
paid, or more than three (3) years
after the return for such period is
filed, whichever is later.

file any report or return required by
this section; files a fraudulent report
or return; or where the Commissioner has evidence that admissions
tax collected have not been remitted
to the City, no assessment shall be
made more than six (6) years after
the return date for the period, in
which the admission charge was
paid, or more than six (6) years
after the return for such period is
filed, whichever is later.

admission ticket or card is sold
shall be conspicuously and indelibly

and received; and
(c) Such other pertinent statements, schedules, records or information as the Commissioner may
require to correctly determine the
amount of tax collected and due.

of operating or conducting a temporary or transitory amusement, entertainment or exhibition by persons

conducted, the tax imposed by this
chapter shall be reported and remitted as provided in Section 195.04 by

unless paid by the person conducting the place. The applicant for a
license and certificate of registration for such purpose shall furnish

chapter that does not contain information upon which the substantial
correctness of the report may be
judged or contains information that
on its face indicates that the report
is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the report in that manner
is due to a position that is frivolous
or a desire that is apparent from the
report to delay or impede the administration of the tax levied by this
chapter, a penalty of five hundred
dollars shall be imposed.
(b) If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting
or payment of the tax required to be
shown on any report or return
required under this chapter, a penalty of one thousand dollars or one

the Commissioner, if such person
refunds to a consumer the admission
upon which the tax levied under
this chapter has been paid, such person may request a refund or credit
of the amount of admissions tax so
refunded. If a person charged with
collecting the tax levied under this

the total admissions reported during
a monthly reporting period, such
person may request a refund or credit of the amount of admissions tax
erroneously paid.

from the date on which such payment was made or the return was
due, whichever is later, on a form
prescribed by the Commissioner.
Upon the filing of an application for
refund or credit, the Commissioner
shall
determine
the
amount
of
refund or credit to which the applicant may be entitled and may
require any such information and
documentation as he deems necessary in making that determination.
(c) No interest shall be paid on
any tax refunded or credited overpayment.
(d) In the event any person who
is entitled to a refund or credit is
indebted to the City for any tax or
fee administered by the Commissioner that is paid to the City, or
any charge, penalty or interest arising from such a tax or fee, the
amount refundable shall first be
applied in satisfaction of that debt.
If the amount refundable is less
than the amount of the debt, it may
be applied in partial satisfaction of
the debt. If the amount refundable
is greater than the amount of the
debt, the amount remaining after

November 28, 2007
satisfaction of the debt shall be
credited as provided in this Section.

The City Record
Res. No. 1902-07.
By Council Member Britt.
An emergency resolution encouraging the Jackson administration
and State of Ohio to examine the
City of Cleveland retirement system’s investments to determine if
funds are invested in scrutinized
companies operating in Sudan; and
if such companies are found in the
City’s retirement portfolio, encourage those companies to cease scrutinized business operations in Sudan, and cease investments in scrutinized companies until the Sudanese government stops military
forces from committing genocide in
Darfur.
Whereas, the government of Sudan has engaged in a policy of
genocide against its own civilians in
Darfur through use of its military
and through sponsorship of attacks
by armed militias known as the janjaweed; and
Whereas, the janjaweed and military of the Sudanese government
are responsible for razing over 80%
of Darfur’s villages, gang-raping
civilians,
slaughtering
at
least
200,000 victims, displacing 2.5 million more, using forced starvation as
a weapon of war, and impeding
access of humanitarian aid to the up
to 3.5 million Darfurians that are
now reliant on assistance; and
Whereas, the Sudanese government and janjaweed militias have
continued their attacks despite the
signing of the Darfur Peace Agreement; and
Whereas, the Darfur crisis represents the first time the US Congress,
State Department, and President
have declared a genocide while the
atrocities are ongoing; and
Whereas,
certain
international
companies operating in Sudan bring
significant revenue, cover, and arms
to the Sudanese government while
providing little benefit to the majority of Sudan’s citizens; and
Whereas, Khartoum has funneled
the majority of foreign direct investment from these companies into military expenditures used to perpetuate the genocide while neglecting
needed development projects in the
Darfur region; and
Whereas, the government of Sudan has a history of remedying
egregious behavior in response to
economic pressure; and
Whereas, the current Sudan divestment movement now encompasses
nearly 100 universities, cities, states,
and private pension plans; and
Whereas, the divestment movement has already gained the attention of the Sudanese government
and altered the behavior of some
companies operating in Sudan;
Whereas, this Council encourages
the Jackson administration and the
State of Ohio investment managers
to examine City retirement investments and short-term investment
pool to determine if funds are
invested in scrutinized companies
operating in Sudan.
Whereas, scrutinized companies
shall be defined as those companies
that:
1. Engage in business with actors
or projects that directly or indirectly benefit the government of Sudan

2160

November 28, 2007
through providing revenue or arms
to the government or by enhancing
the government’s capacity to resist
international pressure on Darfur;
2. Provide minimal benefit to
those outside of government or the
small circle of government supporters based mainly in the Khartoum
state;
3. Have no significant corporate
governance policy to address how a
company’s business in Sudan may
contribute to the genocide in Darfur;
and
Whereas, Companies that meet
any of the following criteria shall
not be considered scrutinized companies:
1. Companies contracting exclusively with the Government of South
Sudan;
2. Companies primarily participating in the provision of goods or services that principally and directly
benefit marginalized populations in
Sudan;
3. Companies involved in the distribution of general downstream
consumer goods and services within
the country;
4. Companies whose primary purpose in Sudan is humanitarian, medical, journalistic, educational, or any
other “social good;”
5. Companies whose activities in
Sudan are currently dormant; and
Whereas, this Council encourages
the Jackson administration and
State of Ohio to identify scrutinized companies to implement the
above policy by consulting, on a
quarterly basis, a list promulgated
by the Sudan Divestment Task
Force; and
Whereas, if it is found that the
City of Cleveland’s retirement funds
are being invested in scrutinized
companies operating in Sudan, this
Council encourages the City retirement system and its investment
managers to undertake the following procedure with respect to these
identified companies:
1. Engage these companies for a
period of no longer than three
months in an effort to convince
them to alter or cease scrutinized
business operations in Sudan, using
engagement letters are available
from the Sudan Divestment Task
Force;
2. If a scrutinized company undertakes any of the following actions
during the engagement period, they
shall no longer be considered a scrutinized company: adopting, publicizing, and implementing a formal plan
to cease Scrutinized Business Operations within one year and to
refrain from any such new Business
Operations; undertaking humanitarian efforts in conjunction with an
international organization, the government of Sudan, the regional government of southern Sudan, or a
non-profit entity and evaluated and
certified by an independent third
party to be substantial in relationship to the company’s Sudan business operations and of benefit to
one or more marginalized populations of Sudan; or through engagement with the Government of Sudan,
materially improving conditions for
the genocidally victimized population in Darfur;

November 28, 2007
3. If a scrutinized company does
not exhibit any of these changes
during the engagement period, this
Council encourages the City’s retirement system and investment managers to divest all public securities
held in scrutinized companies, excluding public securities held in
commingled accounts or securities
where
no
financially
equivalent
alternative is available;
4. If the city is found to hold
securities in commingled funds that
contain scrutinized companies, this
Council encourages the City’s retirement system to submit letters to
the managers of such funds containing scrutinized companies requesting that they consider removing such companies from the fund
or create a similar actively managed fund with commingled holdings devoid of such companies, and
if the manager creates a similar
fund, the City’s retirement system
will replace all applicable investments with investments in the similar fund in an expedited timeframe
consistent with prudent investing
standards; and
Whereas, this Council encourages
the City retirement system’s investment
managers
to
continue
to
review your investments and take
action to restrict investments in
scrutinized companies as described
above on a quarterly basis; and
Whereas, this Council encourages
the City retirement system’s investment managers not to enter into further investments in offending companies until the Sudanese government stops its military and militia
forces from committing genocide in
Darfur; and
Whereas, this Council calls upon
the State of Ohio to follow the example of the City’s retirement system
and identify and divest from all
companies meeting the above criteria, aiding Sudan’s genocidal government
without
benefiting
the
country’s marginalized populations.
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby encourages the Jackson administration and State of Ohio to examine the City of Cleveland retirement
system’s investments to determine if
funds are invested in scrutinized
companies operating in Sudan; and
if such companies are found in the
City’s retirement portfolio, encourage those companies to cease scrutinized
business
operations
in
Sudan, and cease investments in
scrutinized
companies
until
the
Sudanese government stops military
forces from committing genocide in
Darfur.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to the Sudan Divestment Task Force, State of Ohio
PERS, and Mayor Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,

The City Record
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted November 19, 2007.
