An emergency resolution urging
the State of Ohio to enact legislation that prohibits racial profiling
and mandates data collection during
traffic stops.
Whereas, racial profiling is the
stop, detention, or other disparate
treatment of an individual using the
racial, ethnic or minority group status of such individual as a factor,
other than in the case of a physical
description used to apprehend a specific suspect; and
Whereas, the majority of states
have some form of racial profiling
legislation regarding data collection
during traffic stops; and
Whereas, Ohio is only one of ten
states that have no racial profiling
legislation passed or under consideration; and
Whereas, some Ohio agencies collect data voluntarily or as the result
of litigation, but the vast majority
of Ohio agencies do not collect data
during traffic stops – counter to the
national trend; and
Whereas, data collected by officers is essential in order to identify
any pattern of racial and ethnic disparities during traffic and pedestrian stops by police and make recommendations to eliminate any disparities; and
Whereas, data collected must include stop, driver, and vehicle characteristics, stop outcomes, and identification information in order to be
useful in racial profiling traffic stop
studies; and
Whereas, data collection assists in
identifying potential problem areas
and increases officers’ legitimacy
with the public; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the State of Ohio to enact
legislation that prohibits racial profiling and mandates data collection
during traffic stops.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to the Ohio
General Assembly, Governor Strickland, the NAACP, and Mayor Jackson.

measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force

An emergency resolution supporting reauthorization of the federal
Ryan White CARE Act, under which
the United States supports medical
and other social services for 571,000
poor, underinsured, and uninsured
people with HIV/AIDS in the United States – including thousands of
individuals in Ohio, Cuyahoga County, and the City of Cleveland, and
urging such reauthorization to be in
a manner that results in just and
equitable distribution of funding
based on accurate counts of persons
living with HIV/AIDS, and that
fully takes into account the impact
local economic conditions have on a
region’s ability to help people gain
access to HIV/AIDS care and treatment.
Whereas, since 1990 the Ryan
White CARE Act has been the payer
of last resort for primary medical
and ancillary support services for
poor, uninsured, and underinsured
people with HIV/AIDS in the United States; and
Whereas, the availability of Ryan
White CARE Act resources has literally meant the difference between
life and death for individuals who
would not otherwise be able to
access the services they need; and
Whereas, the availability of Ryan
White CARE Act resources has
helped thousands of Cleveland and
Cuyahoga County residents achieve
significantly improved medical status and greater independence; and
Whereas, the Ryan White CARE
Act has expired, and is currently
being financed by continuing budget resolutions; and
Whereas, the US Congress is set
to consider reauthorization of the
Ryan White CARE Act in late
March or early April; and,
Whereas, since the Ryan White
CARE Act was last reauthorized in
2000, the number of HIV/AIDS cases

Whereas, poverty, unemployment,
homelessness, and other economic
conditions have a great impact on
the ability of a region to help people with HIV/AIDS gain access to

Whereas, the current funding formula results in an inequitable distribution of Ryan White CARE Act
resources across the United States,
leaving Ohio and cities within Ohio,
with fewer resources per patient
than other regions of the country;

An emergency resolution urging
the United States Postal Service,
Postmaster, Cleveland, Ohio to cease
the discontinued collection of certain neighborhood mail boxes and
engage members of Cleveland City
Council to evaluate the impact of
discontinued collection on Cleveland
neighborhoods; and further to maintain mail boxes in areas such as
major transit routes, by schools, and

Whereas, public access to mail
boxes in Cleveland neighborhoods is
an essential service relating to the
quality of life in communities across
Cleveland; and
Whereas, numerous neighborhood
mail boxes were removed over the

mail boxes; and
Whereas, availability of neighborhood mail boxes is a vital service to
individuals who do not drive, residents who use public transit and
individuals who prefer to take care
of their basic services within their
own neighborhoods; and

Whereas, the lack of access to
neighborhood mail boxes causes
risks to neighborhood residents in
transacting needed business and
personal communication including
paying bills, undertaking sensitive

taxpayers count on the United States
Government to be sensitive to the citizens’ need to use the services of the
United States Postal Services by way
of neighborhood mail boxes; and
Whereas, the United States Postal
Service, Station A (44102) Manager
has discontinued collection of the

An emergency resolution urging
the Federal government to increase
crucial funding for autism research
and services.
Whereas, about one in 150 American children has autism, according
to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s largest study
done so far on the urgent public
health concern; and
Whereas, the new study results,
based on 2002 data from 14 states,
are higher than previously reported,
and underscore how common autism
is; and
Whereas, the study calculated an
average autism rate of 6.6 per 1,000,
an increase from last year’s estimated rate of 5.5 in 1,000; and
Whereas, autism is a complex disorder characterized by a range of
behaviors, including difficulty in
expressing needs and inability to
socialize; and
Whereas, autism is usually not
diagnosed in children until after age
three, even though early intervention is beneficial to progress; and
Whereas, the cause of autism is
not known, although some parents
and advocates contend that autism
is linked to a vaccine preservative;
and
Whereas, Autism Speaks, the nation’s largest organization advocating more services for autistic children, believes the new data shows
the need for more early intervention
services, more therapists, and legislators to stand up for autistic children and their families; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the Federal government to
increase crucial funding for autism
research and services.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to Autism
Speaks, the United States Congress,
and the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Res. No. 306-07.
By Council Members Santiago,
Cimperman, Zone and Brancatelli.
An emergency resolution calling
upon the Jackson administration to
adequately inspect the canopy roofs
of all businesses in the City, including gas service stations, to ensure
compliance with the City’s Building
Code and the Ohio Building Code,
and supporting an amendment to the
codified ordinances to require regular maintenance of all flat canopy
roofs and also requiring any newly
constructed
canopy
roofs
to
be
pitched, not flat
Whereas, on February 14th, a
canopy roof covered with heavy
snow collapsed at a gas service station at Fulton and Lorain on Cleveland’s west side, injuring one person
and crushing three cars; and
Whereas, less than 6 days later,
on February 19th, another snowladen canopy roof completely collapsed at a gas service station at
West 14th and Clark in the City,
sending one person to the hospital;
and
Whereas, also on February 19th, a
canopy roof collapsed under the
weight of heavy snow at a business
in Elyria, trapping a woman for 25
minutes; and
Whereas, under the City’s Building Code, which adopts Ohio’s Building Code, all roofs, whether flat or
pitched, must be designed to bear
snow loads as set forth in the law;
and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
that doing everything possible to
ensure that canopy roofs bear the
weight of heavy snow is a matter
of grave importance to the health
and safety of the citizens of the
City; and
Whereas, City building and housing
inspectors
must
adequately
inspect all canopy roofs prior to
winter weather to ensure that these
roofs
can
hold
snow
loads
as
required by the code; and
Whereas, owners of flat canopy
roofs should be required to clean
snow from the structures regularly
during any snowfall; and
Whereas, engineers have stated
that flat canopy roofs are less sturdy in holding heavy snow than
pitched roofs and flat canopy roofs
are more likely to collapse under
the weight of heavy snow; and
Whereas, given the obvious engineering problems with flat canopy
roofs bearing heavy snow, all newly
constructed canopy roofs should be
required to have pitched roofs, not
flat; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council calls
upon the Jackson administration to
adequately inspect the canopy roofs
of all businesses in the City, including gas service stations, to ensure
compliance with the City’s Building
Code and the Ohio Building Code,
and supports an amendment to the
codified ordinances to require regular maintenance of all flat canopy
roofs and also to require any newly
constructed
canopy
roofs
to
be
pitched, not flat.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,

it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
