Res. No. 10-07.
By Council Member Sweeney (by
departmental request).
An emergency resolution requesting the County Auditor to make
advances during the year 2007 under
Section 321.34 of the Revised Code.
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That under Section
321.34 of the Revised Code, the County Auditor is requested to draw, and
the County Treasurer is requested to
pay, on draft or drafts made payable
to the Treasury of the City of Cleveland, any money that may be in the
County Treasury from time to time
during the year 2007 and credited to
the account of the City of Cleveland
and lawfully applicable to the purpose of the 2007 fiscal year, during
which year such request will be
made. The payments are to be made
from time to time in accordance
with the schedule set by Cuyahoga
County.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit a certified
copy of this resolution to the Auditor of Cuyahoga County.
Section 3. That this resolution is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted January 8, 2007.
Effective January 9, 2007.

Res. No. 11-07.
By Council Member Coats.
An emergency resolution encouraging the Federal Government to
address the disparities in healthcare
access and treatment between racial
and
ethnic
minority
population
groups and Caucasians by following
the recommendations of the National Healthcare Disparities Report,
the Institute of Medicine study and
the President’s New Freedom Commission.
Whereas, the United States has
achieved significant increases in
the life expectance of most residents and reductions in the incidence of injury, disability and disease; and
Whereas, the gap between the
health status and death rates for
racial and ethnic minority population groups and Caucasians has not
decreased and in some cases has
widened; and
Whereas, racial and ethnic minority populations face substantial cultural, social and economic barriers
to obtaining access to adequate and
competent health care; and
Whereas, the 2005 National Healthcare Disparities Report (NHDR) finds
that disparities related to race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status still
pervade the American health and
behavioral health care system in
almost all aspects of healthcare; and
Whereas, in 1999, Congress requested an Institute of Medicine
(IOM) study to assess the extent of
disparities in the types and quality
of health services received by U.S
racial and ethnic minorities and
non-minorities; and
Whereas, Congress charged the
IOM with the task of exploring the
factors that may contribute to inequities in care and to provide recommendations on policies and practices to eliminate these inequities;
and
Whereas, the report from that
study, “Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care”, found that a
consistent body of research demonstrates significant variation in the
rates of medical procedures by race,
even when insurance status, income,
age and severity of conditions are
comparable; and
Whereas, this research indicates
that U.S. racial and ethnic minorities
are less likely to receive even routine
medical procedures and experience a
lower quality of health services; and
Whereas, the report states that a
large body of research underscores
the existence of disparities in treatment such as minorities being less
likely to receive appropriate cardiac
medications, undergo bypass surgery or receive kidney dialysis or
transplants; and
Whereas, by contrast, minorities
are more likely to receive certain
less-desirable procedures, such as
lower limb amputations for diabetes
and other conditions; and
Whereas, the future health of the
nation will be determined to a large
extent by how effectively we work
with communities to reduce and
eliminate health disparities between
non-minority and minority populations experiencing disproportionate
burdens of disease, disability and
premature death; and

The City Record
Whereas, the President’s New Freedom Commission Report for 2005 underscored the disparity in recovery and
resilience for ethnic/racial minorities
and identified several goals to be
achieved by 2010 that included the
elimination of disparities; and
Whereas, eliminating health disparities will require new knowledge
about the determinants of disease,
causes of health disparities and
effective interventions for prevention and treatment; and
Whereas, eliminating health disparities will also require improving
access to the benefits of society,
including quality preventive and
treatment services, as well as innovative ways of working in partnership with health and behavioral
health care systems, federal, state
and local governments, advocacy
groups academia and communitybased organizations; and
Whereas, the recommendation of
the NHDR, IOM study and the President’s New Freedom Commission
Report
include:
increasing
the
awareness about health disparities
among the general public, health
care providers insurance companies
and policy-makers; recruiting more
minority
health
and
behavioral
health
care
providers
especially
since they are more likely to serve
in minority and medically underserved communities; and recruiting
more interpreters for health clinics
and hospitals to overcome language
barriers that may affect the quality
of care; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby encourages the Federal Government to address the disparities in
healthcare access and treatment
between racial and ethnic minority
population groups and Caucasians
by following the recommendations
of the National Healthcare Disparities Report, the Institute of Medicine study and the President’s New
Freedom Commission.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
all members of United States Congress representing the State of Ohio
and the appropriate representatives
of the National League of Cities.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Res. No. 13-07.
By Council Member Polensek.
An emergency resolution supporting a township-wide celebration of
the Euclid Township Charter Bicentennial, 1809-2009.
Whereas, on July 22, 1796 General
Moses Cleaveland and a team of surveyors of the Connecticut Land Company came to this area to settle a
capital of the Western Reserve
lands of Connecticut and to establish a settlement here; and
Whereas, Moses Cleaveland’s team
not only established Cleaveland as
a settlement but some also surveyed
land some seven miles east to establish the Euclid Township; and
Whereas, Euclid Township’s boundaries covered all or most of current Cleveland Heights, Collinwood
Village, East Cleveland, Euclid,
Lyndhurst,
Nottingham
Village,

January 17, 2007
Richmond
Heights
and
South
Euclid; and
Whereas, in November, 1809, the
State of Ohio gave Euclid Township
residents a charter to hold elections,
pass ordinances and levy taxes; the
first election was on April 10, 1810;
and
Whereas, these dates mark the
beginning of local democratic government on Cleveland’s East Side;
and
Whereas, two hundred years after
founding, it is time to revisit the
historic event of Euclid Township
by
celebrating
a
township-wide
charter bicentennial; and
Whereas, impetus for a substantial yet light-hearted event comes
from the City of Euclid’s “Sesquicentennial” for the 1809 charter; and
Whereas, celebratory events for
the Euclid Township Charter Bicentennial celebration will be held in
venues across the old township during the fall of 2009 and the winter
and spring of 2010; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,

An emergency resolution endorsing the City of Cleveland’s AntiIdling Policy and encouraging other
municipalities to adopt Anti-Idling
Policies; announcing City Council’s
intent to enact Anti-Idling legislation that regulates private commercial fleet vehicles.
Whereas, unnecessary running an
engine at low speed (idling) wastes
fuel and pollutes the air; and
Whereas, idling causes twice the
wear on internal parts compared to
driving at regular speeds; and
Whereas, idling of vehicles consumes approximately 17% of the
fuel that a vehicle has on board; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
and
Northeast
Ohio
have
been
attempting to lessen pollutants that

The City Record
pose a detriment to the region’s air
quality, but the region is still in a
non-attainment status; and
Whereas, reducing idling is necessary to protect public health and
the environment by reducing emissions while conserving fuel; and
Whereas, effective June 1, 2006,
the City of Cleveland adopted an
Anti-Idling Policy that applies to all
City vehicles, equipment, and operators, that is available on the City of
Cleveland’s Division of Water website sustainability page and a copy
