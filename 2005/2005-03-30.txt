FIRST READING EMERGENCY ORDINANCES REFERRED

An emergency ordinance to reallocate funds appropriated for the use of the Housing Division of the Judicial
Branch and the Clerks Division of the Judicial Branch under the annual appropriation measure, Ordinance No.

Whereas, in the City’s annual appropriation measure, Ordinance No. 125-05, passed March 28, 2005, the total
amount of funds appropriated for the use of the Housing Division was inadvertently listed as $9,921,289 instead
of the correct figure of $2,801,680; and
Whereas, the total amount of funds appropriated for the use of the Clerk Division was inadvertently listed as
$2,787,513 instead of the correct figure of $9,907,122; and
Whereas, the total amount of funds appropriated for the use of the Judicial Division remains unchanged at
$21,003,577; and
Whereas, the total appropriation for each of these Divisions must be reallocated and transferred within the
Judicial Branch to correctly show the Division’s appropriations; and
Whereas, in accordance with Section 41 of the Charter, the Mayor has recommended in writing the within
transfer; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of a municipal
department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the City of Cleveland:
