Ord. No. 1780-05.
By Mayor Campbell.
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Economic
Development to enter into a Tax
Increment
Financing
Agreement
with Steelyard Commons LLC, to
provide for payments to the Cleveland City School District and to
provide for the creation of the
Steelyard Commons TIF Fund to be
used for development and recreational
improvements;
and
to
declare certain improvements to
real property to be a public purpose.
Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of
the Revised Code, improvements to

2681

real property may be declared to
be a public purpose where fee title
to such real property was, at one
time, held by the City of Cleveland
and the real property is then
leased or conveyed by the City;
and
Whereas, under the authority of
Ordinance No. 1541-04, passed October 17, 2005, and prior to the passage of this ordinance, the City
approved both the acquisition and
conveyance of fee title to certain
real property, which is more particularly described in the documents
set
forth
in
the
file
described in this ordinance (the
“Real Property”); and
Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of
the Revised Code, such improvements so declared to be a public purpose may be exempt from real property taxation; and
Whereas, under Section 5709.42 of
the Revised Code, the owners of the
improvements may be required to
make annual service payments in
lieu of taxes that would have been
paid had such improvements not
been exempt; and
Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of
the Revised Code, the exemption
may exceed 75% of the improvements for up to 30 years without
the approval of the board of education of the school district within
the territory of which the improvements are or will be located if the
ordinance declaring improvements
to a parcel to be a public purpose
specifies that service payments in
lieu of taxes provided for in Section 5709.42 of the Ohio Revised
Code shall be paid to the school
district in which the parcel is located in the amount of the taxes that
would have been payable to the
school district if the improvements
had not been exempted from taxation; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That pursuant to and in
accordance with the provisions of
Section 5709.41 of the Revised Code,
this Council finds and determines
that 100% of the increase in assessed value of the Property after
its acquisition by the City (which
increase in assessed value is referred to as “Improvement” as defined in Section 5709.41 of the Revised Code) will be a public purpose.
Section 2. That one hundred percent (100%) of the Improvements
are declared exempt from real prop-

4
erty taxation for a period of 20
years beginning _____________ 2005;
and that in no event shall the
exemption period extend beyond
_________, 2026.
Section 3. That, under Section
5709.42 of the Revised Code, the
owners of the Improvements shall
make service payments for a period
of 20 years in lieu of the exempt
taxes to the Cuyahoga County Treasurer;
the
payments
shall
be
charged and collected in the same
manner, and shall be in an amount
not less than the taxes that would
have been paid had the Improvements not been exempt from taxation.
Section 4. That a portion of the
service payments collected under
Section 3 of this ordinance shall be
distributed by the Cuyahoga County Treasurer to the Treasurer of
the Cleveland Municipal School District (“District”) in the amount of
the taxes that would have been
payable to the District had the
Improvement not been exempt from
taxation.
Section 5. That the Mayor or
Director of Economic Development,
with the approval of the Director of
Law, is authorized to enter into one
or more agreements with such parties as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the purposes of
this ordinance.
Section 6. That under Section
5709.43 of the Revised Code there
is hereby established a Steelyard
Commons
Urban
Redevelopment
Tax Increment Equivalent Fund
(“Steelyard Commons TIF Fund”),
70% of which shall be used for
acquisition of land and to make
improvements to the Tow Path
Trail and Canal Basin Park. Of
this 70%, if there are remaining
funds, they shall be used for additional connector trails.
The remaining 30% shall be used
for retail assistance programs and
other commercial and industrial initiatives, including land acquisition,
within the City. This 30% will be
used primarily for projects that offset the impacts of Steelyard Commons on adjacent neighborhood commercial districts, and use of these
funds will be guided by the retail
impact study currently underway.
These funds will be disbursed quarterly as grants, on a competitive
basis, under criteria established by
this Council and the Cleveland
City-wide Development Corporation
(CCDC). The CCDC will evaluate
applications and make recommendations to this Council. Projects in
the following categories will be
eligible:
Neighborhood Retail: specifically
those elements not funded by the
existing Storefront Program (such
as parking lots);
Neighborhood Small and Start-up
Businesses: to assist with small
business expansion, refine business
plans, assist entrepreneurs to “get
out of the garage and into a storefront,” etc.;
Neighborhood Arts Projects: projects that enhance a neighborhood
commercial/retail district;
Neighborhood Streetscape: in neighborhood commercial/residential districts;

The City Record
Neighborhood
Industrial
Sites:
planning, environmental site assessments, etc., of underused and/or
abandoned neighborhood industrial
sites; and

Tow Path Trail.
Section 7. That the service payments collected under Section 3
shall be distributed by the Cuyahoga County Treasurer to the Treasurer of the City of Cleveland to be
deposited in the Steelyard Commons
TIF Fund created by Section 6.
With the approval of the Director of
Economic
Development
and
the
Director of Law, money deposited in
the Steelyard Commons TIF Fund
shall be used to for the purposes
described in Section 6.
Section 8. That the Director of the
Office of Equal Opportunity shall
engage in discussions with the
County Engineer to explore how
employment of local residents and
minority and female business enterprises can best be advanced. The
Director of the Office of Equal
Opportunity shall report back to this
Council on the results of those discussions and shall make recommendations on how to achieve those
goals.
Section 9. That the signed letter
from Mitchell Schneider, President
of First Interstate Properties Ltd.,
dated December 2, 2005 to the Council Member of Ward 13 shall be
placed in File No. 1780-05-A.
Section 10. That there is hereby
created
an
Advisory
Committee
that shall consist of five members
selected as follows: one (1) member shall be appointed by this
Council; one (1) member shall be
appointed by the Mayor; one (1)
member shall be appointed by the
County Commissioners; and two (2)
members shall be appointed by the
