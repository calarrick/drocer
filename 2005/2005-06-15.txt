Members

Coats, Zone, White, Britt, Sweeney,
Brady, Dolan, Jackson and Polensek.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Legislature not to increase
the kilowatt-hour tax for the purpose of balancing the state budget.
Whereas, the Ohio Legislature is
considering House Bill 66, the 2005
state budget bill that will impose
drastic
funding
cuts
for
Ohio’s
largest and neediest cities; and
Whereas, the budget bill includes
a 30% increase in the kilowatt-hour
tax imposed on the consumption of
electricity in the state; and
Whereas, the residents of Cleveland and northern Ohio already pay
some of the highest rates for electricity in the country; and
Whereas, the kilowatt-hour tax is
unfairly regressive in that it applies
to customers at the same rate with-

The City Record
out regard to the income of the customer or the customer’s ability to
pay; and
Whereas, the proposed 30% increase in the kilowatt-hour tax also
unfairly penalizes lower-income residents, many of whom cannot afford
modern energy-efficient homes and
appliances; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public

City. The provisions of this ordinance have neither the purpose nor
effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any
communicative materials, including

of this ordinance to restrict or deny
access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment or to deny access by the

who owns, controls, operates, or
maintains a Adult Video Arcade or

area where the owner, operator, or
employee keeps the cash register.

area accessible to the patrons.
Section 237.03

Configuration

No person shall operate an Adult

Entertainment Arcade unless the
Arcade complies with the following
requirements:
(a) It is the duty of the owners
and operator of the premises to
ensure that at least one employee is
on duty and can see the monitor
located at the manager’s station at
all times that any patron is present
inside the premises.
(b) The premises’ owner or operator installs a camera system in the
video booths that complies with the
following requirements:
(1) The owner or operator operates the camera system when any of
the booths are available for viewing
videos.
(2) The owner or operator numbers all the booths in the store with
an individual number so that the
booth is identified on the monitor,
the digital recording, and the maintenance log.

an individual camera in each video
booth.
(4) The individual cameras are
placed in the booths in a way that
shows the people inside the booths

shoulders.

1262

June 15, 2005
(6) Each Video Arcade will immediately remove anything that obstructs the camera from showing the
people inside the booths from at
least the knees to the shoulders.
(7) The camera system has a monitor at the manager’s station so that
the owner, operator, or employee
who is present in the store can view
it.
(8) The monitor faces into the
store’s public area so that it is visible from the public area.
(9) The monitor’s screen is not
obstructed from view from the public area at any time that the store
is open to the public.
(10) The monitoring system operates on a switcher system so that
the monitor switches sequentially
and continuously from one camera
to another. The continuous switching process will be timed to allow
an adequate view of each area surveyed by each camera. The view
inside each booth must be at least
four seconds, but not more than six
seconds. Once the camera system
completes a circuit showing the
inside of all the booths, the system
must immediately start a new circuit showing inside all the booths.
(11) The monitor and the recording identify the booth number for
the booth that is being shown on the
monitor.
(12) The camera system records
all activity in all booths in digital
format
on
a
minimum
five-day
recording loop. The owner or operator must maintain at least the most
recent five-day period’s recordings
at all times.
(13) The camera system records
the date and time for the recorded
images.
(14) The owner or operator places
a sign that is at least 5" by 7" in a
conspicuous place in each booth
stating words to the effect: “This
arcade installed a video-camera-monitoring-and-recording system in this
booth. The arcade monitors and
records activity in this booth.”
(15) If anyone removes or defaces
the
sign
required
by
C.C.O.
§
237.03(b)(14), then the owner or
operator will replace the sign with
a new one as soon as store personnel find that the sign has been
removed or defaced. The owner or
operator must keep enough extra
signs in supply at the store to be
able to replace any sign as needed.
(16) If a camera is not operating
in any booth, the store must close
that booth until the camera is
repaired. “Not operating” means that
the
camera
does
not
transmit
images showing the booth’s interior
so that the image is shown on the
monitor and recorded by the recording device.
(17) If the entire camera system
is not operating, then the Video
Arcade may not operate any video
booths until the system is repaired.
(18) Each Video Arcade will keep
a log for every time the camera system or an individual camera is not
working. The log also must note
any time that the sign required by
C.C.O. § 237.03(b)(14) is defaced or
removed. The log should show the
date and time the camera or camera system stopped working, the
date and time a repair company
fixed it, and the repair company’s
contact information. The owner or
operator must immediately provide
a copy of this log to City officials
on request.

the owner or operator will provide
artificial light at a level that allows
the activities inside the booth to be
clearly visible on the camera system’s monitor and recordings. If
City officials cannot clearly see
activities inside the booths either on
the camera system’s monitor or
recordings, then the Video Arcades
must raise the light level inside the
booths to the point where the activities are clearly visible.
(f) It shall be the duty of the
operator, and it shall also be the
duty of any agents and employees
present in the premises, to ensure

ditional Uses

Approval

of

Con-

The City Planning Commission
shall approve a conditional use in
an I-R District only if it determines
that the proposed use, by virtue of
its location, size, layout and design,
will function principally to support
the institutional and research uses
in the district, and will contribute to
the creation or maintenance of a
vibrant, pedestrian-oriented, mixeduse district.
Section 340.06
Site Plan and Design Review
No Building Permit shall be issued for the construction of a new
building
in
an
Institutional-Research District without the approval
of the site plan and building design
by the City Planning Commission or
its Director, in accordance with
rules promulgated by the Commis-

sion and in accordance with the following standards.
(a) Master Plan. In reviewing development proposals in an Institutional-Research District, the City
Planning Commission shall assess
the development’s consistency with
any applicable master plan that has
been adopted or accepted by the
Commission. If no current master
plan for the district is available to
the Commission, the Commission
may request submission of a master
plan from an organization deemed
responsible for preparation of a plan
for the district.
(b) Urban Form. Except where
such design would be clearly inconsistent with the character of an area,
new development should take an
“urban form,” characterized by multistory buildings, streetside building
placement, and parking located in
garages or in lots behind buildings.
(c) Architectural Design. In addition to meeting high standards of
architectural design, buildings should
be compatible with nearby properties
with respect to scale, height, setback,
spacing,
orientation
to
existing
streets, architectural style, materials,
and colors.
Variations and innovations in design are, however, encouraged in order to achieve visual interest and to create distinct identities
for individual buildings and districts.
The goal is compatibility in design,
not uniformity.
(d) Pedestrian, Bicyclist and Transit Access. Developments should be
designed to facilitate safe and convenient access by pedestrians and
bicyclists and to facilitate use of
public transit.
(e) Parking and Circulation. Developments should be designed to
provide adequate and convenient offstreet and on-street parking and to
utilize opportunities for parking that
is shared by buildings and uses.
Streets, driveways, sidewalks and
paths should be designed in a manner that facilitates safe and convenient circulation for motorists, pedestrians, bicyclists and transit users.
(f) Landscaping and Open Space.
Developments should include landscaped areas and open spaces that
enhance the appearance of a property and provide areas for recreation and scenic enjoyment, while
meeting the environmental design
standards of this Section.
(g) Environmental Design. Developments should incorporate “sustainable” building techniques and other
measures, as feasible, in order to
conserve energy, minimize water
usage, recycle wastes, re-use building materials, and to achieve other
goals that promote environmental
sustainability.
Section 340.07 Off-Street Parking
Requirements
Off-street parking for individual
uses in an Institutional-Research District shall be provided in accordance
with the regulations of Section 349.04.

submitted and reviewed in accordance with the provisions of Section

Section 413.031 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as
enacted by Ordinance No. 176-A-05,
passed May 2, 2005, relating to the
use of automated cameras to impose
civil penalties upon red light and
speeding violators.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 413.031 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as enacted by Ordinance No. 176-A-05, passed May 2,
2005 is amended to read as follows:
Section 413.031 Use of Automated
Cameras to Impose Civil Penalties
upon Red Light and Speeding Violators
Civil
enforcement
system
(a)
established. The City of Cleveland
hereby adopts a civil enforcement
system for red light and speeding
offenders photographed by means of
an “automated traffic enforcement
camera system” as defined in division (m). This civil enforcement system imposes monetary liability on
the owner of a vehicle for failure of
an operator to stop at a traffic signal displaying a steady red light
indication or for the failure of an
operator to comply with a speed limitation.
(b) Red light offense - liability
imposed. The owner of a vehicle
shall be liable for the penalty
imposed under this section if the
vehicle crosses a marked stop line
or the intersection plane at a system location when the traffic signal
for that vehicle’s direction is emitting a steady red light.
(c) Speeding offense - liability
imposed. The owner of a vehicle
shall be liable for the penalty
imposed under this section if the
vehicle is operated at a speed in
excess of the limitations set forth in
Section 433.03.
(d) Liability does not constitute a
conviction. The imposition of liability under this section shall not be
deemed a conviction for any purpose
and shall not be made part of the
operating record of any person on
whom the liability is imposed.
(e) Other offenses and penalties
not abrogated. Nothing in this section shall be construed as altering
or limiting Sections 433.03 or 413.03
of these Codified Ordinances, the
criminal penalties imposed by those
sections, or the ability of a police
officer to enforce those sections
against any offender observed by
the officer violating either of those
sections. Nothing in this section
shall be construed to limit the liability of an operator of a vehicle for
any violation of division (b) or (c)
of this section.
(f) Selection of camera sites. The
selection of the sites where automated cameras are placed and the
enforcement of this ordinance shall
be made on the basis of sound professional traffic engineering and
law enforcement judgments. Automated cameras shall not be placed
at any site where the speed restrictions or the timing of the traffic signal fail to conform to sound professional traffic engineering principles.

The Director of Public Safety
shall cause the general public to be
notified by means of a press release
issued at least thirty days before
any given camera is made fullyoperational and is used to issue tickets to offenders. Before a given camera issues actual tickets, there shall
be a period of at least two weeks,
which may run concurrently with
the 30-day public-notice period, during which only “warning” notices
shall be issued.
At each site of a red light or fixed
speed camera, the Director of Public Service shall cause signs to be
posted to apprise ordinarily observant
motorists
that
they
are
approaching an area where an automated camera is monitoring for red
light or speed violators. Mobile
speed units shall be plainly marked
vehicles.
(h) Notices of liability. Any ticket for an automated red light or
speeding system violation under this
section shall:
(1) Be reviewed by a Cleveland
police officer;
(2) Be forwarded by first-class
mail or personal service to the vehicle’s registered owner’s address as
given on the state’s motor vehicle
registration, and
(3) Clearly state the manner in
which the violation may be appealed.
(i) Penalties. Any violation of
division (b) or division (c) of this
section shall be deemed a noncriminal violation for which a civil
penalty shall be assessed and for
which no points authorized by Sec-

1312

tion 4507.021 of the Revised Code
(“Point system for license suspension”) shall be assigned to the
owner or driver of the vehicle.
(j) Ticket evaluation, public service, and appeals. The program
shall include a fair and sound ticket-evaluation process that includes
review by the vendor and a police
officer, a strong customer-service
commitment, and an appeals process
that accords due process to the ticket respondent and that conforms to
the requirements of the Ohio Revised Code.
(k) Appeals. A notice of appeal
shall be filed with the Hearing Officer within twenty-one (21) days
from the date listed on the ticket.
The failure to give notice of appeal
or pay the civil penalty within this
time period shall constitute a waiver of the right to contest the ticket
and shall be considered an admission.
Appeals shall be heard by the
Parking Violations Bureau through
an administrative process established by the Clerk of the Cleveland
Municipal Court. At hearings, the
strict rules of evidence applicable to
courts of law shall not apply. The
contents of the ticket shall constitute a prima facie evidence of the
facts it contains. Liability may be
found by the hearing examiner
based upon a preponderance of the
evidence. If a finding of liability is
appealed, the record of the case
shall include the order of the Parking Violations Bureau, the Ticket,
other evidence submitted by the
respondent or the City of Cleveland,
and a transcript or record of the
hearing, in a written or electronic
form acceptable to the court to
which the case is appealed.
Liability shall not be found where
the evidence shows that the automated camera captured an event is
not an offense, including each of the
following events and such others as
may be established by rules and regulations issued by the Director of
Public Safety under the authority of
division (n) of this section:
1) The motorist stops in time to
avoid violating a red light indication;
2) The motorist proceeds through
a red light indication as part of
funeral procession;
3) The motorist is operating a
City-owned emergency vehicle with
its emergency lights activated and
proceeds through a red light indication or exceeds the posted speed limitation;
4) The motorist is directed by a
police officer on the scene contrary
to the traffic signal indication.
Liability shall also be excused if
a vehicle is observed committing an
offense
where
the
vehicle
was
stolen prior to the offense and the
owner has filed a police report;
The Director of Public Safety, in
coordination with the Parking Violations Bureau, shall establish a
process by which a vehicle owner
who was not the driver at the time
of the alleged offense may, by affidavit, name the person who the
owner believes was driving the vehicle at the time. Upon receipt of such
an affidavit timely submitted to the
Parking
Violations
Bureau,
the
Bureau shall suspend further action
against the owner of the vehicle and
instead direct notices and collection
efforts to the person identified in
the affidavit. If the person named in
the affidavit, when notified, denies

The City Record

being the driver or denies liability,
then the Parking Violations Bureau
shall resume the notice and collection process against the vehicle
owner, the same as if no affidavit
had been submitted, and if the violation is found to have been committed by a preponderance of evidence, the owner shall be liable for
any penalties imposed for the offense.
A decision in favor of the City of
Cleveland
may
be
enforced
by
means of a civil action or any other
means provided by the Revised
Code.
(l) Evidence of ownership. It is
prima facie evidence that the person
registered as the owner of the vehicle with the Ohio Bureau of Motor
Vehicles, or with any other State
vehicle registration office, was operating the vehicle at the time of the
offenses set out in divisions (b) and
(c) of this section.
