held by the City of Cleveland and
the real property is then leased or
conveyed by the City; and
Whereas, under the authority of
Ordinance No. 1541-04, passed October 17, 2005, and prior to the passage of this ordinance, the City
approved both the acquisition and
conveyance of fee title to certain
real property, which is more particularly described in the documents set forth in the file described
in this ordinance (the “Real Property”); and
Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of
the Revised Code, such improvements so declared to be a public purpose may be exempt from real property taxation; and
Whereas, under Section 5709.42 of
the Revised Code, the owners of the
improvements may be required to
make annual service payments in
lieu of taxes that would have been
paid had such improvements not
been exempt; and
Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of
the Revised Code, the exemption
may exceed 75% of the improvements for up to 30 years without the
approval of the board of education
of the school district within the territory of which the improvements
are or will be located if the ordinance declaring improvements to a
parcel to be a public purpose specifies that service payments in lieu of
taxes provided for in Section 5709.42
of the Ohio Revised Code shall be
paid to the school district in which
the parcel is located in the amount
of the taxes that would have been
payable to the school district if the
improvements had not been exempted from taxation; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That pursuant to and in
accordance with the provisions of
Section 5709.41 of the Revised Code,
this Council finds and determines
that 100% of the increase in assessed

a public purpose.

5709.42 of the Revised Code, the owners of the Improvements shall make
service payments for a period of 20
years in lieu of the exempt taxes to
the Cuyahoga County Treasurer; the
payments shall be charged and collected in the same manner, and shall
be in an amount not less than the
taxes that would have been paid had
the Improvements not been exempt
from taxation.
Section 4. That a portion of the
service payments collected under
Section 3 of this ordinance shall be
distributed by the Cuyahoga County
Treasurer to the Treasurer of the

5709.43 of the Revised Code there is
hereby established a Steelyard Commons Urban Redevelopment Tax
Increment Equivalent Fund (“Steelyard Commons TIF Fund”), 70% of
which shall be used for acquisition
of land and to make improvements
to the Tow Path Trail and Canal
Basin Park. Of this 70%, if there are
remaining funds, they shall be used
for additional connector trails.
The remaining 30% shall be used
for retail assistance programs and
other commercial and industrial initiatives, including land acquisition,
within the City. This 30% will be
used primarily for projects that offset the impacts of Steelyard Commons on adjacent neighborhood commercial districts, and use of these
funds will be guided by the retail
impact study currently underway.
These funds will be disbursed quarterly as grants, on a competitive
basis, under criteria established by
this Council and the Cleveland Citywide

the Steelyard Commons TIF Fund
shall be used to for the purposes
described in Section 6.
Section 8. That the Director of the

Council on the results of those discussions and shall make recommendations on how to achieve those
goals.
Section 9. That the signed letter

of First Interstate Properties Ltd.,
dated December 2, 2005 to the Council Member of Ward 13 shall be
placed in File No. 1780-05-A.

Cleveland City Council on June 16,
1997, and Board of Control Resolution No. 5-05, adopted January 12,
2005, the City, through the Mayor,

Tillman
Associates,
Ltd.
(Consultant), for the professional
services necessary to conduct a disparity study of minority business
enterprise (MBE) and female business enterprise (FBE) utilization as
subcontractors by City contractors
within the Cleveland contracting
market; and
Whereas, the City and Consultant
have
determined
that
additional
City contractor subcontracting data
to that originally collected, and
additional study and assessment of
that data, was needed to complete
the MBE and FBE subcontractor
Disparity Study with results having
a quality and reliability level consistent with industry standards; and
Whereas, the Consultant has proposed to render the additional services necessary to complete the Disparity Study for an amount of
$70,000; now, therefore,
