By
Council
Members
Conwell,
Reed, Cimperman, Coats, Knight,
Westbrook, Zone, Brady and White.
An emergency resolution encouraging the state to support businesses that provide assistance to parents
of children with disabilities.
Whereas, the incidence of U.S.
children and teenagers with a disabling condition has tripled to 7%
from 2% in 1960; and
Whereas, today, an estimated one
in 12 U.S. workers has a child with
a disability or special need; and
Whereas, stigma and fear of
reprisal have kept many workers
from disclosing their family situations; and
Whereas, having a child with a
disability requires time and effort to
find and manage treatment, forcing
30% of parents to quit or cut back
at work; and
Whereas, few parents, however,
can afford to cut back: over 40% of
families
with
special-needs
kids
have financial problems because of
care costs; 60% of children with special needs rely on their parents’
employers for health insurance; and
Whereas, there are some companies that have instituted support
groups or have formed parent-networks for parents of special needs
children; and
Whereas, a few companies have
even expanded insurance coverage
for special-needs kids; and
Whereas, in order that more businesses provide much needed assistance to workers who have special
needs children, the state should do
what it can to ensure that such businesses are supported; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby encourages the state to support
businesses that provide assistance
to parents of children with disabilities.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Res. No. 2006-05.
By Council Members Zone, Sweeney, Conwell, Knight, Lewis, Cimperman, Brady, Westbrook and Coats.
An emergency resolution supporting Senate Bill 85 and encouraging
the Ohio Senate to pass Senate Bill
85.
Whereas, bankruptcy is a middle
class family issue as a family with
children is three times more likely
to file for bankruptcy than a fami-

The City Record
ly without children and the typical
bankruptcy filer is middle class
with an above-average education
and owns a home; and
Whereas, new federal bankruptcy
legislation took effect on October 17,
2005 that makes it considerably
more difficult for Ohio’s working
families to climb out from an evergrowing mountain of debt caused
predominantly by medical bills, job
loss, and divorce; and
Whereas, this new federal bankruptcy legislation allows state legislatures to increase the amount of
equity filers may have in their
homes and cars; and
Whereas, passage of Senate Bill
85, “The Fighting Chance for Working Families Act of 2005”, raises the
home and auto equity exemptions in
Ohio law to match those at the federal level; and
Whereas, Senate Bill 85 would
increase the amount of equity a
married couple has in the home
from $10,000 to $30,000 and the
amount of auto equity would increase from $1,500 to $2,500; and
Whereas, the current state limits
were established more than two
decades ago when the average home
price in the state was between
$40,000 and $50,000; and
Whereas, failure to pass Senate
Bill 85 will result in more Ohio middle class families losing their homes
to foreclosure; and
Whereas, increased home foreclosures result in the deteriorating of
residential neighborhoods; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports Senate Bill 85 and encourages
the Ohio Senate to pass Senate Bill
85 as it raises the home and auto
equity exemptions in Ohio bankruptcy law to match those exemptions at the federal level.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to all members of the Ohio Senate.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

By Council Members Cimperman,
Pierce Scott and Jackson (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance declaring improvements to certain parcels
of real property to be a public purpose, describing the public improvements to be made to directly benefit such parcels, requiring the owner
of the improvements on such parcels
to make service payments in lieu
of taxes, establishing a municipal
public improvement tax increment
equivalent fund for the deposit of
such service payments, authorizing
a compensation agreement with the
Cleveland Municipal School District,
and related authorizations pursuant
to Revised Code Sections 5709.40,
5709.42 and 5709.43.
Whereas, Sections 5709.40, 5709.42
and 5709.43 of the Revised Code (the
“Act”) provide that this Council may
describe public improvements to be
made which directly benefit certain
parcels, declare Improvements (as
defined in Section 5709.40 of the
Revised Code) with respect to such
parcels of real property located in
the City to be a public purpose,
thereby authorizing the exemption
of those Improvements from real
property taxation for a period of
time, and provide for the making of
service payments in lieu of taxes by
the owner of such parcels, and
establish a municipal public improvement tax increment equivalent
fund into which such service payments shall be deposited; and
Whereas, a residential and commercial development has been proposed (the “Project”) to be located
on the parcels and in the area
described in File No. 1645-05-D (that
area, as the parcels therein are consolidated or subdivided and as existing streets are vacated, is hereinafter referred to as the “Property,”

2309

13
excluding the portions thereof to be
part of public streets and parks otherwise exempt from property taxation); and
Whereas, this Council desires to
construct or cause the construction
of the public infrastructure improvements described and placed in the
above-mentioned file (the “Public
Improvements”) that once made will
directly benefit the Property; and
Whereas, the City has determined
that it is necessary and appropriate
and in the best interests of the City
to provide for service payments in
lieu of taxes with respect to the
Property pursuant to Section 5709.42
of the Revised Code (the “Service
Payments”); and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland is
an Impacted City within the meaning of Section 1728.01 of the Revised
Code; and
Whereas, the Property is located
within area designated as the Flats
East Bank Community Development
Plan Area, which this Council has
determined by Ordinance No. 1644-05,
passed ________________, 2005, is a
Blighted Area within the meaning
of Section 1728.01 of the Revised
Code; and
Whereas, the Property is located
in the Cleveland Municipal School
District (the “School District”), and
the School District has approved the
real property tax exemption provided for in this Ordinance and has
waived notice requirements on the
condition that a compensation agreement be entered into, as provided
herein (the “School Agreement”);
and
Whereas, the City desires that the
Cleveland Cuyahoga County Port
Authority (the “Port Authority”)
and/or the City and other governmental
entities
construct
and
finance a portion of the Public
Improvements and anticipates that
the Port Authority will finance costs
relating thereto by the issuance of
bonds by the Port Authority secured
by
the
Service
Payments
(the
“Bonds”) under the terms of a cooperative agreement to be entered into
providing for the City’s transfer of
the portion of the Service Payments
not otherwise paid to the School District; and
Whereas, the construction of the
Project and the Public Improvements is necessary to eliminate
blighted conditions and prevent the
recurrence of blight and as a result,
this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the
immediate preservation of the public, peace, property, health and safety, and for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

Res. No. 1966-05.
By Council Members Zone, Brady,
Lipovan Holan, Sweeney, White,
Westbrook, Polensek, Coats, Pierce
Scott, Brancatelli and Cimperman.
An emergency resolution opposing
the federal, “Gasoline for America’s
Security Act of 2005”, and encouraging
Ohio’s
senators
to
vote
against this bill when it is heard in
the Senate.
Whereas, late last month the
House Energy and Commerce Committee passed H.R. 3893, the “Gasoline for America’s Security Act of
2005”; and
Whereas, H.R. 3893 passed the
Committee without the opportunity
for state and local governments to
comment on the consequences of
this legislation’s sweeping preemptive measures; and
Whereas, last week, H.R. 3893
barely passed out of the House of
Representatives and will now be
heard in the Senate; and
Whereas, H.R. 3893 would give the
Secretary of the Department of
Energy the final siting and permitting authority for local refineries,
thus overriding any state and local
authority to do so; and
Whereas, H.R. 3893 would expose
states and local governments to federal sanctions and lawsuits by
threatening federal transportation
and project development funding
based on siting decisions made by
the federal government; and
Whereas, H.R. 3893 would impact
public health by compromising long
standing federal environmental laws
in that it would allow modifications
that would expand the capacity of
any industrial source (not just a refinery) without requiring any antipollution mechanisms; and
Whereas, H.R. 3893 reduces the
number of possible blends of diesel
and gasoline, without regard for the
individual needs of states and localities that depend on these special
blends to reduce emissions from
mobile sources, thus affecting the
health and well-being of Americans
everywhere; and
Whereas, H.R. 3893 masks attempts to dismantle environmental
laws that are not barriers to rebuilding the Gulf States affected by
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby opposes the federal, “Gasoline for
America’s Security Act of 2005”, H.R.
3893 and encourages Ohio’s senators
to vote against this bill when it is
heard in the Senate.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Senator
George Voinovich and Senator Mike

2322

October 26, 2005
DeWine, and to the National League
of Cities.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Res. No. 1967-05.
By Council Members Zone, Brady,
Lipovan Holan, Sweeney, White,
Westbrook, Coats, Pierce Scott, Conwell,
Polensek,
Brancatelli
and
Cimperman.
An emergency resolution supporting increased federal regulation of
non-point sources of water pollution.
Whereas, the Clean Water Act has
had undeniable success in reaching
the goal of restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical and biological integrity of the nation’s surface waters; and
Whereas, for almost 30 years, federal law has focused primarily on
point source pollution, strictly controlling discharges from municipal
and other facilities; and
Whereas, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, using
data provided by the states, reported in its 2000 National Water Quality Inventory Report that thirty-nine
percent (39%) of assessed river and
stream miles and forty-five percent
(45%) of assessed lake acres are not
meeting applicable standards and
are impaired for one or more desired
uses; and
Whereas, these waters cross political boundaries and any mechanism
to address pollution must include
watershed-based solutions; and
Whereas, the EPA states that nonpoint sources are the main reason
for these water quality problems —
perhaps contributing as much as
fifty percent (50%) of the nation’s
water pollution; and
Whereas, estimates on the cost to
address national non-point pollution
are based on questionable data and
are likely too outdated to be useful;
and
Whereas, combating the problem
of non-point source pollution will
require significant federal investment; and
Whereas, existing federal mechanisms, programs, and funding to
address
non-point
sources
have
proved inadequate to combat this
problem; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
Congress to develop a comprehensive, consistent program to control
and regulate non-source pollution
that includes adequate federal resources to progress and research,
economic studies to estimate costs
to control non-point pollution, and
watershed-based water quality initiatives.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to United
States Senator George Voinovich,
United States Senator Mike DeWine,

October 26, 2005
all members of the United States
House of Representatives representing Cuyahoga County and the surrounding counties, and the National
League of Cities.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adoped October 17, 2005.
Effective October 21, 2005.

Res. No. 1968-05.
By Council Members Zone, Polensek, Brady, Lipovan Holan, Sweeney, White, Westbrook, Reed, Coats,
Pierce Scott, Brancatelli and Cimperman.
An emergency resolution opposing
that portion of House Bill 189 that
modifies the definition of “dangerous dog” and “vicious dog” by eliminating pit bull dog from the definition of “vicious dog”.
Whereas, current state law defines “vicious dog” as a dog that (1)
without provocation kills or causes
serious injury to any person, (2)
without provocation causes injury,
other than death or serious injury,
to any person or has killed another
dog, or (3) belongs to a breed that
is commonly know as a pit bull dog;
and
Whereas, current state law also
states that the ownership, keeping,
or harboring of a pit bull dog is
prima-face evidence of the ownership, keeping, or harboring of a
vicious dog”; and
Whereas, House Bill 189 modifies
the definition of “dangerous dog”
and “vicious dog” by eliminating pit
bull dog from the definition of
“vicious dog”; and
Whereas, the presence of pit bull
dogs in neighborhoods often results
in fear and anxiety; and
Whereas, recent attacks by pit
bull dogs have increased this fear
and anxiety; and
Whereas, current state law requires owners of pit bull dogs and
other vicious dogs to satisfy certain
requirements
regarding
confinement, restraint, and liability insurance; and
Whereas, these requirements help
to protect the public; and
Whereas, removing pit bull dogs
from the vicious dog definition will
provide the public with less protection from pit bull dogs; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes that portion of House Bill 189
that modifies the definition of “dangerous dog” and “vicious dog” by
eliminating pit bull dog from the
definition of “vicious dog”.

making certain findings and determinations in connection with the
Plan.
Whereas, a proposed community
development plan, designated as the
Flats East Bank Community Development Plan, dated September, 2005
(the “CD Plan”), for the plan area
designated and described in the CD
Plan (the “Plan Area”), has been
prepared and submitted to Council;
and
Whereas, the CD Plan includes an
area described and designated within the Plan Area as the Action Area
(the “Action Area”) and the Plan
contemplates certain activities and
treatment for the elimination of conditions of blight and deterioration
and for the prevention of its recurrence within the Plan; and
Whereas, the City Planning Commission has found and determined
that the Plan Area is a blighted and
deteriorated area within the meaning of Section 313.02 of the Codified
Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976
and Section 1728.01 of the Revised
Code; and
Whereas, the findings of the City
Planning Commission are based on
a document entitled “East Bank of
the Flats Building Conditions Survey, September 2005” (“the Survey”)
with respect to the Plan Area; and
the City Planning Commission has
further
found
and
determined,
based on the Survey, that the
Action Area is a blighted and deteriorated area within the meaning of
Section 313.02 of the codified ordinances and Section 1728.01 of the
Revised Code; and
Whereas, under notice duly given,
the City Planning Commission held
a public hearing on the Plan which
includes the Action Area, and the
City
Planning
Commission
has
approved the CD Plan; and
Whereas, the CD Plan amends and
supersedes any previously adopted
plan with respect to the Plan Area;
and

34
Whereas, the Survey, the CD Plan
dated September, 2005, and the City
Planning Commission findings and
related materials have been presented to this Council, and have
been placed in File No. 1644-05-B;
and
Whereas, oral reports and testimony have been presented by City
staff, and Council has been apprised
of the facts, conditions, structural
deficiencies, and blighted influences
pertaining to the Plan Area and the
Action Area, including the existence
of a majority of structures that are
blighted due to one or more of the
following factors: structural deficiencies, deterioration, dilapidation,
obsolescence, nonconformities with
modern code requirements relating
to building or fire protection, existing conditions therein endangering
life and property by fire or other
causes, or other conditions which
are detrimental to the public health,
safety, morals and general welfare;
and
Whereas, this Council has determined that it shall be City policy that specific “Action Areas,” with
defined
boundaries,
within
community development plan areas will
be established by the City when the
City has determined that the presence of blight, and the possible
recurrence of blight, can be prevented through City or private maintenance, rehabilitation or redevelopment; and
Whereas, the CD Plan contemplates general measures to eliminate the conditions of blight and
deterioration from the Plan Area;
and the Action Area portion of the
Plan contemplates specific measures
to eliminate such conditions of
blight and deterioration from the
Action Area by providing for the
maintenance, rehabilitation, or clearance and redevelopment of structures on the property comprising the
area described in the Action Area,
under the CD Plan Standards; and
Whereas, for the above reasons,
this Council has determined that the
Plan for the Action Area, and the
implementation
of
the
measures
within the Plan will be in the best
interests of the citizens of the City
and will provide for the general
health, safety, and welfare of the
City; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public property, health, and
safety in that approval of the CD
Plan for the Action Area is necessary in order that steps can be
immediately undertaken to eliminate conditions of blight and deterioration and for the prevention of
its recurrence in the Plan Area; now
therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
