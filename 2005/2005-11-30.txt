Ord. No. 2162-05.
By Council Member Coats.
An emergency ordinance authorizing a Network Upgrade Surcharge
substantiated by Adelphia Cleveland, LLC.
Whereas, Adelphia Cleveland LLC,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adelphia Communications Corporation
(collectively, “Adelphia”), has the
right to own, operate and maintain
a cable system in the City of Cleveland, Ohio (the “City”) pursuant to
a franchise agreement granted on or
about September 16, 1986, as further
amended; and
Whereas,
in
accordance
with
applicable provisions of the Cable
Consumer Protection and Competition
Act
of
1992,
as
amended
(hereinafter the “Cable Act”) and
regulations adopted by the Federal
Communications Commission (the
“FCC”), the City is certified to regulate the basic cable service tier
rate and related equipment rental,
service and installation rates; and
Whereas, on or about November
26, 2003, pursuant to FCC regulations, the City received from Adelphia an Abbreviated Cost of Service
Filing for Cable Network Upgrades
on FCC Form 1235 (the “FCC Form
1235”) proposing a Maximum Permitted Network Upgrade Surcharge
of $0.47 per month, per subscriber,
to be assessed against basic service
tier subscribers (in addition to the
Basic Service Tier Rate) over the
next 12 years in order to recover the
cost, plus a rate of return, related
to the upgrade of the cable system
completed in the City in 2003; and
Whereas, in response to correspondence and discussions with the
City’s
representatives,
Adelphia
filed an amended FCC Form 1235
(the “Amended FCC Form 1235”) on
July 17, 2004; and
Whereas, on November 22, 2004,
City Council enacted Ordinance No.
2209-04 disapproving Adelphia’s proposed monthly Network Upgrade
Surcharge based upon a lack of
information to substantiate the requested Surcharge, but reserving the
right to reconsider the Ordinance for
the purpose of further reducing
rates should Adelphia submit additional information; and
Whereas, Adelphia has filed an
appeal with the FCC of the City’s
decision in Ordinance No. 2209-04; and
Whereas, Adelphia has now submitted sufficient information from
which the City can determine that a
Network Upgrade Surcharge of $0.39
per subscriber, per month is in accordance with FCC Regulations; and
Whereas, this Council has determined that it is in the best interest
of the City’s subscribers to resolve
the disputed issues related to Adelphia’s Amended FCC Form 1235 and
the Network Upgrade Surcharge; and
Whereas, Adelphia has agreed to
resolve the current disagreement
related to the Network Upgrade
Charge under the terms set forth in
Section 1 of this Ordinance and will
acknowledge its acceptance of the
terms of Section 1 below by execution of the “Acceptance” attached to,
and incorporated into, this Ordinance as File No. 2162-05-A
Whereas, this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department, now, therefore,

November 30, 2005
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That based on the additional
information
submitted
by
Adelphia, and the advice of the
City’s cable television legal consultants,
regarding
the
Network
Upgrade Surcharge, Council makes
the below listed findings and orders:
A. A Maximum Permitted Network
Upgrade Surcharge Rate of $0.39 per
subscriber, per month (which FCC
regulations permit to be added to
the maximum permitted basic service tier rate) is authorized under
FCC Regulations.
B. Although the FCC Form 1235
permits Adelphia to recover its
rebuild costs based on a twelve (12)year useful life, Adelphia shall limit
its recovery period to ten (10) years
which ten (10)-year period shall
start on July 17, 2004 (the date
Adelphia filed its Amended FCC
Form 1235) and shall end no later
than July 16, 2014 (the “Recovery
Period”).
C. Notwithstanding the Recovery
Period approved in subsection B of
this section, Adelphia or its successors and assigns shall not implement the Network Upgrade Surcharge prior to March 1, 2006.
D. In the event the Network
Upgrade Surcharge, or any portion
thereof, is ever charged to subscribers in the City, it will be separately itemized on subscriber billings
as a “Network Upgrade Surcharge”.
E. Adelphia shall not amend or refile its FCC Form 1235 or Amended
FCC Form 1235 that is the subject
of Ordinance No. 2209-04.
F. Upon the effective date of this
Ordinance, Adelphia shall immediately (but in no event later than
December 21, 2005) withdraw its
pending appeal to the FCC of the
City’s Rate Order, Ordinance No.
2209-04.
G. Within ten (10) days of the passage of this Ordinance, Adelphia
shall properly execute and return to
the Clerk of Council the “Acceptance” attached hereto as File No.
2162-05-A; otherwise, the authorization of the Network Upgrade Surcharge in subsection A above shall
be null and void.
Section 2. That it is found and
determined that all formal actions
of this Council concerning and relating to the adoption of this Ordinance were adopted in an open
meeting of this Council, and that all
deliberations of this Council and of
any of its committees or subcommittees that resulted in such formal
action, were in meetings open to the
public, in compliance with all legal
requirements
including
Section
121.22 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Section 3. That notice of the passage of this Ordinance shall be
given by publishing the title and
abstract of contents prepared by the
Director of Law once in a newspaper of general circulation in the
City of Cleveland and the Clerk is
hereby directed to serve a certified
copy of this Ordinance by certified
mail on Adelphia immediately upon
its passage.
Section 4. That this Ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and

approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
