August 10, 2005
public use located in the City of
Brecksville, between Oakes Road
and Metro Parks Boulevard to the
City of Brecksville.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 3 of Ordinance No. 651-05, passed April 25,
2005, is amended to read as follows:
Section 3. That the conveyance
shall be made by limited warranty
deed, or other appropriate deed, prepared by the Director of Law and
executed by the Mayor on behalf of
the City of Cleveland. The deed
shall contain necessary provisions,
including restrictive reversionary interests as may be specified by the
Board of Control or Director of Law,
which shall protect the parties as
their respective interests require
and shall specifically contain a provision against the erection of any
advertising signs or billboards except permitted identification signs.
The City of Cleveland shall retain
an easement in perpetuity for Cleveland’s existing utility lines and the
Division of Water’s tower site and
communications antenna. The conveyance shall include a deed restriction that the subject property shall
be used for municipal, municipally
related, and all other governmental
uses for a period of thirty years
from the date of closing, unless such
period is shortened by the City of
Cleveland.
That
the
conveyance
shall also include a provision authorizing a right of first refusal to the
City of Brecksville regarding any
remaining portion of Permanent
Parcel No. 603-10-004 located north of
Valley Parkway and within the
Brecksville city limits that is not
part of this original conveyance.
Specifically, if the City of Cleveland
receives a bona fide offer to purchase, and the City of Cleveland
wishes to accept the offer, the City
of Cleveland shall notify the City of
Brecksville in writing of the offer,
stating the relevant terms. The City
of Brecksville shall have 30 days
from receipt of such notice in which
to elect to purchase all, but not less
than all of the City of Cleveland’s
interest in the subject property on
the same terms and conditions of
the bona fide offer to purchase.
Upon passage of legislation authorizing the sale of the remaining portion of Permanent Parcel No. 603-10004 and approval by the Board of
Control, the City may sell any
remaining portion of Permanent
Parcel No. 603-10-004 at the same
terms as the offer received by the
City of Cleveland or other negotiated terms.
Section 2. That existing Section 3
of Ordinance No. 651-05, passed April
25, 2005, is repealed.
Section 3. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

allowed by law.

An emergency resolution compelling the Ohio General Assembly
to act on and pass House Bill 191
making it a fifth degree felony for
certain sexual offenders to reside
within 1,000 feet of school premises.

August 10, 2005
Whereas, the Ohio General Assembly enacted Chapter 2950 of the
Ohio Revised Code governing sex
offenders and requiring registration; and
Whereas, Ohio law currently prohibits sex offenders from living
within 1,000 feet of a school; and
Whereas, this Council is concerned about circumstances enabling sex offenders to reside near
schools; and
Whereas, such circumstances include the failure of Ohio’s sex
offender registration law to provide
a criminal penalty for any sex
offender illegally residing within
1,000 feet of a school; and
Whereas, current State law provides only for eviction lawsuits
against sex offenders illegally residing within 1,000 feet of a school; and
Whereas, the eviction process is
timely and costly and landlords are
reluctant to evict for fear of retaliation; and
Whereas, protecting young children from sex offenders is a paramount governmental interest; and
Whereas, enabling sex offenders
to reside near schools subjects children to risk; and
Whereas, recent studies indicate
that more than nine hundred fifty
(950) registered sex offenders living
within 1,000 feet of a school in violation of state law;
Whereas, House Bill 191, introduced by State Representative Tim
DeGeeter, would amend Ohio law to
make it a fifth degree felony for
certain sexual offenders to reside
within 1,000 feet of school premises;
and
Whereas, the Ohio House did not
act on similar legislation introduced
in 2004; and
Whereas, House Bill 191 is currently in the Criminal Justice Committee of the Ohio House; and
Whereas, passage of House Bill
191 provides yet another tool in the
on-going efforts to protect young
children from sexual predators; and
Whereas, failure to act on House
Bill 191 sends a clear signal to Ohio
citizens that the leadership of the
Ohio House of Representatives is
not
concerned
about
protecting
young children from sexual predators; and
Whereas, this Council encourages
the Ohio General Assembly to act on
and pass House Bill 191; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council compels the Ohio General Assembly to
act on and pass House Bill 191
making it a fifth degree felony for
certain sexual offenders to reside
within 1,000 feet of school premises.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
certified copy of this resolution to
Speaker of the Ohio House Jon
Husted, State Representative Bob
Latta, Chair of the House Criminal
Justice Committee, State Representative Tim DeGeeter, all other members of the State of Ohio House of

Johnson, Jones, Kelley, Lewis, Polensek, Reed, Pierce Scott, Sweeney,
Westbrook, White and Zone.
An emergency resolution supporting the renewal of the State Capital
Improvements Program for another
ten years.
Whereas, the State Capital Improvements Program was created in
1987 following the passage of State
Issue 2 which amended Section 2k,
Article VIII of the Ohio Constitution
to permit the State to use its general fund as a revenue stream to
support debt and issue up to $120
million in bonds each year to provide financial assistance to local
communities to improve their basic
infrastructure; and
Whereas, the legislature created
the Ohio Public Works Commission
to distribute the proceeds of the
bonds and established nineteen local
District Public Works Integrating
Committees to recommend projects
to the Ohio Public Works Commission for funding; and
Whereas, in 1995, Ohio voters approved an amendment to Section M,
Article VIII of the Ohio Constitution
to re-authorize the State Capital
Improvements Program for another
ten years; and

The City Record
Whereas, the State Capital Improvements Program has greatly
improved the local infrastructure
around the State by distributing
nearly $2.3 billion in financial assistance; and
Whereas, since its inception the
State Capital Improvements Program has provided more than $450
million to Cuyahoga County local
governments to improve more than
$800 million in local infrastructure;
and
Whereas, resolutions have been
introduced in the Ohio House of
Representative and the Ohio Senate
to extend the State Capital Improvements Program for another ten
years permitting bonding authority
for $120 million annually; and
Whereas, the State Capital Improvements Program is a critical
funding source for local communities by providing needed assistance
to repair and rehabilitate infrastructure, the physical framework
that supports and sustains economic activity, and provides needed jobs
in the construction related industries; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the City of Cleveland considers the improvement of
the State’s infrastructure to be a priority and supports the renewal of
the State Capital Improvements Program for another ten years and to
issue $120 million in bonds annually.

Council is instructed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to Governor

declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

An emergency resolution compelling the Ohio General Assembly
to act on and pass House Bill 191
making it a fifth degree felony for
certain sexual offenders to reside
within 1,000 feet of school premises.
Whereas, the Ohio General Assembly enacted Chapter 2950 of the
Ohio Revised Code governing sex
offenders and requiring registration; and
Whereas, Ohio law currently prohibits sex offenders from living
within 1,000 feet of a school; and
Whereas, this Council is concerned about circumstances enabling sex offenders to reside near
schools; and
Whereas, such circumstances include the failure of Ohio’s sex
offender registration law to provide
a criminal penalty for any sex
offender illegally residing within
1,000 feet of a school; and
Whereas, current State law provides only for eviction lawsuits
against sex offenders illegally residing within 1,000 feet of a school; and
Whereas, the eviction process is
timely and costly and landlords are
reluctant to evict for fear of retaliation; and
Whereas, protecting young children from sex offenders is a paramount governmental interest; and
Whereas, enabling sex offenders
to reside near schools subjects children to risk; and
Whereas, recent studies indicate
that more than nine hundred fifty
(950) registered sex offenders living
within 1,000 feet of a school in violation of state law;
Whereas, House Bill 191, introduced by State Representative Tim
DeGeeter, would amend Ohio law to
make it a fifth degree felony for
certain sexual offenders to reside
within 1,000 feet of school premises;
and
Whereas, the Ohio House did not
act on similar legislation introduced
in 2004; and
Whereas, House Bill 191 is currently in the Criminal Justice Committee of the Ohio House; and
Whereas, passage of House Bill
191 provides yet another tool in the
on-going efforts to protect young
children from sexual predators; and
Whereas, failure to act on House
Bill 191 sends a clear signal to Ohio
citizens that the leadership of the
Ohio House of Representatives is
not
concerned
about
protecting
young children from sexual predators; and
Whereas, this Council encourages
the Ohio General Assembly to act on
and pass House Bill 191; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
