1189-04,
passed June 14, 2004, relating to
unsafe structures and exterior property nuisances; violation and remedial notices, cost recovery.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 3103.09 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended by
Ordinance No. 1189-04, passed June
14, 2004 is amended to read as follows:
Section 3103.09 Unsafe Structures
and Exterior Property Nuisances;
Violation
and
Remedial
Notices;
Cost Recovery
(a) Legislative Findings
Council of the City of Cleveland
finds that:
(1) Structures that are vacant and
open to entry at doors, windows or
other points accessible to the general public:
A. Attract children to enter;
B. Become harborage for vermin;
C. Serve as temporary abode for
derelicts, vagrants and criminals;
and
D. Are likely to be damaged by
vandals or set ablaze by arsonists.
(2) Unkept grounds surrounding
vacant, open structures invite the
dumping of garbage and rubbish;
(3) Thousands of structures in
this City are made of wood-frame
construction
that
is
more
combustible than other building types;
(4) Thousands of structures in
this City are situated on narrow lots
and in close proximity to one another, increasing the risk of conflagration and spread of insect and rodent
infestation;
(5) Population loss and economic
decline experienced by the City in
recent years has caused the incidence of vacant, open structures,
high grass, weeds, junk, debris, and
junk motor vehicles to increase significantly;
(6) Vacant, open structures often
become dilapidated because they are
not repaired by the owners or persons in control of the structures;
(7) Structures that are vacant and
open to entry, high grass, weeds,
junk, debris, and junk motor vehicles depress the market value of
surrounding properties;
(8) The existence of certain hazardous conditions may require a
structure to be vacated; the conditions include but are not limited to:

101

13
A. Danger of structural collapse;
B. Inadequate heat or use of dangerous heating mechanism;
C. Danger of fire; and
D. Lack of plumbing in safe working order.
(9) Structures that remain boarded for an extended period of time
contribute to blight, cause a decrease
in
neighboring
property
values, create targets for arson, and
lead to the cancellation of homeowners’ insurance for neighboring
property owners;
(10) The following conditions provide
harborage
and
breeding
grounds for pests or otherwise create human-health problems:
A. Grass over 8 inches in height;
B. Noxious weeds including Russian, Canadian, or common thistle;
wild lettuce; wild mustard; wild
parsley; ragweed; milk weed; iron
weed; wild plants that can cause
skin reaction upon contact or produce or aggravate hay fever, asthma, allergic respiratory reaction, or
similar conditions; and all other noxious weeds;
C. Refuse including trash, junk,
garbage and food waste, offal, animal wastes, tires, and all other
waste materials;
D. Stagnant surface water.
(11) As used in this Chapter,
“junk motor vehicle” means a motor
vehicle that meets all of the following criteria:
A. Three model years old or older;
B. Apparently inoperable; and
C. Extensively damaged, including, but not limited to, any of the
following: missing wheels, tires,
engine, motor, or transmission. (R.C.
§505.173)
(b) Declaration of Nuisance
(1) All buildings or structures
that are injurious to or a menace to
the public health, safety or welfare,
or are structurally unsafe, unsanitary or not provided with adequate
safe egress, or which constitute a
fire hazard, or which are vacant and
open to public entry, or which are
otherwise dangerous to human life
or injurious to the public, or which
in relation to existing use constitute
a hazard to the public health, safety or welfare by reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence or abandonment, are, severally, for the purposes of this
Building Code, declared to be “unsafe structures’’. All unsafe structures or conditions are declared to
be public nuisances. The public nuisance shall be abated by correction
of the violations to the minimum
standards of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
applicable City rules and regulations, the Ohio Revised Code, and
Ohio Administrative Code including
the Ohio Building Code, or by demolition.
(2) The conditions listed in division (a)(10) of this section are declared to be nuisances that shall be
removed, destroyed, or abated from
any property on which they are
found.
(3)
Junk
motor
vehicles
as
defined in division (a)(11) of this
section are declared to be nuisances
that shall be removed or abated
from any property on which they
are found. Junk motor vehicles are
declared to be a nuisance because:

14
A. They harbor rodents, vermin,
and other pests;
B. They contain toxic substances
and flammable liquids and fumes;
C. They attract children to enter;
D. They serve as temporary abode
for derelicts, vagrants and criminals;
E. They diminish neighboring
property values; and,
F. They are likely to be damaged
by vandals or set ablaze by arsonists.
(c) Effective Boarding Pending
Rehabilitation
(1) Permits
Pending the correction of the violations to the minimum standards of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, applicable City
rules and regulations, the Ohio
Revised Code, and the Ohio Administrative Code, including the Ohio
Building Code, the owner of a structure
may
secure
the
structure
through effective boarding. In order
to effectively board the structure,
the owner of the structure shall
apply, within 3 days of receiving a
notice of violation, to the Department of Building and Housing for a
permit to board. The Department of
Building and Housing shall review
the condition of the structure, determine if it can be effectively boarded, and grant or deny the owner’s
permit to board, setting forth special
requirements, if any, necessary for
compliance with minimum standards
for effective boarding. The owner
shall effectively board the structure
within 3 days of the issuance of a
boarding permit, or within such
other time limit that the Director
deems appropriate. Structures that
are boarded without first obtaining
a boarding permit shall continue to
be considered public nuisances subject to demolition. Within thirty (30)
days of the issuance of a permit to
board, the owner of the structure
shall apply for a rehabilitation permit pursuant to Section 3105.06 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976. The Director may
grant an extension of time for
acquiring a rehabilitation permit
upon the owner’s written request
and for good cause shown. Failure
of the owner to obtain a rehabilitation permit before effective boarding will result in the structure being
deemed
a
public
nuisance,
and
scheduled for demolition.
(2) Materials
The effective boarding of a structure shall include, but not be limited to, doors, windows, or other areas
of the structure open to ingress and
egress and to weather elements at
any and all levels of the structure.
The openings shall be secured by
plywood, not less than 1/2” thick, or
other material of equal strength, cut
and fit into the openings. Openings
in excess of forty-eight inches wide
shall be framed with 2” x 4” lumber
and plywood, or equivalent material
fastened twenty-four inches on center onto frame. The plywood or
equivalent material shall be fastened into the openings by screw
type nails or lag screws.
(3) Maintenance
After
effectively
boarding
the
structure, the owner shall monitor
and maintain the structure and its
surrounding premises in a safe, san-

The City Record
itary and secured condition. Any
portion of the exterior structure
which is deemed to be potentially
hazardous due to deteriorated conditions,
or
to
be
structurally
unsound shall be removed or treated in a manner that eliminates the
hazard. The exterior premises shall
be maintained free of high weeds,
debris, junk vehicles, and conditions
that may provide harborage for
rodents. Failure of the owner to
properly maintain the building in
the above condition, will result in
the structure being deemed a public
nuisance, and scheduled for demolition.
(4) Rehabilitation
Rehabilitation of the structure
shall commence within 30 days of
receiving a rehabilitation permit
pursuant to Section 3105.06 of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976 unless the time period is
extended with permission from the
Director. If rehabilitation of the
effectively boarded structure does
not begin within this time period, or
if the rehabilitation permit is otherwise invalidated or revoked, then
the Director may declare that the
nuisance has not been abated and
schedule the structure for demolition.
(d) Examination and Condemnation
(1) The Director is authorized to
examine or cause to be examined
every building or other structure
reported to be unsafe or damaged or
injurious to or a menace to the public, and shall make a written record
of the examination.
(2) The Director may designate as
a public nuisance those particular
structures or conditions found to be
unsafe under division (b) of this
section.
(3) The Director may also declare
that a nuisance structure which, due
to its advanced state of dilapidation,
substantial fire damage or structural infirmity, is an immediate hazard
to human life or health, may only
be abated by immediate repair and
rehabilitation to the minimum standards of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, applicable
City rules and regulations, the Ohio
Revised Code, and Ohio Administrative Code including the Ohio Building Code, or by demolition.
(4) Whenever the Director finds a
vacant structure open to entry at
doors, windows or other points
accessible to the general public, he
may cause the structure to be
secured at those points of entry. The
Director shall be authorized at any
time to enter the premises to secure
the structure in order to lessen the
severity of the public nuisance. In
securing the structure, the Director
may call upon any department, division or bureau of the City for whatever assistance may be necessary, or
may, by private contract, secure the
structure. Securing shall not be
deemed
to
constitute
“effective
boarding’’ under division (b) of this
section, and it does not abate the
nuisance condition of an unsafe
structure, as declared under division
(d)(2) of this section, unless so
declared in writing by the Director.
An additional notice, issued under
division (e)(1) below, shall include
the fact that the Director has found

102

February 2, 2005
it necessary to take appropriate
action to secure the structure.
(e) Notice of Violation; Participation in the Pre-Prosecution Program
(1) Whenever the Director finds a
building, structure or portion thereof to be unsafe and determines it or
the property on which it is located
to be a public nuisance as defined
in this Chapter, he shall forward by
certified mail to the owner, agent or
person in control of the building,
structure or portion thereof and to
any mortgagee of record a written
notice
of
violation
stating
the
defects thereof. A notice of violation
shall require the owner within a
stated time to abate the nuisance
condition of the structure by correction of the violations and defects to
the minimum standards of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio,
1976, applicable City rules and regulations, the Ohio Revised Code, and
Ohio Administrative Code including
the Ohio Building Code; or by demolition and removal of the building,
structure, or portion thereof. The
notice also shall state that if the
nuisance is not abated within the
required time, or if participation in
the pre-prosecution program has not
been approved, that the Director
may take appropriate action to
repair, remove, or otherwise abate
the public nuisance and that the
owner, agent or person in control
shall be responsible for the costs.
The of the violation notice to the
owner, agent or person in control of
the building, structure or portion
thereof is legal and valid service
and no other form of service is necessary (actual notice).
(2) The owner, agent or person in
control of the building, structure or
portion thereof may be referred by
the Director of Building and Housing for participation in the Building
and Housing pre-prosecution program for those violations listed in
the violation notice. Persons who

and Schedule of Repairs. Those persons who do not complete the program as outlined above will be
removed from the program and may
be subject to prosecution in the
Cleveland Housing Court.
(3) Each owner, agent, or person
in control of the building, structure
or portion thereof who is referred to

A. $25.00 for a single-family home;
B. $50.00 for a 2 family home;
C. $100.00 for a 3-5 unit dwelling;
D. $200.00 for any residential
building of 6 or more units; and
E. $200.00 for any bui lding that
has a commercial use and also may
have residential units above or within it.
(4) If a participant in the preprosecution program fails to comply
with the requirements of the program,
the
participant
will
be
removed from the program and the
protections under the pre-prosecution program will be revoked. Those
applicants
will
receive
written
notice from the Director of Building
and Housing stating the reason or
reasons for their removal and revo-

February 2, 2005
cation from the program. The participant shall have no appeal rights
regarding removal from the program. Any unabated violations may
become the subject of prosecution in
the Cleveland Housing Court. The
City may pursue any other legal
remedies for nuisance abatement
afforded under this section.
(5) If the person to whom the
notice and order is addressed is not
found after a reasonable and diligent search, then the notice and
order shall be sent by certified mail
to his tax mailing address, if available, as indicated on the County tax
duplicate, and a copy of the notice
shall be posted in a conspicuous
place on the premises to which it
relates. Such mailing and posting
shall be deemed legal service of the
notice.
(6) An owner, agent or person in
control of the structure or building,
a mortgagee of record, or a lien
holder of record who has received a
notice of violation or a notice to
make corrections to the minimum
standards of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
applicable City rules and regulations, the Ohio Revised Code, and
Ohio Administrative Code including
the Ohio Building Code, or to demolish and remove, as provided for in
this section, shall inform prospective purchasers, vendees, grantees,
assignees, lessees, or land contractees thereof of the notice of violation or the notice to make corrections, or to demolish and remove. No
person shall transfer to a vendee,
grantee, assignee, lessee, land contractee or any other transferee any
interest in a building, structure or
portion thereof after receiving a
notice of violation to make corrections, or to demolish and remove the
same, without first providing the
transferee with a copy of the notice.
(7) A. No person, agent, firm or
corporation shall sell, by land contract or otherwise, any interest in
any structure or building without
furnishing the buyer, prior to the
sale a copy of any outstanding
notice or order from the City, including any notice of violation or any
outstanding notice to make corrections to the minimum standards of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio 1976, applicable City rules
and regulations, the Ohio Revised
Code including the Ohio Building
Code, or any outstanding notice to
demolish and remove.

interest in any structure or building
without obtaining from the seller,
prior
to
sale,
the
documents
described above.
B. No person, agent, firm or corporation acting in the capacity of an
escrow agent in any real estate

have been met.
C. Any buyer or grantee, by land
contract or otherwise, of a structure
or building, shall begin at the date

notice or order obtained or to be
obtained pursuant to this division
and, within ten days of the date of

inspected, and approved by the
Director. The Director may cause to
be posted at each entrance to the
building or structure a notice as follows: “THIS STRUCTURE IS IN A
DANGEROUS CONDITION AND HAS
BEEN CONDEMNED AND ITS USE
HAS BEEN PROHIBITED BY THE
DIRECTOR
OF
BUILDING
AND
HOUSING.’’ The notice shall remain
posted until the required corrections
are made or demolition is completed. No person shall remove the
notice without written permission of
the Director, nor shall any person
use or enter the building or structure except for the purpose of making the required corrections or
demolishing or effectively boarding
the building or structure, or securing the structure under division
(d)(4) of this section.
(g) Right to Appeal
The owner, agent or person in control shall have a right to appeal
from the notice and decision of the
Director as provided in this section
and appear before the Board of
Building Standards and Building
Appeals at a specified time and
place to show cause why he should
not comply with the notice. Any
notice served by the Director shall
automatically become a final order
if a written notice of appeal before
the Board is not filed in the office
of the Board within the time set
forth in the notice from the Director. In the absence of an appeal, all
actions taken shall constitute a
valid exercise of the police powers
of the City of Cleveland.
(h) Noncompliance with Notice
(1) Director Authorized To Demolish, Remove, or Abate. In case the
owner, agent or person in control
fails, neglects or refuses to comply
with the notice to repair or rehabilitate, or defaults on the requirements of participation in the preprosecution program, or to demolish
and remove a public nuisance or
unsafe building, structure or portion
thereof,

appropriate
action in the court to cause correction of the violations and defects, or
demolition and removal, or effective
boarding of the building or structure pending rehabilitation.

Bar To Director’s Action To Abate.
The securing of rehabilitation permits for the building or structure
shall not in and of itself bar the
Director from taking action to abate
the nuisance.

103

15
(4) Effective Boarding by Director. The Director may, with respect
to any condemned structure, also
take appropriate action to effectively board such structure, or to secure
it pursuant to division (d)(4) of this
section. The Director shall specifically state in writing his findings
with respect to the structure, and
shall determine whether to secure or
to effectively board, based upon factors which may include the following: the distance of the structure
from neighboring structures, the
type of structure, the extent to
which the structure is secured, the
likelihood of vandalism or arson, the
extent of the deterioration, the economic likelihood of eventual rehabilitation of the structure, or cost of
securing or effectively boarding the
structure.
(5)
Failure
To
Comply
with
Notice. In case the owner, agent or
person in control fails, neglects or
refuses to comply with the notice to
repair or rehabilitate, or to demolish
and remove a public nuisance or
unsafe building, structure or portion
thereof, or to remove or abate any
other condition that is defined as a
nuisance under this Chapter, the
Director
may
take
appropriate
action to take repair or maintenance
measures or to otherwise abate the
public nuisance. The Director shall
specifically state in writing the
findings with respect to the structure, and shall determine whether to
perform repair or maintenance upon
factors which may include the following: the distance of the structure
from neighboring structures, the
type of structure, the extent of deterioration, the likelihood of vandalism or arson, the economic likelihood of eventual complete rehabilitation of the structure, the cost of
repair or maintenance.
(6) Notice of Intent To Demolish.
Except as provided in division (i) of
this section, the Director shall give
written notice informing the owner,
agent, or person in control, mortgagee of record and lien holders of
record of the City’s intention to
demolish and remove the unsafe
building or structure at least 30
days prior to the intended action by
the City. The notice may be effective concurrently with the violation
notice. A condemned structure, once
effectively boarded by the owner
pending rehabilitation that later
becomes open to entry, may then be
demolished and removed, subject to
the Director giving written notice as
stated in divisions (e)(1) and (h) of
this section, upon a finding by the
Director that the structure can no
longer be effectively boarded.
(i) Junk Motor Vehicle Removal
(1) Notice. The Director shall send
written notice, by certified mail
with return receipt requested, to the
person having the right of possession of the property on which a junk
motor vehicle, as defined in this
Chapter, is left. This notice shall
notify the person having right of
possession of the property that within ten days of mailing of the notice,
the junk motor vehicle either shall
be covered by being housed in a
garage or other suitable structure or
removed from the property. The
notice shall also be posted in a conspicuous place on the property.

and order the removal of a junk
motor vehicle when the junk motor
vehicle has not been either covered
by being housed in a garage or

of the date of mailing and posting
of the notice as set forth above.
(j) Cases of Emergency
In cases of emergency that, in the
opinion of the Director, involve
immediate danger to human life or
health, the Director shall promptly
cause the building, structure or portion thereof to be made safe or
removed. For this purpose he may
at once enter the structure or land
on which it stands, or any abutting
land or structure, with such assistance and at a cost as he deems necessary. He may request the Director
of Public Safety to enforce the
orders he gives that are necessary
to cause the building, structure or
portion thereof to be made safe or
removed. The Director of Public
Safety has the authority to enforce
the orders. He may order adjacent
structures and premises to be vacated, and protect the public by an
appropriate fence or other means as
may be necessary, and for this purpose may close a public or private
way.
(k) Costs
(1) Any and all expenses or costs
incurred under this section for the
removal, repair, alteration, securing
or boarding of a building or structure or for abating any other nuisance shall be paid by the owner of
the building or structure, except
when expenses or costs are incurred
with respect to a government or
school building owned by a governmental entity or political subdivision and are funded by federal
money.
(2) Whenever an inspection is
made after the compliance date stated on a Notice of Violation of the
Building Code, the Housing Code, or
the Zoning Code or after a compliance date determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to determine
whether the violation has been

remedied and the violation has not
been remedied, or an additional permit is obtained for work previously
permitted and the original permit
has expired or was appropriately
voided, a fee of $100.00 shall be
charged for each such inspection,
except that this fee shall not apply
to one-family and two-family owneroccupied dwelling structures.
(3) If the owner fails to pay for
the costs of removal, repair, alteration, securing or boarding or of
inspections of violations that have
not been remedied within 30 days
from the date the Director of Building and Housing sends a statement
of the charges and costs incurred
therein, the Director may certify the
amount to the Commissioner of
Assessments and Licenses. The Commissioner
of
Assessments
and
Licenses shall make written return
to the County Auditor of the action
under this section with a statement
of the charges for services, the
amount paid for the performing of
the labor and a proper description
of the premises. Certification to the
County Auditor is for the purpose of
making expenses and costs a lien
upon the lands, to be collected as
other taxes and returned to the City
with the General Fund, with special
accounting thereof in accordance
with Ohio R.C. 715.261.
(4) Notwithstanding the method of
collection set forth in this division,
the Director of Law may take any
action necessary to collect the costs
of demolition, boarding, or other nuisance abatement from the owner or
other responsible party.

By Council Members White, Lewis,
Reed,
Conwell,
Polensek,
Britt,
Zone, Brady and Westbrook.
An emergency resolution opposing
the privatization of Social Security
and the establishment of personal
social security accounts.
Whereas, Social Security provides
a critical foundation of income for
retried and disabled workers; and
Whereas, for approximately onethird of Americans over the age of
sixty-five, Social Security benefits
constitute ninety percent (90%) of
their total income; and
Whereas, Social Security has been
effective in reducing poverty among
the elderly, protecting relatives of
deceased workers and the disabled,
and providing a reliable source
income; and
Whereas, President Bush is proposing the establishment of personal social security accounts; and
Whereas, recent analyses show
that the establishment of personal
social security accounts while continuing to provide Social Security
benefits
to
current
beneficiaries
would require a combination of federal borrowing, tax increases, and
benefit cuts amounting to between
two trillion dollars and three trillion
dollars; and

February 2, 2005
Whereas, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported
“to raise the rate of return for
future generations by moving to a
funded system, some generations
must receive rates of return even
lower than they would have gotten
under the pay-as-you-go system”; and
Whereas, the establishment of personal
social
security
accounts
require that young Americans pay
for Social Security benefits of older
Americans and pay for the transition to private accounts at the same
time; and
Whereas, the establishment of personal social security accounts also
creates new risks for young Americans who would confront the ups
and downs of the stock market,
future inflation, and administrative
costs; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes the privatization of Social Security and the establishment of personal social security accounts.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
certified copy of this resolution to
President George W. Bush, U.S. Senator Michael DeWine, U.S. Senator
George Voinovich, Congresswoman
Stephanie Tubbs Jones, Congressman Dennis Kucinich, Congressman
Sherrod Brown, and Congressman
Steven LaTourette.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it

to a New C2 Liquor Permit at 4060
Lee Road.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Department of Liquor
Control of an application for a New
C2 Liquor Permit at Ossie, Inc., DBA
Lee Harvard Shell, 4060 Lee Road,
Cleveland, Ohio 44128, Permanent
Number 65916750010; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to
Section 4303.26 of the Ohio Revised
Code. Council’s objection to said
permit must be received by the
Director of Liquor Control within
30 days of notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby record its objection to a New C2

By Council Members Polensek,
Westbrook, White, Sweeney, Brady,
Zone, Reed and Cintron.
An emergency resolution strongly
opposing the parking fees proposed
by the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources and encouraging the Ohio
General Assembly to adequately
fund the Ohio Department of Natural Resources.
Whereas, the Ohio Department of
Natural Resources is seeking approval to charge a parking fee at
the 74 State Parks in Ohio; and
Whereas, the proposed parking
fee is $5.00 for Ohio residents, $4.00
for seniors with a Golden Buckeye
Card, and $6.00 for nonresidents; and
Whereas, the parking fee proposal also includes an annual pass
option for $25.00; and
Whereas, the proposed parking
fee may discourage the public from
enjoying parks; and
Whereas, the parking fee proposal does not indicate that fees will
be used to provide enhanced service,
improved maintenance, and public
improvements to Ohio’s State Parks;
and
Whereas, funds necessary to maintain and operate State Parks should
be allocated from state tax dollars
and
taxpayers
should
not
be
required to pay an additional fee to
utilize public parks; and
Whereas, approval of the parking
fee proposal will encourage users of
State Parks to park on streets bordering State Parks and, thereby,
result in increased traffic, noise,
and disruption to citizens residing
near State Parks; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council is
strongly opposed to the parking fees
proposed by the Ohio Department of
Natural Resources and encourages
the Ohio General Assembly to adequately fund the Ohio Department of
Natural Resources.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
certified copy of this resolution to
Ohio Governor Bob Taft, the Director of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, the President of the
Ohio Senate, the Speaker of the Ohio
House, the Northeast Ohio delegation to the Ohio General Assembly,
and the Ohio Municipal League.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and provided it receives the

the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

Jones, Lewis, O’Malley, Pierce Scott,

An emergency resolution supporting maintenance of the Local Government Fund, Local Government
Revenue
Assistance
Fund
and
Library and Local Government Support Funds at current levels and
encouraging the Ohio Legislature to
once again establish a predicable,
statutory formula for distribution of
such funds.
Whereas, for seven decades there
has been a strong tie between state
and local government funds provided by the state to local governments
and libraries, namely, the Local Government Fund, Local Government
Revenue
Assistance
Fund
and
Library and Local Government Support Funds (“LGF”); and
Whereas, the future of that critical partnership has been severely
threatened during the last two state
budgets; and
Whereas, in Ohio 939 cities and
villages depend on the LGF as vital
sources of revenues that, among
other things, keep hundreds of
police officers and firefighters on
duty and provide critical safety services to millions of Ohioans; and
Whereas,
these
funds
support
other important municipal services,
from health and sanitation to parks
and recreation and, without these
funds, many of these services could
not be provided through locally generated revenues; and
Whereas, because LGF is distributed on the basis of need, any further erosion into these funds will hit
hardest the communities adversely
affected by recent economic bad
times and may plunge these same
communities into fiscal emergency;
and
Whereas, all three LGF’s were on
a statutory formula that goes up
and down with the rise and fall of
state revenue and the last two state
budgets removed the established formula and subjected the funds to
cuts and freezes, resulting in local
governments and libraries suffering
a loss in state aid of $673 million
over a four-year period; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the maintenance of the LGF’s
at current levels as these funds are
used to provide vital services to citizens.
Section
2.
That
this
Council
encourages the Ohio Legislature to
once again establish a predictable,
statutory formula for distribution of
LGF funds.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
certified copy of this resolution to
Ohio Governor Bob Taft, the President of the Ohio Senate, the Speaker of the Ohio House, the Northeast
Ohio delegation to the Ohio General
Assembly, and the Ohio Municipal
League.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and provided it receives the
