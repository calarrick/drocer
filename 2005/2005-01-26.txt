Ord. No. 75-05.
By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting
new Section 347.17 thereof, relating
to large scale retail stores.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
hereby supplemented by enacting
new Section 347.17 thereof, to read
as follows:
Section 347.17
Large-Scale Retail
Stores
(a) Purpose. Council recognizes
that development of large-scale retail stores often increases traffic
volumes, strains the existing street
network, and discourages pedestrian
travel. In addition, such large-scale
retail stores often adversely affect
the viability of small-scale, pedestrian-friendly neighborhood commercial areas and the health of smaller
retail businesses including grocery
stores and supermarkets. Given this,
Council seeks to limit the negative
impacts that large-scale retail stores
have on traffic circulation, land use
patterns and the economic and
social health of neighborhood commercial areas by limiting the percentage of total sales floor area that
a large-scale retail store may devote
to the sale of non-taxable merchandise.
(b) Definitions.
(1)
“Large-scale
retail
store”
means a single retail business with
a gross floor area of 90,000 square
feet or larger, including wholesale
clubs and other business establishments that charge membership dues
or otherwise restrict merchandise
sales to fee-paying customers.
(2)
“Non-taxable
merchandise”
means
products,
commodities
or
items not subject to Ohio state sales
tax. Pharmacy medications requiring a doctor’s prescription shall not
be counted as a non-taxable item.
(3) “Sales floor area” means interior building space devoted to the
sale of merchandise, but excludes
office space, pharmacy areas not
open to the public, storage space,
automobile service centers, open-air
garden centers and restrooms.
(c) Non-taxable merchandise limitation. No large-scale retail store
shall devote more than 5% of its
total sales floor area to the sale of
non-taxable merchandise.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

By Council Member Reed.
An emergency ordinance to amend
Section 628.02 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as
enacted by Ordinance No. 2661-91,
passed November 18, 1991, relating
to possession or sale of assault
weapons.
Whereas, the State of California
recently banned the .50 caliber rifle;
and
Whereas, the .50 caliber rifle is a
combat weapon; and
Whereas, according to a Senate
report, a bullet from the .50 caliber
rifle,
even
at
1.5
miles
ways,
destroys a target with more energy
than a bullet fired at point-blank
range from Dirty Harry’s famous .44
Magnum; and
Whereas, the standard .50 caliber
bullet is four times heavier than the
.30 caliber bullet and ten times
heaver than the M16 bullet; and
Whereas, 60 Minutes recently produced and aired a segment on the
power of the .50 caliber rifle and the
dangers associated with the availability of the rifle; and
Whereas, such dangers include
the possibility that the .50 caliber
rifle could be used in a terrorist
attack; and
Whereas, one such specific danger
is the use of the .50 caliber rifle to
impair a commercial airline during
takeoff or landing; and
Whereas, this Council is concerned about the use of the .50 caliber rifle in non-combat zones and
the potential for use in a terrorist
attack; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 628.02 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as enacted by Ordinance No. 2661-91, passed November

Cleveland, Ohio 44128, Permanent
Number 65916750010; and
Whereas, the granting of this

10
Whereas, the place for which the

Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department

and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to

An emergency resolution strongly
opposing the parking fees proposed
by the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources and encouraging the Ohio
General Assembly to adequately
fund the Ohio Department of Natural Resources.
Whereas, the Ohio Department of
Natural Resources is seeking approval to charge a parking fee at
the 74 State Parks in Ohio; and

The City Record
Whereas, the proposed parking
fee is $5.00 for Ohio residents, $4.00
for seniors with a Golden Buckeye
Card, and $6.00 for nonresidents; and
Whereas, the parking fee proposal also includes an annual pass
option for $25.00; and
Whereas, the proposed parking
fee may discourage the public from
enjoying parks; and
Whereas, the parking fee proposal does not indicate that fees will
be used to provide enhanced service,
improved maintenance, and public
improvements to Ohio’s State Parks;
and
Whereas, funds necessary to maintain and operate State Parks should
be allocated from state tax dollars
and
taxpayers
should
not
be
required to pay an additional fee to
utilize public parks; and
Whereas, approval of the parking
fee proposal will encourage users of
State Parks to park on streets bordering State Parks and, thereby,
result in increased traffic, noise,
and disruption to citizens residing
near State Parks; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council is
strongly opposed to the parking fees
proposed by the Ohio Department of
Natural Resources and encourages
the Ohio General Assembly to adequately fund the Ohio Department of
Natural Resources.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a

An emergency resolution supporting maintenance of the Local Government Fund, Local Government
Revenue
Assistance
Fund
and
Library and Local Government Support Funds at current levels and
encouraging the Ohio Legislature to
once again establish a predicable,
statutory formula for distribution of
such funds.

66

January 26, 2005
Whereas, for seven decades there
has been a strong tie between state
and local government funds provided by the state to local governments
and libraries, namely, the Local Government Fund, Local Government
Revenue
Assistance
Fund
and
Library and Local Government Support Funds (“LGF”); and
Whereas, the future of that critical partnership has been severely
threatened during the last two state
budgets; and
Whereas, in Ohio 939 cities and
villages depend on the LGF as vital
sources of revenues that, among
other things, keep hundreds of
police officers and firefighters on
duty and provide critical safety services to millions of Ohioans; and
Whereas,
these
funds
support
other important municipal services,
from health and sanitation to parks
and recreation and, without these
funds, many of these services could
not be provided through locally generated revenues; and
Whereas, because LGF is distributed on the basis of need, any further erosion into these funds will hit
hardest the communities adversely
affected by recent economic bad
times and may plunge these same
communities into fiscal emergency;
and
Whereas, all three LGF’s were on
a statutory formula that goes up
and down with the rise and fall of
state revenue and the last two state
budgets removed the established formula and subjected the funds to
cuts and freezes, resulting in local
governments and libraries suffering
a loss in state aid of $673 million
over a four-year period; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the maintenance of the LGF’s
at current levels as these funds are
used to provide vital services to citizens.
Section
2.
That
this
Council
encourages the Ohio Legislature to
once again establish a predictable,
statutory formula for distribution of
LGF funds.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
certified copy of this resolution to
Ohio Governor Bob Taft, the President of the Ohio Senate, the Speaker of the Ohio House, the Northeast
Ohio delegation to the Ohio General
Assembly, and the Ohio Municipal
League.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force

allowed by law.
