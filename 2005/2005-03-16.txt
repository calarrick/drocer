An emergency resolution objecting to the new authority of the Ohio
Department of Natural Resources to
charge parking fees at Ohio’s state
parks and urging the Mayor to
review the City’s lease with the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources to determine if such charge
violates the terms of the lease.
Whereas, the Ohio Department of
Natural Resources (ODNR) has received
approval
from
the
Taft
administration to charge a parking
fee at all state parks in Ohio; and
Whereas, beginning this spring,
the fee to park at any of the state’s
74 state parks is $5.00 a visit, or $25
a year for Ohioans; and
Whereas, the City’s five lakefront
parks, Edgewater Park, East 55th

The City Record
Street Marina, Gordon Park, Euclid
Beach, and Villa Angela/Wildwood,
would all charge this fee; and
Whereas, this would have a negative impact on the ability of City
residents to use the state parks
located in the City; and
Whereas, in order to avoid paying
such a fee, parkgoers will simply
park their vehicles on the streets
and on private property in the vicinity of the state parks, which will
result in increased traffic, trespassing, noise, and disruption to citizens
residing near the state parks; and
Whereas, the lease that the City
of Cleveland has with ODNR may
prohibit charging a fee to park in
our lakefront state parks; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council objects to the new authority of the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources to charge parking fees at

Res. No. 384-05.
By Council Member Coats.
An emergency resolution encouraging the Ohio General Assembly to
enact legislation increasing the distance prohibition governing the residence of sex offenders and schools
to a distance that, at a minimum, is
greater than the distance children
walk to and from school and, in the
alternative,
to
enact
legislation
increasing the distance prohibition
governing the residence of sex
offenders and schools to 2,000 feet.
Whereas, the Ohio General Assembly enacted Chapter 2950 of the Ohio
Revised Code governing sex offenders and requiring registration; and

397

31
Whereas, in enacting Chapter 2950
of the Ohio Revised Code, the Ohio
General Assembly determined and
declared several legislative findings; and
Whereas, one such finding determined and declared “sex offenders
and offenders who commit child-victim offenses pose a risk of engaging in further sexually abusive
behavior and protection of members
of the public from sex offenders and
offenders who commit child-victim
oriented offenses is a paramount
governmental interest”; and
Whereas, Ohio law currently prohibits sex offenders from living
within 1,000 feet of a school; and
Whereas, this 1,000 feet restriction
does not adequately protect young
children
walking
to
and
from
school; and
Whereas, this Council is concerned about circumstances enabling sex offenders convicted of raping young children to reside near
schools; and
Whereas, the documentation contained in File No. 384-05-A, documents fourteen (14) registered sex
offenders who live at an address
within 1,840 feet of an elementary
school; and
Whereas, four (4) of these sex
offenders were convicted of raping
victims five (5) years of age and
four (4) of these sex offenders were
convicted of raping victims nine (9)
years of age or younger; and
Whereas, protecting young children from sex offenders is a paramount governmental interest; and
Whereas, enabling sex offenders
to reside near schools subjects children to risk; and
Whereas, this Council encourages
the Ohio General Assembly to increase the current 1,000 feet restriction; and
Whereas, such increase should be,
at a minimum, greater than the distance young children walk to and
from school; and
Whereas, in the event, the Ohio
General Assembly chooses not to or
is unable to increase the prohibition
to the distance children walk to and
from school, this Council encourages
the
Ohio
General
Assembly
to
increase the prohibition to 2,000 feet;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council encourages the Ohio General Assembly to
enact legislation increasing the distance prohibition governing the residence of sex offenders and schools to
a distance that, at a minimum, is
greater than the distance children
walk to and from school.
Section 2. That this Council encourages the Ohio General Assembly,
in the alternative, to enact legislation
increasing the distance prohibition
governing the residence of sex offenders and schools to 2,000 feet.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
certified copy of this resolution and
the legislative file to those members
