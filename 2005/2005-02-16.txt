term may be taken if desired by the
Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies until provision is made for the
requirements for the entire term.

purposes of this ordinance, a financial advantage shall be determined
by the Director of Finance by comparing the bids received for both
terms.
Section 2. That the costs of the
contract
or

charged against the proper appropriation accounts and the Director
of Finance shall certify the amount

B1Two-Family District on the northwest corner of Union Avenue and
East 118th Street at 11723-25 Union

but allows it first in Section 343.01 for a Local Retail Business District; and Section 349.04(f)

The City Record

February 16, 2005

requires nine parking spaces for the
combined use, with compliance to
Sections 337.18(a)(b) that the parking area be properly graded and
hard surfaced for drainage with
installation of wheel bumpers in the

to Section 352.11, no transition landscaping strip is provided, where an
8' wide strip with 75% year-round
opacity is required to separate the

in the required 10' building line setback from the side street line on the
rear third of the corner lot in a
Local Retail District; and on the
rear of a corner lot in any use district where the rear lot line of the
corner lot is also the side line of the
butt lot in the rear, no parking
space shall be constructed nearer to
the side street at the rear line of the
corner lot than the building line of
the butt lot (20'), provided that for
each foot the building on the corner

Res. No. 186-05.
By Council Members Conwell and
Reed.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio legislature to reintroduce
and pass a mental health parity bill.
Whereas, Ohio is one of 16 states
that have yet to pass some form of
parity law requiring private insurance to cover mental illnesses at the
same level as other illnesses; and
Whereas, health insurance plans
discriminate
against
millions
of
Americans with mental disorders by
providing only limited coverage for
mental health problems; and
Whereas, a mental health parity
bill would prohibit discrimination in
the coverage provided for the diagnosis, care and treatment of biologically based mental illnesses in sickness and accident insurance policies
and in private and public employer
self-insurance plans; and
Whereas, a 2001 analysis concluded that full parity of health insurance premiums would result in an
average increase of only 1% to 1.5%;
and
Whereas, such minimal insurance
increases
would
be
offset
by
increased productivity of workers,
overall reduction of medical costs,
reduction in crime and homelessness, and a subsequent increase in
the number of contributing taxpayers with private insurance; and
Whereas, this Council supports
the efforts of the Mental Health
Advocacy Coalition and the Legisla-

February 16, 2005
tive Advocacy Committee for People
with Disabilities which are lobbying
the Ohio legislature to reintroduce a
mental health insurance parity bill;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the Ohio legislature to
reintroduce
and
pass
a
mental
health parity bill.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Governor
Bob Taft and those members of the
State of Ohio Legislature representing residents of the City of Cleveland.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted February 7, 2005.
Effective February 10, 2005.

Res. No. 187-05.
By
Council
Members
Gordon,
Coats and Pierce Scott.
An emergency resolution strongly
opposing the plan of President
George W. Bush to reduce Community Development Block Grant funding.
Whereas,
Community
Development Block Grant (“CDBG”) funds
provide multipurpose development
grants to state and local governments; and
Whereas, CDBG funds are used in
a variety of ways from job creation
and retention to housing rehabilitation as long as seventy percent
(70%) of the funds received are
used to benefit low income and moderate income persons; and
Whereas, discussions between the
White House Office of Management
and Budget and the Department of
Housing and Urban Development
suggest that CDBG funding could be
cut by as much as fifty percent
(50%); and
Whereas, reduction of CDBG funding will have a devastating effect
on the City of Cleveland and other
cities; and
Whereas, in these challenging economic times, it is important to continue programs that benefit low and
moderate income persons and communities; and
Whereas, in these challenging economic times, it is also important to
provide adequate funding of programs that increase economic development opportunities; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

The City Record
Section
1.
That
this
Council
strongly opposes the plan of President George W. Bush to reduce Community Development Block Grant
funding.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to transmit
copies of this resolution to President
George
W.
Bush,
U.S.
Senator
Michael
DeWine,
U.S.
Senator
George
Voinovich,
Congressman
Dennis Kucinich, Congresswoman
Stephanie Tubbs Jones, Congressman Steven LaTourette, Congressman Sherrod Brown, the Board Members of the National League of
Cities, the Board Members of the
National Black Caucus of Local
Elected Officials (NBC-LEO), and
the Director of the Ohio Municipal
League.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted February 7, 2005.
Effective February 10, 2005.

Res. No. 188-05.
By Council Member Brady.

1320-04 adopted by the Council on
July 14, 2004; and
Whereas, this Council wishes to

Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
