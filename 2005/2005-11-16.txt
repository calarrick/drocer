paid by the pass-through entity to
another municipality in the State; or
(ii) the resident owner’s proportionate share of the amount of city
income tax that would be imposed
on the pass-through entity if the
pass-through entity conducted business in the City.

the credit allowed under division (e)

An emergency resolution objecting to plans to move the Lakewood
Social Security Administration Office and encouraging the Social
Security Administration to maintain
the local office at 14650 Detroit
Avenue in Lakewood, Ohio.

2431

15
Whereas, the United States Social
Security Administration currently
operates a local office at 14650
Detroit Avenue in Lakewood, Ohio;
and
Whereas, this local office is centrally located and utilized by many
Clevelanders residing on the West
Side; and
Whereas, this local office is easily accessible via public transportation, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic;
and
Whereas, the Social Security Administration is contemplating moving the Lakewood local office to a
suburb that is not as accessible to
Clevelanders residing on the West
Side and not as accessible via public transportation; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby objects to plans to move the
Lakewood Social Security Administration Office and encourages the
Social Security Administration to
maintain the local office at 14650
Detroit Avenue in Lakewood, Ohio.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is requested to transmit copies of
this resolution to President George
W. Bush, United States Senator

An emergency resolution urging
the federal Food and Drug Administration to seek ways to better control counterfeit drug sales in the
United States.
Whereas, the business of selling
fake
prescription
drugs
is
an
increasing global industry; and
Whereas, nearly $39 billion, or 11%
of global pharmaceutical commerce
will be counterfeit this year; by 2010,
this number will double; and
Whereas, many products sold via
drug traffickers contain ingredients
that could be harmful, and these
products come from illegal operations with poor controls; and
Whereas, drugs come into Canada
from places such as China, Chile,
India, Belize, the Bahamas and Vietnam through a process known as
transshipment and most of these
drugs are mailed to customers in the

16
United States from Internet pharmacies in Canada; and
Whereas, although people often
save money by purchasing pharmaceuticals via the internet from Canada and other foreign countries, nothing guarantees the safety of drugs
exported from these countries; and
Whereas, Canada’s national drug
agency cannot guard the purity of
drugs exports sold from Canada to
the United States; and
Whereas, this all poses a grave
health risk to citizens of the U.S.
who use prescriptions drugs and
seek ways to save money on the
purchase of such drugs; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the federal Food and Drug
Administration to seek ways to better control counterfeit drug sales in
the United States.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to directors of the
Food and Drug Administration and
Health and Human Services, to Ohio
Senators DeWine and Voinovich and
all federal Representatives from
Ohio.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

An emergency resolution opposing
Senate Bill 1504 known as the
“Broadband Investment and Consumer Choice Act” (S. 1504) and
Senate Bill 1349/House Bill 3146
known as the “Video Choice Act”
(S. 1349/H.R.3146), and urging Congressional Representatives to refrain fro many form of support or
co sponsorship of S. 1504, S. 1349 and
H.R. 3146 and to vote in opposition
to said bills.
Whereas, on August 2, 2005, the
Broadband
Investment
and
Consumer Choice Act of 2005 (S. 1504)
was introduced in the federal senate; and
Whereas, S. 1504 would preempt
all local authority over the provision
of cable and video services within
the community, including the ability of the local government to provide appropriate oversight to entities
conducting
business
within
their jurisdiction and in the local
public rights-of-way; and
Whereas, the City’s negotiated
contract with its cable operator
would be abrogated under the terms
of the bill; and
Whereas, S. 1504 would substitute
a new compensation methodology on

The City Record
the parties to the City’s existing
franchise contract, depriving the
City of the agreed-upon bargain by
lowering the existing franchise fee
and replacing it with a fee which
must be justified as being “reasonable” in the eyes of the user, limited to management costs (which
denies the rights of the property
owner to obtain fair and reasonable
compensation for the use of public
property for private gain), and not
in excess of 5%; and
Whereas, these requirements and
restrictions would result in the creation of a subsidy to the cable and
telecommunications
industries,
at
the expense of the City’s taxpayers;
and
Whereas, the bill would further
substantially reduce the revenues
that are now includable in the definition of “Gross Revenues” so that
even if the franchise fee did in fact
remain at 5%, the City’s revenues
from the fee would be significantly
less due to the smaller revenue
base; and
Whereas, S. 1504 would substantially reduce the amount of capacity which may be required by local
governments to meet their public,
educational
and
government
(“PEG”) access needs, while stripping the City of the ability to obtain
capital support for the use of PEG
capacity – part of the bargain contained within the City’s negotiated
franchise agreement – with the
result that the community’s cablerelated needs and interests would
not be met; and
Whereas, the bill would deprive
local citizens of the ability to
address local issues locally, by
removing to the state all customer
service issues, and further by denying consumers any form of recourse
for any actions of a communications
provider; and
Whereas, S. 1504 would eliminate
any build-out requirements for any
video
service
provider,
thereby
allowing providers to discriminate
based on the wealth of the local
neighborhoods they choose to serve;
and
Whereas, the bill would preempt
any state or local law that is not
generally applicable to all businesses, thereby potentially preempting
any law applicable to only certain
classes of businesses, such as utilities and rights-of-way users (such
as
requiring
undergrounding
of
facilities and ensuring electric code
compliance); and
Whereas, S. 1504 would prohibit
the City from imposing any fee for
issuance of rights-of-way construction permits yet would require the
City to act on requests for permits
in a timely manner as determined
by the FCC, thereby insinuating
inappropriate federal government
involvement in the basic day-to-day
management of local rights-of-way;
and
Whereas, the bill would prohibit
municipalities and their utilities
from providing communications services without giving a right of first
refusal to private industry, and
would then grant industry unfettered access to all municipal facilities and financing in the event private industry chooses to provide services; and
Whereas, the bill would deprive
the City of the authority to estab-

2432

November 16, 2005
lish
and
maintain
government
owned
and
operated
networks,
known as institutional networks,
that may be utilized by first responders and other government officials
in the day-to-day management of the
City’s business; and
Whereas, S. 1504 would permit
broadened preemption of local zoning decisions relating to the placement of cell towers, depriving the
City of the authority to ensure that
such towers are safely and appropriately located in areas to provide
the greatest degree of services without unnecessarily posing a hazard
to the public health, safety and welfare; and
Whereas, the bill would eliminate
the protection the City currently has
against liability for damages and
attorneys fees in lawsuits brought
by communication service providers
against local governments, a type of
litigation that the bill would seem
to invite service providers to bring;
and
Whereas, on June 30, 2005, the
“Video Choice Act” (S. 1349/H.R.
3145) was introduced in the federal
House and Senate; and
Whereas, S. 1504, S. 1349 and H.R.
3146 would eliminate any build out
requirements
for
video
service
providers, thereby allowing such
providers to pick the most lucrative
communities to service and discriminate against neighborhoods based
on wealth or race; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby opposes Senate Bill 1504 known
as the “Broadband Investment and
Consumer Choice Act” (S. 1504), and
S. 1349/H.R. 3146 known as the
“Video Choice Act”, and urges Congressional Representatives to refrain from any form of support or
co-sponsorship
of
S.
1504,
S.
1349/H.R. 3146, and to vote in opposition to said bills.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
