(a) Notice of Declaration of Nuisance. The Chief of Police or his
designee, upon finding that two (2)
or
more
nuisance
activities
as
defined
in
Section
630.01
have
occurred within any twelve month
period on the same premises, may
cause a written notice and order to
be served on the owner of the property declaring that such property is
a nuisance property. This notice and
order shall set forth the nature of
the nuisances, the estimated costs to
abate any future nuisance, and state
that the owner may avoid being
charged the costs of abatement by
taking steps to prevent any further
nuisance activity as set forth in
division (d) of this Section. The
notice shall further state that if a
third or subsequent nuisance activity as declared in Section 630.01
occurs within twelve (12) months of
the dates of the first two activities,
the City may abate the nuisance by
responding to the activities using
administrative and law enforcement
actions, and the costs of such
abatement shall be assessed on the
nuisance property. Notice shall be
deemed properly delivered by delivering it personally to the owner or
leaving it at the owner’s usual place
of business or residence, or by posting it in a conspicuous place on the
real estate involved, or by mailing
it to the owner, or by publishing it
once in a newspaper of general circulation within the City if it cannot
be served in any of the other ways
mentioned above.

1165

19
(b) Abatement. If within twelve
(12) months after the first of the
two nuisances referred to in division
(a) of this section has occurred, the
Chief of Police or his designee
determines that a third nuisance
activity as declared in Section 630.01
has occurred, the City may abate the
nuisance by responding to the activity using administrative and law
enforcement actions, and the costs
of such abatement shall be assessed
on the nuisance property as a lien
on the real estate from which the
nuisance originated, and the costs
shall be calculated as set forth in
division (c) hereof. The City shall
provide notice to the owner of the
nuisance property of the City’s decision to assess the costs of abatement against the owner’s property.
Such notice shall be made at least
thirty (30) days before such costs
are certified to the County Auditor
for assessment against the property,
and shall contain a street address or
legal description of the property, a
description of the nuisance activities and the cost to abate. Notice
shall be served as set forth in division (a) of this section.
(c) Costs of Abatement. Costs of
abatement shall be assessed based
upon the hourly wage of the police
officer or officers involved in the
abatement of the nuisance activity,
plus 75%, multiplied by the number
of hours required to abate the nuisance.
(d) Appeal. The owner of a nuisance
property
who
receives
a
notice from the Chief of Police or
his designee pursuant to this section
may appeal such notice by submitting written request for reconsideration to the Chief of Police within
ten (10) days of the date of the
notice. If the Chief of Police finds
that the facts presented do not support the declaration of a nuisance,
the Chief shall rescind the notice.
Otherwise, the Chief shall deny the
request by written notice to the
owner, which notice shall inform the
owner of the right to appeal to the
Board of Zoning Appeals. Such
appeal shall be made within ten
(10) days of the date of the notice
from the Chief of Police denying the
request
for
reconsideration.
The
Board shall conduct a hearing and
render a decision in accordance with
City ordinances and regulations governing its conduct and procedure.
Any such appeal shall not stay any
actions by the City to abate the first
or any subsequent nuisance activity.
In any such appeal, the City must
show by a preponderance of the evidence that each violation stated in
the
notice
being
appealed
has
occurred, and that the declaration of
the property as a nuisance property,
or of the intent of the City to assess
the property for abatement costs,
whichever is applicable, is justified.
The City shall be deemed to have
failed to have met this standard if
the owner demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that:
(1) He or she was not the owner
at the time of any of the nuisance
activity that is the basis of the
notice; or
(2) He or she had knowledge of
the
nuisance
activity,
but
has
promptly and vigorously taken all
actions necessary to abate each nuisance including, without limitation,
compliance with the requirements of
Sections
5321.17(C)
and
5321.04
(A)(9) of the Revised Code; or
(3) He or she had no knowledge
of the nuisance activity and could

The City Record

20
not, with reasonable care and diligence, have known of the nuisance
activity; and upon receipt of the
notice of the declaration of the property as a nuisance property, he or
she promptly took all actions necessary to abate the nuisance including, without limitation, compliance
with the requirements of Sections
5321.17(C) and 5321.04 (A)(9) of the
Revised Code.
Section 630.03
Other Legal Actions Not Affected
The declaration of a nuisance
property, an order to abate a nuisance, or the assessment of costs by
the City on a property pursuant to
this chapter, do not affect or limit
the City’s right or authority to bring
criminal prosecution or other legal
action against any person for viola-

tion of the City’s ordinances, including legal action brought pursuant to
Sections 619.24 and 619.25 of the Codified Ordinances.
Section 630.04 Severability
If any clause, sentence, paragraph
or part of this chapter, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, shall for any reason be
adjudged by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect, impair or
invalidate the remainder of this
Chapter nor the application of such
clause, sentence, paragraph or part
to other persons or circumstances but
shall be confined in its operation to
the clause, sentence, paragraph or
part thereof and to the persons or circumstances directly involved in the
controversy in which such judgment

June 8, 2005
shall have been rendered. It is hereby declared to be the legislative
intent that this Chapter would have
been adopted had such provisions not
been included or such persons or circumstances been expressly excluded
from their coverage.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

By Mayor Campbell.
An emergency ordinance to amend
Section 413.031 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as
enacted by Ordinance No. 176-A-05,
passed May 2, 2005, relating to the
use of automated cameras to impose
civil penalties upon red light and
speeding violators.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 413.031 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as enacted by
Ordinance No. 176-A-05, passed May
2, 2005 is amended to read as follows:
Section 413.031 Use of Automated
Cameras to Impose Civil Penalties
upon Red Light and Speeding Violators
Civil
enforcement
system
(a)
established. The City of Cleveland
hereby adopts a civil enforcement
system for red light and speeding
offenders photographed by means of
an “automated traffic enforcement
camera system” as defined in division (m). This civil enforcement system imposes monetary liability on
the owner of a vehicle for failure of
an operator to stop at a traffic signal displaying a steady red light
indication or for the failure of an
operator to comply with a speed limitation.
(b) Red light offense - liability
imposed. The owner of a vehicle
shall be liable for the penalty
imposed under this section if the
vehicle crosses a marked stop line
or the intersection plane at a system location when the traffic signal
for that vehicle’s direction is emitting a steady red light.
(c) Speeding offense - liability
imposed. The owner of a vehicle
shall be liable for the penalty
imposed under this section if the
vehicle is operated at a speed in
excess of the limitations set forth in
Section 433.03.
(d) Liability does not constitute
a conviction. The imposition of liability under this section shall not
be deemed a conviction for any
purpose and shall not be made part
of the operating record of any person on whom the liability is imposed.
(e) Other offenses and penalties
not abrogated. Nothing in this section shall be construed as altering
or limiting Sections 433.03 or 413.03
of these Codified Ordinances, the
criminal penalties imposed by those
sections, or the ability of a police
officer to enforce those sections
against any offender observed by
the officer violating either of those
sections. Nothing in this section
shall be construed to limit the liability of an operator of a vehicle for
any violation of division (b) or (c)
of this section.
(f) Selection of camera sites. The
selection of the sites where auto-

32
mated cameras are placed and the
enforcement of this ordinance shall
be made on the basis of sound professional traffic engineering and
law enforcement judgments. Automated cameras shall not be placed
at any site where the speed restrictions or the timing of the traffic
signal fail to conform to sound professional traffic engineering principles.
(g) Locations. The following are
the locations for the Automated
Traffic Enforcement Camera System:

The Director of Public Safety
shall cause the general public to be
notified by means of a press release
issued at least thirty days before
any given camera is made fullyoperational and is used to issue tickets to offenders. Before a given
camera issues actual tickets, there
shall be a period of at least two
weeks, which may run concurrently
with the 30-day public-notice period,
during which only “warning” notices
shall be issued.
At each site of a red light or fixed
speed camera, the Director of Public Service shall cause signs to be
posted to apprise ordinarily observant
motorists
that
they
are

The City Record
approaching an area where an automated camera is monitoring for red
light or speed violators. Mobile
speed units shall be plainly marked
vehicles.
(h) Notices of liability. Any ticket for an automated red light or
speeding system violation under this
section shall:
(1) Be reviewed by a Cleveland
police officer;
(2) Be forwarded by first-class
mail or personal service to the vehicle’s registered owner’s address as
given on the state’s motor vehicle
registration, and
(3) Clearly state the manner in
which the violation may be appealed.
(i) Penalties. Any violation of
division (b) or division (c) of this
section shall be deemed a noncriminal violation for which a civil penalty shall be assessed and for which
no points authorized by Section
4507.021 of the Revised Code (“Point
system
for
license
suspension”)
shall be assigned to the owner or
driver of the vehicle.
(j) Ticket evaluation, public service, and appeals. The program
shall include a fair and sound ticket-evaluation process that includes
review by the vendor and a police
officer, a strong customer-service
commitment, and an appeals process
that accords due process to the ticket respondent and that conforms to
the requirements of the Ohio Revised Code.
(k) Appeals. A notice of appeal
shall be filed with the Hearing Officer within twenty-one (21) days
from the date listed on the ticket.
The failure to give notice of appeal
or pay the civil penalty within this
time period shall constitute a waiver of the right to contest the ticket
and shall be considered an admission.
Appeals shall be heard by the
Parking Violations Bureau through
an administrative process established by the Clerk of the Cleveland Municipal Court. At hearings,
the strict rules of evidence applicable to courts of law shall not
apply. The contents of the ticket
shall constitute a prima facie evidence of the facts it contains. Liability may be found by the hearing
examiner based upon a preponderance of the evidence. If a finding
of liability is appealed, the record
of the case shall include the order
of the Parking Violations Bureau,
the Ticket, other evidence submitted by the respondent or the City
of Cleveland, and a transcript or
record of the hearing, in a written
or electronic form acceptable to
the court to which the case is
appealed.
Liability
shall
not
be
found
where the evidence shows that the
automated
camera
captured
an
event is not an offense, including
each of the following events and
such others as may be established
by rules and regulations issued by
the Director of Public Safety under

1178

avoid violating a red light indication;
2) The motorist proceeds through
a red light indication as part of
funeral procession;
3) The motorist is operating a
City-owned emergency vehicle with
its emergency lights activated and
proceeds through a red light indication or exceeds the posted speed limitation;
4) The motorist is directed by a
police officer on the scene contrary
to the traffic signal indication.
Liability shall also be excused if
a vehicle is observed committing an
offense
where
the
vehicle
was
stolen prior to the offense and the
owner has filed a police report;
The Director of Public Safety, in
coordination with the Parking Violations Bureau, shall establish a
process by which a vehicle owner
who was not the driver at the time
of the alleged offense may, by affidavit, name the person who the
owner believes was driving the vehicle at the time. Upon receipt of such
an affidavit timely submitted to the
Parking
Violations
Bureau,
the
Bureau shall suspend further action
against the owner of the vehicle and
instead direct notices and collection
efforts to the person identified in
the affidavit. If the person named in
the affidavit, when notified, denies
being the driver or denies liability,
then the Parking Violations Bureau
shall resume the notice and collection process against the vehicle
owner, the same as if no affidavit
had been submitted, and if the violation is found to have been committed by a preponderance of evidence, the owner shall be liable for
any penalties imposed for the offense.
A decision in favor of the City of
Cleveland
may
be
enforced
by
means of a civil action or any other
means provided by the Revised
Code.
(l) Evidence of ownership. It is
prima facie evidence that the person
registered as the owner of the vehicle with the Ohio Bureau of Motor
Vehicles, or with any other State
vehicle registration office, was operating the vehicle at the time of the
offenses set out in divisions (b) and
(c) of this section.
(m)
Program
oversight.
The
Director of Public Safety shall oversee the program authorized by this
Section. The Director of Public Service shall oversee the installation
and maintenance of all automated
cameras. An encroachment permit
shall be authorized in the legislation in which locations are selected.
(n) Rules and Regulations. The
Director of Public Safety may issue
rules and regulations to carry out
the provisions of these sections,
which shall be effective thirty (30)
days after publication in the City
Record.
(o) Establishment of Penalty. The
penalty imposed for a violation of

An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Legislature not to increase
the kilowatt-hour tax for the purpose of balancing the state budget.
Whereas, the Ohio Legislature is
considering House Bill 66, the 2005
state budget bill that will impose
drastic
funding
cuts
for
Ohio’s
largest and neediest cities; and
Whereas, the budget bill includes
a 30% increase in the kilowatt-hour
tax imposed on the consumption of
electricity in the state; and
Whereas, the residents of Cleveland and northern Ohio already pay
some of the highest rates for electricity in the country; and
Whereas, the kilowatt-hour tax is
unfairly regressive in that it applies
to customers at the same rate without regard to the income of the customer or the customer’s ability to
pay; and
Whereas, the proposed 30% increase in the kilowatt-hour tax also
unfairly penalizes lower-income residents, many of whom cannot afford
modern energy-efficient homes and
appliances; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

Legislature

amend
pending
House Bill 66 to remove provisions
that will increase the kilowatt-hour
tax.

a copy of this resolution to Ohio
Governor Bob Taft, Ohio Senate
President Bill Harris, each member
of the Ohio Senate representing

County residents.

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Ord. No. 817-05.
By Council Members Westbrook
and Jackson (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the purchase by one or more
requirement contracts of labor and
materials necessary to remove rubber and any other contaminants
from paved surfaces, for the various
divisions of the Department of Port
Control.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Port Control is authorized to make
one or more written requirement
contracts under the Charter and the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, for the requirements for
the term of one year or two years
for the necessary items of labor and
materials necessary to remove rubber and any other contaminants
from paved surfaces in the approximate amount as purchased during
the preceding term, purchased by
the Commissioner of Purchases and
Supplies on a unit basis for the various divisions of the Department of
Port Control. Bids shall be taken in
a manner that permits an award to
be made for all items as a single
contract, or by separate contract for
each or any combination of the
items as the Board of Control determines. Alternate bids for a period
less than the specified term may be
taken if desired by the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies
until provision is made for the
requirements for the entire term.
The Director of Port Control is
authorized to enter into one or more

1210

June 8, 2005
contracts with a term of two years
instead of one year when there is a
financial advantage to the City. For
purposes of this ordinance, a financial advantage shall be determined
by the Director of Port Control by
comparing the bids received for both
terms.
Section 2. That the costs of the
contract
or
contracts
shall
be
charged against the proper appropriation accounts and the Director
of Finance shall certify the amount
of the initial purchase, which purchase, together with all later purchases, shall be made on order of
the Commissioner of Purchases and
Supplies
under
a
requisition
against the contract or contracts
certified
by
the
Director
of
Finance. (RL 133202)
Section 3. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Passed May 23, 2005.
Effective June 2, 2005.
