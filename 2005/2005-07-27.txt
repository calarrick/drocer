assistance; and
Whereas,
the
Entrepreneurship
Academy will offer a college preparatory curriculum in an extended

An emergency resolution opposing
the proposed changes to the Ohio
Constitution that arbitrarily constrain the ability of state and local
governments to effectively realize
and allocate the tax resources needed to meet the people’s needs
through a representative democracy
and supporting efforts to defeat the
proposed changes to the Ohio Constitution.
Whereas, the Citizens for Tax
Reform are endorsing proposals to
amend the Ohio Constitution to institute tax and expenditure limitations
at the state and local levels of government; and
Whereas, these expenditure limitations could only be overridden by
a popular vote; and
Whereas, these expenditures proposals are called “Taxpayers Bill of
Rights”; and
Whereas, states that have instituted similar Constitutional proposals, such as Colorado, now face
severe problems in meeting the
basic needs of their citizenry and
are seeking to overturn key aspects
of the expenditure limitation laws;
and
Whereas, such expenditure limitation proposals tie the hands of state
and local leaders in time of crisis
and
other
unpredictable
circumstances and circumvent state and
local governments’ thoughtful consideration of policy decisions; and
Whereas, such expenditure limitation proposals reduce funding for
education, health care, police, fire
protection, libraries, economic development, and other vital services
to citizens; and
Whereas, such expenditure limitation proposals could undercut state
constitutional provisions requiring
state support of education; and
Whereas, such expenditure limitations prevent state and local officials from making the tough decisions they were elected to make and
pass the responsibility for learning
all aspects of often complex budgetary issues to citizens who have
other jobs and responsibilities; and
Whereas, amending the constitution is a virtually irrevocable action
and should only be undertake when
legislative remedies have proven
enduringly inadequate; and
Whereas, such constitutional tinkering brings great harm to local
communities through continued reductions in state funding, erodes
decision making at the local level
and adversely impacts government’s
ability to provide the basic services
residents and businesses expect and
deserve; and
Whereas,
in
volatile
economic
times state governments and local
governments
need
flexibility
in
order to avoid crisis situations; and
Whereas, without such flexibility,
the State of Ohio and local governments may be unable to provide
basic services in crisis situations
and this inability will adversely
impact the quality of life of Ohio
residents, especially urban residents
and poor residents; and
Whereas, the proposed expenditure limitation proposal would force
the State and local governments to

The City Record
spend valuable time and money asking for permission from the same
people who elected them before any
action can be taken on important
issues and would also force taxpayers to pay twice for governance –
once for elections of the State and
local officials and again for elections to make the decisions those
officials should make; and
Whereas, such expenditure limitation proposals contradict the fundamental principles upon which our
constitution and system of representative government are based and
damages the ability to craft good
public policy; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that state and local elected officials
are elected to represent the interests
of their constituents, to deal with
difficult decisions, and to thoughtfully debate and determine the best
course of action for the state or community they serve; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
usual daily operation of a municipal
department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes the proposed changes to the
Ohio Constitution that would arbitrarily constrain the ability of state
and local governments to effectively realize and allocate the tax
resources needed to meet the people’s needs through a representative
democracy and supports efforts to
defeat the proposed changes to the
Ohio Constitution.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to transmit
copies of this resolution to Governor
Bob Taft, Secretary of State Ken
Blackwell, those members of the
Ohio General Assembly representing
Cuyahoga County, the Ohio Municipal
League,
and

all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

Ord. No. 172-A-05 (As a substitute
for Ordinance No. 172-05).
By Mayor Campbell.
An emergency ordinance authorizing the provision of certain economic development incentives for
the purpose of creating jobs and
improving the economic welfare of
the people of the City as authorized
in Art. VIII, Section 13 of the Ohio
Constitution; and authorizing the
Director of Economic Development
to implement the Job Creation Incentive Grant Program under this
ordinance;
and
authorizing
the
Director of Economic Development
to enter into economic development
agreements to facilitate the provisions of this ordinance.
Whereas, under Section 325.12 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended by
Ordinance No. 1333-97, passed August 13, 1997, this Council designated an area which is in the City of
Cleveland and described as the Central Business District (the “CBD”);
and
Whereas, the City’s CBD has significantly declined in tax value and
lost over 7,000 jobs since the year
2000, with corresponding reductions
in City tax receipts available for the
City’s general fund and the Cleveland Public Schools; and
Whereas, when compared to suburban office locations, the competitiveness of office space in the CBD
is impacted by the relatively high
occupancy costs for companies located in the CBD; and
Whereas, one of the primary factors of these relatively high occupancy costs is the cost of parking
for employees and employers in the
CBD, and these costs: 1) increase
downtown employers’ costs of doing
business and restricts these employers by eliminating potential employees who are unwilling or unable to
bear significant monthly parking
costs in the CBD; and 2) handicap
the CBD’s ability to attract companies whose employees are accustomed to free parking spaces in
their current suburban locations;
and
Whereas, the City intends to pursue long term strategies to achieve
a relative reduction in the average
monthly
parking
costs
of
CBD
employees; and
Whereas, until the City’s long
term parking approaches are realized, the City requires an interim
incentive program to allow new or
expanding CBD businesses to partially offset the relatively high occupancy costs for companies located
in, or considering locating in, the
CBD to offset suburban office parks’
competitive advantages; and
Whereas, the City intends to enter
into economic development agreements in which the City will annually make, subject to annual appropriation, incentive payments to deserving employers in the CBD for
the purpose of inducing various
employers to locate and expand
their workforces within the City,
create
employment
opportunities,
and improve the economic welfare
of Cleveland’s citizens, all as authorized in Article VIII, Section 13 of
the Ohio Constitution; and
Whereas, within the CBD, the
Director of Economic Development

The City Record
is authorized to further induce commitment from various deserving
employers by providing annual incentive payments, subject to appropriation, and based on the number
of full time employees in the CBD
as specified in individual economic
development
agreements
between
the City and a specific employer;
and
Whereas, this incentive that the
City of Cleveland is offering to businesses in the CBD shall be termed
the Job Creation Incentive Grant
Program; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, safety, property, and welfare and that its enactment is a necessary prerequisite to
providing immediate assistance to
create and preserve job opportunities and advance and promote economic development in the City of
Cleveland, and the assistance is
immediately necessary; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council finds
and determines that entering into
economic development agreements
with employers inside the CBD, as
defined in Section 325.12 of the Codified Ordinances, for the purpose of
providing annual incentive payments to deserving businesses, is
in furtherance of the City’s efforts
to induce various employers to
locate and expand their workforce
within the City, create employment
opportunities, and improve the economic welfare of Cleveland’s citizens, all as authorized in Article
VIII, Section 13 of the Ohio Constitution.
Section 2. That the Director of
Economic Development is authorized to create the Job Creation
Incentive Grant Program and to
approve and enter into economic
development agreements with various for-profit employers that are
new to the CBD and those that previously existed in the CBD. New
Employers are those employers not
currently located within the City
that move to the CBD after the
effective date of this ordinance, and
whose relocation to the CBD adds at
least 25 new, non-retail employees to
the CBD (“New Employers”). Existing Employers are those employers
that have been located in the CBD
for not less than two years prior to
the effective date of this ordinance
and that add at least 10 new, nonretail employees within the CBD
after the effective date of this ordinance (“Existing Employers”). New
Employers and Existing Employers
are both collectively known as the
“Employers”.
Section 3. That based on the specific terms of each economic development agreement, the City may
annually provide, subject to annual
appropriation, incentive payments
to the Employers in the CBD based
upon a fixed dollar amount not less
than One Hundred and Ninety Five
Dollars
($195.00)
per
year
per
employee and not greater than One
Thousand and Seventy Five Dollars
($1,075.00) per year per employee.
The
specific
amount
of
each
Employer’s incentive payment will

1666

July 27, 2005
be determined by the Directors of
Economic Development and Finance
based on a salary schedule included in File Number 172-A-05-A, multiplied by the number of New
Employees, with new employees defined as permanent employees that
a New Employer hires or relocates
or that an Existing Employer hires
after the effective date of the economic development agreement and
who work at least 32 hours per
week for a one year period (“New
Employees”). Employers must be
located in the CBD at least six
months during the year in which
they are seeking an incentive payment. The Employer must not be
delinquent on any portion of its
municipal taxes, including employee withholding, due and owing to
the City of Cleveland. The Employer will annually document and certify the number of jobs created and
annual average payroll to the Departments of Economic Development and Finance. Employers may
only participate in one economic
development agreement under this
ordinance. The term of an economic
development agreement authorized
by this ordinance shall not exceed
the term of the Employer’s lease,
and in no event shall exceed five
years, unless otherwise approved
by Council.
Section 4. That the Incentive Payments shall be drawn from Fund
Nos. 10 SF 526 and 17 SF 006 and
paid to the Employers no later than
March 31, of each year following the
effective date of the applicable economic
development
agreement.
Total contracts under this Section
shall not exceed $5,000,000. All Incentive Payments made under this
ordinance shall be subject to appropriation. The Director of Economic
Development is authorized to execute economic development agreements in a form similar to that provided in the file and such economic
development agreements shall be
consistent with the terms of this
ordinance. Authority to enter into
these economic development agreements shall expire five (5) years
after the effective date of this ordinance.
Section 5. That the Mayor, the
Director of Finance, the Director of
Economic Development, the Director
of Law, and any other City officials,
as appropriate, are each authorized
to prepare and sign any other documents, instruments, amendments or
certificates and to take such actions
as are necessary or appropriate to
consummate
and
implement
the
transactions described in or contemplated by this ordinance, the Economic Development Agreement.
Section 6. That this Council finds
and determines that all formal
actions of this Council concerning
and relating to the passage of this
ordinance were taken in an open
meeting of this Council and that all
deliberations of this Council that
resulted in those formal actions
were in meetings open to the public
in compliance with the law.
Section 7. That a copy of any
economic development agreement
authorized by this ordinance shall
be forwarded to the Clerk of Council within five business days of its
certification.

July 27, 2005
Section 8. That any economic development agreement authorized by
this ordinance shall be reviewed
annually by the Tax Incentive Review Council, established by Section
5709 of the Revised Code for compliance with the contract’s terms
and this ordinance.
Section 9. That this ordinance
shall be reviewed by City Council in
February of every year starting in
February 2006.
Section 10. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit a copy of
this ordinance to the Cuyahoga
County Board of Commissioners.
Section 11. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

Whereas,
this
group

renamed the O’Jays after legendary
radio D.J., Eddie O’Jay; and
Whereas,
in
1963,
the
O’Jays
signed a contract with Imperial

July 27, 2005

and
the
band
quickly
achieved their first hit, Lonely
Drifter; and
Whereas, after a string of hit singles, the O’Jays debut album Comin’
Through was released in 1965; and
Whereas, the group released one
more album, Soul Sounds, before
they met songwriters and producers,
Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, in
1967; and
Whereas, the group started recording on Gamble and Huff’s Neptune
label as a quartet after the departure of Bill Isles in 1967; and
Whereas, Bobby Massey left the
group in 1972 and the trio united

record some of the best R&B pop
hits ever; and
Whereas, during this time, the
O’Jays became known as one of the
best bands in the world; and
Whereas, the 1970’s was truly the
decade of the O’Jays; and

the O’Jays recorded eight No. 1 R&B
singles; and
Whereas, during this period the
band also had five albums that went
gold and three that went platinum;
and
Whereas, during this period of
successes, the O’Jays also faced one
of their darkest moments as William
Powell, a founding member of the
band, was forced to leave the band
because of terminal cancer; and
Whereas, Sammy Strain became
William Powell’s replacement; and
Whereas, the O’Jays were able to
overcome the loss of one of their
founding members to cancers and
continued to release hits through
the 1980’s and 1990’s; and
Whereas, today, the band continues to perform and bring joy to old
and new fans; and
Whereas, this Council takes great
pride in recognizing the O’Jays for
their outstanding accomplishments
and achievements during the course
of their illustrious career which
encompasses more than 40 years;
and
Whereas, this Council congratulates the O’Jays on their induction

Section 413.031 Use of Automated
Cameras to Impose Civil Penalties
upon Red Light and Speeding Violators
(a)
Civil
enforcement
system
established. The City of Cleveland
hereby adopts a civil enforcement
system for red light and speeding
offenders photographed by means of
an “automated traffic enforcement
camera system” as defined in division (m). This civil enforcement system imposes monetary liability on
the owner of a vehicle for failure of
an operator to stop at a traffic signal displaying a steady red light
indication or for the failure of an
operator to comply with a speed limitation.
(b) Red light offense – liability
imposed. The owner of a vehicle
shall be liable for the penalty
imposed under this section if the
vehicle crosses a marked stop line
or the intersection plane at a system location when the traffic signal
for that vehicle’s direction is emitting a steady red light.
(c) Speeding offense – liability
imposed. The owner of a vehicle
shall be liable for the penalty
imposed under this section if the
vehicle is operated at a speed in
excess of the limitations set forth in
Section 433.03.
(d) Liability does not constitute a
conviction. The imposition of liability under this section shall not be
deemed a conviction for any purpose
and shall not be made part of the
operating record of any person on
whom the liability is imposed.
(e) Other offenses and penalties
not abrogated. Nothing in this section shall be construed as altering
or limiting Sections 433.03 or 413.03
of these Codified Ordinances, the
criminal penalties imposed by those
sections, or the ability of a police
officer to enforce those sections
against any offender observed by
the officer violating either of those
sections. Nothing in this section
shall be construed to limit the liability of an operator of a vehicle for
any violation of division (b) or (c)
of this section.
(f) Selection of camera sites. The
selection of the sites where automated cameras are placed and the
enforcement of this ordinance shall
be made on the basis of sound professional traffic engineering and
law enforcement judgments. Automated cameras shall not be placed
at any site where the speed restrictions or the timing of the traffic signal fail to conform to sound professional traffic engineering principles.
(g) Locations. The following are
the locations for the Automated
Traffic Enforcement Camera System:

The Director of Public Safety
shall cause the general public to be
notified by means of a press release
issued at least thirty days before
any given camera is made fullyoperational and is used to issue tickets to offenders. Before a given camera issues actual tickets, there shall
be a period of at least two weeks,
which may run concurrently with
the 30-day public-notice period, during which only “warning” notices
shall be issued.
At each site of a red light or fixed
speed camera, the Director of Public Service shall cause signs to be
posted to apprise ordinarily observant
motorists
that
they
are
approaching an area where an automated camera is monitoring for red
light or speed violators. Mobile
speed units shall be plainly marked
vehicles.
(h) Notices of liability. Any ticket
for an automated red light or speeding system violation under this section shall:
(1) Be reviewed by a Cleveland
police officer;
(2) Be forwarded by first-class
mail or personal service to the vehicle’s registered owner’s address as
given on the state’s motor vehicle
registration, and
(3) Clearly state the manner in
which the violation may be appealed.
(i) Penalties. Any violation of
division (b) or division (c) of this
section shall be deemed a noncriminal violation for which a civil penalty shall be assessed and for which
no points authorized by Section
4507.021 of the Revised Code (“Point

The City Record
system
for
license
suspension”)
shall be assigned to the owner or
driver of the vehicle.
(j) Ticket evaluation, public service, and appeals. The program
shall include a fair and sound ticket-evaluation process that includes
review by the vendor and a police
officer, a strong customer-service
commitment, and an appeals process
that accords due process to the ticket respondent and that conforms to
the requirements of the Ohio Revised Code.
(k) Appeals. A notice of appeal
shall be filed with the Hearing Officer within twenty-one (21) days
from the date listed on the ticket.
The failure to give notice of appeal
or pay the civil penalty within this
time period shall constitute a waiver of the right to contest the ticket
and shall be considered an admission.
Appeals shall be heard by the
Parking Violations Bureau through
an administrative process established by the Clerk of the Cleveland
Municipal Court. At hearings, the
strict rules of evidence applicable to
courts of law shall not apply. The
contents of the ticket shall constitute a prima facie evidence of the
facts it contains. Liability may be
found by the hearing examiner
based upon a preponderance of the
evidence. If a finding of liability is
appealed, the record of the case
shall include the order of the Parking Violations Bureau, the Ticket,
other evidence submitted by the
respondent or the City of Cleveland,
and a transcript or record of the
hearing, in a written or electronic
form acceptable to the court to
which the case is appealed.
Liability shall not be found where
the evidence shows that the automated camera captured an event is
not an offense, including each of the
following events and such others as
may be established by rules and
regulations issued by the Director of
Public Safety under the authority of
division (n) of this section:
1) The motorist stops in time to
avoid violating a red light indication;
2) The motorist proceeds through
a red light indication as part of
funeral procession;
3) The motorist is operating a
City-owned emergency vehicle with
its emergency lights activated and
proceeds through a red light indication or exceeds the posted speed limitation;
4) The motorist is directed by a
police officer on the scene contrary
to the traffic signal indication.
Liability shall also be excused if
a vehicle is observed committing an
offense
where
the
vehicle
was
stolen prior to the offense and the
owner has filed a police report;
The Director of Public Safety, in
coordination with the Parking Violations Bureau, shall establish a
process by which a vehicle owner
who was not the driver at the time
of the alleged offense may, by affidavit, name the person who the
owner believes was driving the vehicle at the time. Upon receipt of such

1702

July 27, 2005
an affidavit timely submitted to the
Parking
Violations
Bureau,
the
Bureau shall suspend further action
against the owner of the vehicle and
instead direct notices and collection
efforts to the person identified in
the affidavit. If the person named in
the affidavit, when notified, denies
being the driver or denies liability,
then the Parking Violations Bureau
shall resume the notice and collection process against the vehicle
owner, the same as if no affidavit
had been submitted, and if the violation is found to have been committed by a preponderance of evidence, the owner shall be liable for
any
penalties
imposed
for
the
offense.
A decision in favor of the City of
Cleveland
may
be
enforced
by
means of a civil action or any other
means provided by the Revised
Code.
(l) Evidence of ownership. It is
prima facie evidence that the person
registered as the owner of the vehicle with the Ohio Bureau of Motor
Vehicles, or with any other State
vehicle registration office, was operating the vehicle at the time of the
offenses set out in divisions (b) and
(c) of this section.
(m)
Program
oversight.
The
Director of Public Safety shall oversee the program authorized by this
Section. The Director of Public Service shall oversee the installation
and maintenance of all automated
cameras. An encroachment permit
shall be authorized in the legislation in which locations are selected.
(n) Rules and Regulations. The
Director of Public Safety may issue
rules and regulations to carry out
the provisions of these sections,
which shall be effective thirty (30)
days after publication in the City
Record.
(o) Establishment of Penalty. The
penalty imposed for a violation of
division (b) or (c) of this section
shall be follows:

413.031(b)
All violations
413.031(c)
