An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Legislature to restore full
funding for the Office of Ohio Consumers’ Counsel and to retain the
toll-free consumer call center operated by the agency.
Whereas, the Office of Ohio Consumers’ Counsel (“OCC”) was created under Chapter 4911 of the Ohio
Revised Code and has the statutory
mandate to serve as advocate for
the state’s residential utility customers; and
Whereas, OCC maintains a tollfree consumer call center where utility consumers can obtain assistance

June 1, 2005
in disputing a utility bill, addressing a problem with the quality of
service, obtaining financial assistance, avoiding disconnection of utility services, and purchasing utility
services under the state’s customer
choice programs; and
Whereas, House Bill 66, as passed
by the Ohio House of Representatives, reduces funding for OCC’s
operations by $1.5 million per year,
prohibits OCC from operating a customer call center, and requires customers to take their complains
about utilities to the Public Utilities
Commission of Ohio; and
Whereas, cutting OCC’s funding
will not affect the state’s budget
because OCC is funded by assessments on the utility companies and
not by the general revenue fund;
and
Whereas, this Council strongly
believes that reducing funding for
the office of OCC and eliminating
OCC’s customer call center will hurt
the interests of this state’s residential utility customers by denying
customers direct access to OCC and
by weakening OCC’s ability to assist
customers, monitor the regulated
utilities, and in other respects fulfill
its duties as the statutory residential consumer advocate; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio Legislature to restore the
proposed funding cuts for the Office
of Consumers’ Counsel and to permit
that agency to maintain its toll-free
consumer call center.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to transmit
a copy of this resolution to Ohio
Governor Bob Taft, Ohio Senate
President Bill Harris, each member
of the Ohio Senate representing
Cuyahoga County residents, Attorney General Jim Petro and Janine
L.
Midgen-Ostrander,
Consumers
Counsel.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

and
Whereas, state and local governments throughout the United States

reducing global warming pollution
in City operations and their communities; and
Whereas, one hundred thirty one
U.S. Mayors have signed the U.S.
Mayors Climate Protection Agreement; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the

Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby expresses its support of the U.S.
Mayors Climate Protection Agreement and urges Mayors from around
