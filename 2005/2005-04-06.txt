I. Introduction
The Charter of the City of Cleveland (the “City”) provides the City
with the legal authority to promulgate and implement standards for
the City’s cash management and
investment operations. Under the
authority granted by the Charter,
the City Council has adopted specific cash management and investment legislation, (the City’s Depository Ordinance is included as Appendix A), which both outlines the
City’s investment authority and confers
powers
and
responsibilities
upon the City’s Director of Finance.
Under the authority of the Codified Ordinances of the City (as
established and amended through
the passage of ordinances and resolutions by the City Council), the
Director of Finance is authorized
and required to make rules and regulations and to establish administrative policies and procedures relating to the cash management and
investment policies of the City. To
this end, this Statement of Cash
Management and Investment Policy
(the “Policy”) has been prepared.
II. Cash Management and Investment Policy Goals
A. The cash management and
investment activities of the City
shall be conducted in compliance
with the Charter of the City, the
Codified Ordinances of the City, and
the applicable provisions of the Ohio
Revised Code.
B. The cash management and
investment activities of the City
shall be conducted in a manner
which is consistent with prevailing
prudent business practices which
may be applied by other public organizations of similar size and financial resources.
C. Investments of the City, or
funds held in a fiduciary capacity,
shall be made with the exercise of
that judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which
persons of prudence, discretion, and
intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not
for speculation, but for investment,
considering the probable safety of
their capital, as well as the probable income derived.
D. Fundamental goals governing
the City of Cleveland’s investment
policy shall be:
Safety: Safety of principal is the
foremost objective of the investment
program. Investments of the City
shall be undertaken in a manner
that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio.
Liquidity: The City’s investment
portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable the City to meet all
operating requirements, which might
be reasonably anticipated.
Yield: The City’s investment portfolio shall be designed with the
objective to produce a rate of return
on investment, which is equal to an

April 6, 2005
amount that will provide the maximum level of income without subjecting the City to undue risk. Specific
rate
of
return
equivalent
“goals” are listed in Section VII B.
E. Rules and polices promulgated
by the Director of Finance shall be
designed in the best interests of the
City and its citizens, and shall not
afford special financial advantage
to any individual or corporate member of the financial or investment
community.
F. Expenses associated with this
policy, e.g., bank charges, shall be
fully disclosed by the utilization of
itemized billing and shall be liquidated in such a manner which will
be the most cost efficient for the
City of Cleveland as determined by
the Director of Finance and the City
Treasurer.
G. This Policy shall be reviewed
yearly by the Director of Finance,
and if the Director deems it necessary it shall be revised or updated.
Unless the policy is withdrawn or
repealed it is the effective policy.
III. City funds subject to the Cash
Management and Investment Policy
The Policy applies to all cash and
investment activity administered by
the City Treasurer. The Policy does
not apply to cash and investments
of the Sinking Fund of the City, and
to funds governed by the trust
agreements
securing
outstanding
bonds, notes, leases, Certificates of
Participation or other obligations of
the City containing covenants of the
City with respect to the permissible
investments of those funds.
IV. Selection of Depositories and
Broker/Dealers
A. Depositories
Deposits in commercial banks,
whether they be in time deposits, or
demand deposits in special interestbearing accounts (“NOW”, “SuperNOW”, etc.), shall be only made in
banks (i) qualified to accept public
sector deposits by having been designated as eligible depositories by
the Director of Finance and reviewed by City Council and (ii)
which meet the requirements of the
Charter and Codified Ordinances of
the City.
1. Selection Criteria: Public Purpose Criteria-Civic performance evaluation
a. The City is committed to the
growth, development, and renewal
of its residential, retail, commercial,
and industrial areas, with the objective of counteracting population loss
and various forms of disinvestment.
Furthermore, the City is committed
to resistance of all forms of racial,
religious, ethnic, and economic bias.
Given such commitments, the City
has established criteria for evaluating financial institutions commitment to the City’s standards of civic
performance. The criteria used to
designate eligible depositories can
serve to hasten the achievement of
the City’s objectives. Such civic performance evaluation criteria, insofar
as they can be applied to the financial operation of the City, have been
incorporated in the investment policy.
b. Compliance with the City’s standards for civic performance is a prerequisite for the achievement of eligibility for depository status by
commercial banks. Financial institutions failing to demonstrate evidence of commitment to the City’s
standards of civic performance shall
be deemed ineligible to serve as a

The City Record
City depository. Demonstration of
compliance with the City’s standards of civic performance shall be
evaluated based upon the specific
statements, disclosures, affidavits
and other documentation required
by
Codified
Ordinances
Section
178.03 through 178.08:
i. Any financial institution seeking eligibility, as a City Depository
shall submit to the Director of
Finance upon request certain information required by the City to evaluate the financial institutions policies and practices regarding housing and economic development. The
required information shall include,
but is not limited to, documentation
of residential and commercial lending information; SEC 10-K reports,
annual report, report of condition
and income; documentation of the
financial institution’s participation,
creation, and implementation of initiatives that result in participation
in neighborhood development; account information by census tract;
and a declaration of the financial
institution’s commitment to continue
or
undertake
neighborhood
development.
ii. Eligibility to serve as a City
depository shall be based, in part,
upon the submission of all required
information as well as the successful completion of a biennial review
as conducted by the Community
Reinvestment
Review
Committee
created pursuant to Codified Ordinance Section 178.07.
iii. A financial institution seeking
designation, as an eligible depository will be required to submit an
Affidavit of Intent, a sample of
which is contained in Codified Ordinance 178.08.
2. Selection Criteria: Financial
a. Commercial Banks: The creditworthiness, liquidity, and the overall Financial strength of banking
institutions into which the City
deposits money, as measured by recognized rating services, shall be factors in the City’s biennial selection
of depositories.
b. Deposits of City moneys in commercial banks may only be made
with institutions, which possess the
overall financial strength, capitalization, and liquidity to reasonably
ensure the safety and availability of
such moneys. (The City’s Collateral
Agreement is included as Appendix
B). To assess the overall financial
strength of potential depositories,
the City will utilize credit ratings
assigned by Fitch Rating Service,
Moody Investors Service (Moody’s)
and Standard and Poor’s Corporation
(S&P) that are assigned to the commercial bank or related bank holding company. Specifically, any eligible depository, or if the depository is not rated, its corporate holding
company parent, should possess a
long-term deposit rating (or a corporate senior debt rating) of at least
“single A” which is an investment
grade category. Credit ratings downgrades by any of the aforementioned
rating services, which bring an eligible depository below this investment grade category, shall have the
effect
of
immediately
removing
them from eligible depository status
as defined in Section 178.03 (c) of
the Codified Ordinance. The Treasurer shall be notified in writing
within 7 business days of receiving
official notification of placement on
a “negative watch list” or being
downgraded by one of the aforementioned rating agencies.
c. Eligible depositories must also
meet City requirements regarding

549

23
the submission and approval of specific statements, disclosures, affidavits
and
other
documentation
required by Codified Ordinance Section 178.03.
d. Eligible depositories must also
meet City requirements regarding
the quality of services offered and
cost for providing those services as
determined through a competitive
process. (See Appendix D for the
current list of eligible depository
banks.)
B. Broker/Dealer
1. Selection Criteria
a. Broker/dealers must submit
specific statements, disclosures, affidavits and other documentation
required
by
Codified
Ordinance
178.12. The selection of broker/dealers shall be made annually by the
Director of Finance and the list of
eligible broker/dealers shall be submitted to Council.
b. The City will conduct transactions with broker/dealers selected
as provided in subdivision (a) of the
section.
A minimum of 60% of the City’s
designated Broker/Dealers should
have offices within the City of
Cleveland. All “Primary Dealers”
must report to the Market Reports
Division of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York. Also, all applications from Minority/Female Business Enterprises will receive consideration from the Director of
Finance for designation as an eligible Broker/Dealer.
c. Transactions involving City assets with broker/dealers may only
be conducted with institutions possessing overall financial strength,
capitalization, and liquidity sufficient to reasonably ensure the safety and availability of such assets. In
order to assess the overall financial
strength of eligible broker/dealers,
the City will, where applicable, utilize credit ratings assigned to the
broker/dealer or their corporate parent by Fitch Rating Service, Moody
Investors Service (Moody’s) and
Standard and Poor’s Corporation
(S&P). Specifically, any eligible broker/dealer or parent assigned a rating should possess a senior debt rating of at least “Single A”.
d. In cases where a broker/dealer,
or parent, is placed on a “watch list”
by the following rating services;
Fitch Rating Service, Moody’s, or
S&P with negative implications and
their rating falls below “Single A”
they will be immediately removed
from the list. The Treasurer shall be
notified by the Broker / Dealer in
writing within 7 business days of
receiving
official
notification
of
being placed on a “negative watch
list” or being downgraded by one of
the aforementioned rating agencies.
e. The Director of Finance will
designate no more than fifteen (15)
firms to the authorized list of eligible broker/dealers. The list shall be
subject
to
annual
review.
(See
Appendix E for the current list of
eligible broker/dealers).
f. Any non-rated Broker/Dealer
applicant will receive consideration
from the Investment Committee for
designation as an eligible Broker/Dealer.
V. Contract authority with Depositories
All public moneys coming under
control of the City Treasurer from
whatever source shall be deposited
no later than the next business day
in depositories which are eligible to
receive deposits in accordance with
Codified Ordinance 178 of the City;

24
which comply with the selection criteria outlined in Section III of this
Statement of Cash Management Policies and Procedures; and which
have been designated as depositories by the Director of Finance and
reviewed by City Council. The period of designation is for a period not
to exceed two (2) years.
Pursuant to Section 178 of the

facilities, safekeeping and custody
services, automated clearinghouse
(ACH) services, or other professionals services deemed necessary to
support the ongoing banking requirements of the City. The Director
of Finance may, from time to time,
issue a “request for services” to eligible depositories or eligible broker/dealers in regard to the procurement of the above-mentioned
financial services.
VI. Security for Deposits
Before the City Treasurer will initially deposit or continue to maintain a deposit in an eligible depository, the eligible depository shall be
required to pledge and deposit with
the City, or with a custodian, as
security for the repayment of all
public moneys so deposited, eligible
securities which have an aggregate
market value equal to 110% of the
aggregate amount of public moneys
which shall at anytime be so deposited.
Further, the City may require that
additional eligible securities be deposited to provide for any reduction,
which may occur in the market value
of any securities so deposited. Appendix F contains a sample safekeeping
agreement between the City, the eligible depository, and the typical
third party custodian.
A. Joint Custody Safekeeping by
the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland
The Federal Reserve Bank of
Cleveland (the “Fed”) offers a system by which the Fed itself may act
as the safekeeping agent for both
the City and the bank pledging the
collateral to secure City deposits.
Upon proper transfer by the pledging bank into a “joint custody
account,” the Fed will issue a joint
custody receipt to both the pledging
bank and the City. Thereafter, the
Fed will not release the securities
(for purposes of reassignment or liquidation) without the express consent of both parties.
The pledge and deposit of securities shall be consummated by direct
transfer
of
such
securities
so
pledged into a joint custody account
at the Federal Reserve Bank of
Cleveland in joint favor of the City
and the depositing bank.
Securities eligible for collateral
pledging against deposit are as follows:
1. Bills, Notes, or other obligations
of the United States; or bonds, notes,
or other obligations guaranteed as
to principal and interest by the United States or those to which the full
faith and credit of the United States
is pledged for the payment of principal and interest thereon, by language appearing in the instrument
specifically providing such guarantee or pledge and not merely by
interpretation or otherwise;

The City Record
2. Bonds, Notes, debenture, letters
of credit, or other obligations or
securities issued by any federal government agency, or instrumentality,
or the Export-Import Bank; bonds,
notes, or other obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by
the United States or those for which
the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged for the payment
of principal and interest thereon, by
interpretation or otherwise and not
by language appearing in the instrument specifically providing such
guarantee or pledge;
3. Obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or any federal
government
agency
or
instrumentality;
4. Obligations partially insured or
partially guaranteed by any federal
government agency or instrumentality;
5. Obligations fully guaranteed by
the Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Federal Farm
Credit Bank, or Student Loan Marketing Association;
6. Bonds and other obligations of
this state;
7. Bonds and other obligations of
any county, township, school district, municipal corporation, or other
legally constituted taxing subdivision of this state, which is not at
the time of such deposit, in default
in the payment of principal or interest on any of its bonds or other
obligations, for which the full faith
and credit of the issuing subdivision
is pledged.
Note: The City shall not accept as
eligible collateral securities, for purposes of this section, any securities
that are part of a pool of securities
as defined in Section 135.181 of the
Ohio Revised Code.
B. Safekeeping by Third-party
Custodians
1. A custody account located at a
third-party custodial bank may be
established between the City and
the eligible depository when a nonFederal Reserve Bank custodian is
desired.
2. Securities pledged against deposits in the custody account will
not be released (even if right of substitution provision exists) without
the express written consent of the
City Treasurer.
3. A Statement of Account document will be issued at least monthly to the City and eligible depositories describing all of the securities
pledged and held in the joint-custody account.
4. Securities eligible for collateral
pledging are as follows:
1. Bills, Notes, or other obligations
of the United States; or bonds, notes,
or other obligations guaranteed as
to principal and interest by the United States or those to which the full
faith and credit of the United States
is pledged for the payment of principal and interest thereon, by language appearing in the instrument
specifically providing such guarantee or pledge and not merely by
interpretation or otherwise;
2. Bonds, Notes, debenture, letters
of credit, or other obligations or
securities issued by any federal government agency, or instrumentality,
or the Export-Import Bank; bonds,
notes, or other obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by
the United States or those for which
the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged for the payment
of principal and interest thereon, by
interpretation or otherwise and not
by
language
appearing
in
the

550

April 6, 2005
instrument
specifically
providing
such guarantee or pledge;
3. Obligations fully guaranteed by
the United States or any federal government agency or instrumentality;
4. Obligations partially insured or
partially guaranteed by any federal
government agency or instrumentality;
5. Obligations of or fully guaranteed by the Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corporation, Federal
Farm Credit Bank, or Student Loan
Marketing Association;
6. Bonds and other obligations of
this state;
7. Bonds and other obligations of
any county, township, school district,
municipal corporation, or other legally constituted taxing subdivision of
this state, which is not at the time of
such deposit, in default in the payment of principal or interest on any
of its bonds or other obligations, for
which the full faith and credit of the
issuing subdivision is pledged.
Note: The City shall not accept as
eligible collateral securities, for purposes of this section, any securities
that are part of a pool of securities
as defined in Section 135.181 of the
Ohio Revised Code.
VII. Investment Policies and Procedures
The statement, “Investments . . .
shall be made with the exercise of
that judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which
persons of prudence, discretion and
intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not
for speculation, but for investment,
considering the probable safety of
their capital, as well as the probable income derived”, imposes a wide
variety of responsibilities upon the
Department
of
Finance.
These
responsibilities include, but are not
limited to:
1. The need for prudence and care
in the selection of appropriate
investment securities.
2. The need for rational criteria
for the selection of financial institutions and securities broker/dealers with whom the City conducts
business.
3. The goal of maximizing yield
from investments within the parameters of the other listed responsibilities.
To meet these responsibilities, the
Department of Finance has established the following policies and
procedures for investments:
A. Eligible Investments
In the daily management of its
portfolio, the City will typically only
invest in “money market instruments” which are very creditworthy,
highly liquid investments. Such investments will mature no more than
five years from the date of purchase. The City may purchase these
investments only through financial
intermediaries approved as eligible depositories or as eligible broker/dealer as defined in Section IV of the
Policy.
To the extent possible, the City
will attempt to match its investments with anticipated cash flow
requirements. Five-year maturities
(from the purchase date) shall be
the maximum term of any asset purchased by the City with the exception of assets purchased in order to
match the specific cash flows of construction funds, or similar “project”
proceeds whose distribution cash
flows are scheduled beyond the five
year term maximum. Such circumstances shall be the only ones

The City Record

April 6, 2005
deemed appropriate for the utilization of investment instruments with
maturities greater than five years.
Given the foregoing constraints,
the City Treasurer may invest funds
in the following securities:
1. Certificates of Deposits/Time
Deposits
Description: Fully insured and/or
fully collateralized depository instruments issued by designated eligible depositories.
Credit: FDIC insurance coverage
and/or eligible collateral as described in Codified Ordinance Section 178.11
Maturity Limit: Not to extend
beyond the current depository agreement expiration date with the particular eligible depository.
Investment Limit: 25% of public
moneys may be invested in this particular instrument.
2. U.S. Treasury Obligations

the U.S. Government.
Credit: Backed by the full faith
and credit of the U.S. Government
Maturity Limit: Five-years from
the purchase date.
Investment Limit: No limit as to
the percentage of public moneys
which may be invested in these
instruments as long as the maturity
does not exceed three years from
the date of purchase. No more than
10% of the average assets subject to
investment by the Treasurer may
have maturities greater than three
years and up to five-years. Of the
10% invested in maturities greater
than three years and up to five
years, no more than 20% may be
invested in callable securities.
3. U.S. Government Agencies or
Government
Sponsored
Corporation/Instrumentality Obligation.
Description: Securities issued by
Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA).
Credit: Backed by the full faith
and credit of the U.S. Government.
Maturity Limit: Three years from
the purchase date.
Investment Limit: 5% of public
moneys
4. Other U.S. Government Agencies.
Description: debt issues of:
Federal
Agricultural
Mortgage
Corporation (FAMC)
Federal Farm Credit Bank (FFCB)
Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB)
Federal
Home
Loan
Mortgage
Association (FHLMC)
Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA)
Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)
Credit: Implicitly backed by the
credit of the U.S. Government
Maturity Limit: Five-years from
the purchase date.
Investment Limit: No limit as to
the percentage of public moneys
which may be invested in these
instruments as long as the maturity
does not exceed three years from
the date of purchase. No more than
10% of the average assets subject to
investment by the Treasurer may
have maturities greater than three
years and up to five-years. Of the
10% invested in maturities greater
than three years and up to five
years, no more than 20% may be
invested in callable securities.
5. State Treasury Asset Reserve of
Ohio (Star Ohio)
Description: A statewide investment pool managed by the State
Treasurer of Ohio.

Credit: Must be rated AA or better.
Maturity Limit: Star Ohio shareholders may redeem shares on a
daily basis without penalty.
Investment Limit: A maximum of
75% of City public moneys may be
invested in StarOhio. In any case,
City of Cleveland public moneys
may comprise no more than 5% of
total StarOhio assets.
6. U.S. Government Money Market
Funds.
Description: An Open-ended investment company product registered
with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC). Objective must
be to maintain net asset value at
$1.00. Portfolios must be limited to
delivered repurchase agreements or
outright security purchases of U.S.
Treasuries or Agencies.
Credit: Must be AA or better.
Maturity Limit: Average portfolio
maturity may not exceed 120 days.
(The intent is to insure that money
market funds are utilized, not bonds
funds).
Investments Limit: 75% of public
moneys
7. Repurchase Agreement (Repo).
Description: A contractual transaction whereby an investor exchanges cash for temporary ownership or control of collateral securities from an issuer with an agreement between parties that, on a
future date, the insurer will repurchase the securities at a fixed price.
Credit: Collateral securities backed
by the full faith and credit of the
U.S. Government or by the full faith
and credit of the issuing Agency
such as FHLMC, FNMA, GNMA, etc.
Maturity Limit: One year or less
for the Repo investment. No Repo
maturity may extend beyond the
expiration date of an eligible depository’s agreement with the City.
Investment Limit: 75% of public
moneys
Note: Repo’s may be executed with
the dealer sections of eligible depositories or with eligible broker/dealers. Repurchase agreements underlying collateral securities will not
mature more than ten (10) years
from the repurchase (transaction)
date. (See Appendix C for the Master Repurchase Agreement)
B. Rate of Return Goals
The City’s goal is to obtain returns on eligible investments equivalent to the following:
Term:

Return Desired:

Overnight

Rate paid on overnight Federal Funds

All Other Terms Should yield at least
what could be earned
on U.S. Treasury Bills
or Notes of comparable maturity.
To the extent required by federal
tax laws applicable to the proceeds
of tax-exempt bonds, notes or other
obligations of the City, the investment yields on moneys in construction funds of other applicable funds
and accounts of the City may be
restricted to the yields permitted by
applicable federal tax laws upon the
advice of an Arbitrage advisor.
C. Procedures for delivery, possession, and safekeeping of securities
To ensure maximum protection,
the City has established delivery,
possession, and safekeeping procedures, which will be followed in
every case. The safekeeping proce-

551

25
dures are required so that the City
will obtain a perfected security
interest in the collateral, which
secures City deposits, or in the specific
security
purchased
in
an
investment transaction, or in securities purchased subject to the terms
of specific repurchase agreement.
Further, the safekeeping procedures
outlined below ensure compliance
with the requirements of Governmental Accounting Standards Board
(GASB) Statement 3.
1. Safekeeping Procedures
In general there are four types of
transactions, which require securities
safekeeping. The City anticipates
that all four transaction types can be
satisfactorily consummated by the receipt of either a safekeeping receipt
issued by the City’s safekeeping
agent and/or a Federal Reserve “joint
custody receipt”, or a safekeeping
receipt issued by a third-party custodian. These four transaction types
and the related safekeeping requirements are discussed below:
1. Purchase of book entry securities from eligible securities broker/dealer for the portfolio shall be
evidenced by a safekeeping receipt
issued by the City’s safekeeping
agent naming the City as owner of
the
securities.
The
safekeeping
agent may not provide securities
safekeeping services in cases in
which the safekeeping agent itself
is a principal or counterparty in the
investment
transaction.
In
such
cases, safekeeping documentation
similar to that described in the preceding paragraph must be provided
by a third-party custodian. Safekeeping may not be provided by any
parent or holding company bank,
which is financially related to any
institution, which is a principal in a
specific securities transaction. In
cases in which the City’s lead bank
merely executes the necessary wire
transfer services to support the
City’s investment transactions, and
is not a principal in the transaction,
the bank’s role is defined as that of
a “Settlement Agent” rather than
that of a “Counterparty” as defined
by the Governmental Accounting
Standards Board in Statement 3.
2. Purchase of book entry securities under the term of a master
repurchase agreement (the City’s
Master Repurchase Agreement is
included as Appendix C) shall be
held
in
the
same
manner
as
described in the preceding paragraph if the transaction is executed
with an eligible broker/dealer. The
safekeeping of securities underlying
repurchase agreements shall be executed by a custodian other than the
Repo counterparty. Such third-party
custodian shall be acceptable to the
City, and shall issue their own safekeeping receipts documenting the
complete status of the underlying
collateral securities.
3. Purchase of non-book entry
securities for the portfolio shall be
evidenced by a third-party custodian’s safekeeping receipt, subject to
requirements, which shall be at the
City’s discretion. However, the general intent of the City is to purchase
only wirable securities.
4. Purchases of non-book entry
under the terms of a Master Repurchase Agreement shall be held in
the same manner as described in the
preceding paragraph.
Securities, both wirable and physical, which are held as collateral
securing deposits in eligible depositories, whether time or demand
deposits, shall be held at the Federal Reserve Bank, or at third-party

26
custodians, and evidenced by joint
custody receipts and monthly statements.
All purchase and sale transactions
will be executed on a delivery vs.
payment, or payment vs. delivery
basis. In the absence of acceptable
payment or delivery, the City will
refuse to enter into or complete the
transaction.
2. Repurchase Agreement Procedures
Repurchase agreements will meet
the delivery criteria specified above,
and will be accompanied by an
acceptable margin of market value
of securities in excess of the principal amount of the investment. The
required margin amount (“margin
amount” is defined in the Terms and
Conditions of Master Repurchase
Agreement included in this policy as
Appendix C) will be established by
the City, and shall be specifically
addressed in a written master repurchase agreement, which supports the
repurchase transaction. In general,
the margin amount will increase in
direct proportion to the length of
maturity of the securities purchased
under the terms of the specific
repurchase agreement.
Further,
securities
purchased
under the terms of a specific repurchase agreement will have maturity
dates ten years or less and be wireable securities through the Federal
Reserve System. Any departures
from these maturity or wirability
standards shall require the written
authorization of the Director of
Finance.
In the absence of written authorization, the City will require the
following minimum ratios of market
value securities purchased, under
the terms of a specific repurchase
agreement, to the principal dollar
amount of such investments:
U.S. Treasury Bills, Notes and
Bonds, which mature in 1 year or
less: 101%;
U.S. Treasury Bills, Notes and
Bonds, which mature in 1 to 10
years: 102%;
U.S. Government Agency securities, which mature in 1 to 10 years:
102%;
The ratios of market value of
securities purchased to principal dollar amount of the investment will be
examined on a daily basis to ensure
that the margin does not drop below
minimum acceptable standards. In
cases of securities, which require
physical rather than book entry
delivery and safekeeping, the City
will require a higher ratio of securities to principal dollar amount of
the investment and the City must
specifically approve the acceptability of such securities.
As a general policy, the City will
accept underlying collateral, which
are wireable securities with maturities of 10 years or less. However, the
City may accept, at its discretion,
certain physical delivery and safekeeping
of
non-wirable
and/or
longer-term securities in keeping
with preceding requirements for the
ratio of the market value of securities to the principal dollar amount
of the investment.
8. Auctioning Investments Online
Procedures.
The Treasurer may use an internetbase auction site to solicit and purchase
short
and
long-term
investments from eligible banks and
broker/dealers for the City’s portfolio. The goal of the Investment Auction is to optimize the returns on

The City Record
each investment by comparing quotes
for multiple investment instruments;
U.S. Treasury Bills, Notes, Bonds,
CD’s and Repurchase Agreements
using a single bidding platform.
Treasurer will only accept quotes
that meet the City guidelines under
the Cash Management and Investment Policy Section VII-A “Eligible
Investments”. On a as needed basis,
the Treasurer will notify (fax, email) approved banks and broker
dealers of the City request for bids.
The banks and broker/dealers will
log into the site to submit their bids
and will not have access to the bid
from the other parties.
All bidders will have the opportunity to improve their bids; the site
will provide the bidders their ranking in the auction in real time and
at the end of the auction. The Treasurer will award the investment purchase at his/her discretion.
Further, all purchase and sale
transactions will be executed on a
delivery vs. payment, or payment vs.
delivery basis. In the absence of
acceptable payment or delivery, the
City will refuse to enter into or complete the transaction. All securities
purchased under this process will
have maturity dates five years or
less and be wireable securities
through the Federal Reserve System. Any departures from these
maturity or wirability standards
shall require the written authorization of the Director of Finance.
VIII. Reporting Requirements
A. Each business day, the Treasurer shall provide the Commissioner of Accounts and the City Controller a sworn statement showing
the total amount deposited in and
total amount withdrawn from each
depository from the preceding business day. (The Daily Treasurer’s
Report).
B. No later than the fifteenth business day of the following month, the
Treasurer shall provide the City
Controller with statements, which
will list the par and market value
of collateral held by the Federal
Reserve Bank of Cleveland and
third party custodians securing the
deposit of public moneys in eligible
depositories.
C. No later than the tenth business
day of the month, the Treasurer
shall make to the City Controller a
sworn statement which includes the
par and market value of outstanding investments; the average maturity of the investment portfolio, the
average yield on the investment
portfolio, the securities purchased
pursuant to repurchase agreements
and an analysis that the required
ratio of securities purchased to the
principal
dollar
amount
of
the
investment
in
each
repurchase
transaction was maintained as required by Section VII (B) (2) of this
Policy.
D. A weekly financial report of
the status of the City’s commingled
cash and investment position will be
provided to the Director of Finance
by the City Treasurer.
E. Quarterly commingled cash balance, interest income, and interest
rate forecast reports will be provided to the Director of Finance by the
City Treasurer.
F. An annual review of this policy shall be conducted by the Director of Finance and an annual submission of this document shall be
made to City Council. Eligible depositories and eligible broker/dealers shall receive notice of changes
to this document as well.

552

Treasurer, but not to direct his conduct of the division. Any recommendations of such board shall be

passed April 14, 1997, as amended,
relating
to
expending
Economic
Development Initiative Grant Funds
for the operation of the Empowerment Zone Business Opportunity
Program and to enter into contracts
under this program.
Whereas, the Empowerment Zone’s
economic development program is
predicated on assisting businesses
who typically have been excluded

conventional
lending
programs, both private and public, for
reasons that include lack of effective financial and management systems, past credit problems, lack of

BOP”) was created to meet unmet
needs of Empowerment Zone businesses; and
Whereas,
providing
one-on-one
technical assistance for those businesses is as important as providing
loans and rebates; and

of several approaches to address the
needs of small businesses; and
Whereas, the Empowerment Zone
provides four to six months of assistance to determine suitability of EZ
BOP assistance for those businesses;

one or more written requirement
contracts under the Charter and the

may be taken if desired by the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies
until provision is made for the

The Director of Public Service is
authorized to enter into one or more

instead of one year when there is a
financial advantage to the City. For
purposes of this ordinance, a financial advantage shall be determined

Bids shall also be taken so as to
permit an award to be made for provision of such services citywide or
by separate contracts for the districts determined by the Director of
Public Service.

and the performance of the term of
each contract. If a single bond
securing both execution and performance is required by the Director, it
shall be substantially in accordance
with the form attached as Exhibit
“A”. Each bond, whether to secure
the execution of a contract, its performance, or both, shall be in an
amount determined by the Director
of Public Service. Each bond submitted to secure the contract or contracts authorized by this ordinance
shall be executed by a surety authorized to do business in the State of
Ohio and shall be acceptable to the
