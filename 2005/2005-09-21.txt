An emergency resolution encouraging the Ohio General Assembly to
enact legislation that would establish excessive pricing of prescription drugs as a violation of State
law, establish penalties for such
excessive pricing, and provide a
cause of action for an aggrieved
party.
Whereas, prescription drugs are
the fastest growing health care expenditure in the United States; and

seniors reported skipping doses or
not filling prescriptions because of
the cost; and
Whereas, in 2002, the average
price of the top 50 drugs used by

the
world’s
highest
prescription
drug prices and that most Americans struggle to pay skyrocketing
prescription drug bills; and

has introduced a bill, and states
such as Vermont and Maine have
enacted bills, to prohibit excessive
prescription drug pricing; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

the payment of principal, redemption premium, if any, and interest
requirements on any outstanding
Bonds if, in the judgment of the
Director of Finance and the Director of Public Utilities, based on the
written advice of a financial advisor to the City, doing so will
improve the debt service coverage
ratio of Cleveland Public Power
(being the ratio of Adjusted Net
Revenues to Bond Service Charges,
as defined in the Indenture). The
Director of Finance is authorized to
deposit into an escrow fund, from
time to time, moneys transferred

Trustee of fees and expenses for
performance of its duties under the
agreement. The officer signing the
agreement on behalf of the City
shall determine that the agreement
satisfies the requirements of this
Section,

determination
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the agreement by the

September 21, 2005

authorized to take such other actions as may be necessary or appropriate to accomplish any defeasance under the Indenture of the
designated outstanding Bonds to be
paid from any escrow fund, including without limitation, the retention
of a firm of independent certified
public accountants to verify that the

sufficient, together with any available moneys, for the payment of
debt service on the designated outstanding Bonds.

expend up to $1,000,000 of tax remittances received from the general
fund prior to January 1, 2003 on the
cost in calendar year 2003 of replacing utility poles treated with copper
