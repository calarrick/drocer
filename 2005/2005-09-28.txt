FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES REFERRED
Ord. No. 1826-05.
By Council Members Coats and
Jackson (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Finance to enter
into an economic development agreement or agreements with the County of Geauga for the purpose of
charging an impact fee in exchange
for the City’s extension of water service to a portion of Bainbridge
Township.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland’s
Division of Water provides water
service to the County of Geauga
under master meter Water Service
Agreement No. 43866, entered into on
July 18, 1991, along with subsequent
amendments to expand the service
area; and
Whereas, the County of Geauga
has requested the Division of Water
to amend the service area contained
in the Water Service Agreement to
include a portion of Bainbridge
Township containing a commercial
development; and
Whereas, the expansion of water
service outside the City creates
opportunities for economic development in suburban communities by
enabling businesses to locate in that
community that might otherwise
have chosen to locate within the
City; and
Whereas, as a condition of expanding its current service area to
provide water to the portion of Bainbridge Township, the City wishes to
enter into an agreement with the
County of Geauga, to mitigate economic impacts to Cleveland’s General Fund for such expansion; and
Whereas, retaining existing water
customers and adding new customers through the expansion of the
Division of Water’s service area increases the rate base, promotes rate
stability, minimizes the need for
future rate increases, and improves
the Division of Water’s bond credit
rating, to the benefit of all Division
of Water customers and bondholders; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council finds
that expansion of water service outside the City creates opportunities
for economic development in suburban communities by enabling businesses to locate in that community
that might otherwise have chosen to
locate within the City.

Section 2. That the Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
an economic development agreement
or agreements with the County of
Geauga and other necessary public
authorities to charge an impact fee
to the County of Geauga to mitigate
economic impacts to Cleveland’s General Fund that may result from the
extension of water service to the
new portion of Bainbridge Township.
Section 3. The impact fee to be
charged shall be $4,000 for the first
year, and shall increase by 5% each
year for the remainder of the term
of the agreement.
Section 4. That the term of the
agreement shall run concurrently
with the term of master meter
Water Service Agreement No. 43866,
including any extensions, and shall
contain such terms and conditions
acceptable to the Director of Law.
Section 5. That all payments by
the County of Geauga under the
agreements authorized by this ordinance shall be deposited in the
City’s General Fund to be used for
economic development purposes.
Section 6. That the Director of
Public Utilities and the Director of
Finance are authorized to execute
on behalf of Cleveland all necessary
documents to effectuate the purposes of this ordinance.
Section 7. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Utilities, Finance, Law; Committees

Ord. No. 1827-05.
By Mayor Campbell.
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Public Utilities
to accept a grant of $400,000 from
Interstate Gas Supply to fund community outreach programs to inform
residents of energy-assistance benefits and conservation measures, and
to create jobs for Cleveland residents in home weatherization, and
authorizing the Director of Public
Utilities to enter into necessary contracts.
Whereas, dramatic increases in
natural gas prices will likely cause
the City’s residents to suffer recordhigh heating bills this winter; and
Whereas, it is critical for the City
to take all necessary steps to ensure
that the City’s residents are informed of and participate in all
available federal, state, and local
energy-assistance programs, to encourage residents to take all steps
possible to reduce their heating bills
through energy conservation, and to
provide job opportunities for Cleveland residents in home weatherization; and
Whereas, in consideration of the
City’s membership in the Northeast Ohio Public Energy Council
(NOPEC) gas aggregation program,
NOPEC’s gas supplier, Interstate Gas
Supply, pledged to grant the City
$400,000 to support economic development projects in the City; and
Whereas, the City has determined
that the funds to be provided by

2112

September 28, 2005
Interstate Gas Supply are urgently
needed to fund community outreach
activities to inform residents of available energy assistance programs and
energy conservation measures and to
create jobs for Cleveland residents in
home weatherization; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of

accept a grant in the amount of
$400,000 from Interstate Gas Supply
to fund community outreach activities to inform City residents of

receive the funds under the grant;
and that the funds are appropriated
for the purposes set forth in this
ordinance.
Section 2. That the Director of
Public Utilities is authorized to
employ by contract or contracts one
or more institutions, organizations,
agencies, or other consultants for
the purpose of supplementing the

for the City to conduct community
outreach programs to inform City
residents of available energy-assistance benefits and energy conservation measures, including but not limited to supplying, preparing, distributing, and mailing informational
and promotional materials, assisting
in communications with City residents and appropriate agencies, providing advertising and promotional
services and otherwise assisting in
the community outreach activities
contemplated by this ordinance, and
to create jobs for Cleveland residents in home weatherization. Such
consultants shall be selected from a
list of qualified consultants available for employment as may be
determined after a full and complete
canvass by the Director of Public
Utilities for the purpose of compiling a list. The compensation to be
paid for the services shall be fixed
by the Board of Control. The contract or contracts authorized by this
ordinance shall be prepared by the
Director of Law, approved by the
Director of Public Utilities, and certified by the Director of Finance.
Section 3. That the costs for the
expenditures under this ordinance
shall be paid from the fund or funds
to which are credited the proceeds
of the grant accepted through this
ordinance.
Section 4. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it

An emergency resolution supporting Ohio Senate Bill 13 which would

Whereas, stopping the hemorrhaging of Ohio jobs is critical to Ohio’s
economic and social vitality; and

assistance, including tax incentives,
loans or grants, for 5 years to
employers that have a net loss of
jobs due to the relocation of jobs

An emergency resolution encouraging the Ohio General Assembly to
enact legislation that would establish excessive pricing of prescription drugs as a violation of State
law, establish penalties for such
excessive pricing, and provide a
cause of action for an aggrieved
party.

The City Record
Whereas, prescription drugs are
the fastest growing health care expenditure in the United States; and
Whereas, in 2002, U.S. spending on
prescription drugs reached $162 billion; this number is projected to
reach $369 billion by 2010; and
Whereas, paying for prescription
drugs is extremely difficult for
many people in the United States,
including many Ohio citizens, especially those that are poor, chronically ill and elderly; and
Whereas, in 2001, nearly 1 in 4
seniors reported skipping doses or
not filling prescriptions because of
the cost; and
Whereas, in 2002, the average
price of the top 50 drugs used by
seniors was $1,500 per year; a senior
without
supplementary
insurance
taking
6
different
medications
would spend $9,000 per year out-ofpocket; and
Whereas, prices of the top 30
brand-name drugs increased by 22%
over the past 3 years; in 2003 prescription costs increased four times
the rate of inflation; and
Whereas, American drug companies spend more money on marketing and advertising than they do on
research
and
development
and
invest enormous sums of money into
“me too” drugs, which provide little
to no innovation but are simply variations of existing drugs; and
Whereas, extraordinarily generous tax breaks have helped the
pharmaceutical industry become the
richest industry in the United States;
and
Whereas, it is well known that
the citizens of the United States pay
the
world’s
highest
prescription
drug prices and that most Americans struggle to pay skyrocketing
prescription drug bills; and
Whereas, the District of Columbia
has introduced a bill, and states
such as Vermont and Maine have
enacted bills, to prohibit excessive
prescription drug pricing; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby encourages the Ohio General
Assembly to enact legislation that
would establish excessive pricing of
prescription drugs as a violation of
State law, establish penalties for
such excessive pricing, and provide
a cause of action for an aggrieved
party.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby directed to transmit certified
copies of this resolution Governor
Bob Taft and to the members of the
state legislature representing Cuyahoga County.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

An emergency resolution in support of Issues 2, 3, 4 and 5 which
would reform Ohio’s election laws to
restore faith, trust and confidence in
Ohio’s election system.
Whereas, on November 8, 2005,
several issues will be on the ballot
that, if passed, would reform Ohio’s
elections laws and restore faith
and trust in Ohio’s election system;
and
Whereas, Issue 2 makes voting
easier by allowing Ohioans to vote
early by mail or in person at any
time for any reason up to 35 days
before any election; and
Whereas, Issue 3 helps stops the
influence of big money in elections
by restoring reasonable limits on

Whereas, Issue 4 takes the politics out of drawing legislative districts and puts an independent commission in charge of the process
beginning in 2008; the commission
will focus on what is best for constituents, not politicians; and

of Ohio’s elections instead of a partisan official that backs candidates

Whereas, the above issues are

faith, trust and confidence in the
elections system in Ohio; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation

Section 3. Terms of Temporary
Bonds. The Temporary Bonds shall
be dated the date of issuance or
such other date as is designated in
the Certificate of Award but not
later than October 30, 2005. The
Temporary Bonds shall mature on a
date to be determined by the Director of Finance in the Certificate of
Award
in
accordance
with
the
Director of Finance’s determination
of the best interest of and financial
advantages to the City, provided
that such date shall not be later
than five years from the date of
issuance of the Temporary Bonds.
The Temporary Bonds shall bear
interest from their date at the rate
or rates per annum set forth in the
Certificate of Award, or if any Tem-

The City Record
porary Bonds bear interest at a variable rate, at the rate determined
pursuant to the method set forth in
the Certificate of Award. Interest on
the
Temporary
Bonds
shall
be
payable on the dates determined by
the Director of Finance in the Certificate of Award and until the principal amount is paid or payment is
provided for. If any Temporary
Bonds bear interest at a fixed rate
or rates, those rates shall not exceed
eight percent (8%) per year (computed on the basis of a 360-day year
consisting of twelve 30-day months)
and interest shall be payable not
more often than every six months

Bonds bear interest at a variable
rate or rates, those rates shall not
exceed that set forth below, and
interest shall be payable not more
often than once a month and following purchase and at maturity or
at any earlier redemption date.
In the event that the Director of
Finance based on the written advice
of the Financial Advisor determines
that the City’s best interests will be
served by causing all or a portion
of the Temporary Bonds to be obligations bearing interest at variable
rates, redeemable by the City without penalty or premium on interest
adjustment dates, then the Director
of Finance is authorized to so specify in the Certificate of Award. If
the Director of Finance so determines, then the Director of Finance
shall specify in the Certificate of
Award the method and procedure by
which the variable rate of interest
to be borne by the variable rate
Temporary Bonds shall be determined, whether by reference to a
market index, by a remarketing
agent or otherwise; provided that
the variable rate Temporary Bonds
shall not bear interest at a rate in
excess of sixteen percent (16%) per
annum; provided further that the
maximum interest rate for variable
rate Temporary Bonds during any
period those Temporary Bonds are
held by a provider of a Credit Support Instrument because they could
not be remarketed shall be twentyfive percent (25%). Holders of variable rate Temporary Bonds may be
given the right to tender their variable rate Temporary Bonds for purchase by the City at the times, on
the terms, and subject to the conditions set forth in the Certificate of
Award and any tender agreement;
provided that tender rights shall be
exercisable only at such times as a
Credit Support Instrument is in
place that provides for the payment
of the purchase price payable to the
tendering holder of a variable rate
Temporary Bond. If the Director of
Finance designates any Temporary
Bonds as variable rate Temporary
Bonds, and if the holders of the variable rate Temporary Bonds are to be
entitled to tender the variable rate
Temporary Bonds for purchase, then
the Director of Finance shall also
designate
in
the
Certificate
of
Award for those variable rate Temporary
Bonds
the
provider
or
providers for any Credit Support
Instrument, the tender agent or
agents and the remarketing agent
or agents, which designations shall
be based on the determination of the
Director of Finance that the parties
so designated possess the requisite
resources and experience to provide

2138

September 28, 2005
the services required of them and
that the terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide
such services are fair and commercially reasonable. The Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements in connection with the
delivery of the variable rate Temporary Bonds, and from time to time
thereafter so long as the variable
rate Temporary Bonds are outstanding with providers of Credit Support
Instruments, tender agents (which
may be the Registrar), remarketing
agents (which may be the Original
Purchaser), and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the method of
determining the variable interest
rates permitting holders the right of
tender, providing for liquidity or
credit support for the payment of
the variable rate Temporary Bonds
upon tender for purchase or redemption, and providing for the repayment by the City of any amounts
drawn under the Credit Support
Instrument.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of
the
Temporary
Bonds,
and
regardless of the Temporary Bonds
bearing interest at variable or fixed
rates, is authorized to contract for a
Credit Support Instrument and to
pay the costs of it from proceeds of
the Temporary Bonds, if the Director of Finance based on the written
advice of the Financial Advisor
determines that the Credit Support
Instrument will result in a savings
in the cost of this financing to the
City.

Charges on the Temporary Bonds.
The debt charges on the Temporary
Bonds shall be payable in lawful
money of the United States of America, or in Federal Reserve funds of
the United States of America as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance in the Certificate of Award,
and shall be payable, without deduction for the services of the Registrar as the City’s paying agent. If
agreed to by the Original Purchaser, the Temporary Bonds shall be
subject to redemption without penalty or premium at the option of the
City in whole or in part at any time
prior to maturity as provided in this
Ordinance and the Certificate of
Award.
If fewer than all of the Temporary Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Temporary Bonds of that maturity
to be redeemed, or portions thereof
in amounts of the minimum authorized denomination (as set forth in
Section 8 hereof) or any integral
multiple thereof, shall be made by
lot in a manner determined by the
Registrar. In the case of a partial
redemption of Temporary Bonds by
lot
when
Temporary
Bonds
of
denominations greater than the minimum authorized denomination are
then outstanding, each unit of principal thereof in the amount of the
minimum authorized denomination
shall be treated as if it were a separate Temporary Bond of the denomination of the minimum authorized
denomination. If it is determined
that one or more, but not all, of the
units of principal amount in the
amount of the minimum authorized
denomination represented by a Tem-

September 28, 2005
porary Bonds are to be called for
redemption, then, upon notice of
redemption of such unit or units, the
registered owner of that Temporary
Bond shall surrender the Temporary
Bond to the Registrar (i) for payment of the redemption price of such
unit or units of principal amount
called for redemption (including,
without
limitation,
the
interest
accrued
to
the
date
fixed
for
redemption), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner, of a new Temporary Bond or
Temporary Bonds of any authorized
denomination or denominations in
an
aggregate
principal
amount
equal to the unmatured and unredeemed portion of, and bearing
interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date as, the Temporary Bond surrendered.
The notice of the call for redemption of Temporary Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers, or other distinguishing marks,
the Temporary Bonds or portions
thereof to be redeemed, (ii) the
redemption price to be paid, (iii) the
date fixed for redemption, and (iv)
the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least 30
days prior to the date fixed for
redemption, to the registered owner
of each Temporary Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Register (as defined
in Section 5) maintained by the Registrar at the close of business on the
15th day preceding that mailing.
Failure to receive notice by mail or
any defect in that notice regarding
any Temporary Bond, however, shall
not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any
Temporary Bond.
In the event that notice of redemption shall have been given by the
Registrar to the registered owners
as provided above, there shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, moneys that, in addition to any other
moneys available therefor and held
by the Registrar, will be sufficient
to redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus accrued interest to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Temporary Bonds for
which notice of redemption has been
given. Notice having been mailed in
the manner provided in the preceding paragraph hereof, the Temporary Bonds and portions thereof
called for redemption shall become
due and payable on the redemption
date, and, upon presentation and
surrender thereof at the place or
places specified in that notice, shall
be paid at the redemption price, plus
accrued interest to the redemption
date. If moneys for the redemption
of all of the Temporary Bonds and
portions thereof to be redeemed,
together
with
accrued
interest
thereon to the redemption date, are
held
by
the
Registrar
on
the
redemption date, so as to be available therefor on that date and, if
notice
of
redemption
has
been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall

The City Record
be considered to be outstanding. If
those moneys shall not be so available on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Temporary
Bonds
and
portions
thereof shall continue to bear interest, until they are paid, at the same
rate as they would have borne had
they not been called for redemption.
All moneys held by the Registrar
for the redemption of particular
Temporary Bonds shall be held in
trust for the account of the registered owners thereof and shall be
paid to them, respectively, upon presentation and surrender of those
Temporary Bonds.
Section 5. Registrar. The Director
of Finance shall designate a bank
or trust company to act as the
authenticating
agent,
registrar,
transfer agent and paying agent for
the Temporary Bonds after determining that the payment at that
bank or trust company will not
endanger the funds or securities of
the City and that proper procedures
and safeguards are available for
that purpose (the “Registrar”). The
Director of Finance shall sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, a registrar agreement or
agreements between the City and
the Registrar (the “Registrar Agreement”) substantially in the form
contained in File No. 943-05-A, with
such changes as approved by the
Director of Law. In the event that a
trust agreement secures the Temporary Bonds, as provided in Section
10, the Registrar Agreement may be
incorporated in such trust agreement. The Director of Finance shall
provide for the payment of the services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant
to the Registrar Agreement from the
proceeds of the Temporary Bonds to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose.
The Temporary Bonds shall be
issued only as fully registered Temporary Bonds. Principal on the Temporary Bonds shall be payable when
due upon presentation and surrender
of the Temporary Bonds at the designated office of the Registrar designated in the Registrar Agreement.
Interest on each Temporary Bond
shall be paid on each interest payment date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Temporary Bond was registered,
and to that person’s address appearing on the Register (defined below
in this Section) at the close of business on the 15th day of the calendar month next preceding that interest payment date or such other date
established in the Certificate of
Award if variable rate Temporary
Bonds are issued. The City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange,
and transfer of Temporary Bonds as
provided in this Section (the “Register”) so long as any of the Temporary Bonds remain outstanding.
Subject to the provisions of this Section, the person in whose name a
Temporary Bond is registered on the
Register shall be regarded as the
absolute owner of that Temporary
Bond for all purposes of the Proceedings (except as may otherwise
be required with respect to the

2139

31
City’s continuing disclosure agreement pursuant to the Rule). Payment of or on account of the debt
charges on any Temporary Bond
shall be made only to or upon the
order of that person; neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be
affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Temporary Bond, including interest,
to the extent of the amount or
amounts so paid.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
and so long as the Temporary Bonds
are issued in a book entry system,
principal of and interest on the Temporary Bonds shall be payable in
the manner provided in any agreement entered into by the Director of
Finance, in the name and on behalf
of the City, in connection with the
book entry system.
Section 6. Transfer and Exchange
of Certain Temporary Bonds. Temporary Bonds may be exchanged for
Temporary Bonds of any authorized
denomination upon presentation and
surrender at the office designated
by the Registrar, together with a
request for exchange signed by the
registered owner or by a person
legally empowered to do so in a
form satisfactory to the Registrar. A
Temporary Bond may be transferred
only on the Register, upon presentation and surrender of the Temporary Bond at the office designated
by the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner
or
by
a
person
legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer, the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate, and
deliver a new Temporary Bond or
Temporary Bonds, of any authorized
denomination or authorized denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Temporary Bond surrendered and bearing interest at the same rate and
maturing on the same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Temporary Bonds only
after the new Temporary Bonds are
signed by the authorized officers of
the City. In all cases of Temporary
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Temporary Bonds in accordance with the
provisions of the Proceedings. The
exchange or transfer shall be without charge to the owner, except that
the City and Registrar may make a
charge sufficient to reimburse them
for any tax or other governmental
charge required to be paid with
respect to the exchange or transfer.
The City or the Registrar may
require that those charges, if any,
be paid before the procedure is
begun for the exchange or transfer.
All Temporary Bonds issued and
authenticated upon any exchange or
transfer shall be valid special obligations of the City, evidencing the
same obligation, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under the
proceedings,
as
the
Temporary
Bonds
surrendered
upon
that
exchange or transfer. Neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be

32
required to make any exchange or
transfer of a Temporary Bond during the period beginning at the
opening of business 15 days before
the day of the mailing of a notice
of redemption of Temporary Bonds
and ending at the close of business
on the day of such mailing or to
transfer or exchange any Temporary Bond selected for redemption in
whole or in part.
Section 7. Book Entry. Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this Ordinance, if it is determined
by the Director of Finance to be in
the best interest of and financially
advantageous to the City, the Temporary Bonds may be issued in book
entry form in accordance with the
provisions of this Section.
The Temporary Bonds may be
issued to a Depository for use in a
book entry system and, if and as
long as a book entry system is utilized, (i) the Temporary Bonds may
be issued in the form of a single,
fully registered Temporary Bond
representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered
owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository; (ii) the book
entry interest owners of Temporary
Bonds in book entry form shall have
no
right
to
receive
Temporary
Bonds in the form of physical securities or certificates; (iii) ownership
of book entry interests in book
entry form shall be shown by book
entry on the system maintained and
operated by the Depository and its
participants, and transfers of the
ownership of book entry interests
shall be made only by book entry
by the Depository and its Participants;
and
(iv)
the
Temporary
Bonds as such shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for
transfer to another Depository or to
another nominee of a Depository,
without further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Temporary Bonds for use in
a book entry system, the Director of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Director of Finance, after
making provision for notification of
the book entry interest owners by
the then Depository and any other
arrangements
deemed
necessary,
shall permit withdrawal of the Temporary Bonds from the Depository,
and authenticate and deliver certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance also is
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the Temporary Bonds, after determining
that the signing thereof will not
endanger the funds or securities of
the City and after the approval of
the form of any such agreement by
the Director of Law.
Section 8. Execution of Temporary
Bonds. Temporary Bonds shall be
signed by the Mayor and the Direc-

The City Record
tor of Finance, in the name of the
City and in their official capacities,
provided that either or both of those
signatures may be a facsimile, and
shall bear the seal of the City or a
facsimile thereof; provided that no
Temporary Bond shall be valid or
obligatory for any purpose or shall
be entitled to any security or benefit under the Proceedings unless and
until the certificate of authentication printed on the Temporary Bond
is signed by the Registrar as
authenticating agent, and authentication by the Registrar shall be conclusive evidence that the Temporary
Bond so authenticated has been duly
issued, signed and delivered under
and is entitled to the security and
benefit of the Proceedings. The certificate of authentication may be
signed by any authorized officer or
employee of the Registrar or by any
other person acting as an agent of
the Registrar and approved by the
Director of Finance on behalf of the
City. The same person need not sign
the certificate of authentication on
all of the Temporary Bonds.
Pursuant to Section 83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
shall prepare the Temporary Bonds
and
shall
endorse
thereon
her
approval of the form and correctness
thereof by her manual or facsimile
signature. The Temporary Bonds
shall be issued in the denominations
as requested by the Original Purchaser and approved by the Director
of Finance, in conformity with this
Ordinance.
The
entire
principal
amount may be represented by a single bond certificate and may be
issued as fully registered securities
and in book entry or other uncertificated form if it is determined by
the
Director
of
Finance
that
issuance of fully registered securities in that form will facilitate the
sale and delivery of the Temporary
Bonds. The Temporary Bonds may
be issued in the authorized denominations of either (a) $100,000 each
or in any denomination that is the
sum of (i) $100,000 and (ii) $5,000 or
any integral multiple thereof, and
not exchangeable for other Temporary Bonds in denominations less
than $100,000, or (b) $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, as determined by the Director of Finance in
the Certificate of Award to be in the
best interest of the City. The Temporary Bonds shall not have coupons
attached, shall be numbered as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance and shall express upon
their faces the purpose, in summary
terms, for which they are issued and
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 9. Sale of Temporary
Bonds. The Temporary Bonds shall
be sold at not less than 97% of par
plus accrued interest at private sale
by the Director of Finance to the
Original Purchaser in accordance
with law and the provisions of this
Ordinance. If, in the reasonable
opinion of the Director of Finance,
an underwriter is incapable of fully
performing its duties or meeting its
obligations in its capacity as Original Purchaser with respect to the
Temporary Bonds, the Director of
Finance is hereby authorized and
directed, in the name of and on
behalf of the City, to take whatever action may be necessary to terminate that underwriter’s standing

2140

September 28, 2005
as Original Purchaser. The Director
of Finance shall sign the Certificate
of Award referred to in this Ordinance, evidencing the sale to the
Original Purchaser, cause the Temporary Bonds to be prepared, and
have the Temporary Bonds signed
and delivered, together with a true
transcript of proceedings with reference to the issuance of the Temporary Bonds if requested by the
Original Purchaser, to the Original
Purchaser upon payment of the purchase price. The Director of Finance
is authorized to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
a bond purchase agreement between
the City and the Original Purchaser, or representative thereof (the
“Purchase Agreement”), in substantially the form contained in the file
referenced above with such changes
therein not inconsistent with the
terms of this Ordinance and not substantially adverse to the City as
approved by the Director of Finance
and Director of Law, such approval
to be conclusively evidenced by the
execution of the Purchase Agreement by such officers. The Director
of Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and
for
reimbursement
of
expenses
incurred pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement from the proceeds of the
Temporary Bonds to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or as may be appropriated for that purpose. The Mayor, the
Director of Finance, the Clerk of
Council, the Director of Law, and
other City officials, as appropriate,
are each authorized and directed to
sign
any
transcript
certificates,
financial statements and other documents and instruments and to take
such actions as are necessary or
appropriate
to
consummate
the
transactions contemplated by this
Ordinance.
Section 10. Security for the Temporary Bonds. The Temporary Bonds
shall be special obligations of the
City, and the debt charges on the
Temporary Bonds shall be payable
solely from the Revenues and the
Nontax Revenues. The Payment of
debt charges on the Temporary
Bonds is secured by a pledge of and
lien on (i) the Revenues and (ii) the
Nontax Revenues which are on
deposit in the Urban Renewal Debt
Retirement Fund created below. The
Temporary Bonds are not and shall
not be secured by an obligation or
pledge of any money raised by taxation. The Temporary Bonds do not
and shall not represent or constitute
a debt or pledge of the faith and
credit or taxing power of the City,
and the owners thereof have and
shall have no right to have taxes
levied by the City for the payment
of debt charges thereon. The Temporary Bonds shall contain a statement to that effect and to the effect
that
the
Temporary
Bonds
are
payable solely from the Revenues
and the Nontax Revenues and are
not secured by an obligation or
pledge of any money raised by taxation.
The City covenants and agrees
that while the Temporary Bonds are
outstanding, it will appropriate and
maintain Nontax Revenues at such
times and in such amounts as will
be sufficient, together with the Revenues and any other funds available

September 28, 2005
or to be available for the purpose
(including proceeds of refunding
obligations),
to
pay
the
debt
charges on the Temporary Bonds
and will so restrict other obligations
payable from Nontax Revenues prior
to or on a parity with the Temporary Bonds as will ensure the continuing availability for appropriation of sufficient Nontax Revenues
to pay debt charges when due,
which Nontax Revenues are hereby
selected by the City pursuant to Section 725.05(C) 725.07 of the Revised
Code as moneys that are not raised
by taxation.
There is hereby created by the
City a separate fund or account designated as the “Urban Renewal Debt
Retirement Fund” (the “Debt Retirement Fund”) into which shall be
deposited (i) the Revenues upon
receipt, and (ii) other Nontax Revenues, and any other funds available for the purpose, on or prior to
the date debt charges on the Temporary Bonds are due, in an amount
sufficient to pay those debt charges.
Any Revenues remaining after payment or provision for payment, of
all debt charges on the Temporary
Bonds shall be deposited to the
extent not otherwise pledged or
encumbered in the Housing Trust
Fund (Fund No. 14 SF 027).
Nothing herein shall be construed
as requiring the City to use or apply
to the payment of debt charges on
the Temporary Bonds any funds or
revenues from any source other than
the Revenues and the Nontax Revenues.
Nothing
herein,
however,
shall be deemed to prohibit the City,
of its own volition, from using, to
the extent that it is authorized by
law to do so, any other resources for
the fulfillment of any of the terms,
conditions or obligations of this
Ordinance or of the Temporary
Bonds.
The City will, solely from the proceeds of the Temporary Bonds or
from the Revenues or the Nontax
Revenues, pay or cause to be paid
the debt charges on the Temporary
Bonds on the dates, at the places
and in the manner provided herein
and in the Temporary Bonds. For
that purpose, in each year while the
Temporary Bonds are outstanding,
this Council, after providing for the
payment of debt charges payable on
the City’s general obligation securities in that year from sources available for that purpose, will appropriate Nontax Revenues required to
pay, and for the purpose of paying
the debt charges due in that year on
the Temporary Bonds and any outstanding parity obligations payable
from Nontax Revenues. Further, this
Council will give effect to such
appropriations in all ordinances it
passes thereafter in that year appropriating money for expenditure and
encumbrance and limit the other
appropriations of Nontax Revenues
in that year to the amount available
after deducting the amount required
for the payment of debt charges
payable on the City’s general obligation securities and to pay those
debt charges. The City covenants
that, so long as any of the Temporary Bonds are outstanding, it shall
not issue any additional obligations
payable from the Nontax Revenues
on a parity with the Temporary
Bonds and any outstanding parity
obligations payable from Nontax
Revenues, unless, prior to passage

The City Record
of the ordinance authorizing such
parity obligations, the Director of
Finance shall have certified to this
Council that the Nontax Revenues
during the preceding calendar year,
adjusted to reflect, if necessary,
changes in the rates or charges
resulting in the Nontax Revenues,
aggregate in amount not less than
100% of the highest amount of (a)
debt charges on the Temporary
Bonds to be paid from Nontax Revenues and (b) required payments on
such proposed parity obligations
and any outstanding parity obligations due in any succeeding calendar year.
Each
obligation
of
the
City
required to be undertaken pursuant
to this Ordinance and the Temporary Bonds is binding upon the City,
and upon each officer or employee
of the City as may from time to time
have the authority under law to
take any action on behalf of the
City as may be necessary to perform
all or any part of such obligation as
a duty of the City and of each of
those officers and employees resulting from an office, trust or station
within
the
meaning
of
Section
2731.01 of the Revised Code, providing for enforcement by writ of mandamus.
In the event that the interest on
the Temporary Bonds is to be provided for from Temporary Bond proceeds, or if in the judgment of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of the Financial
Advisor, a debt service reserve to
secure the Temporary Bonds is in
the best interest of and financially
advantageous to the City, the City
shall enter into a trust agreement
with the bank or trust company
serving as Registrar for the Temporary Bonds and providing for the
Debt Retirement Fund or a debt service reserve fund, as applicable, to
be held by that bank or trust company, in its capacity as trustee, and
such fund or funds are hereby
authorized. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, the trust
agreement in a form consistent with
this Ordinance and approved by the
Director of Law. The Mayor and the
Director of Finance and other City
officials, as appropriate, are authorized to take such actions as are
necessary or appropriate to consummate such additional security for
the Temporary Bonds. The City
hereby covenants and agrees to
appropriate annually from the Revenues and the Nontax Revenues into
any such funds amounts sufficient
to maintain the balances required
by the trust agreement and to
restore any deficiency therein.
Section 11. Deposit of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Temporary Bonds are appropriated
and shall be used for the purpose
for which the Temporary Bonds are
being issued. The proceeds from the
sale of the Temporary Bonds (exclusive of amounts to be used to pay
Financing Costs which shall be
deposited in a separate Costs of
Issuance Account) shall be deposited in the Debt Retirement Fund to
be used to refund the Prior Bonds
Series 2003 and, if applicable, to pay
interest on the Temporary Bonds;
provided that any portion of the proceeds of the Temporary Bonds to be
used to make a required deposit to

2141

33
a debt service reserve fund shall be
paid into the debt service reserve
fund created pursuant to Section 10.
Any premium not used to pay costs
of issuance and accrued interest
received from the sale of the Temporary Bonds shall be deposited in
the Debt Retirement Fund.
Section 12. Disclosure. If, in the
judgment of the Director of Finance,
after consultation with the Financial Advisor and the Original Purchaser, an official statement or
other disclosure document is appropriate relating to the initial offering
of the Temporary Bonds, the Director of Finance, on behalf of the City
and in that officer’s official capacity, is authorized to (i) cooperate
with the Original Purchaser in the
preparation of, and the making of
modifications,
completions
or
changes of or supplements to, such
a disclosure document, (ii) determine, and to certify or otherwise
represent, when the disclosure document is to be deemed final or is
final, (iii) authorize the use and distribution of that disclosure document and any supplements thereto
in connection with the initial offering of the Temporary Bonds, (iv)
notwithstanding the requirements
of, and as an exception to, Codified
Ordinance 177.01(a), contract with a
printer to print the Official Statement, and (v) sign certificates,
statements or other documents in
connection with the finality, accuracy, and completeness of that disclosure document.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Temporary Bonds, the City
agrees, as the only obligated person
with
respect
to
the
Temporary
Bonds under the Rule, to provide or
cause to be provided such financial
information
and
operating
data,
audited financial statements and
notices, in such manner as may be
required for purposes of paragraph
(b)(5)(i) of the Rule. In order to
describe and specify certain terms
of the City’s continuing disclosure
agreement for that purpose and
thereby to implement that agreement,
including
provisions
for
enforcement, amendment, and termination, the Director of Finance is
authorized to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
and if required under the Rule, a
Continuing Disclosure Certificate or
Certificates in conformance with the
reporting requirements of the Rule.
The agreement formed collectively,
by this paragraph and that Certificate, shall be the City’s continuing
disclosure agreement for purposes
of the Rule, and its performance
shall be subject to the annual appropriation of any funds that may be
necessary to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of the
occurrence of any other events, the
Director of Finance shall consult
with, as appropriate, the legal counsel and bond or other qualified independent special counsel to the City.
The Director of Finance, acting in
the name and on behalf of the City,

34
shall be entitled to rely upon any
legal advice provided by any such
counsel in determining whether a
filing should be made.
Section 13. Ratings, Insurance,
and Other Credit Enhancement. If,
in the judgment of the Director of
Finance after consultation with the
Financial Advisor, the filing of an
application for a rating on the Temporary Bonds by one or more nationally recognized rating agencies or a
Credit Support Instrument is in the
best interest of, and financially
advantageous to the City, the Director of Finance is authorized to prepare and submit those applications,
to provide to each such agency, company or credit provider such information as may be required for the
purpose. The cost of obtaining each
rating and Credit Support Instrument, except to the extent paid by
the Original Purchaser in accordance with the Purchase Agreement,
shall be paid from the proceeds of
the Temporary Bonds.
Section 14. Interest Rate Swaps,
Hedges and Caps. For the purpose
of achieving the optimal available
debt structure for the Temporary
Bonds, the Director of Finance may,
based on the written advice of the
Financial Advisor, enter into one or
more agreements in connection with
or subsequent to the issuance of the
Temporary Bonds for an interest
rate swap, an interest rate cap or
other such arrangement to lower the
effective interest rate on the obligation to the City or, to hedge the
exposure of the City against fluctuations in prevailing interest rates,
provided, however, that: (i) the debt
structure that is simulated through
the combination of the Temporary
Bonds with any such agreements
shall comply with the restrictions of
this Ordinance on the terms of and
security for the Temporary Bonds
applied to that structure as though
it consisted solely of Temporary
Bonds; (ii) the counterparty to any
swap agreement and the provider of
any interest rate cap shall have a
rating of at least “A” by either
Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard & Poor’s Corporation; (iii)
no such agreement shall purport to
entitle
the
counterparty
to
the
agreement to payment by the City
from any source other than the
sources which secure the Temporary
Bonds as described in this Ordinance; and (iv) the cost of obtaining any such interest rate cap or
other such arrangement shall have
been determined by the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of the Financial Advisor, to
be justified by the corresponding
benefit to the City and to be commercially reasonably based on then
current
market
conditions.
The
notional amount on which any such
agreement is based shall not be subject to the limitations set forth herein
on
the
maximum
principal
amount of the Temporary Bonds.
Section 15. Covenants. In the event
that
the
Temporary
Bonds
are
issued and sold as obligations bearing interest that is excluded from
gross income for federal income tax
purposes, the covenants in this Section 15 shall govern. However, if the
Temporary Bonds are issued and
sold as obligations bearing interest

The City Record
that is included in gross income for
federal income tax purposes, the
City shall not be bound by the
covenants
of
this
Section
with
respect to the Temporary Bonds.
Subject to the foregoing, the City
covenants that it will use and will
restrict the use and investment of,
the proceeds of the Temporary
Bonds in such manner and to such
extent as may be necessary so that
(a) the Temporary Bonds will not
(i) constitute private activity bonds,
arbitrage bonds or hedge bonds
under Sections 141, 148 or 149 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”) or (ii) be
treated other than as bonds to which
Section 103(a) of the Code applies,
and (b) the interest on the Temporary Bonds will not be treated as an
item of tax preference under Section
57 of the Code. The City further
