Res. No. 2044-05.
By Council Members Coats, Jackson and White.
An emergency resolution remembering Rosa Parks and the sacrifices that she made in advancing
civil rights and designating December 1, 2005 as “Rosa Parks Day”.
Whereas, Rosa Louise McCauley
was born on February 4, 1913 in
Tuskegee, Alabama to James McCauley, a carpenter, and Leona
McCauley, a school teacher; and
Whereas, at the age of 11, Rosa
enrolled in the Montgomery Industrial School for Girls and later at
Alabama State Teachers College;
and
Whereas, at the age of twenty,
Rosa married a barber named Raymond Parks; and
Whereas, on December 1, 1955,
Rosa Parks refused to give up her
bus seat to a white passenger in
Montgomery, Alabama, resulting in
her arrest; and
Whereas, Rosa Parks’ defiance
triggered the famous Montgomery
bus boycott and earned her the title
“Mother of the Civil Rights Movement”; and
Whereas, the 382 day boycott introduced the world to Reverend Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr. who was
President of the Montgomery Improvement Association and the boycott spokesperson; and
Whereas, the federal district court
on June 4, 1956, ruled bus segregation unconstitutional; and
Whereas, Rosa Parks and her husband,
Raymond
Parks,
in
1957
moved to Detroit, Michigan where
Rosa served on the staff of United
States Representative John Conyers;
and
Whereas, the Southern Christian
Leadership Council later established
an annual Rosa Parks Freedom
Award in her honor; and
Whereas, Rosa Parks founded the
Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute
for Self-Development to offer guidance to young African-Americans;
and
Whereas, President Clinton presented Rosa Parks with the Congressional Medal of Freedom in
1995; and
Whereas, Rosa Parks died on
October 24, 2005 at the age of 92; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby remembers Rosa Parks and the
sacrifices that she made in advancing civil rights.
Section 2. That this Council hereby designates December 1, 2005 as
“Rosa Parks Day”.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it

2393

9
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted October 31, 2005.
Effective November 2, 2005.

Res. No. 2047-05.
By Council Members Jackson and
Sweeney.
An emergency resolution supporting and encouraging full participation in the Automotive Industry
Summit and supporting efforts to
protect the American automotive
industry.
Whereas, community response to
local industries in crisis and threatened with closure, such as hospitals,
steel mills, the defense finance
agency, and NASA, have resulted in
a community response changing the
direction of industry action; and
Whereas, Cleveland’s local economy is dependent on the automotive
industry; and
Whereas, the nation’s automotive
industry is in crisis as signified by
the
Delphi
bankruptcy,
General
Motor’s proposed cut in health benefits to its workers, and Ford’s projected cutbacks; and
Whereas, all of these occurrences
could have a negative impact on
Cleveland’s automotive industry; and
Whereas, the federal, state, county, and local governments need to
support the automotive industry and
its workers; and
Whereas,
automotive
industry
jobs are important to the local and
national economy; and
Whereas, GM Canada and Ford
Canada are in a stronger position
because the Canadian government
provides universal health care to all
of its citizens, including automotive
industry workers; and
Whereas, even though many local
automotive industry jobs are located in the suburbs of the City of
Cleveland, many automotive workers live in the City of Cleveland and
many jobs related to the automotive
industry are in the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, many of the problems
facing the automotive industry are
the result of the deindustrialization
of our nation and are frequently
beyond the jurisdiction of local governments; and
Whereas, as a result of deindustrialization and the loss of important manufacturing jobs in the automotive industry and other industries, our standard of living is
decreasing, families encounter more
challenges,
and
today’s
young
adults are not as financially secure
as the preceding generation; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
the State of Ohio, and the United
States of America have a workforce
second to none; and
Whereas, today’s work force, like
previous generations, needs health
care; and
Whereas, today’s seniors and retirees need health care; and
Whereas, corporate pensions are
being reduced or eliminated by corporate bankruptcies and cutbacks;
and
Whereas, the Pension Benefits
Guaranty Corporation is being tapped out; and
Whereas, when the automotive
industry fails, other industries are
negatively impacted; and

10
Whereas, our country cannot survive without manufacturing; and
Whereas, the United States lacks,
but needs, a manufacturing policy,
and
Whereas, the automotive, steel,
and aerospace industries are essential to national security; and
Whereas, on October 25, 2005, Congressman Dennis Kucinich convened
the Automotive Industry Summit to
draw attention to the plight of local
workers and the state of the automotive industry and to bring together those impacted by current trends
with government officials at the
local, county, state, and federal levels in a bipartisan and nonpartisan
manner to address these issues; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports and encourages full participation in the Automotive Industry
Summit and supports efforts to protect the American automotive industry as such efforts will enable
Clevelanders, Ohioans, and Americans to find and keep good jobs in
the U.S. automotive industry.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted October 31, 2005.
Effective November 2, 2005.

time, and provide for the making of
service payments in lieu of taxes by
the owner of such parcels, and
establish a municipal public improvement tax increment equivalent
fund into which such service payments shall be deposited; and

The City Record
Whereas, a residential and commercial development has been proposed (the “Project”) to be located
on the parcels and in the area
described in File No. 1645-05-C (that
area, as the parcels therein are consolidated or subdivided and as existing streets are vacated, is hereinafter referred to as the “Property,”
excluding the portions thereof to be
part of public streets and parks
otherwise exempt from property taxation); and
Whereas, this Council desires to
construct or cause the construction
of
the
public
infrastructure
improvements described and placed
in the above-mentioned file (the
“Public Improvements”) that once
made will directly benefit the Property; and
Whereas, the City has determined
that it is necessary and appropriate
and in the best interests of the City
to provide for service payments in
lieu of taxes with respect to the

of the Revised Code (the “Service
Payments”); and

the School District has approved the
real property tax exemption provided for in this Ordinance and has
waived notice requirements on the
condition that a compensation agreement be entered into, as provided

and
Whereas, the City desires that the
Cleveland Cuyahoga County Port
Authority (the “Port Authority”)
and/or the City and other governmental

providing for the City’s transfer of
the portion of the Service Payments
not otherwise paid to the School District; and

blighted conditions and prevent the
recurrence of blight and as a result,
