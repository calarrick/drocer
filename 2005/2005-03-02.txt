By
Council
Members
Brady,
White, Britt, Polensek, O’Malley,
Pierce
Scott,
Sweeney,
Jackson,
Zone, Lewis, Westbrook, Coats and
Cintron.
An emergency resolution encouraging the United States Congress to
first commit to paying back to the
Social Security Trust Fund all of the
money it borrowed from the fund;
encouraging the United States Congress to carefully study potential
changes to the Social Security system; encouraging the United States
Congress to adopt changes that
strengthen Social Security’s family
income protections; and encouraging
the United States Congress to reject
proposals that would divert money
out of Social Security and into private accounts.
Whereas, Social Security’s income
protections,
guaranteed,
lifelong
benefits, cost-of-living adjustments
to guard against inflation, increased
benefits for families, greater income
replacement for low-income workers,
and disability and survivor benefits,
are the backbone of retirement security and family protection in the
United States; and
Whereas, Social Security provides
crucial, often indispensable income
protection for the 47 million individuals, one of every six Americans,
receiving benefits; and
Whereas, Social Security is the
nation’s most successful and most
important family income protection
program, but is has long-term funding needs that need to be addressed;
and
Whereas, some policymakers propose to address these needs by cutting guaranteed benefits and privatizing Social Security, that is,
diverting a third or more of workers’ payroll tax contributions out of
the Social Security Trust Fund and
into private investment accounts;
and
Whereas, privatization will worsen Social Security’s funding needs
by draining resources from the
Trust Fund into private accounts,
increasing the federal deficit by two
trillion dollars over the first decade
alone and more in the future and
putting the United States deeper in
debt to foreign creditors; and
Whereas, some officials and members of Congress have suggested the
federal government will not pay
back money it has taken from the
Social Security Trust Fund over the
past twenty years and used for
other things, thereby denying working families the money they paid
into Social Security and leading to
further benefit cuts; and
Whereas, privatizing Social Security will cut guaranteed benefits by
thirty percent (30%) for young
workers, even for those who do not
participate
in
private
accounts,
denying them benefits they have
earned and imperiling their economic security; and
Whereas, cutting guaranteed benefits will hurt the elderly because
Social Security is the only secure
source of retirement income for most
Americans, providing at least half
the income of nearly two-thirds of
older American households and lifting more than eleven million seniors
out of poverty; and
Whereas, cutting guaranteed benefits will hurt women and people of
color, as they are more likely than
white men to rely on Social Securi-

The City Record
ty for most of their retirement
income, they earn less money than
white men and are, therefore, less
able to save for retirement, and they
are less likely than white men to
receive job-based pensions in retirement; and
Whereas, diverting resources from
Social
Security
to
fund
private
accounts will threaten guaranteed
survivor
and
disability
benefits,
thus harming working families, particularly
African
Americans,
as
roughly one in five workers dies
before retiring and nearly three in
ten become too disabled to work
before reaching retirement age; and
Whereas, privatizing Social Security will burden state and local governments, as cuts in guaranteed benefits will increase demands for public assistance at the very moment
growth in the federal deficit due to
privatization induces the federal
government to shit greater responsibilities onto state and local governments; and
Whereas, Congress should not
rush through drastic and damaging
changes in Social Security that
undermine its family income protections, but instead, should take the
time needed to develop careful and
thoughtful
reforms
that
address
Social Security’s funding needs without slashing benefits or exploding
the deficit; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
encourages the United States Congress to first commit to paying back
to the Social Security Trust Fund all
of the money it borrowed from the
Security Fund.
Section
2.
That
this
Council
encourages the United States Congress to carefully study a variety of
potential changes that will address
Social Security’s problems in a manner that ensures the Social Security
program will continue to meet its
purpose of providing income protection
and
economic
security
for
America’s families.
Section
3.
That
this
Council
encourages the United States Congress
to
adopt
changes
that
strengthen Social Security’s family
income protections without slashing
guaranteed benefits and increasing
the deficit.
Section
4.
That
this
Council
encourages the United States Congress to reject proposals that would
divert money out of Social Security
and into private accounts.

An emergency resolution urging
the United States Congress to reject
any budget reduction and reconciliation process for fiscal year 2006
related to Medicaid reform or other
domestic
discretionary
programs
that shift additional costs to the
states and cities and/or result in
cuts in services; urging the United
States Congress to reject any cap on
federal funding for the Medicaid
program; and urging the United
States Congress to adopt a balanced
approach to deficit reduction.
Whereas, the budget proposal sent
to Congress by President George W.
Bush includes a five year cap on discretionary spending that requires
more than $2.5 billion in discretionary spending cuts in Ohio; and

The City Record
Whereas, the President’s budget
for Medicaid proposes a $60 billion
reduction in Medicaid spending over
the next ten years; and
Whereas, the Medicaid program
provides access to health care for
Cleveland’s most vulnerable citizens, including low-income children,
parents, pregnant women, people
with disabilities, and senior citizens;
and
Whereas, the discretionary and
mandatory spending cuts proposed
by the President will impact the
people of Cleveland in numerous
negative ways; and
Whereas, such negative impacts
will affect educational programs,
community development programs,
health care services, child care services, services for abused children,
environmental protections, energy
assistance programs, juvenile justice, veterans benefits, vocational
education, law enforcement, HIV/
AIDS treatment, and many others;
and
Whereas, it is unfair to place the
burden of deficit reduction entirely
on domestic programs; and
Whereas, in addition to the proposed domestic program cuts, the
President and some Members of Congress are advocating to make the
temporary tax cuts passed in 2001
and 2003 permanent and are proposing the implementation of a new
round of tax cuts; and
Whereas, these tax cuts benefit
wealthier Americans; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of

Section 1. That this Council urges

An emergency resolution opposing
the Clear Skies Act of 2005 as it
would limit the states’ authority to
regulate local air quality and pursue polluters and urging Senator
George Voinovich to reconsider his
support of the Act.
Whereas, several weeks ago, the
U.S.
Senate
reintroduced
amendments to the Clean Air Act, which
amendments are known as the Clear
Skies Act; and
Whereas, the Clear Skies Act is
supposed to target emissions from
power plants and oil refineries and
allegedly replicates the acid rain
cap-and-trade program; and
Whereas, however, testimony on
behalf of state and local air pollution control officials maintains that
the Clear Skies measure would strip
away enforcement tools provided in
the current Clean Air Act and would
delay emissions reductions, compared to reductions already called
for by the Clean Air Act; and
Whereas, the proposed Clear Skies
Act weakens states’ authority on
clean air by stripping states of the
powers they have under the Clean
Air Act, including the authority to set
tougher air pollution standards; and
Whereas, the proposed Clear Skies
Act also weakens the Clean Air
Act’s public health safeguards protecting local air quality; and
Whereas, individual states have
the right to set policy concerning
the health and welfare of their citizens; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of

Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Director of

Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland has recognized the
need to maintain affordable housing
in Cleveland’s neighborhoods; and

approximately
sixtyseven percent (67%) of these units
will be occupied by qualified lowincome individuals and families and
approximately thirty-three percent
(33%) by market-rate families; and
Whereas, no less than fifty percent (50%) of the units will be
reserved for public housing eligible
families; and
Whereas, none of these units are
targeted for a special needs population as defined in the 2005 Qualified

Whereas, the CMHA/McCormack
Baron/Turbov proposal will benefit
the citizens of the City; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of
