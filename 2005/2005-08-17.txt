An emergency resolution compelling the Ohio General Assembly
to act on and pass House Bill 191
making it a fifth degree felony for
certain sexual offenders to reside
within 1,000 feet of school premises.
Whereas, the Ohio General Assembly enacted Chapter 2950 of the
Ohio Revised Code governing sex
offenders and requiring registration; and
Whereas, Ohio law currently prohibits sex offenders from living
within 1,000 feet of a school; and
Whereas, this Council is concerned about circumstances enabling sex offenders to reside near
schools; and
Whereas, such circumstances include the failure of Ohio’s sex
offender registration law to provide
a criminal penalty for any sex
offender illegally residing within
1,000 feet of a school; and
Whereas, current State law provides only for eviction lawsuits
against sex offenders illegally residing within 1,000 feet of a school; and
Whereas, the eviction process is
timely and costly and landlords are
reluctant to evict for fear of retaliation; and
Whereas, protecting young children from sex offenders is a paramount governmental interest; and
Whereas, enabling sex offenders
to reside near schools subjects children to risk; and
Whereas, recent studies indicate
that more than nine hundred fifty
(950) registered sex offenders living
within 1,000 feet of a school in violation of state law;
Whereas, House Bill 191, introduced by State Representative Tim
DeGeeter, would amend Ohio law to
make it a fifth degree felony for
certain sexual offenders to reside
within 1,000 feet of school premises;
and
Whereas, the Ohio House did not
act on similar legislation introduced
in 2004; and
Whereas, House Bill 191 is currently in the Criminal Justice Committee of the Ohio House; and
Whereas, passage of House Bill
191 provides yet another tool in the
on-going efforts to protect young
children from sexual predators; and
Whereas, failure to act on House
Bill 191 sends a clear signal to Ohio
citizens that the leadership of the
Ohio House of Representatives is

1888

August 17, 2005
not
concerned
about
protecting
young children from sexual predators; and
Whereas, this Council encourages
the Ohio General Assembly to act on
and pass House Bill 191; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council compels the Ohio General Assembly to
act on and pass House Bill 191 making it a fifth degree felony for certain sexual offenders to reside within 1,000 feet of school premises.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
certified copy of this resolution to
Speaker of the Ohio House Jon
Husted, State Representative Bob
Latta, Chair of the House Criminal
Justice Committee, State Representative Tim DeGeeter, all other members of the State of Ohio House of
Representatives, Cuyahoga County
Sheriff McFaul, and Inspector Robert Havranek, Cuyahoga County
Sheriff’s Office.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

shall take effect and be in force

An emergency resolution requesting the Campbell administration
seek proposals to purchase Global
Positioning System units for placement in all City vehicles.
Whereas, the City should find an
efficient way to keep track of City
vehicles during working hours; and
Whereas, a Global Positioning
System (GPS) unit in every City
vehicle is an effective tool that will
aid in tracking City vehicles and
help make city departments and
employees accountable to those they
work for; and
Whereas, a GPS unit in every City
vehicle will make management more
efficient and help ensure productivity during working hours; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public

now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

By Council Member Coats.
An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting
new Section 451.241 thereof, relating
to prohibiting the parking of vehicles on vacant lots; and to amend
Sections 459.01 and 459.11 of said
codified ordinances, both as amended
by
Ordinance
No.
1593-2000,
passed December 18, 2000, relating
to definitions of words and phrases
as used within the Traffic Code and
parking infraction fines.
Whereas, vacant lots in the City
often are used as unlicensed parking lots without proper surfacing,
drainage, landscaping or routes of
ingress and egress; and
Whereas, vacant lots in the City
often become littered with abandoned, junk, and unsightly vehicles;
and
Whereas, the parking of vehicles
on vacant lots makes it more difficult for owners of such lots and the
City to prevent and abate nuisances
such as high grass, noxious weeds,
refuse, and stagnant surface water,
which often occur on vacant lots, as
required by Chapter 209 of the City’s
Codified Ordinances; and
Whereas, the City has a licensing
program for commercial parking
lots, in Chapter 457 of the City’s
Codified Ordinances, a program to
alleviate on-street parking congestion on residential streets, in Chapter 461 of the City’s Codified Ordinances, and zoning regulations permitting off-street parking on vacant
lots under certain limited circumstances, making it otherwise unnecessary to park or leave vehicles on
vacant lots; and
Whereas, the Zoning Code of the
City permits off-street parking on
vacant lots in Residential Use Districts, only with approval of the
Board of Zoning Appeals and under
certain
limited
circumstances
(Chapters 337 and 339), and the
Zoning Code contains regulations
and limits on the establishment of
off-street parking in other Use Districts (Chapter 349); and
Whereas, police officers are authorized to remove and impound vehicles left standing or parked unlawfully in the City in Section 405.02 of
the Codified Ordinances, but there is
no express prohibition on parking
on vacant lots, and no express
authorization for the City to act to
remove vehicles and cite owners of
property who allow such parking
without proper approval; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
hereby supplemented by enacting

The City Record
new Section 451.241 to read as follows:

(a) No person who is the owner
of a vacant lot shall knowingly
allow a vehicle to be parked or left
upon any vacant lot within the City
unless the lot is a licensed parking
lot under Chapter 457 of Codified
Ordinances or the lot is an approved
off-street parking facility pursuant
to the Zoning Code of the City and
the lot is clearly marked by a sign
identifying the owner, the approved
private use, and the parking lot
license number, if it is a licensed
parking lot.
(b) No person shall stand or park
a vehicle upon any vacant lot within the City unless the lot is a
licensed parking lot under Chapter
457 of Codified Ordinances or the lot
is an approved off-street parking
facility pursuant to the Zoning Code
of the City and the lot is clearly
marked by a sign identifying the
owner and the approved private use.
(c) For purposes of this section, a
vacant lot shall be defined as a parcel that does not contain any permanent lawful occupied structure.
(d) Cleveland City Council has
determined that a vehicle parked on
a vacant lot constitutes a nuisance
which must be abated. For this reason, any vehicle parked or left upon
a vacant lot in violation of this section shall be subject to be impounded as provided in Chapter 405.
(e) Any person who violates division (a) of this section is guilty of
a minor misdemeanor for the first
offense and is guilty of misdemeanor of the third degree for a second and any subsequent offense. In
addition to any other method of
enforcement provided for in this section, any violation of the provisions
of this section that is a minor misdemeanor may be enforced by the
issuance of a citation in compliance
with Rule 4.1 of the Ohio Rules of
Criminal Procedure.
(f) This section shall not be construed or interpreted in any manner
that would hinder or limit the ability of the City to enforce section
3101.10(e) of the Codified Ordinances as it relates to motor vehicles.
Section 2. That Sections 459.01 and
459.11 of the Codified Ordinances of

The City Record
Section 349.13 Permitted Garages

(a) Commercial Vehicles. No commercial vehicle shall be stored on
any premises in a Limited One-Family District and not more than one
commercial vehicle weighing unloaded not more than one and onehalf tons may be stored on any
premises in any other Residence
District unless for farming, truck
gardening or a related and similar
activity if a permitted accessory use
of the premises.
(b) Rented Space. In a Residence
District, space for two noncommercial motor vehicles may be rented to
persons not residents on the same
lot, provided such rented space is
within the area in which accessory
uses are permitted.
(c) Parking Lots. The Board of
Zoning Appeals may permit, temporarily or permanently, the use of
land in a Residence District, other
than a Limited One-Family District,
for a parking lot when the best
interests of the community will be
served, and provided that:
(1) The lot is to be used only for
the parking of passenger automobiles
of employees, customers or guests of
the person or firm controlling and
operating the lot, who shall be

(8) The building permit number
under which the lot is established is

be located.

of
the
blighted
premises from the owners.
