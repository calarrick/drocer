NO MEETING

THE CALENDAR
The following measure will be on
its final passage at the next meeting:
ORDINANCE
Ord. No. 1780-05.
By Mayor Campbell.
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Economic Development to enter into a Tax Increment Financing Agreement with
Steelyard Commons LLC, to provide
for payments to the Cleveland City
School District and to provide for
the creation of the Steelyard Commons TIF Fund to be used for development and recreational improvements; and to declare certain improvements to real property to be a
public purpose.
Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of
the Revised Code, improvements to
real property may be declared to be
a public purpose where fee title to
such real property was, at one time,
held by the City of Cleveland and
the real property is then leased or
conveyed by the City; and
Whereas, under the authority of
Ordinance No. 1541-04, passed October 17, 2005, and prior to the passage of this ordinance, the City

2625

approved both the acquisition and
conveyance of fee title to certain
real property, which is more particularly described in the documents
set
forth
in
the
file
described in this ordinance (the
“Real Property”); and
Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of
the Revised Code, such improvements so declared to be a public purpose may be exempt from real property taxation; and
Whereas, under Section 5709.42 of
the Revised Code, the owners of the
improvements may be required to
make annual service payments in
lieu of taxes that would have been
paid had such improvements not
been exempt; and
Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of
the Revised Code, the exemption
may exceed 75% of the improvements for up to 30 years without the
approval of the board of education
of the school district within the territory of which the improvements
are or will be located if the ordinance declaring improvements to a
parcel to be a public purpose specifies that service payments in lieu of
taxes provided for in Section 5709.42
of the Ohio Revised Code shall be
paid to the school district in which
the parcel is located in the amount
of the taxes that would have been
payable to the school district if the
improvements had not been exempted from taxation; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That pursuant to and in
accordance with the provisions of
Section 5709.41 of the Revised Code,
this Council finds and determines
that 100% of the increase in assessed value of the Property after
its acquisition by the City (which
increase in assessed value is referred to as “Improvement” as defined in Section 5709.41 of the Revised Code) will be a public purpose.
Section 2. That one hundred percent (100%) of the Improvements
are declared exempt from real property taxation for a period of 20
years beginning _________ 2005; and
that in no event shall the exemption
period extend beyond ________, 2026.
Section 3. That, under Section
5709.42 of the Revised Code, the
owners of the Improvements shall
make service payments for a period
of 20 years in lieu of the exempt
taxes to the Cuyahoga County Treasurer;
the
payments
shall
be
charged and collected in the same
manner, and shall be in an amount

4
not less than the taxes that would
have been paid had the Improvements not been exempt from taxation.
Section 4. That a portion of the
service payments collected under
Section 3 of this ordinance shall be
distributed by the Cuyahoga County Treasurer to the Treasurer of
the Cleveland Municipal School District (“District”) in the amount of
the taxes that would have been
payable to the District had the
Improvement not been exempt from
taxation.
Section 5. That the Mayor or
Director of Economic Development,
with the approval of the Director of
Law, is authorized to enter into one
or more agreements with such parties as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the purposes of
this ordinance.
Section 6. That under Section
5709.43 of the Revised Code there is
hereby established a Steelyard Commons Urban Redevelopment Tax
Increment Equivalent Fund (“Steelyard Commons TIF Fund”), 70% of
which shall be used for acquisition
of land and to make improvements
to the Tow Path Trail and Canal
Basin Park. Of this 70%, if there are
remaining funds, they shall be used
for additional connector trails.
The remaining 30% shall be used
for retail assistance programs and
other commercial and industrial initiatives, including land acquisition,
within the City. This 30% will be
used primarily for projects that offset the impacts of Steelyard Commons on adjacent neighborhood commercial districts, and use of these
funds will be guided by the retail
impact study currently underway.
These funds will be disbursed quarterly as grants, on a competitive
basis, under criteria established by
this Council and the Cleveland
Citywide Development Corporation
(CCDC). The CCDC will evaluate
applications and make recommendations to this Council. Projects in
the following categories will be
eligible:
Neighborhood Retail: specifically
those elements not funded by the
existing Storefront Program (such
as parking lots);
Neighborhood Small and Start-up
Businesses: to assist with small
business expansion, refine business
plans, assist entrepreneurs to “get
out of the garage and into a storefront,” etc.;
Neighborhood Arts Projects: projects that enhance a neighborhood
commercial/retail district;
Neighborhood Streetscape: in neighborhood commercial/residential districts;
Neighborhood
Industrial
Sites:
planning, environmental site assessments, etc., of underused and/or
abandoned neighborhood industrial
sites; and
Land Acquisition: to support commercial development adjacent to the
Tow Path Trail.
Section 7. That the service payments collected under Section 3
shall be distributed by the Cuyahoga County Treasurer to the Treasurer of the City of Cleveland to be
deposited in the Steelyard Commons
TIF Fund created by Section 6.
With the approval of the Director of
Economic
Development
and
the

The City Record
Director of Law, money deposited in
the Steelyard Commons TIF Fund
shall be used to for the purposes
described in Section 6.
Section 8. That the Director of the
Office of Equal Opportunity shall
engage in discussions with the
County Engineer to explore how
employment of local residents and
minority and female business enterprises can best be advanced. The
Director of the Office of Equal
Opportunity shall report back to this
Council on the results of those discussions and shall make recommendations on how to achieve those
goals.
Section 9. That the signed letter
from Mitchell Schneider, President
of First Interstate Properties Ltd.,
dated December 2, 2005 to the Council Member of Ward 13 shall be
placed in File No. 1780-05-A.
Section 10. That there is hereby
created an Advisory Committee that
shall consist of five members selected as follows: one (1) member shall
be appointed by this Council; one
(1) member shall be appointed by
the Mayor; one (1) member shall be
appointed by the County Commissioners; and two (2) members shall
be appointed by the Ohio Canal Corridor. The meetings of the Advisory
Committee may be conducted at City

Development
and
the
Employment, Affirmative Action &
Training on all aspects of the Improvement, including without limitation, overall progress, success on
reaching employment goals, and a
description of any purchases made
in support of the Improvement.
Section 11. That it is found and
determined that all formal actions
of this Council concerning and relating to the passage of this ordinance
were adopted in open meetings of
this Council, and any of its committees that resulted in formal action
were in meetings open to the public
in compliance with the law.

declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it

By Council Member Reed.
An emergency resolution objecting to the transfer of stock of a C1,
C2 and D6 Liquor Permit to 14510
Kinsman Avenue.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Department of Liquor
Control of an application for a transfer of stock of a C1, C2 and D6
Liquor Permit at 14510, Inc., DBA
Kinsman Sunoco, 14510 Kinsman
Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44120, Permanent Number 6549670; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to
Section 4303.26 of the Ohio Revised
Code. Council’s objection to said
permit must be received by the
Director of Liquor Control within
30 days of notification; now, therefore,

The City Record
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby record its objection to a transfer
of stock of a C1, C2 and D6 Liquor
Permit at 14510, Inc., DBA Kinsman
Sunoco,
14510

Cleveland, Ohio 44120, Permanent

Effective December 12, 2005.

Res. No. 2259-05.
By Council Member Brady.
An emergency resolution in support of the Federal Communications
Commission’s upcoming report that
favors consumers being able to purchase cable/satellite channels individually, or a la carte, rather than
in bundled packages, and urging
federal lawmakers to rewrite regulations to allow the cable industry
to offer cable/satellite channels a la
carte.
Whereas, cable companies sell
channels
to
consumers
bundled
together in “packages” as opposed to
individually, or “a la carte”; and
Whereas,
consumer
advocates
have pushed for years for a la carte
pricing saying it would result in
lower programming costs and higher-quality programs; and
Whereas, the average cable/satellite-connected
household
actually
watches about 17 of the nearly 90
channels usually available; and
Whereas, the Federal Communications Commission is preparing a
report finding that pick and choose
channel selection would allow the
average cable/satellite household to
save money; and
Whereas, further, the FCC report
finds that the cable industry should
offer channels a la carte, thereby
allowing the consumer to choose
which channels they purchase; and
Whereas, by making it possible to
keep some of the objectionable channels out of their homes, the public
will be less inclined to ask that Congress set decency standards for private-access channels; and
Whereas, Congress should listen
to the FCC and to consumers and
rewrite the cable regulations to
allow the cable industry to offer al
la carte service; and

2633

11
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports the Federal Communications
Commission’s
upcoming
report that favors consumers being
able
to
purchase
cable/satellite
channels individually, or a la carte,
rather than in bundled packages,
and urges federal lawmakers to
rewrite regulations to allow the
cable industry to offer cable/satellite channels a la carte.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to forward copies of
this resolution to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Kevin
Martin, and to the members of both
the House and the Senate Commerce
Committees.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted December 5, 2005.
Effective December 12, 2005.

Res. No. 2264-05.
By Council Members Zone, Britt,
Sweeney, Polensek, Conwell, Knight
and White.
An emergency resolution urging
the PUCO to adopt rules to protect
consumers from unjustified and substantial increases in basic local service rates, permit stakeholders adequate and fair opportunity to oppose
applications for increased basic local
service rates, provide benefits for
low income consumers and impose
broadband access requirements.
Whereas, on August 5, 2005, Governor Bob Taft signed H.B. 218,
which revises various Ohio laws
dealing
with
telecommunications
including the provision of basic
local phone service; and
Whereas, H.B. 218 authorizes the
Public Utilities Commission of Ohio
(the “PUCO”) to adopt alternative
methods of regulating the rates paid
by consumers for basic local phone
service; and
Whereas, the PUCO is considering
rule changes that would allow telephone service providers to increase
rates up to 20% per year under a
competitive system, even when such
increases would not be justified by
the cost of providing that service;
and
Whereas, this Council strongly
believes that the new rules proposed
by the PUCO do not adequately
require telephone service providers
to demonstrate that increased local
service rates are justified, do not
allow sufficient time for stakeholders to oppose rate increases, allow
excessive rate increases and do not
require consumer benefits including

12
rate
subsidy
programs
for
low
income
consumers
or
broadband
access commitments; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that the proposed PUCO rules do not
adequately protect low and middle
income consumers in the City of
Cleveland
from
substantial
and
unjustified increases in basic local
telephone service rates; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
strongly urges the PUCO to adopt
rules to protect consumers from
unjustified
and
substantial
increases in basic local service rates,
permit stakeholders adequate and
fair opportunity to oppose applications for increased basic local service rates, provide benefits for low
income
consumers
and
impose
broadband access requirements.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to transmit
a copy of this resolution to Ohio
Governor Bob Taft, PUCO Chairman
Schriber, PUCO Commissioners Fergus, Jones, Mason and Rogers and
to Ohio Consumers’ Counsel Janine
L. Migden-Ostrander.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted December 5, 2005.
Effective December 12, 2005.

Res. No. 2265-05.
By Council Members Zone, Kelley,
Coats,
Pierce
Scott,
Cimperman,
Sweeney, Westbrook, Knight, Lewis,
Polensek, Reed, Britt and Conwell.
An emergency resolution urging
the PUCO to consider rule changes
that, to the maximum extent, preserve the OCC toll-free call center
number on utility bills, disconnection notices and literature that may
be sent with utility bills and encouraging the PUCO to provide consumers
with
information
about
direct access to OCC’s many services
in order that consumers may obtain
utility related information and assistance.
Whereas,
the
Office
of
Consumers’ Counsel (“OCC”) was created under Chapter 4911 of the Ohio
Revised Code and has the statutory mandate to serve as advocate
for the state’s residential utility
customers; and
Whereas, OCC maintains a toll-free
consumer call center where utility
consumers can obtain assistance and
address problems on a wide range of
utility-related concerns; and
Whereas, in response to the passage of House Bill 66 by the Ohio
House of Representatives, this Coun-

The City Record
cil passed Resolution No. 1076-05 on
May 23, 2005, urging the Ohio legislature to restore full funding for
OCC and to retain the OCC’s toll-free
consumer call center; and
Whereas, newly enacted sections
of the Ohio Revised Code require
that consumer calls regarding utility bill complaints formerly handled by the OCC toll-free call center must now be referred to the call
center operated by the Public Utilities
Commission
of
Ohio
(the
“PUCO”); and
Whereas, the PUCO, pursuant to
the newly enacted Ohio Revised Code
sections, is considering administrative rule changes that would eliminate or change references on consumer utility bills, disconnection
notices and other literature sent with
utility bills in such a way as to discourage or prohibit consumers from
contacting OCC about concerns with
quality of service, obtaining financial assistance, avoiding disconnection of utility services, home weatherization programs and purchasing
utility services under the state’s customer choice programs; and
Whereas, this Council strongly
believes that utility consumers in
Cleveland and across the state are
facing record-high energy and fuel
bills during the winter of 2005-2006
and that the proposed PUCO rule
changes will have the effect of
denying consumers direct access to
the many services of OCC; and

believes that the rule changes contemplated by the PUCO are not
required by or consistent with state
law and prohibit the OCC from fulfilling many of its statutory responsibilities as the statutory residential
consumer advocate; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the PUCO to consider rule changes
that, to the maximum extent, preserve the OCC toll-free call center
number on utility bills, disconnection notices and literature that may
be sent with utility bills.
Section
2.
That
this
Council
encourages the PUCO to provide
consumers with information about
direct access to OCC’s many services
in order that consumers may obtain
utility related information and assistance.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to transmit
a copy of this resolution to Ohio
Governor Bob Taft, PUCO Chairman
Schriber, PUCO Commissioners Fergus, Jones, Mason and Rogers and
to Ohio Consumers’ Counsel Janine
L. Migden-Ostrander.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force

is placed in service; and
Whereas, this Council wishes to

for those projects; and
Whereas, the Department of Port
