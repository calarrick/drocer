REPRINT
Res. No. 1695-05.
By Council Member Zone.
An emergency resolution objecting to the transfer of ownership of
a C2 and C2X Liquor Permit to 5601
Clark Avenue.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Department of Liquor
Control of an application for the
transfer of ownership of a C2 and
C2X
Liquor
Permit
from
Faik
Mohammad, DBA Cleveland Food
Market, 5601 Clair Avenue, 1st floor,
Cleveland, Ohio 44102, Permanent
Number 6082332 to 5601 Clark Ave.,
Inc., DBA Cleveland Food Market,
5601 Clark Avenue, 1st floor, Cleveland, Ohio 44102, Permanent Number
2759413; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based on
other legal grounds as set forth in
Revised Code Section 4303.292; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure pro-

October 5, 2005
viding for the immediate preservation of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to
Section 4303.26 of the Ohio Revised
Code. Council’s objection to said
permit must be received by the
Director of Liquor Control within
30 days of notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby record its objection to the transfer of ownership of a C2 and C2X
Liquor Permit from Faik Mohammad, DBA Cleveland Food Market,
5601 Clair Avenue, 1st floor, Cleveland, Ohio 44102, Permanent Number
6082332 to 5601 Clark Ave., Inc., DBA
Cleveland Food Market, 5601 Clark
Avenue, 1st floor, Cleveland, Ohio
44102, Permanent Number 2759413;
and requests the Director of Liquor
Control to set a hearing for said
application in accordance with provisions of Section 4303.26 of the

Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
