Res. No. 384-05.
By Council Member Coats.
An emergency resolution encouraging the Ohio General Assembly to
enact legislation increasing the distance prohibition governing the residence of sex offenders and schools
to a distance that, at a minimum, is
greater than the distance children
walk to and from school and, in the
alternative,
to
enact
legislation
increasing the distance prohibition
governing the residence of sex
offenders and schools to 2,000 feet.
Whereas, the Ohio General Assembly enacted Chapter 2950 of the Ohio
Revised Code governing sex offenders and requiring registration; and
Whereas, in enacting Chapter 2950
of the Ohio Revised Code, the Ohio
General Assembly determined and
declared several legislative findings; and
Whereas, one such finding determined and declared “sex offenders
and offenders who commit child-vic-

tim offenses pose a risk of engaging in further sexually abusive
behavior and protection of members
of the public from sex offenders and
offenders who commit child-victim
oriented offenses is a paramount
governmental interest”; and
Whereas, Ohio law currently prohibits sex offenders from living
within 1,000 feet of a school; and
Whereas, this 1,000 feet restriction
does not adequately protect young
children
walking
to
and
from
school; and
Whereas, this Council is concerned about circumstances enabling sex offenders convicted of raping young children to reside near
schools; and
Whereas, the documentation contained in File No. 384-05-A, documents fourteen (14) registered sex
offenders who live at an address
within 1,840 feet of an elementary
school; and
Whereas, four (4) of these sex
offenders were convicted of raping
victims five (5) years of age and
four (4) of these sex offenders were
convicted of raping victims nine (9)
years of age or younger; and
Whereas, protecting young children from sex offenders is a para-

mount governmental interest; and
Whereas, enabling sex offenders
to reside near schools subjects children to risk; and
Whereas, this Council encourages
the Ohio General Assembly to increase the current 1,000 feet restriction; and
Whereas, such increase should be,
at a minimum, greater than the distance young children walk to and
from school; and
Whereas, in the event, the Ohio
General Assembly chooses not to or
is unable to increase the prohibition
to the distance children walk to and
from school, this Council encourages
the
Ohio
General
Assembly
to
increase the prohibition to 2,000 feet;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
encourages the Ohio General Assembly to enact legislation increasing
the distance prohibition governing
the residence of sex offenders and
schools to a distance that, at a min-

March 9, 2005
imum, is greater than the distance
children walk to and from school.
Section 2. That this Council encourages the Ohio General Assembly,
in the alternative, to enact legislation
increasing the distance prohibition
governing the residence of sex offenders and schools to 2,000 feet.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
certified copy of this resolution and
the legislative file to those members
of the State of Ohio Legislature representing residents of the City of
Cleveland.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Section 3. That so much of the
cost and expense of the improvements less, in any event one-fiftieth

of intersections, as shall be found to
be
a
proper
charge,
shall
be
assessed on all lots and lands abutting on, and other specially benefited
property
adjacent
to
Euclid
Avenue between Public Square and
East 70th Street, in proportion to the
benefits which may result from the
improvement, and it is determined

Section 5. That the remainder of
the cost of the improvement not specially assessed, as provided, shall be
paid from Fund No. 20 SF 500.

available
for
public

of Public Service shall serve notice
of the revocation on all affected
property owners.

An emergency resolution encouraging the United States Congress to
first commit to paying back to the
Social Security Trust Fund all of the
money it borrowed from the fund;
encouraging the United States Congress to carefully study potential
changes to the Social Security system; encouraging the United States
Congress to adopt changes that
strengthen Social Security’s family
income protections; and encouraging
the United States Congress to reject
proposals that would divert money
out of Social Security and into private accounts.
Whereas, Social Security’s income
protections,
guaranteed,
lifelong
benefits, cost-of-living adjustments

50
to guard against inflation, increased
benefits for families, greater income
replacement for low-income workers,
and disability and survivor benefits,
are the backbone of retirement security and family protection in the
United States; and
Whereas, Social Security provides
crucial, often indispensable income
protection for the 47 million individuals, one of every six Americans,
receiving benefits; and
Whereas, Social Security is the
nation’s most successful and most
important family income protection
program, but is has long-term funding needs that need to be addressed;
and
Whereas, some policymakers propose to address these needs by cutting guaranteed benefits and privatizing Social Security, that is, diverting a third or more of workers’ payroll tax contributions out of the
Social Security Trust Fund and into
private investment accounts; and
Whereas, privatization will worsen Social Security’s funding needs
by draining resources from the
Trust Fund into private accounts,
increasing the federal deficit by two
trillion dollars over the first decade
alone and more in the future and
putting the United States deeper in
debt to foreign creditors; and
Whereas, some officials and members of Congress have suggested the
federal government will not pay
back money it has taken from the
Social Security Trust Fund over the
past twenty years and used for
other things, thereby denying working families the money they paid
into Social Security and leading to
further benefit cuts; and
Whereas, privatizing Social Security will cut guaranteed benefits by
thirty percent (30%) for young
workers, even for those who do not
participate
in
private
accounts,
denying them benefits they have
earned and imperiling their economic security; and
Whereas, cutting guaranteed benefits will hurt the elderly because
Social Security is the only secure
source of retirement income for most
Americans, providing at least half
the income of nearly two-thirds of
older American households and lifting more than eleven million seniors
out of poverty; and
Whereas, cutting guaranteed benefits will hurt women and people of
color, as they are more likely than
white men to rely on Social Security for most of their retirement
income, they earn less money than
white men and are, therefore, less
able to save for retirement, and they
are less likely than white men to
receive job-based pensions in retirement; and
Whereas, diverting resources from
Social
Security
to
fund
private
accounts will threaten guaranteed
survivor
and
disability
benefits,
thus harming working families, particularly
African
Americans,
as
roughly one in five workers dies
before retiring and nearly three in
ten become too disabled to work
before reaching retirement age; and
Whereas, privatizing Social Security will burden state and local governments, as cuts in guaranteed benefits will increase demands for public assistance at the very moment

The City Record
growth in the federal deficit due to
privatization induces the federal
government to shit greater responsibilities onto state and local governments; and
Whereas, Congress should not
rush through drastic and damaging
changes in Social Security that
undermine its family income protections, but instead, should take the
time needed to develop careful and
thoughtful
reforms
that
address
Social Security’s funding needs without slashing benefits or exploding
the deficit; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
encourages the United States Congress to first commit to paying back
to the Social Security Trust Fund all
of the money it borrowed from the
Security Fund.
Section
2.
That
this
Council
encourages the United States Congress to carefully study a variety of
potential changes that will address
Social Security’s problems in a manner that ensures the Social Security
program will continue to meet its
purpose of providing income protection
and
economic
security
for
America’s families.
Section
3.
That
this
Council
encourages the United States Congress
to
adopt
changes
that
strengthen Social Security’s family
income protections without slashing
guaranteed benefits and increasing
the deficit.

An emergency resolution urging
the United States Congress to reject
any budget reduction and reconciliation process for fiscal year 2006
related to Medicaid reform or other
domestic
discretionary
programs
that shift additional costs to the
states and cities and/or result in

approach to deficit reduction.
Whereas, the budget proposal
sent

Congress

President
George W. Bush includes a five
year cap on discretionary spending
that requires more than $2.5 billion

reduction in Medicaid spending over

Whereas, the Medicaid program
provides access to health care for

Res. No. 307-05.
By Council Members Zone, Coats,

Scott,
O’Malley,
Sweeney,
White, Britt, Brady, Polensek, Westbrook and Lewis.
An emergency resolution opposing
the Clear Skies Act of 2005 as it
would limit the states’ authority to
regulate local air quality and pursue polluters and urging Senator
George Voinovich to reconsider his
support of the Act.
Whereas, several weeks ago, the
U.S.
Senate
reintroduced
amendments to the Clean Air Act, which
amendments are known as the Clear
Skies Act; and
Whereas, the Clear Skies Act is
supposed to target emissions from
power plants and oil refineries and
allegedly replicates the acid rain
cap-and-trade program; and
Whereas, however, testimony on
behalf of state and local air pollution
control
officials
maintains
that
the
Clear
Skies
measure
would
strip
away
enforcement
tools provided in the current Clean
Air Act and would delay emissions
reductions, compared to reductions
already called for by the Clean Air
Act; and
Whereas, the proposed Clear Skies
Act weakens states’ authority on
clean air by stripping states of the
powers they have under the Clean
Air Act, including the authority to
set tougher air pollution standards;
and
Whereas, the proposed Clear Skies
Act also weakens the Clean Air
Act’s public health safeguards protecting local air quality; and
Whereas, individual states have
the right to set policy concerning
the health and welfare of their citizens; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby opposes the Clear Skies Act of
2005 as it would limit the states’
authority to regulate local air quality and pursue polluters and urges
Senator George Voinovich to reconsider his support of the Act.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to the President George W. Bush, Senator
George Voinovich, Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe, Governor Bob
Taft, the Director of the National
League of Cities, and the Director of
the Ohio Municipal League.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Whereas, this Council passed Ordinance No. 1749-80 on October 8, 1980,
and thereafter amended that ordinance by Ordinance No. 1112-83,
passed on May 6, 1983 and Ordinance
No. 944-96 passed on June 10, 1996
(Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so amended and as the same may further be
amended from time to time in accordance with its provisions, is referred
to as the “General Bond Ordinance”),
providing the general terms and provisions for the issuance of unvoted
general obligations of the City, with
the specific terms of each series of
bonds to be contained in ordinances
authorizing the issuance of bonds in
accordance
with
the
provisions
thereof (the “Series Bond Ordinances”); and
Whereas, the issuance of the
Bonds is necessary to provide funds
to refund the Refunded Bonds which
will enable the City to obtain debt
service savings and as a result, this
Ordinance constitutes an emergency
measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public, peace,
property, health and safety, and for
the usual daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary to issue the Bonds in an
aggregate principal amount not to
exceed Eighty-Five Million Dollars
($85,000,000) for the purpose of refunding the Refunded Bonds which,
collectively, were issued for the purposes of providing funds to pay
costs of Projects 1 through 38 as
described above, including the payment of any expenses relating to the
refunding of the Refunded Bonds
and the issuance of the Bonds,
including any financing costs within the meaning of Revised Code Section 133.01(K).
The aggregate principal amount
of Bonds to be issued shall not
exceed $85,000,000 and shall be in an
amount determined by the Director
of
Finance
to
be
the
amount
required to be issued, taking into
account any original issue discount
and/or premium on the sale of the
Bonds in order to refund the Refunded Bonds and pay any expenses
relating to the refunding of the
Refunded Bonds and the issuance of
the Bonds. That amount shall be set
forth in the certificate providing for
the final terms of the Bonds and the
sale of the Bonds and signed by the
Director of Finance in accordance
with this Ordinance (the “Certificate
of Award”). The Director of Finance
may determine in the Certificate of
Award that additional maturities or
different maturities of the series of
unvoted general obligation bonds of
the City identified in the preambles
of this Ordinance and issued for the
purpose of providing funds to pay
costs of Projects 1 through 38 may
be refunded and thereby constitute
Refunded Bonds; provided that in
adding or changing such maturities
the Director of Finance determines,
based on written advice from the
City’s Financial Advisor (defined in
Section 13 below), that the aggregate present value debt service savings to the City resulting from the
refunding of all the Refunded Bonds
is not less than three per cent (3%).
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant

347

61
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Revised
Code Chapter 133 and other applicable provisions of the Revised Code,
the Charter of the City, the General
Bond Ordinance and this Ordinance
in the principal amount and for the
purpose stated in Section 1. The
Bonds shall be designated “General
Obligation Refunding Bonds, Series
2005”. The Bonds shall be issued in
one lot as fully registered Bonds in
denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof but in no case
as to a particular maturity date
exceeding
the
principal
amount
maturing on that date. The Bonds
shall be numbered as determined by
the Director of Finance.
The Bonds shall be dated as of
April 1, 2005 or such other date, but
in no event later than December 31,
2005, specified in the certificate of
award providing for the final terms
of the Bonds and the sale of the
Bonds and signed by the Director of
Finance in accordance with this Ordinance (the “Certificate of Award”).
The Bonds shall bear interest at the
rate or rates per year specified in the
Certificate of Award; provided that if
all the Bonds bear interest at the
same rate, then such rate shall not
exceed six percent (6%) per year,
and if the Bonds bear interest at
more than one rate, then the weighted average of such rates (taking into
account the principal amount and
maturity of each Bond to which a
rate applies) shall not exceed six
percent (6%) per year. Interest on
the Bonds shall be payable, until the
principal amount is paid, semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each
year or on the first day of each of
two months specified in the Certificate of Award as the dates on which
interest on the Bonds shall be
payable
(the
“Interest
Payment
Dates”), beginning October 1, 2005, or
on such other Interest Payment Date
specified in the Certificate of Award
as the first Interest Payment Date.
The Bonds shall mature in the
years and principal amounts as
shall be determined by the Director
of Finance and specified in the Certificate of Award, based on the written advice of a Financial Advisor to
be in the best interests of the City
given market conditions at the time
the Bonds are sold and the objectives of the plan of refunding to
obtain aggregate present value savings of not less than three per cent
(3%). Provided, further, that: (i)
each principal payment shall occur
on an Interest Payment Date, (ii)
the first principal payment on the
Bonds shall be no earlier than October 1, 2005 and no later than October 1, 2007, and (iii) the final maturity date of the Bonds shall be no
later than the last maturity permitted by law for the Refunded Bonds.
The Director of Finance also shall
determine and certify, on or prior to
the date of delivery of the Bonds to
the Original Purchaser, that portion
of the aggregate principal amount
of the Bonds that is allocable to
each Project, and the principal
amount of Bonds allocated to each
Project that shall be payable at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements (as defined below) on
the applicable principal payment
dates; provided, that (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds

62
allocable to a Project shall be determined by the Director of Finance on
a pro rata basis by reference to the
respective amount of funds that is
required for the refunding of the
Refunded Bonds that are allocable
to that Project, taking into account
any funds other than the proceeds
of the Bonds that are available and
appropriated for that purpose, and
(ii) no portion of the aggregate
principal amount of Bonds allocated
to a Project shall be payable later
than the maximum maturity for that
portion of the Bonds as certified by
the Director of Finance.
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the
“Mandatory
Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the “Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption prior to stated maturity
as follows:
(a) Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent,
currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of
and interest on any Term Bonds
shall include amounts sufficient to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City
for any Term Bonds. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and corresponding mandatory redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then

The City Record
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds which
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements)
or
purchased for cancellation and canceled
by the Registrar, to the extent not
applied
theretofore
as
a
credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of
the principal amount thereof against
the then current Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement (and
corresponding mandatory redemption obligation). Any excess of that
amount
over
the
then
current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement shall be credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligations) in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(b)
Optional
Redemption.
The
Bonds may be subject to redemption
prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole or in
part on any date, in integral multiples of $5,000, on the optional
redemption dates and at the redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of the principal amount
redeemed) specified in the Certificate of Award, plus, in each case,
accrued interest to the redemption
date. The first optional redemption
date shall not be later than October
1, 2016 and the highest redemption
price shall not be greater than 102%
of the principal amount redeemed.
Based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, the Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that it is in the
best interests of the City for some
or all of the Bonds not to be callable
prior to their stated maturity.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar. That notice shall specify
the redemption date and the principal amount of each maturity of
Bonds to be redeemed, and shall be
given at least forty-five (45) days
prior to the redemption date or such
shorter period as shall be acceptable
to the Registrar. There shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, funds
sufficient to redeem at the redemption price, all of the redeemable
Bonds for which notice of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than

348

March 9, 2005
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Bonds by lot when Bonds of
denominations greater than $5,000
are then outstanding, each $5,000
unit of principal thereof shall be
treated as though it were a separate
Bond of the denomination of $5,000.
If it is determined that one or more,
but not all of the $5,000 units of
principal amount represented by a
Bond are to be called for redemption, then upon notice of redemption
of a $5,000 unit or units, the registered owner of that Bond shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i)
for payment of the redemption price
of the $5,000 unit or units called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption and any
premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing and to any
municipal bond insurance company
that has issued a policy insuring
some or all of the Bonds. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity
of
the
proceedings
for
the
redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph, the Bonds and portions
thereof called for redemption shall
become due and payable on the
redemption date, and, upon presentation and surrender at the place or
places specified in that notice, shall
be paid. If money for the redemption of all of the Bonds and portions
thereof to be redeemed, including
interest accrued to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, and, if notice of
redemption has been deposited in
the mail, then from and after the
redemption date those Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall cease to bear interest and
no longer shall be considered to be

March 9, 2005
outstanding. If that money shall not
be so available on the redemption
date, or that notice shall not have
been deposited in the mail, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held
by
the
Registrar
for
the
redemption of particular Bonds shall
be held in trust for the account of
the registered owners and shall be
paid to them, respectively, upon presentation and surrender of those
Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section
3) at the close of business on the
date
provided
in
the
Registrar
Agreement authorized in Section 3
(the Record Date). Notwithstanding
any contrary provision in the General Bond Ordinance, so long as the
Bonds are held by a Depository in
a book entry system (as described
in Section 3), debt charges on the
Bonds will be payable in lawful
money of the United States by wire
transfer to the Depository made by
the Escrow Agent on each Interest
Payment Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance, except for the third paragraph of Section 13(a) (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 (pertaining generally to the periods during which the City is not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under the
General Bond Ordinance), will apply
to the Bonds. Except for those provisions, the General Bond Ordinance
is included as a part of this Ordinance as fully as if restated in this
Ordinance. Words and terms not otherwise defined in this Ordinance
shall have the same meaning as set
forth in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their faces
the purpose for which they are
issued and that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to
Section 4 of the General Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be authenticated by the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee (as
defined therein). The Bonds shall be
signed by the City’s Mayor and by
the City’s Director of Finance, and,
consistent with Revised Code Section 133.27 and notwithstanding Section 177.02 of the Codified Ordinances of the City, either or both of
those signatures may be a facsimile. The Bonds shall bear the seal of
the City, which seal may be a fac-

The City Record
simile seal. Pursuant to Section 83
of the City’s Charter, the Director of
Law shall prepare the Bonds and
shall endorse thereon her approval
of the form and correctness thereof
by her manual or facsimile signature.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating agent, bond registrar, transfer
agent and paying agent for the
Bonds (the “Registrar”); provided
that the Escrow Agent shall also act
as paying agent for the Bonds so
long as the Bonds are held in a book
entry
system.
The
Director
of
Finance shall sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
the Registrar Agreement among the
City, the Registrar and the Escrow
Agent (the “Registrar Agreement”)
in substantially the form as is now
on file with the Clerk of Council in
File No. 167-05-A. The Registrar
Agreement is approved, together
with any changes or amendments
that are not inconsistent with this
ordinance
and
not
substantially
adverse to the City and that are
approved by the Director of Finance
and the Director of Law on behalf
of the City, all of which shall be
conclusively evidenced by the signing of the Agreement or amendments to the Agreement. The Director of Finance shall provide for the
payment of the services rendered
and for reimbursement of expenses
incurred pursuant to the Agreement
from the proceeds of the Bonds to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided
in this Section (the “Bond Register”). Subject to the provisions of
Section 5, the person in whose name
a Bond is registered on the Bond
Register shall be regarded as the
absolute owner of that Bond for all
purposes of this ordinance. Payment
of or on account of the debt charges
on any Bond shall be made only to
or upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Bond at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner
or
by
a
person
legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar

349

63
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of
this ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Bonds
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Bonds surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized: (i) the
Bonds may be issued in the form of
a single, fully registered Bond representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository

64
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the beneficial
owners in book entry form shall
have no right to receive Bonds in
the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for
transfer to another Depository or to
another nominee of a Depository,
without further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Bonds from the Depository,
and the Trustee and Registrar shall
authenticate and deliver bond certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking
Fund and, if not purchased by them,
shall be offered to the Treasury
Investment Account for purchase
and, if not purchased for that
Account, shall be sold to Morgan
Stanley & Co. Incorporated, McDonald
Investments
Inc.
and
SBKBrooks Investment Corp. (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”).
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance, the written advice
of either Financial Advisor and the
Original Purchaser’s offer to purchase the Bonds, including: the principal amount of the Bonds, final purchase price (which shall be not less
than 97% of the principal amount
plus any accrued interest to their
date of delivery), interest rate or
rates, the amounts and years in
which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements), the Interest Payment Dates and the date
of the Bonds (if different from those
set forth in Section 2) and any other

The City Record
matters required in this Ordinance
to be set forth in that Certificate. As
appropriate under the Charter, the
Mayor, Director of Finance, Director
of Law and other appropriate officers of the City are, and each of
them is, authorized and directed to
take such actions as are necessary,
appropriate and in the best interest
of the City to establish the terms
and requirements for delivery of the
Bonds and to make such arrangements as are necessary with the
Original Purchaser in order to establish the date, location, and procedure, and conditions for the delivery
of the Bonds to the Original Purchaser,
to
give
all
appropriate
notices and certificates, to cause a
true transcript of proceedings with
reference to the issuance of the
Bonds to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Director of Finance is
further authorized and directed to
sign and deliver on behalf of the
City a bond purchase agreement
(the “Bond Purchase Agreement”),
approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, between the
City and the Original Purchaser setting forth the terms and conditions
on which the City agrees to sell the
Bonds and the Original Purchaser
agrees to buy the Bonds on terms
consistent with this Ordinance. The
Bond Purchase Agreement is approved substantially in the form
now on the file with the Clerk of
Council in the File referenced in
Section 3, together with any changes
or amendments that are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and not
substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance and the Director of
Law on behalf of the City, all of
which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of the Bond
Purchase Agreement by the Director
of Finance. It is determined that the
terms of the Bonds, as provided in
this Ordinance and as may be provided in or pursuant to the Certificate of Award, are in the best interest of the City and in compliance
with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an Official
Statement is appropriate or necessary in connection with the original
issuance of the Bonds, the Director
of Finance in his official capacity is
authorized to prepare or cause to be
prepared on behalf of the City an
Official Statement and any necessary supplements and to authorize
the use and distribution of, that
Official Statement and any supplements. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign on behalf of the
City and in his official capacity that
Official Statement and any supplements approved by the Director of
Finance. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign and deliver, on
behalf of the City and in his official
capacity such certificates in connection with the accuracy of the Official Statement and any supplements

350

March 9, 2005
as may, in his judgment, be necessary or appropriate. The Director of
Finance is also authorized to determine and certify on behalf of the
City that such disclosure document
is “deemed final” by the City within the meaning of Securities and
Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12
(the “SEC Rule”). The Director of
Finance is authorized to contract for
services for the production and distribution of preliminary and final
official statements, including by
printed and electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Director of
Finance is authorized and directed
to prepare or cause to be prepared,
and to sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the
continuing
disclosure
agreement
made by the City for the benefit of
the holders and beneficial owners of
the Bonds in accordance with the
SEC Rule. The performance of that
Agreement shall be subject to the
availability of funds and their annual appropriation to meet costs the
City would be required to incur to
perform it. The Director of Finance
is further authorized and directed to
establish procedures in order to
ensure compliance by the City with
its continuing disclosure agreement,
including the timely provision of
information and notices.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds
promptly when and as the same
falls due, and also to provide for the
discharge of the Bonds at maturity,
there shall be and is levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes, a direct
tax annually during the period the
Bonds
are
outstanding,
in
an
amount sufficient to provide for the
payment of that interest, when and
as the same shall fall due, and also
to discharge the principal of the
Bonds at maturity, which tax shall
not be less than the interest and
sinking fund tax required by Section
11 of Article XII of the Constitution
of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is ordered
computed, certified, levied and extended upon the tax duplicate and
collected by the same officers, in the
same manner and at the same time
that taxes for general purposes for
each of those years are certified,
extended and collected. The tax
shall be placed before and in preference to all other items and for the
full amount thereof. The funds
derived from those tax levies shall
be placed in the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund as required by the
General Bond Ordinance and those

March 9, 2005
funds, together with the interest collected on them shall be irrevocably
pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds
when and as the same fall due; provided, however, that, subject to the
provisions of Section 8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in each year to
the extent that revenues are available from other sources for the payment of the Bonds and are appropriated for such purpose, the amount
of such tax shall be reduced by the
amount of such revenues so available and appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25(B)(1) and 5705.51 of
the Revised Code, and in accordance
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the
General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt
charges for the Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds;
Notice of Redemption of Refunded
Bonds. Pursuant to Revised Code
Section 133.34, the General Bond
Ordinance and this Ordinance, the
proceeds of the Bonds to be applied
to the refunding of the Refunded
Bonds shall be deposited in a separate bank account within the Unvoted
Bond
and
Note
Redemption
Account of the Sinking Fund held
by The Huntington National Bank,
Cleveland, Ohio, as Escrow Agent,
in accordance with Section 179.08 of
the Codified Ordinances of the City
and
the
Escrow
Agreement
described
below,
and
shall
be
applied to the payment of debt service charges on the Refunded Bonds
from and after the date of issuance
of the Bonds to and including their
respective maturity or prior redemption
dates.
The
amount
to
be
deposited in the Escrow Fund shall
be determined by the Director of
Finance in the Certificate of Award
and shall be the amount necessary,
together with money in the Unvoted
Tax Supported Obligations Account
of the Sinking Fund available for
the purpose, to provide for the
refunding of the Refunded Bonds.
Any transfer to the Escrow Fund of
any money currently on deposit in
the Unvoted Tax-Supported Obligations Account and determined by the
Director of Finance to be available
for payment of the Refunded Bonds,
is authorized by this Ordinance.
Money deposited in the Escrow
Fund shall be (a) held in cash or
(b) invested in direct obligations of
the United States of America that
mature or are subject to redemption
by and at the option of the holder,
in amounts sufficient, together with
any uninvested cash in the Escrow
Fund but without further investment or reinvestment, for the payment
of
the
principal
of,
any
redemption premium and interest on,
the Refunded Bonds as provided in
the Escrow Agreement. Pursuant to
the respective Ordinances authorizing the Refunded Bonds, Section
133.34 of the Revised Code and this
Ordinance, money deposited in the
Escrow Fund, and the investment
income thereon, are pledged to the
payment of the Refunded Bonds.
Pursuant to Revised Code Chapter
133 and this Ordinance, and notwith-

The City Record
standing Chapter 179 of the Codified
Ordinances, any accrued interest
received from the sale of the Bonds
and any original issue premium in
excess of the amount deposited with
the Escrow Agent under the Escrow
Agreement to accomplish the refunding of the Refunded Bonds shall be
deposited in the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund to be applied to the
payment of interest on the Bonds.
The proceeds of the Bonds to be
applied to pay costs of any credit
enhancement facilities shall be paid
to the provider or providers of those
credit enhancement facilities. The
proceeds of the Bonds to be used to
pay costs of issuing the Bonds and
refunding the Refunded Bonds shall
be deposited with the Registrar in
a separate account under the Registrar
Agreement
pending
their
application to the payment of such
costs.
The Director of Finance is authorized and directed to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
Issuer, an agreement (the “Escrow
Agreement”) between the City and
the Escrow Agent, providing for the
investment and holding in escrow of
the proceeds of the Bonds to be
applied to the refunding of the
Refunded Bonds and for the application of the moneys derived from
such investments, in accordance
with the General Bond Ordinance
and this Ordinance and as otherwise
directed by law. Notice of the
advance refunding of the Refunded
Bonds and any early redemption of
Refunded Bonds shall be given in
accordance with the terms of the
Refunded Bonds and as further provided in the Escrow Agreement. The
Refunded Bonds shall be retired at
stated maturity or redeemed prior to
maturity as provided in the Certificate of Award and in accordance
with the ordinance authorizing the
respective Refunding Bonds and the
Escrow Agreement. The Director of
Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and
for
reimbursement
of
expenses
incurred pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement from money lawfully
available and appropriated or to be
appropriated for that purpose. The
Director of Finance shall obtain the
services of an independent accounting firm of national reputation to
provide a verification report as to
the adequacy of the escrow fund to
pay the Refunded Bonds on the
dates set forth in the Escrow Agreement. As appropriate under the
Charter, the Mayor and Director of
Finance and other appropriate City
officials shall execute all documents
and take all other actions necessary
or appropriate on the part of the
City to effect the refunding of the
Refunded Bonds in accordance with
the General Bond Ordinance and
this Ordinance and as otherwise
directed by law, and to cause the
Refunded Bonds to be deemed paid
and discharged.
If U.S. Treasury Securities State
and Local Government Series are to
be purchased for the Escrow Fund,
the Escrow Agent is authorized to
file, on behalf of the City, subscriptions for the purchase and issuance
of those Securities. If those Securities are not timely available for purchase, or if in the judgment of the
Director of Finance, an open-market

351

65
purchase of direct obligations of the
United States of America for the
Escrow Fund is in the best interest
of and financially advantageous to
the City, the Director of Finance
may purchase and deliver those
obligations, engage the services of
a bidding agent or similar entity for
the purpose of facilitating the bidding, purchase and delivery of such
obligations for, and any related
structuring of, the Escrow Fund,
execute such instruments as are
deemed necessary to engage such
services for such purpose, and provide further for the payment of the
cost of obtaining such services from
the proceeds of the Bonds to the
extent available and otherwise from
any other funds lawfully available
and that are appropriated or shall
be appropriated for that purpose.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Bonds are secured by a pledge and
lien on a parity with the pledges
and liens authorized by the General
Bond Ordinance and, in addition to
the taxes and revenues specifically
pledged pursuant to this Ordinance
and the General Bond Ordinance and
the other covenants, terms and
agreements provided hereunder and
in the General Bond Ordinance to
secure payment of the principal of
and interest on the Bonds, the City
hereby determines, declares, warrants and covenants that the Bonds
are general obligations of the City
and that the full faith and credit of
the City are hereby pledged for the
payment of the principal of and
interest on the Bonds in accordance
with the laws and Constitution of
the State of Ohio, this Ordinance and
the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid
and discharged all the outstanding
Bonds, or there shall otherwise be
paid to the holders of the outstanding Bonds all debt charges due or
to become due thereon, and provision shall also be made for paying
all other sums payable hereunder,
then and in that event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of further
effect, and the covenants, agreements and other obligations of the
City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the
request of the City execute and
deliver to the City such instruments
in writing as shall discharge the
lien hereof and enter on the record
such discharge of the lien and such
other instruments as may be reasonably required by the City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if:
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or sub-accounts, in trust for and
irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold
in special accounts or sub-accounts,
in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations
of the United States certified by an
independent public accounting firm
of national reputation to be of such
maturities and interest payment
dates and to bear such interest,

66
without further investment or reinvestment of either the principal
amount thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held
in trust and committed, except as
hereinafter provided), as will be
sufficient, together with moneys
referred to in (i) above, for the payment, at their maturities or redemption dates, of all debt charges on the
Bonds to their date of maturity or
redemption, as the case may be, or
if default in such payment shall
have occurred on such date then to
the date of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds
are to be redeemed prior to the
maturity thereof, notice of such
redemption shall have been duly
given or irrevocable provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall have
been duly made for the giving of
such notice. Any moneys held by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with
the provisions of this Section shall
be invested by the Escrow Agent in
direct obligations of the United
States of America maturing, or
redeemable at the option of the holder, at times and in amounts sufficient to meet payment of debt
charges on the Bonds, as directed by
the Director of Finance. Any income
or interest earned by, or increment
to, the investments held under this
Section shall, to the extent determined from time to time by the
Escrow Agent to be in excess of the
amount required to be held by it for
the purposes of this Section, be
transferred at the time of such
determination as provided in Section
17(a) of the General Bond Ordinance
for unclaimed funds held by a Paying Agent. In the event of nonpresentment of any Bond as described
in Section 17(a) of the General Bond
Ordinance, the moneys held pursuant to this Section shall be held
and paid as provided in said Section
17(a) for unclaimed funds held by a
Paying Agent.
Section 9. Miscellaneous.
(a) Any provisions of the Codified
Ordinances of the City which are
inconsistent with the provisions of
this Ordinance and the General
Bond Ordinance shall not apply to
the Bonds or the Notes authorized
herein.
(b) All covenants, terms and provisions of the General Bond Ordinance are fully applicable to the
Bonds authorized herein, and nothing in this Ordinance shall be
deemed to alter or restrict such full
application of the General Bond
Ordinance, except for the exclusion
from application to the Bonds of the
provisions of the third paragraph of
Section 13(a) and the third paragraph of Section 4 of the General
Bond Ordinance pursuant to Section
2 of this Ordinance.
Section 10. Captions. The captions
or headings in this Ordinance are
for convenience only and in no way
define, limit or describe the scope or
intent of any provisions or sections
of this Ordinance.
Section 11. Federal Tax Covenants. The City covenants that it
will use, and will restrict the use
and investment of, the proceeds of
the Bonds in such manner and to
such extent as may be necessary so
that (a) the Bonds will not (i) constitute private activity bonds, arbitrage bonds or hedge bonds under
Sections 141, 148 or 149 of the Inter-

The City Record
nal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) or (ii) be treated
other than as bonds to which Section 103(a) of the Code applies, and
(b) the interest thereon will not be
treated as an item of tax preference
under Section 57 of the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the Bonds
