PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO
THE RULES OF THE CIVIL
SERVICE COMMISSION
6.10 Notice of Vacancy
Before any position in the classified service shall be filled the
appointing authority shall make a
written request of the Commission
for the certification of the names of
eligibles for such position and shall
state whether the employment is to
be permanent or temporary, and if
temporary, the duration and conditions of employment. Upon receipt of
such request, the Commission shall
certify to the appointing authority
the names and addresses of the
three (3) persons standing highest
on the eligible list, unless there are:
(1) individuals qualified for the
position who are on layoff status
from any classification with the
City of Cleveland for a period of
less than two (2) years who must
be considered, or (2) individuals on
a bona fide seasonal seniority list
for the classification. This section
does not supercede any collective
bargaining agreements.
If there is more than one position
to be filled, the number of names to
be certified shall be determined by
taking the next higher multiple of
four above the number of vacancies,
dividing it by two and adding the
quotient to the number of vacancies
except where the number of vacancies is itself a multiple of four (4)
in which case the number of vacancies is divided by two (2) and the
quotient added to the number of
vacancies.
Nothing herein contained shall be
so construed to prevent the Commission from certifying a larger
number of eligibles, if, in the opinion of the Commission such action
would be in the best interest of the
service. However, when there is no
eligible list for the exact position to
be filled the Commission may certify eligibles from the eligible list
most nearly appropriate to the position to be filled.

culture achievements; and
Whereas,

an
important

resource
enriching the cultural fabric of
Cleveland and our region by bringing to life ideas representing the

region and the world;
