An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances by
enacting new Section 394.071 thereof relating to transporting certain
hazardous materials by rail car
through the City.

The City Record
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
hereby supplemented by enacting
new Section 394.071 thereof, to read
as follows:
Section 394.071 Transporting Hazardous Materials by Rail Car Prohibited
(a) Findings.
This Council finds and declares
the following. That, every year in
the United States, there are derailments of trains with hazardous
cargo requiring major evacuations.
This Council finds that the volume
of rail traffic per day on Cleveland’s
Lakefront Rail Line is over 50
trains, approximately 80% of which
carry hazardous materials. That
Cleveland’s Lakefront Rail Line
goes
through
heavily
populated
areas on the east and west sides of
the City, and through the northern
rim of downtown Cleveland along
the lakefront, within one block of
buildings and museums all of which
attract thousands of people. That
the release and/or ignition of several types of the most commonly
shipped hazardous cargo on the
Lakefront Rail Line, could result in
a toxic cloud that could spread for
several miles or could result in a
spill of toxic material into Lake
Erie. This Council further finds
that, depending on the material
released, time of day and weather,
the recommended distance for initial
isolation and evacuation in the
event of a hazardous cargo release
in
a
serious
railroad
incident
extends from a few hundred feet to
several miles, potentially requiring
the evacuation or shelter-in-place of
many thousands of people in downtown Cleveland or other heavily populated areas along the Lakefront
Rail Line. Any evacuation could be
hampered by the inability to evacuate to the north, where Lake Erie
and the Lakefront Rail Line are
located. This Council finds that the
proximity of the Lakefront Rail
Line to a heavily congested city
area on one side, and to Lake Erie
on the other, poses a uniquely local
security and safety hazard, making
it incumbent upon this Council to
reduce the risk of exposure to hazardous materials to both citizens of
the City and to this City’s greatest
natural resource, Lake Erie.
This Council finds that the Cuyahoga County Local Emergency Planning Committee has recommended an
alternate rail route that traverses
less populated sections of the Cleveland metropolitan area and would
dramatically reduce the consequences
of a potential accidental release. This
Council further finds that said alternate rail route would require minimal
capital expenditures on the part of
the rail road companies. This Council finds that said alternate rail route
more closely follows the mandatory
routes for the through shipment of
hazardous materials by highway as
ordered by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio.
Therefore, in light of its findings,
in order to preserve and protect the
general health, safety, security and
welfare of the citizens of the City
of Cleveland and of Cuyahoga County, and to reduce an essentially local
safety and security hazard, this

872

May 11, 2005
Council finds that it is necessary to
prohibit large shipments of certain

Whereas,
firearms
are
easily
accessible to children in the United
States, for example, 47% of high
school students said they could
obtain a gun if they wanted to,
while 22% of middle school students
said they could get a firearm; and

881

21
Whereas, 6% of high school students said they had carried a gun
in the last 30 days; and
Whereas, in 72% of unintentional
deaths and injuries, suicide and suicide attempts with a firearm of 0-19
year olds, the firearm was stored in

homes with at least one firearm; and
Whereas, there have been incidents recently in this City involving
children
using
firearms
against
other children; and
Whereas, in the past year, this

An emergency resolution urging
the State legislature to pass Expungement Reform Legislation and
supporting the National Restoration
Movement, U.S.A., Inc., in its efforts
to obtain such reform in Ohio.
Whereas, Ohio’s current expungement laws do not allow individuals
who have paid their debt to society
to become productive members of
the community, because such laws
prohibit or prevent the individuals
from obtaining meaningful employment, sometimes for 10 or more
years; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has a very high unemployment rate

22
and many of those that are unemployed have been previously convicted of crimes, thus preventing
them from finding good paying jobs;
and
Whereas, in Ohio, a person convicted of a misdemeanor or felony
crime can be prohibited from getting employment, decent housing,
and even student loans; and
Whereas, the state of Ohio’s current law allows only a first offense
to be expunged, with a few exceptions; and
Whereas, currently in Ohio, if a
person is convicted of a misdemeanor, he may apply to have his
record expunged after one year of
the final discharge of the case; and
Whereas, if a person is convicted
of a felony, the record may be
expunged after three years after the
final discharge of the case; and
Whereas,
reform
of
Ohio’s
expungement laws should include
allowing all cases to be expugnable
after 10 years of clean conduct and
positive community living, with the
exception of murder and sexual
offenses; and
Whereas,
reforming
Ohio’s
expungement laws would allow individuals who have fulfilled their punishments under the law to again be
a productive part of the local community and broader society; and
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the State legislature to
pass Expungement Reform Legislation. and supports the National
Restoration Movement, U.S.A., Inc.,
in its efforts to obtain such reform
in Ohio.

Taft, and to Reverend Mark C. Olds,

An emergency resolution encouraging the United States Senate to
support bi-partisan S. 9 and oppose
Workforce Investment Act Plus.
Whereas,
the
local
Workforce
Investment Act program is an integral part of local economic development; and

The City Record
Whereas, in 2004, the local Workforce Investment Act assisted over
5,000 individuals and businesses;
and
Whereas, in 1998, important relationships were established between
the federal government, state governments, local governments, and
the public and private sectors in
establishing the Workforce Investment Act program; and
Whereas, the United States Senate
is currently considering legislation
to reauthorize the Workforce Investment Act; and
Whereas, passage of S. 9, introduced on January 24, 2005, will
result in positive changes in the
United States workforce investment
system and build upon progress
already made by the Workforce
Investment Act program; and
Whereas, the Local Workforce
Coalition, comprised of the National
Association of Counties, the National Association of Workforce Boards,
the National Workforce Association,
and the U.S. Conference of Mayors,
urges passage of bi-partisan S.9; and
Whereas, the Department of Labor
is proposing a Workforce Investment Act Plus Consolidated Grant
Program (“WIA Plus”); and
Whereas,
under
this
proposal,
states would have complete authority to design their workforce investment act program and could choose
to eliminate local workforce investment boards; and
Whereas, such authority is contrary to the governance relationships negotiated and agreed upon
when establishing the Workforce
Investment Act in 1998; and
Whereas, this Council is concerned about the detrimental impact
of WIA Plus on local workforce systems in the greater Cleveland, Ohio
region; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,

By Council Members Westbrook,

An emergency resolution opposing
the proposed cuts in funding to
Bridgeway’s Playhouse program, an
Alcohol and Drug Addiction Prevention
Program
for
Children
and
Youth and urging the Alcohol and
Drug Addiction Services Board of
Cuyahoga County to reinstate such
funds for this worthwhile program.
Whereas, Bridgeway is a mental
health agency that provides counseling, treatment, crisis intervention
and assisted living services for
those struggling with severe mental
illnesses, or drug and alcohol addiction; and
Whereas, the Playhouse is a program of Bridgeway that serves over
400 children and youth per year
through alcohol and drug awareness
classes taught in Cleveland schools;
and
Whereas, the Playhouse program
reaches an additional 400 youth in
its after school program, which
includes drama, dance, sports and
field trips; and
Whereas, 468 children have participated in the Playhouse after
school activities in the last 9 months
alone; and
Whereas, the Playhouse program
has kept youth off the streets and
away from drugs, alcohol and street
violence for the last 15 years; and
Whereas, programs run by the
Playhouse cost less than $250 per
youth per year; and
Whereas, the Alcohol and Drug
Addiction Services Board of Cuyahoga County has suddenly decided
to cut funding for Brigeway’s Playhouse program; and
Whereas, the proposed cuts in
funding will shut down the Playhouse program, putting an end to
the Playhouse as a safe haven for
Cleveland
youth
and
effectively
putting more than 400 children and
youth back on the streets, significantly increasing the chances that
they will become involved in drug
and/or alcohol abuse, gang related
activity and other risky or illegal
behavior; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby
opposes the proposed cuts in funding
to Bridgeway’s Playhouse program,
an Alcohol and Drug Addiction Prevention Program for Children and
Youth and urges the Alcohol and
Drug Addiction Services Board of
Cuyahoga County to reinstate such
funds for this worthwhile program.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby directed to transmit copies of

Board of Cuyahoga County, to David
J. Lundeen, President and CEO of
Bridgeway and to Cuyahoga County

An emergency resolution opposing
tax and expenditure limitation proposals, whether by constitutional
amendment or other means and supporting the principle of representative democracy as the best route to
sound state and local public policy.
Whereas, various elected officials,
organizations and individuals are
endorsing proposals to amend the
Ohio Constitution to institute constitutionally mandated Tax Expenditure Limitations (TEL) at the
state and local levels of government
; and
Whereas, one such proposal is
commonly known as “Taxpayers Bill
of Rights (TABOR)”; or Tax Expenditure Limitation (TEL) and
Whereas, those states that have
instituted proposals similar to the
Tax Expenditure Limitations’ Law,
such as Colorado, now face severe
problems in meeting the basic needs
by reducing expenditures for K-12
education
support,
reduction
of
spending
for
higher
education,
reduction of expenditures for immunizations and pre-natal care, for its
citizenry and are seeking to override
constitutionally
mandated
spending restrictions; and
Whereas,
such
TEL
proposals
would severely limit fiscal management options of elected state and
local leaders in times of crisis and
other unpredictable circumstances,
putting state and local governments
on “auto pilot” and circumventing
thoughtful and deliberative consideration of policy decisions; and
Whereas,
such
TEL
proposals
could override state constitutional
provisions requiring certain expenditures to support education and the
use of gas taxes; and
Whereas, such TEL proposals in
Ohio would reduce funding for education, health care, police, fire protection, social services and economic development; by limiting annual
aggregate state expenditures increases from the previous years
expenditures by the sum of the rate
of inflation and the rate of population change, or 3.5 percent; and
Whereas,
such
TEL
proposals
would prevent local officials from
changing priorities and subvert the
ability of legislators to set tax policy they were elected to make by
allowing for mandated expenditure
responses as required by the TEL
proposal; and
Whereas, such TEL proposals will
require the state expenditures to be
increasingly allocated as matching
funds for federal programs as a
result of mandated expenditure limitations for state supported programs; and

The City Record
Whereas, TABOR and other tax
and expenditure limitation (TEL)
legislation bring great harm to local
communities
through
continued
reductions in state funding, erode
decision-making at the local level
and the ability to provide the basic
services residents and businesses
expect and deserve; and
Whereas, such proposals would
force the state and local governments to spend valuable time and
money asking for permission from
the same people who elected them
before any action can be taken on
important issues, and would also
force taxpayers to pay twice for
governance – once for elections of
their state and local officials and
again for elections to make the decisions those officials should have
already made; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that state and local elected officials
are elected to do a job, which is to
represent the interests of their constituents, to deal with difficult decisions, and to thoughtfully debate
and determine the best course of
action for the state or the community in which they serve; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby opposes tax and expenditure limitation proposals, whether by constitutional
amendment
or
other
means and supports the principle of
representative democracy as the
best route to sound public policy.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Robert
Taft, Governor, Ken Blackwell, Secretary of State, Jon Husted, Speaker, Ohio House of Representatives,
Bill Harris, President, Ohio Senate,
C.J. Prentiss Minority Leader, Ohio
Senate,
Chris
Redfern,
Minority
Leader, Ohio Senate, to all members
of the state legislature representing
Cuyahoga County, and Susan Cave,
Executive Director, Ohio Municipal
League.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Motion to suspend rules. Charter

Res. No. 929-05.
By Council Member Conwell.
An emergency resolution urging
the federal government to intervene
to protect to automobile industry in
the United States
Whereas, this Council believes
that the economy in Ohio, as in the
United States, is near collapse, with
thousands of jobs lost daily in all

883

23
areas of industry, including the
automobile, machine and steel industries; and
Whereas, certain stop-gap measures should be adopted and implemented by Congress to forestall the
presently
threatened,
irreparable
damage to our nation’s physical
economy, which is typified by the
presently accelerating crisis in the
U.S. automobile industry; and
Whereas,
the
U.S.
automobile
industry is $475 billion dollars in
debt, and its bond rating has been
recently lowered to junk bond status, making filing for bankruptcy
by the leading automobile manufacturers a very real possibility; and
Whereas, it is conceivable that the
automobile industry’s leading manufacturers could close most, if not all
its factories in the United States,
including in Ohio; and
Whereas, the closing down of even
some of the automobile factories,
including the shut down of machine
tool production, would mean both the
end of the United States as a leading physical economic power and
cause chain reaction damage to the
world economy; and
Whereas, the U.S. Congress has
the capability to intervene on behalf
of the automobile industry to ensure
that the continued employment of
that industry’s labor force remains
functioning in each and every present locality of employment; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that the U.S. Congress can and must
intervene, on behalf of national and
related interests, to ensure that the
productive potential of the automobile industry, with its featured high
technology and machine tool capability, be held together in place and
intact; and
Whereas, the impact of such Congressional intervention on the City
of Cleveland will be thousands of
new jobs repairing infrastructure,
maintenance of automobile production jobs, restoration of the tax base
and ultimately, an increase in the
standard of living in the City; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the federal government to
intervene to protect to automobile
industry in the United States.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to all members of the
U.S. Congress and to President
George W. Bush.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

An
emergency
resolution
condemning the recent incidents of violence and assault by school-age children and youth at the city’s public
schools and urging the Campbell
administration and the municipal
school district to enforce all laws
that apply to this conduct, including
those that hold parents responsible
for their children’s actions.
Whereas, there have been far too
many reports recently of violence,
assaults and rioting in schools in
the Cleveland Public School system;
and
Whereas,
these
incidents
on
school grounds have made increased
demands on school security and the
police department; and
Whereas, too many of these incidents go unreported, or, if reported,
the perpetrators go unpunished because of the failure to enforce the
laws currently available to help
bring such perpetrators to justice;
and
Whereas, several of the current
laws hold parents accountable for
failure to supervise their children;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,

Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council condemns the recent incidents of violence and assault by school-age
children and youth at the city’s public schools and urges the Campbell
administration and the municipal

By Mayor Campbell.
An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting
new Section 413.031 relating to the
use of automated cameras to impose
civil penalties upon red light and
speeding violators; and authorizing
the Director of Public Safety to
enter into one or more contracts
with a consultant or consultants to
install and maintain automated cameras.
Whereas, under Article 18, Sec. 3
of the Ohio Constitution, the City of
Cleveland has all powers of local
self-government; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
exercises its powers of local selfgovernment through its charter; and
Whereas, a fundamental purpose
of local self-government is the protection of the health, safety, and
welfare of the citizenry; and
Whereas, red light crashing and
speeding
cause
needless
serious
injuries and death; and
Whereas, the incidence of red
light running and speeding will be
reduced through this program; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
supplemented by enacting new Section 413.031 to read as follows:
Section 413.031 Use of Automated
Cameras to Impose Civil Penalties
upon Red Light and Speeding Violators
Civil
enforcement
system
(a)
established. The City of Cleveland
hereby adopts a civil enforcement
system for red light and speeding
offenders photographed by means of
an “automated traffic enforcement
camera system” as defined in division (m). This civil enforcement system imposes monetary liability on
the owner of a vehicle for failure of
an operator to stop at a traffic signal displaying a steady red light
indication or for the failure of an
operator to comply with a speed limitation.
(b) Red light offense - liability
imposed. The owner of a vehicle
shall be liable for the penalty
imposed under this section if the
vehicle crosses a marked stop line
or the intersection plane at a system location when the traffic signal
for that vehicle’s direction is emitting a steady red light.
(c) Speeding offense - liability
imposed. The owner of a vehicle
shall be liable for the penalty
imposed under this section if the
vehicle is operated at a speed in
excess of the limitations set forth in
Section 433.03.
(d) Liability does not constitute a
conviction. The imposition of liability under this section shall not be
deemed a conviction for any purpose
and shall not be made part of the
operating record of any person on
whom the liability is imposed.
(e) Other offenses and penalties
not abrogated. Nothing in this section shall be construed as altering
or limiting Sections 433.03 or 413.03
of these Codified Ordinances, the

896

May 11, 2005
criminal penalties imposed by those
sections, or the ability of a police
officer to enforce those sections
against any offender observed by
the officer violating either of those
sections. Nothing in this section
shall be construed to limit the liability of an operator of a vehicle for
any violation of division (b) or (c)
of this section.
(f) Selection of camera sites. The
selection of the sites where automated cameras are placed and the
enforcement of this ordinance shall
be made on the basis of sound professional traffic engineering and
law enforcement judgments. Automated cameras shall not be placed
at any site where the speed restrictions or the timing of the traffic signal fail to conform to sound professional traffic engineering principles.
(g) Site selection. Each site of a
red light camera or fixed speed camera shall be selected by ordinance
of Council properly published in the
City Record amending this section
to include the sites.
The Director of Public Safety
shall cause the general public to be
notified by means of a press release
issued at least thirty days before
any given camera is made fullyoperational and is used to issue tickets to offenders. Before a given camera issues actual tickets, there shall
be a period of at least two weeks,
which may run concurrently with
the 30-day public-notice period, during which only “warning” notices
shall be issued.
At each site of a red light or fixed
speed camera, the Director of Public Service shall cause signs to be
posted to apprise ordinarily observant
motorists
that
they
are
approaching an area where an automated camera is monitoring for red
light or speed violators. Mobile
speed units shall be plainly marked
vehicles.
(h) Notices of liability. Any ticket for an automated red light or
speeding system violation under this
section shall:
(1) Be reviewed by a Cleveland
police officer;
(2) Be forwarded by first-class
mail or personal service to the vehicle’s registered owner’s address as
given on the state’s motor vehicle
registration, and
(3) Clearly state the manner in
which the violation may be appealed.
(i) Penalties. Any violation of
division (b) or division (c) of this
section shall be deemed a noncriminal violation for which a civil penalty shall be assessed and for which
no points authorized by Section
4507.021 of the Revised Code (“Point
system
for
license
suspension”)
shall be assigned to the owner or
driver of the vehicle.
(j) Ticket evaluation, public service, and appeals. The program
shall include a fair and sound ticket-evaluation process that includes
review by the vendor and a police
officer, a strong customer-service
commitment, and an appeals process
that accords due process to the ticket respondent and that conforms to
the
requirements
of
the
Ohio
Revised Code.
(k) Appeals. A notice of appeal
shall be filed with the Hearing Officer within twenty-one (21) days
from the date listed on the ticket.
The failure to give notice of appeal

May 11, 2005
or pay the civil penalty within this
time period shall constitute a waiver of the right to contest the ticket
and shall be considered an admission.
Appeals shall be heard by the
Parking Violations Bureau through
an administrative process established by the Clerk of the Cleveland
Municipal Court. At hearings, the
strict rules of evidence applicable to
courts of law shall not apply. The
contents of the ticket shall constitute a prima facie evidence of the
facts it contains. Liability may be
found by the hearing examiner
based upon a preponderance of the
evidence. If a finding of liability is
appealed, the record of the case
shall include the order of the Parking Violations Bureau, the Ticket,
other evidence submitted by the
respondent or the City of Cleveland,
and a transcript or record of the
hearing, in a written or electronic
form acceptable to the court to
which the case is appealed.
Liability shall not be found where
the evidence shows that the automated camera captured an event is
not an offense, including each of the
following events and such others as
may be established by rules and regulations issued by the Director of
Public Safety under the authority of
division (n) of this section:
1) The motorist stops in time to
avoid violating a red light indication;
2) The motorist proceeds through
a red light indication as part of
funeral procession;
3) The motorist is operating a
City-owned emergency vehicle with
its emergency lights activated and
proceeds through a red light indication or exceeds the posted speed limitation;
4) The motorist is directed by a
police officer on the scene contrary
to the traffic signal indication.
Liability shall also be excused if
a vehicle is observed committing an
offense
where
the
vehicle
was
stolen prior to the offense and the
owner has filed a police report;
The Director of Public Safety, in
coordination with the Parking Violations Bureau, shall establish a
process by which a vehicle owner
who was not the driver at the time
of the alleged offense may, by affidavit, name the person who the
owner believes was driving the vehicle at the time. Upon receipt of such
an affidavit timely submitted to the
Parking
Violations
Bureau,
the
Bureau shall suspend further action
against the owner of the vehicle and
instead direct notices and collection
efforts to the person identified in
the affidavit. If the person named in
the affidavit, when notified, denies
being the driver or denies liability,
then the Parking Violations Bureau
shall resume the notice and collection process against the vehicle
owner, the same as if no affidavit
had been submitted, and if the violation is found to have been committed by a preponderance of evidence, the owner shall be liable for
any
penalties
imposed
for
the
offense.
A decision in favor of the City of
Cleveland may be enforced by means
of a civil action or any other means
provided by the Revised Code.
(l) Evidence of ownership. It is
prima facie evidence that the person
registered as the owner of the vehi-

Vehicles, or with any other State
vehicle registration office, was operating the vehicle at the time of the
offenses set out in divisions (b) and
(c) of this section.

The
(m)
Director of Public Safety shall oversee the program authorized by this
Section. The selection of the locations of automated cameras shall be

specified in division (g), upon nomination of the Director of Public
Safety, in consultation with the
appropriate council members, the
Director
of
Public
Service,
the
Police Traffic Commissioner, and
the Commissioner of Traffic Engineering. The Director of Public Service shall oversee the installation
and maintenance of all automated
cameras. An encroachment permit
shall be authorized in the legislation in which locations are selected.
(n) Rules and Regulations. The
Director of Public Safety may issue
rules and regulations to carry out
the provisions of these sections,
which shall be effective thirty (30)
days after publication in the City
Record.
