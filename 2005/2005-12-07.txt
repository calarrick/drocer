An emergency resolution objecting to the transfer of stock of a C1,
C2 and D6 Liquor Permit to 14510
Kinsman Avenue.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Department of Liquor
Control of an application for a transfer of stock of a C1, C2 and D6
Liquor Permit at 14510, Inc., DBA
Kinsman Sunoco, 14510 Kinsman
Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44120, Permanent Number 6549670; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and

The City Record
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of
notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby record its objection to a transfer
of stock of a C1, C2 and D6 Liquor

Sunoco,

An emergency resolution in support of the Federal Communications
Commission’s upcoming report that
favors consumers being able to purchase cable/satellite channels individually, or a la carte, rather than
in bundled packages, and urging
federal lawmakers to rewrite regulations to allow the cable industry
to offer cable/satellite channels a la
carte.
Whereas, cable companies sell
channels
to
consumers
bundled
together in “packages” as opposed to
individually, or “a la carte”; and
Whereas,
consumer
advocates
have pushed for years for a la carte
pricing saying it would result in

2578

December 7, 2005
lower programming costs and higher-quality programs; and
Whereas, the average cable/satellite-connected
household
actually
watches about 17 of the nearly 90
channels usually available; and
Whereas, the Federal Communications Commission is preparing a
report finding that pick and choose
channel selection would allow the
average cable/satellite household to
save money; and
Whereas, further, the FCC report
finds
that
the
cable
industry
should offer channels a la carte,
thereby allowing the consumer to
choose which channels they purchase; and
Whereas, by making it possible to
keep some of the objectionable channels out of their homes, the public
will be less inclined to ask that Congress set decency standards for private-access channels; and
Whereas, Congress should listen
to the FCC and to consumers and
rewrite the cable regulations to
allow the cable industry to offer al
la carte service; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports the Federal Communications
Commission’s
upcoming
report that favors consumers being
able
to
purchase
cable/satellite
channels individually, or a la carte,
rather than in bundled packages,
and urges federal lawmakers to
rewrite regulations to allow the
cable industry to offer cable/satellite channels a la carte.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to forward copies of
this resolution to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Kevin
Martin, and to the members of both
the House and the Senate Commerce
Committees.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it

and White.
An emergency resolution urging
the PUCO to adopt rules to protect
consumers from unjustified and substantial increases in basic local service rates, permit stakeholders adequate and fair opportunity to oppose
applications
for
increased
basic
local service rates, provide benefits
for
low
income
consumers
and
impose broadband access requirements.

December 7, 2005
Whereas, on August 5, 2005, Governor Bob Taft signed H.B. 218,
which revises various Ohio laws
dealing
with
telecommunications
including the provision of basic
local phone service; and
Whereas, H.B. 218 authorizes the
Public Utilities Commission of Ohio
(the “PUCO”) to adopt alternative
methods of regulating the rates paid
by consumers for basic local phone
service; and
Whereas, the PUCO is considering
rule changes that would allow telephone service providers to increase
rates up to 20% per year under a
competitive system, even when such
increases would not be justified by
the cost of providing that service;
and
Whereas, this Council strongly
believes that the new rules proposed by the PUCO do not adequately require telephone service
providers to demonstrate that increased local service rates are justified, do not allow sufficient time
for stakeholders to oppose rate
increases,
allow
excessive
rate
increases and do not require consumer benefits including rate subsidy programs for low income consumers or broadband access commitments; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that the proposed PUCO rules do not
adequately protect low and middle
income consumers in the City of
Cleveland
from
substantial
and
unjustified increases in basic local
telephone service rates; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council
strongly urges the PUCO to adopt
rules to protect consumers from
unjustified
and
substantial
increases
in
basic
local
service
rates, permit stakeholders adequate and fair opportunity to oppose applications for increased
basic local service rates, provide
benefits
for
low
income
consumers
and
impose
broadband
access requirements.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to transmit
a copy of this resolution to Ohio
Governor Bob Taft, PUCO Chairman
Schriber, PUCO Commissioners Fergus, Jones, Mason and Rogers and
to Ohio Consumers’ Counsel Janine
L. Migden-Ostrander.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Res. No. 2265-05.
By Council Members Zone, Kelley,
Coats,
Pierce
Scott,
Cimperman,
Sweeney, Westbrook, Knight, Lewis,
Polensek, Reed, Britt and Conwell.
An emergency resolution urging
the PUCO to consider rule changes
that, to the maximum extent, preserve the OCC toll-free call center
number on utility bills, disconnection notices and literature that may
be sent with utility bills and encouraging the PUCO to provide consumers
with
information
about
direct access to OCC’s many services
in order that consumers may obtain
utility related information and assistance.
Whereas, the Office of Consumers’
Counsel (“OCC”) was created under
Chapter 4911 of the Ohio Revised
Code and has the statutory mandate
to serve as advocate for the state’s
residential utility customers; and
Whereas, OCC maintains a tollfree consumer call center where utility consumers can obtain assistance
and address problems on a wide
range of utility- related concerns;
and
Whereas, in response to the passage of House Bill 66 by the Ohio
House of Representatives, this Council passed Resolution No. 1076-05 on
May 23, 2005, urging the Ohio legislature to restore full funding for
OCC and to retain the OCC’s toll-free
consumer call center; and
Whereas, newly enacted sections
of the Ohio Revised Code require
that consumer calls regarding utility bill complaints formerly handled
by the OCC toll-free call center must
now be referred to the call center
operated by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (the “PUCO”); and
Whereas, the PUCO, pursuant to
the newly enacted Ohio Revised
Code sections, is considering administrative rule changes that would
eliminate or change references on
consumer utility bills, disconnection
notices and other literature sent
with utility bills in such a way as
to discourage or prohibit consumers
from contacting OCC about concerns
with quality of service, obtaining
financial assistance, avoiding disconnection of utility services, home
weatherization programs and purchasing utility services under the
state’s customer choice programs;
and
Whereas, this Council strongly
believes that utility consumers in
Cleveland and across the state are
facing record-high energy and fuel
bills during the winter of 2005-2006
and that the proposed PUCO rule
changes will have the effect of
denying consumers direct access to
the many services of OCC; and
Whereas, this Council strongly
believes that the rule changes contemplated by the PUCO are not
required by or consistent with state
law and prohibit the OCC from fulfilling many of its statutory responsibilities as the statutory residential
consumer advocate; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

The following measure will be on

ORDINANCE
Ord. No. 1780-05.
By Mayor Campbell.
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Economic Development to enter into a Tax Increment Financing Agreement with
Steelyard Commons LLC, to provide
for payments to the Cleveland City
School District and to provide for
the creation of the Steelyard Commons TIF Fund to be used for development and recreational improvements; and to declare certain improvements to real property to be a
public purpose.
Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of
the Revised Code, improvements to
real property may be declared to be
a public purpose where fee title to
such real property was, at one time,
held by the City of Cleveland and
the real property is then leased or
conveyed by the City; and
Whereas, under the authority of
Ordinance No. 1541-04, passed October 17, 2005, and prior to the passage of this ordinance, the City
approved both the acquisition and
conveyance of fee title to certain
real property, which is more particularly described in the documents
set
forth
in
the
file
described in this ordinance (the
“Real Property”); and
Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of
the Revised Code, such improvements so declared to be a public purpose may be exempt from real property taxation; and

The City Record
Whereas, under Section 5709.42 of
the Revised Code, the owners of the
improvements may be required to
make annual service payments in
lieu of taxes that would have been
paid had such improvements not
been exempt; and
Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of
the Revised Code, the exemption
may exceed 75% of the improvements for up to 30 years without the
approval of the board of education
of the school district within the territory of which the improvements
are or will be located if the ordinance declaring improvements to a
parcel to be a public purpose specifies that service payments in lieu of
taxes provided for in Section 5709.42
of the Ohio Revised Code shall be
paid to the school district in which
the parcel is located in the amount
of the taxes that would have been
payable to the school district if the
improvements had not been exempted from taxation; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That pursuant to and in
accordance with the provisions of
Section 5709.41 of the Revised Code,
this Council finds and determines
that 100% of the increase in assessed value of the Property after
its acquisition by the City (which
increase in assessed value is referred to as “Improvement” as defined in Section 5709.41 of the Revised Code) will be a public purpose.
Section 2. That one hundred percent (100%) of the Improvements
are declared exempt from real property taxation for a period of 20
years beginning _________ 2005; and
that in no event shall the exemption
period extend beyond ________, 2026.
Section 3. That, under Section
5709.42 of the Revised Code, the
owners of the Improvements shall
make service payments for a period
of 20 years in lieu of the exempt
taxes to the Cuyahoga County Treasurer;
the
payments
shall
be
charged and collected in the same
manner, and shall be in an amount
not less than the taxes that would
have been paid had the Improvements not been exempt from taxation.
Section 4. That a portion of the
service payments collected under
Section 3 of this ordinance shall be
distributed by the Cuyahoga County
Treasurer to the Treasurer of the
Cleveland Municipal School District
(“District”) in the amount of the
taxes that would have been payable
to the District had the Improvement
not been exempt from taxation.
Section 5. That the Mayor or
Director of Economic Development,
with the approval of the Director of
Law, is authorized to enter into one
or more agreements with such parties as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the purposes of
this ordinance.
Section 6. That under Section
5709.43 of the Revised Code there is
hereby established a Steelyard Commons Urban Redevelopment Tax
Increment Equivalent Fund (“Steel-

2585

25
yard Commons TIF Fund”), 70% of
which shall be used for acquisition
of land and to make improvements
to the Tow Path Trail and Canal
Basin Park. Of this 70%, if there are
remaining funds, they shall be used
for additional connector trails.
The remaining 30% shall be used
for retail assistance programs and
other commercial and industrial initiatives, including land acquisition,
within the City. This 30% will be
used primarily for projects that offset the impacts of Steelyard Commons on adjacent neighborhood commercial districts, and use of these
funds will be guided by the retail
impact study currently underway.
These funds will be disbursed quarterly as grants, on a competitive
basis, under criteria established by
this Council and the Cleveland Citywide
Development
Corporation
(CCDC). The CCDC will evaluate
applications and make recommendations to this Council. Projects in the
following categories will be eligible:

Businesses: to assist with small

plans, assist entrepreneurs to “get

Neighborhood
Industrial
Sites:

Section 7. That the service payments collected under Section 3
shall be distributed by the Cuyahoga County Treasurer to the Treasurer of the City of Cleveland to be
deposited in the Steelyard Commons
TIF Fund created by Section 6.
With the approval of the Director of
Economic
Development
and
the
Director of Law, money deposited in
the Steelyard Commons TIF Fund
shall be used to for the purposes
described in Section 6.
Section 8. That the Director of the
Office of Equal Opportunity shall
engage in discussions with the
County Engineer to explore how
employment of local residents and
minority and female business enterprises can best be advanced. The
Director of the Office of Equal
Opportunity shall report back to this
Council on the results of those discussions and shall make recommendations on how to achieve those
goals.
Section 9. That the signed letter
from Mitchell Schneider, President
of First Interstate Properties Ltd.,
dated December 2, 2005 to the Council Member of Ward 13 shall be
placed in File No. 1780-05-A.

December 7, 2005
Charge”, and adding a new section
entitled Energy Adjustment Charge
which fixes certain rates, rules and
regulations relating to electric service, subject to the approval of the
Council of the City of Cleveland, as
follows:
Energy Adjustment Charge
(a) An additional incremental
charge for excess fuel and power
production
and
purchase
power
costs may be applied to the rates
prescribed
in
Section
523.02
to
523.065 and any other rate schedule
as may be adopted by the City.
(b) The incremental charge shall
be based on the fuel and purchase
power cost per kilowatt hour delivered
calculated
under
divisions
(c)(1) and (2) of this section, and
shall not be less than the charge
calculated under the divisions on
October 1, 1997.
(c)(1) The fuel and purchase
power cost per kilowatt hour sold to
residential ratepayers shall be determined by dividing the sum of the
cost of the kilowatt hours purchased
from the Power Authority of the
State of New York and the average
cost of kilowatt hours purchased
from other sources needed to supply
the residential customers. For the
period ending December 31, 2008, the
incremental charge calculated herein shall be adjusted by subtracting
15 mils per kilowatt hour for residential customers who proved the
Division of Cleveland Public Power
with a certificate of reduction of
taxes obtained pursuant to the
Homestead Exemption provisions of
Sections 323.151 through 323.157 of
the Revised Code, and 9.75 mils per
kilowatt hour for all other residential customers. Beginning on January 1, 2009, the incremental charge
for all residential customers shall be
adjusted by subtracting 15 mils per
kilowatt hour.
(2) Except as provided in Section
523.048, the fuel and purchase power
cost per kilowatt hour sold to all
ratepayers, other than residential
ratepayers,
during
the
twelve
months of the year, shall be determined by dividing the sum of the
total cost of coal, oil, gas and purchase power by the total kilowatt
hours distributed, except that the
computation shall exclude the cost
of PASNY power and the amount of
PASNY power allocable to kilowatt
hours distributed, and shall exclude
the costs of all purchase power from
a specific source or sources purchased by the Division for distribution to ratepayers pursuant to Section 523.048. For the period ending
December 31, 2008, the incremental
charge calculated herein shall be
adjusted by subtracting 3.0 mils per
kilowatt hour. Beginning on January 1, 2009, such incremental charge
shall be adjusted by subtracting 15
mils per kilowatt hour.
(d) At the end of each month, the
Division of Cleveland Public Power
shall determine the excess fuel and
power charge during the month as
herein provided.
Be it further resolved by the
Board of Control of the City of
Cleveland that all other provisions
of Resolution No. 79-00, adopted February 16, 2000, not expressly amended by this resolution shall remain

is to be made for parking on the lot;
(3) the lot is not to be used for
sales, repair work or servicing of
any kind; (4) entrance to and exit

are to be adequately screened from
the street and adjoining residential

(a) When a resident is subject to

in another municipality on the same
income taxable under this chapter,
regardless of whether such other

residents, and the rate of Cleveland’s
municipal income tax is less than

the amount of income tax paid to the
other municipality, but not in excess
of fifty percent (50%) of the tax
imposed by this chapter.

municipal income tax in another
municipality on the same income taxable under this chapter regardless of
whether
such
other
municipality
allows a credit to its residents and
the rate of Cleveland’s municipal
income tax is two and one-half percent (2.5%) or more, such resident

(c) Assignment of any claim for
refund to which a resident may be
entitled from another municipality
shall be tentatively accepted as payment of that portion of city income

However, if satisfactory evidence is
offered that the taxpayer is entitled
to the claim covered by the assignment, such taxpayer shall not be
deprived of credit therefor because
of fault or neglect on the part of
either municipality.
(d) In the event such resident
fails, neglects or refuses to file such
return or form as is prescribed by
the Tax Administrator, such resident shall not be entitled to such
credit and shall be considered in violation of this chapter for failure to
file a return and make payment of
taxes due hereunder.
(e) A resident owner of a passthrough entity that does not conduct
business in the City and that has
paid an income tax to another
municipality may claim a credit
equal to the lesser of (i) the resident owner’s proportionate share of
the amount, if any, of income tax
paid by the pass-through entity to
another municipality in the State; or
(ii) the resident owner’s proportionate share of the amount of city
income tax that would be imposed
on the pass-through entity if the
pass-through entity conducted business in the City.
(f) In no case shall the amount of
the credit allowed under division (e)
of this Section exceed the tax
assessed by this chapter on the resident owner’s taxable income subject to tax by another municipality.
(g) The credits provided in Section 718.021 and 718.121 shall be
available to residents, if applicable.
