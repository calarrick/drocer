An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting
new Sections 3106.01 to 3106.04 and
3106.99 relating to notification of
foreclosure filing.

Whereas,
recent
studies
have
shown that there has been a drastic
rise in foreclosure filings in Cleveland; and
Whereas, a foreclosure filing is
often an early-warning signal that a
property is in decline and headed
towards vacancy; and
Whereas, the presence of vacant
properties in our neighborhoods contributes to blight and lowered quality of life; and
Whereas, immediate notice of a
foreclosure filing would enable the
City and the public to monitor specific properties in an effort to
address problems before the structure becomes vacant and abandoned;

Cleveland on which there is a building or structure shall notify the City
of the filing of the foreclosure complaint and shall file a complete copy
of the foreclosure complaint with
the Director of Building and Housing within ten (10) days after the
filing of that complaint with the
relevant court. The notice to the

7
City shall be on a form prescribed
by the Director.
Section 3106.03

responsible
for
maintaining
the
property.
(b) If the building or structure on
the property that is the subject of
foreclosure becomes vacant at any
time after the foreclosure complaint

contact information for the person
who will be responsible for maintaining the property.
Section 3106.04 Fees
The fee for notice of a foreclosed
property is sixty dollars ($60.00).
The fee shall be paid at the time of

Whereas, at the age of twenty,
Rosa married a barber named Raymond Parks; and
Whereas, on December 1, 1955,
Rosa Parks refused to give up her
bus seat to a white passenger in
Montgomery, Alabama, resulting in
her arrest; and
Whereas, Rosa Parks’ defiance
triggered the famous Montgomery
bus boycott and earned her the title
“Mother of the Civil Rights Movement”; and
Whereas, the 382 day boycott
introduced the world to Reverend
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. who was
President
of
the
Montgomery
Improvement Association and the

Whereas, the federal district court
on June 4, 1956, ruled bus segregation unconstitutional; and

An emergency resolution supporting and encouraging full participation in the Automotive Industry
Summit and supporting efforts to
protect the American automotive
industry.
Whereas, community response to
local industries in crisis and threatened with closure, such as hospitals,

2354

November 2, 2005
steel mills, the defense finance
agency, and NASA, have resulted in
a community response changing the
direction of industry action; and
Whereas, Cleveland’s local economy is dependent on the automotive
industry; and
Whereas, the nation’s automotive
industry is in crisis as signified by
the
Delphi
bankruptcy,
General
Motor’s proposed cut in health benefits to its workers, and Ford’s projected cutbacks; and
Whereas, all of these occurrences
could have a negative impact on
Cleveland’s
automotive
industry;
and
Whereas, the federal, state, county, and local governments need to
support the automotive industry and
its workers; and
Whereas,
automotive
industry
jobs are important to the local and
national economy; and
Whereas, GM Canada and Ford
Canada are in a stronger position
because the Canadian government
provides universal health care to all
of its citizens, including automotive
industry workers; and
Whereas, even though many local
automotive industry jobs are located in the suburbs of the City of
Cleveland, many automotive workers live in the City of Cleveland and
many jobs related to the automotive
industry are in the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, many of the problems
facing the automotive industry are
the result of the deindustrialization
of our nation and are frequently
beyond the jurisdiction of local governments; and
Whereas, as a result of deindustrialization and the loss of important manufacturing jobs in the automotive industry and other industries, our standard of living is
decreasing, families encounter more
challenges,
and
today’s
young
adults are not as financially secure
as the preceding generation; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
the State of Ohio, and the United
States of America have a workforce
second to none; and
Whereas, today’s work force, like
previous generations, needs health
care; and
Whereas,
today’s
seniors
and
retirees need health care; and
Whereas, corporate pensions are
being reduced or eliminated by corporate bankruptcies and cutbacks;
and
Whereas, the Pension Benefits
Guaranty
Corporation
is
being
tapped out; and
Whereas, when the automotive
industry fails, other industries are
negatively impacted; and
Whereas, our country cannot survive without manufacturing; and
Whereas, the United States lacks,
but needs, a manufacturing policy,
and
Whereas, the automotive, steel,
and aerospace industries are essential to national security; and
Whereas, on October 25, 2005, Congressman Dennis Kucinich convened
the Automotive Industry Summit to
draw attention to the plight of local
workers and the state of the automotive industry and to bring together those impacted by current trends
with government officials at the

November 2, 2005
local, county, state, and federal levels in a bipartisan and nonpartisan
manner to address these issues; and

By

An emergency resolution encouraging the state to support businesses that provide assistance to parents
of children with disabilities.
Whereas, the incidence of U.S.
children and teenagers with a disabling condition has tripled to 7%
from 2% in 1960; and
Whereas, today, an estimated one
in 12 U.S. workers has a child with
a disability or special need; and
Whereas, stigma and fear of
reprisal have kept many workers
from disclosing their family situations; and
Whereas, having a child with a
disability requires time and effort to
find and manage treatment, forcing
30% of parents to quit or cut back
at work; and
Whereas, few parents, however,
can afford to cut back: over 40% of

The City Record
families
with
special-needs
kids
have financial problems because of
care costs; 60% of children with special needs rely on their parents’
employers for health insurance; and
Whereas, there are some companies that have instituted support
groups or have formed parent-networks for parents of special needs
children; and
Whereas, a few companies have
even expanded insurance coverage
for special-needs kids; and
Whereas, in order that more businesses provide much needed assistance to workers who have special
needs children, the state should do
what it can to ensure that such businesses are supported; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby encourages the state to support
businesses that provide assistance
to parents of children with disabilities.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted October 24, 2005.
Effective November 1, 2005.

Res. No. 2006-05.
By Council Members Zone, Sweeney, Conwell, Knight, Lewis, Cimperman, Brady, Westbrook and Coats.
An emergency resolution supporting Senate Bill 85 and encouraging
the Ohio Senate to pass Senate Bill
85.
Whereas, bankruptcy is a middle
class family issue as a family with
children is three times more likely
to file for bankruptcy than a family without children and the typical
bankruptcy filer is middle class
with an above-average education
and owns a home; and
Whereas, new federal bankruptcy
legislation took effect on October 17,
2005 that makes it considerably
more difficult for Ohio’s working
families to climb out from an evergrowing mountain of debt caused
predominantly by medical bills, job
loss, and divorce; and
Whereas, this new federal bankruptcy legislation allows state legislatures to increase the amount of
equity filers may have in their
homes and cars; and
Whereas, passage of Senate Bill
85, “The Fighting Chance for Working Families Act of 2005”, raises the
home and auto equity exemptions in
Ohio law to match those at the federal level; and
Whereas, Senate Bill 85 would increase the amount of equity a married couple has in the home from
$10,000 to $30,000 and the amount of
auto equity would increase from
$1,500 to $2,500; and

2366

November 2, 2005
Whereas, the current state limits
were established more than two
decades ago when the average home
price in the state was between
$40,000 and $50,000; and
Whereas, failure to pass Senate
Bill 85 will result in more Ohio middle class families losing their homes
to foreclosure; and
Whereas, increased home foreclosures result in the deteriorating of
residential neighborhoods; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports Senate Bill 85 and encourages
the Ohio Senate to pass Senate Bill
85 as it raises the home and auto
equity exemptions in Ohio bankruptcy law to match those exemptions at the federal level.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to all members of the Ohio Senate.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted October 24, 2005.
Effective November 1, 2005.
