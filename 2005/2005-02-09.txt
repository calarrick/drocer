account any original issue discount
and/or premium on the sale of the
Bonds in order to refund the Refunded Bonds and pay any expenses
relating to the refunding of the
Refunded Bonds and the issuance of
the Bonds. That amount shall be set
forth in the certificate providing for
the final terms of the Bonds and the
sale of the Bonds and signed by the
Director of Finance in accordance
with this Ordinance (the “Certificate
of Award”). The Director of Finance
may determine in the Certificate of
Award that additional maturities or
different maturities of the series of
unvoted general obligation bonds of
the City identified in the preambles
of this Ordinance and issued for the
purpose of providing funds to pay
costs of Projects 1 through 38 may
be refunded and thereby constitute
Refunded Bonds; provided that in
adding or changing such maturities
the Director of Finance determines,
based on written advice from the
City’s Financial Advisor (defined in
Section 13 below), that the aggregate present value debt service savings to the City resulting from the
refunding of all the Refunded Bonds
is not less than three per cent (3%).
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Revised
Code Chapter 133 and other applicable provisions of the Revised Code,
the Charter of the City, the General
Bond Ordinance and this Ordinance
in the principal amount and for the
purpose stated in Section 1. The
Bonds shall be designated “General
Obligation Refunding Bonds, Series
2005”. The Bonds shall be issued in
one lot as fully registered Bonds in
denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof but in no case
as to a particular maturity date
exceeding
the
principal
amount
maturing on that date. The Bonds
shall be numbered as determined by
the Director of Finance.
The Bonds shall be dated as of
April 1, 2005 or such other date, but
in no event later than December 31,
2005, specified in the certificate of
award providing for the final terms
of the Bonds and the sale of the
Bonds and signed by the Director of
Finance in accordance with this
Ordinance
(the
“Certificate
of
Award”). The Bonds shall bear
interest at the rate or rates per year
specified
in
the
Certificate
of
Award; provided that if all the
Bonds bear interest at the same
rate, then such rate shall not exceed
six percent (6%) per year, and if
the Bonds bear interest at more than
one rate, then the weighted average
of such rates (taking into account
the principal amount and maturity
of each Bond to which a rate
applies) shall not exceed six percent
(6%) per year. Interest on the
Bonds shall be payable, until the
principal amount is paid, semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each
year or on the first day of each of
two months specified in the Certificate of Award as the dates on which
interest on the Bonds shall be
payable
(the
“Interest
Payment
Dates”), beginning October 1, 2005,
or on such other Interest Payment
Date specified in the Certificate of
Award as the first Interest Payment
Date.
The Bonds shall mature in the
years and principal amounts as
shall be determined by the Director

144

February 9, 2005
of Finance and specified in the Certificate of Award, based on the written advice of a Financial Advisor to
be in the best interests of the City
given market conditions at the time
the Bonds are sold and the objectives of the plan of refunding to
obtain aggregate present value savings of not less than three per cent
(3%). Provided, further, that: (i)
each principal payment shall occur
on an Interest Payment Date, (ii)
the first principal payment on the
Bonds shall be no earlier than October 1, 2005 and no later than October 1, 2007, and (iii) the final maturity date of the Bonds shall be no
later than the last maturity permitted by law for the Refunded Bonds.
The Director of Finance also shall
determine and certify, on or prior to
the date of delivery of the Bonds to
the Original Purchaser, that portion
of the aggregate principal amount
of the Bonds that is allocable to
each Project, and the principal
amount of Bonds allocated to each
Project that shall be payable at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements (as defined below) on
the applicable principal payment
dates; provided, that (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds
allocable to a Project shall be determined by the Director of Finance on
a pro rata basis by reference to the
respective amount of funds that is
required for the refunding of the
Refunded Bonds that are allocable
to that Project, taking into account
any funds other than the proceeds
of the Bonds that are available and
appropriated for that purpose, and
(ii) no portion of the aggregate
principal amount of Bonds allocated
to a Project shall be payable later
than the maximum maturity for that
portion of the Bonds as certified by
the Director of Finance.
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the
“Mandatory
Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the “Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption prior to stated maturity
as follows:
(a) Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent,
currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of
and interest on any Term Bonds
shall include amounts sufficient to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemp-

February 9, 2005
tion Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City
for any Term Bonds. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds which
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements)
or
purchased for cancellation and canceled
by the Registrar, to the extent not
applied
theretofore
as
a
credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of
the principal amount thereof against
the then current Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement (and
corresponding mandatory redemption obligation). Any excess of that
amount
over
the
then
current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement shall be credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligations) in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(b)
Optional
Redemption.
The
Bonds may be subject to redemption
prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole or in
part on any date, in integral multiples of $5,000, on the optional
redemption dates and at the redemption prices (expressed as a percentage
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed) specified in the Certificate of Award, plus, in each case,
accrued interest to the redemption
date. The first optional redemption
date shall not be later than October
1, 2016 and the highest redemption
price shall not be greater than 102%
of the principal amount redeemed.
Based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, the Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that it is in the
best interests of the City for some
or all of the Bonds not to be callable
prior to their stated maturity.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or

The City Record
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar. That notice shall specify
the redemption date and the principal amount of each maturity of
Bonds to be redeemed, and shall be
given at least forty-five (45) days
prior to the redemption date or such
shorter period as shall be acceptable
to the Registrar. There shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, funds
sufficient to redeem at the redemption price, all of the redeemable
Bonds for which notice of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Bonds by lot when Bonds of
denominations greater than $5,000
are then outstanding, each $5,000
unit of principal thereof shall be
treated as though it were a separate
Bond of the denomination of $5,000.
If it is determined that one or more,
but not all of the $5,000 units of
principal amount represented by a
Bond are to be called for redemption, then upon notice of redemption
of a $5,000 unit or units, the registered owner of that Bond shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i)
for payment of the redemption price
of the $5,000 unit or units called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption and any
premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing and to any
municipal bond insurance company

145

9
that has issued a policy insuring
some or all of the Bonds. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity
of
the
proceedings
for
the
redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph, the Bonds and portions
thereof called for redemption shall
become due and payable on the
redemption date, and, upon presentation and surrender at the place or
places specified in that notice, shall
be paid. If money for the redemption of all of the Bonds and portions
thereof to be redeemed, including
interest accrued to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, and, if notice of
redemption has been deposited in
the mail, then from and after the
redemption date those Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall cease to bear interest and
no longer shall be considered to be
outstanding. If that money shall not
be so available on the redemption
date, or that notice shall not have
been deposited in the mail, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held
by
the
Registrar
for
the
redemption of particular Bonds shall
be held in trust for the account of
the registered owners and shall be
paid to them, respectively, upon presentation and surrender of those
Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section
3) at the close of business on the
date
provided
in
the
Registrar
Agreement authorized in Section 3
(the Record Date). Notwithstanding
any contrary provision in the General Bond Ordinance, so long as the
Bonds are held by a Depository in
a book entry system (as described
in Section 3), debt charges on the
Bonds will be payable in lawful
money of the United States by wire
transfer to the Depository made by
the Escrow Agent on each Interest
Payment Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance, except for the third paragraph of Section 13(a) (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section 4
(pertaining generally to the periods
during
which
the
City
is
not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under the
General Bond Ordinance), will apply
to the Bonds. Except for those provisions, the General Bond Ordinance
is included as a part of this Ordinance as fully as if restated in this
Ordinance. Words and terms not oth-

10
erwise defined in this Ordinance
shall have the same meaning as set
forth in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their faces
the purpose for which they are
issued and that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to
Section 4 of the General Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be authenticated by the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee (as
defined therein). The Bonds shall be
signed by the City’s Mayor and by
the City’s Director of Finance, and,
consistent with Revised Code Section 133.27 and notwithstanding Section 177.02 of the Codified Ordinances of the City, either or both of
those signatures may be a facsimile. The Bonds shall bear the seal of
the City, which seal may be a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section 83
of the City’s Charter, the Director of
Law shall prepare the Bonds and
shall endorse thereon her approval
of the form and correctness thereof
by her manual or facsimile signature.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating agent, bond registrar, transfer
agent and paying agent for the
Bonds (the “Registrar”); provided
that the Escrow Agent shall also act
as paying agent for the Bonds so
long as the Bonds are held in a book
entry
system.
The
Director
of
Finance shall sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
the Registrar Agreement among the
City, the Registrar and the Escrow
Agent (the “Registrar Agreement”)
in substantially the form as is now
on file with the Clerk of Council in
File No. 167-05-A. The Registrar
Agreement is approved, together
with any changes or amendments
that are not inconsistent with this
ordinance
and
not
substantially
adverse to the City and that are
approved by the Director of Finance
and the Director of Law on behalf
of the City, all of which shall be
conclusively evidenced by the signing of the Agreement or amendments to the Agreement. The Director of Finance shall provide for the
payment of the services rendered
and for reimbursement of expenses
incurred pursuant to the Agreement
from the proceeds of the Bonds to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided in
this Section (the “Bond Register”).
Subject to the provisions of Section
5, the person in whose name a Bond
is registered on the Bond Register
shall be regarded as the absolute
owner of that Bond for all purposes
of this ordinance. Payment of or on
account of the debt charges on any
Bond shall be made only to or upon
the order of that person; neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be
affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid and
effectual to satisfy and discharge the

The City Record
City’s liability upon the Bond, including interest, to the extent of the
amount or amounts so paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Bond at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner
or
by
a
person
legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of
this ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Bonds
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Bonds surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds or the principal and

146

February 9, 2005
interest, and to effect transfers of
Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized: (i) the
Bonds may be issued in the form of
a single, fully registered Bond representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the beneficial
owners in book entry form shall
have no right to receive Bonds in
the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for
transfer to another Depository or to
another nominee of a Depository,
without further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Bonds from the Depository,
and the Trustee and Registrar shall
authenticate and deliver bond certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking
Fund and, if not purchased by them,
shall be offered to the Treasury
Investment Account for purchase
and, if not purchased for that
Account, shall be sold to Morgan
Stanley & Co. Incorporated, McDonald
Investments
Inc.
and
SBKBrooks Investment Corp. (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”).
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in

February 9, 2005
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance, the written advice
of either Financial Advisor and the
Original Purchaser’s offer to purchase the Bonds, including: the principal amount of the Bonds, final purchase price (which shall be not less
than 97% of the principal amount
plus any accrued interest to their
date of delivery), interest rate or
rates, the amounts and years in
which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements),
the
Interest Payment Dates and the
date of the Bonds (if different from
those set forth in Section 2) and any
other matters required in this Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. As appropriate under the
Charter, the Mayor, Director of
Finance, Director of Law and other
appropriate officers of the City are,
and each of them is, authorized and
directed to take such actions as are
necessary, appropriate and in the
best interest of the City to establish
the terms and requirements for
delivery of the Bonds and to make
such arrangements as are necessary
with the Original Purchaser in order
to establish the date, location, and
procedure, and conditions for the
delivery of the Bonds to the Original Purchaser, to give all appropriate notices and certificates, to cause
a true transcript of proceedings
with reference to the issuance of the
Bonds to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Director of Finance is
further authorized and directed to
sign and deliver on behalf of the
City a bond purchase agreement
(the “Bond Purchase Agreement”),
approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, between the
City and the Original Purchaser setting forth the terms and conditions
on which the City agrees to sell the
Bonds and the Original Purchaser
agrees to buy the Bonds on terms
consistent with this Ordinance. The
Bond Purchase Agreement is approved substantially in the form
now on the file with the Clerk of
Council in the File referenced in
Section 3, together with any changes
or amendments that are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and not
substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance and the Director of
Law on behalf of the City, all of
which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of the Bond
Purchase Agreement by the Director
of Finance. It is determined that the
terms of the Bonds, as provided in
this Ordinance and as may be provided in or pursuant to the Certificate of Award, are in the best interest of the City and in compliance
with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an Official
Statement is appropriate or necessary in connection with the original
issuance of the Bonds, the Director
of Finance in his official capacity is
authorized to prepare or cause to be

The City Record
prepared on behalf of the City an
Official Statement and any necessary supplements and to authorize
the use and distribution of, that
Official Statement and any supplements. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign on behalf of the
City and in his official capacity that
Official Statement and any supplements approved by the Director of
Finance. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign and deliver, on
behalf of the City and in his official
capacity such certificates in connection with the accuracy of the Official Statement and any supplements
as may, in his judgment, be necessary or appropriate. The Director of
Finance is also authorized to determine and certify on behalf of the
City that such disclosure document
is “deemed final” by the City within the meaning of Securities and
Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12
(the “SEC Rule”). The Director of
Finance is authorized to contract for
services for the production and distribution of preliminary and final
official statements, including by
printed and electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Director of
Finance is authorized and directed
to prepare or cause to be prepared,
and to sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the
continuing
disclosure
agreement
made by the City for the benefit of
the holders and beneficial owners of
the Bonds in accordance with the
SEC Rule. The performance of that
Agreement shall be subject to the
availability of funds and their annual appropriation to meet costs the
City would be required to incur to
perform it. The Director of Finance
is further authorized and directed to
establish procedures in order to
ensure compliance by the City with
its continuing disclosure agreement,
including the timely provision of
information and notices.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds promptly when and as the same falls due,
and also to provide for the discharge
of the Bonds at maturity, there shall
be and is levied on all the taxable
property in the City, in addition to all
other taxes, a direct tax annually
during the period the Bonds are outstanding, in an amount sufficient to
provide for the payment of that interest, when and as the same shall fall
due, and also to discharge the principal of the Bonds at maturity, which
tax shall not be less than the interest and sinking fund tax required by
Section 11 of Article XII of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is ordered
computed,
certified,
levied
and
extended upon the tax duplicate and

147

11
collected by the same officers, in the
same manner and at the same time
that taxes for general purposes for
each of those years are certified,
extended and collected. The tax
shall be placed before and in preference to all other items and for the
full amount thereof. The funds
derived from those tax levies shall
be placed in the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund as required by the
General Bond Ordinance and those
funds, together with the interest collected on them shall be irrevocably
pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds
when and as the same fall due; provided, however, that, subject to the
provisions of Section 8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in each year to
the extent that revenues are available from other sources for the payment of the Bonds and are appropriated for such purpose, the amount
of such tax shall be reduced by the
amount of such revenues so available and appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25(B)(1) and 5705.51 of
the Revised Code, and in accordance
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the

Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
supplemented by enacting new Section 413.12 to read as follows:
Section 413.12 Use of Automated
Cameras to Impose Civil Penalties
upon Red Light and Speeding Violators
Civil
enforcement
system
(a)
established. The City of Cleveland
adopts a civil enforcement system for
red light and speeding offenders photographed by means of an “automated traffic enforcement camera system” as defined in division (m). This
civil enforcement system imposes
monetary liability on the owner of a
vehicle for failure of an operator to
stop at a traffic signal displaying a
steady red light indication or for the
failure of an operator to comply with
a speed limitation.
(b) Red light offense – liability
imposed. The owner of a vehicle
shall be liable for the penalty
imposed under this section if the
vehicle crosses a marked stop line
or the intersection plane at a system location when the traffic signal
for that vehicle’s direction is emitting a steady red light.
(c) Speeding offense – liability
imposed. The owner of a vehicle
shall be liable for the penalty
imposed under this section if the
vehicle is operated at a speed in
excess of the limitations set forth in
Section 433.03.
(d) Liability does not constitute a
conviction. The imposition of liability under this section shall not be
deemed a conviction for any purpose
and shall not be made part of the

154

February 9, 2005
operating record of any person on
whom the liability is imposed.
(e) Other offenses and penalties
not abrogated. Nothing in this section shall be construed as altering
or limiting Sections 433.03 or 413.03
of these Codified Ordinances, the
criminal penalties imposed by those
sections, or the ability of a police
officer to enforce those sections
against any offender observed by
the officer violating either of those
sections. Nothing in this section
shall be construed to limit the liability of an operator of a vehicle for
any violation of division (b) or (c)
of this section.
(f) Notices of liability. Any ticket
for an automated red light or speeding system violation under this section, known as a “Notice of Liability”, shall:
(1) Be processed by officials or
agents of the City of Cleveland;
(2) Be forwarded by first-class
mail or personal service to the vehicle’s registered owner’s address as
given on the state’s motor vehicle
registration, and
(3) Clearly state the manner in
which the violation may be appealed.
(g) Penalties. Any violation of
division (b) or division (c) of this
section shall be deemed a noncriminal violation for which a civil penalty shall be assessed and for which
no points authorized by Section
4507.021 of the Revised Code (“Point
system
for
license
suspension”)
shall be assigned to the owner or
driver of the vehicle.
(h) Appeals. A notice of appeal
shall be filed with the Hearing Officer within twenty-one (21) days
from the date listed on the “Notice
of Liability.” The failure to give
notice of appeal or pay the civil
penalty within this time period shall
constitute a waiver of the right to
contest the Notice of Liability and
will be considered an admission.
Appeals shall be heard through an
administrative process established
by the Clerk of the Cleveland Municipal Court. A decision in favor the
City of Cleveland may be enforced
by means of a civil action or any
other
means
provided
by
the
Revised Code.
(i) Evidence of ownership. It is
prima facie evidence that the person
registered as the owner of the vehicle with the Ohio Bureau of Motor
Vehicles, or with any other State
vehicle registration office, was operating the vehicle at the time of the
offenses set out in divisions (b) and
(c) of this section.
(j) Program oversight. The Director of Public Safety shall oversee
the program authorized by this Section. The selection of the locations
of automated cameras shall be made
by the Director of Public Safety, in
consultation with the Director of
Public Service, the Traffic Commissioner, and the Traffic Engineer.
The Director of Public Safety shall
also oversee the installation and
maintenance of all automated cameras. An encroachment permit shall
not be required for the placement of
cameras.
(k) Rules and Regulations. The
Director of Public Safety may issue
rules and regulations to carry out the
provisions of this sections, which
shall be effective thirty (30) days
after publication in the City Record.

February 9, 2005
(l) Establishment of Penalty. The
penalty imposed for a violation of
division (b) or (c) of this section

(10) days after publication in the
City Record.
(m) Definitions. As used in this
section:

and a vehicle sensor installed to
work alone or in conjunction with
an official traffic controller and to

(2) “System location” is the approach to an intersection or a street

consultants and fix the compensation for services from a list of qualified vendors identified through canvass.
Section 3. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the

An emergency ordinance excusing
Ghassan Ali from the requirement of
Section 74 of the Charter.
Whereas, Section 74 of the Charter of the City of Cleveland requires
employees of the City of Cleveland
to be a bona fide resident of the
City of Cleveland during employment with the City; and
Whereas, Section 74 of the Charter grants the Council the authority,
by a majority vote of the Council,
to excuse an employee from this
requirement; and
Whereas, Ghassan Ali, an engineer employed in the Division of
Water, has requested that he be
excused from the requirement of
Section 74 of the Charter (a copy of
his request dated November 18, 2004
is incorporated into this ordinance
and is included in File No. 192-05-A);
and
Whereas, Mr. Ali’s request is
unique in that he is the father of a
young child diagnosed with moderate to severe autism; and
Whereas, the intervention program recommended for Mr. Ali’s son
by a pediatric psychologist is not
provided by the Cleveland Public
School System; and
Whereas, fees to attend the recommended
intervention
program
exceed $60,000 per year; and
Whereas, another school system
within Cuyahoga County provides
the recommended intervention program to students within that school
system; and
Whereas, the Administration, in a
memorandum
dated
January
28,
2005, indicated that they believe Mr.
Ali’s request “meets the spirit and
intent of the waiver provision and
supports Mr. Ali’s request for a res-

Whereas, this Council is supportive of Mr. Ali’s efforts to obtain
access to an intervention program
that will enable his disabled child
to move ahead and reach his full
potential; and

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 186-05.
By Council Members Conwell and
Reed.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio legislature to reintroduce
and pass a mental health parity bill.
Whereas, Ohio is one of 16 states
that have yet to pass some form of
parity law requiring private insurance to cover mental illnesses at the
same level as other illnesses; and
Whereas, health insurance plans
discriminate
against
millions
of
Americans with mental disorders by
providing only limited coverage for
mental health problems; and
Whereas, a mental health parity
bill would prohibit discrimination in
the coverage provided for the diagnosis, care and treatment of biologically based mental illnesses in sickness and accident insurance policies
and in private and public employer
self-insurance plans; and
Whereas, a 2001 analysis concluded that full parity of health insurance premiums would result in an
average increase of only 1% to 1.5
%; and
Whereas, such minimal insurance
increases
would
be
offset
by
increased productivity of workers,
overall reduction of medical costs,
reduction in crime and homelessness, and a subsequent increase in
the number of contributing taxpayers with private insurance; and
Whereas, this Council supports
the efforts of the Mental Health
Advocacy Coalition and the Legislative Advocacy Committee for People
with Disabilities which are lobbying
the Ohio legislature to reintroduce a
mental health insurance parity bill;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the Ohio legislature to
reintroduce
and
pass
a
mental
health parity bill.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Governor
Bob Taft and those members of the
State of Ohio Legislature representing residents of the City of Cleveland.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Res. No. 187-05.
By Council Members Gordon, Coats
and Pierce Scott.
An emergency resolution strongly
opposing the plan of President
George W. Bush to reduce Community Development Block Grant funding.
Whereas,
Community
Development Block Grant (“CDBG”) funds
provide multipurpose development
grants to state and local governments; and
Whereas, CDBG funds are used in
a variety of ways from job creation
and retention to housing rehabilitation as long as seventy percent
(70%) of the funds received are
used to benefit low income and moderate income persons; and
Whereas, discussions between the
White House Office of Management
and Budget and the Department of
Housing and Urban Development
suggest that CDBG funding could be
cut by as much as fifty percent
(50%); and
Whereas, reduction of CDBG funding will have a devastating effect
on the City of Cleveland and other
cities; and
Whereas, in these challenging economic times, it is important to continue programs that benefit low and
moderate income persons and communities; and
Whereas, in these challenging economic times, it is also important to
provide adequate funding of programs that increase economic development opportunities; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

1.

Council

An emergency resolution opposing
the privatization of Social Security
and the establishment of personal
social security accounts.
Whereas, Social Security provides
a critical foundation of income for
retried and disabled workers; and
Whereas, for approximately onethird of Americans over the age of
sixty-five, Social Security benefits
constitute ninety percent (90%) of
their total income; and
Whereas, Social Security has been
effective in reducing poverty among
the elderly, protecting relatives of
deceased workers and the disabled,
and providing a reliable source
income; and
Whereas, President Bush is proposing the establishment of personal social security accounts; and
Whereas, recent analyses show
that the establishment of personal
social security accounts while continuing to provide Social Security
benefits
to
current
beneficiaries
would require a combination of federal borrowing, tax increases, and
benefit cuts amounting to between
two trillion dollars and three trillion
dollars; and
Whereas, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported
“to raise the rate of return for
future generations by moving to a
funded system, some generations
must receive rates of return even
lower than they would have gotten
under the pay-as-you-go system”; and
Whereas, the establishment of personal
social
security
accounts

February 9, 2005
require that young Americans pay
for Social Security benefits of older
Americans and pay for the transition to private accounts at the same
time; and
Whereas, the establishment of personal social security accounts also
creates new risks for young Americans who would confront the ups
and downs of the stock market,
future inflation, and administrative
costs; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes the privatization of Social Security and the establishment of personal social security accounts.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
certified copy of this resolution to
President George W. Bush, U.S. Senator Michael DeWine, U.S. Senator

Stephanie Tubbs Jones, Congressman Dennis Kucinich, Congressman
Sherrod Brown, and Congressman
Steven LaTourette.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
