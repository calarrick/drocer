By Hand Delivery
The Honorable Frank G. Jackson
President of Council
601 Lakeside Avenue
Cleveland, Ohio 44114
Re: Ordinance No. 2-05
Dear Council President Jackson:
As Mayor of the City of Cleveland,
I take seriously my responsibility to
manage the City, to provide quality
services, to protect the public safety, and to ensure fiscal integrity.
Because of this responsibility, I
must return Ordinance No. 2-05 to
you with my disapproval and veto
noted on it.
Ordinance No. 2-05 authorizes the
Director of Finance to enter into an
amendment to Contract No. 38823
with North Point Garage Limited
Partnership for the lease and operation of the North Point Garage. The
ordinance as presented to the Council Committee on Finance on March,
28, 2005, reflected the negotiated
terms agreed to by the tenant. In
consideration
for
extending
the
lease for sixty-seven years, the tenant agreed to pay the City a onetime payment of $3,750,000. This figure was supported by an appraisal
that was presented to the Committee.
The City Council, over the objection
of
the
tenant’s
representative,
amended the ordinance to require a
one-time payment of $3,750,000 in
consideration
for
extending
the
lease for only forty-nine years. The
City Council took this action with
the full knowledge that an appraisal
valued a forty-nine year extension
of
the
lease
at
$3,250,000,
not
$3,750,000. Moreover, the City Council amended the ordinance to require
that a provision be inserted in the
lease to allow the City to reclaim
the lease without the necessity of
eminent domain. Again, the City
Council took this action without the
agreement
of
the
tenant.

importantly, the Council took this
action without any consideration as
to the impact of this reclaim provision on the financing and operation
of the garage.

File No. 667-05.
From the Ohio Department of
Transportation — Cuyahoga County
— City of Cleveland, Project No.
216(05) — copy of contract. Received.

In short, the Council changed the
agreement negotiated by the Administration with the tenant without
obtaining
the
tenant’s
consent.
Although the Council was informed
of the problems with the amendments, the Council acted anyway. As
a result, the Council has effectively
rejected a proposal that would have
resulted in badly needed revenue to
the City and preserved a needed
parking facility adjoining North
Point, with ready access to the lakefront museums and stadium.

FROM DEPARTMENT OF
LIQUOR CONTROL

For the above reasons, I hereby veto
Ordinance No. 2-05.
Sincerely,
Jane L. Campbell,
Mayor
Received.

City. The provisions of this ordinance have neither the purpose nor
effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of any
communicative materials, including

of this ordinance to restrict or deny
access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First
Amendment or to deny access by the

intended market. It is neither the
intent nor effect of this ordinance to
condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials.
Section 237.02
Definitions
(a) The words in this Chapter
shall have the meaning given to
them in 347.07 of the Cleveland Codified Ordinances.
(b) “Operator” means a person
who owns, controls, operates, or
maintains a Adult Video Arcade or
Adult Live Entertainment Arcade.
(c) “Manager’s station” means the
area where the owner, operator, or
employee keeps the cash register.
This must be an open, conspicuous
area accessible to the patrons.
Section 237.03
Configuration
No person shall operate an Adult
Video Arcade or an Adult Live
Entertainment Arcade unless the
Arcade complies with the following
requirements:

10
(a) It is the duty of the owners
and operator of the premises to
ensure that at least one employee is
on duty and can see the monitor
located at the manager’s station at
all times that any patron is present
inside the premises.
(b) The premises’ owner or operator installs a camera system in the
video booths that complies with the
following requirements:
(1) The owner or operator operates the camera system when any of
the booths are available for viewing
videos.
(2) The owner or operator numbers all the booths in the store with
an individual number so that the
booth is identified on the monitor,
the digital recording, and the maintenance log.
(3) The camera system includes
an individual camera in each video
booth.
(4) The individual cameras are
placed in the booths in a way that
shows the people inside the booths
from at least the knees to the shoulders.
(5) Each Video Arcade will ensure
that nothing obstructs the camera
from showing the people inside the
booths from at least the knees to the
shoulders.
(6) Each Video Arcade will immediately remove anything that obstructs the camera from showing the
people inside the booths from at
least the knees to the shoulders.
(7) The camera system has a monitor at the manager’s station so that
the owner, operator, or employee
who is present in the store can view
it.
(8) The monitor faces into the
store’s public area so that it is visible from the public area.
(9) The monitor’s screen is not
obstructed from view from the public area at any time that the store
is open to the public.
(10) The monitoring system operates on a switcher system so that
the monitor switches sequentially
and continuously from one camera
to another. The continuous switching process will be timed to allow
an adequate view of each area surveyed by each camera. The view
inside each booth must be at least
four seconds, but not more than six
seconds. Once the camera system
completes a circuit showing the
inside of all the booths, the system
must immediately start a new circuit showing inside all the booths.
(11) The monitor and the recording identify the booth number for
the booth that is being shown on the
monitor.
(12) The camera system records
all activity in all booths in digital
format
on
a
minimum
five-day
recording loop. The owner or operator must maintain at least the most
recent five-day period’s recordings
at all times.
(13) The camera system records
the date and time for the recorded
images.
(14) The owner or operator places
a sign that is at least 5" by 7" in a
conspicuous place in each booth
stating words to the effect: “This
arcade installed a video-camera-monitoring-and-recording system in this
booth. The arcade monitors and
records activity in this booth.”
(15) If anyone removes or defaces
the
sign
required
by
C.C.O.
§
237.03(b)(14), then the owner or

The City Record
operator will replace the sign with
a new one as soon as store personnel find that the sign has been
removed or defaced. The owner or
operator must keep enough extra
signs in supply at the store to be
able to replace any sign as needed.
(16) If a camera is not operating
in any booth, the store must close
that booth until the camera is
repaired. “Not operating” means that
the camera does not transmit images
showing the booth’s interior so that
the image is shown on the monitor
and recorded by the recording device.
(17) If the entire camera system
is not operating, then the Video
Arcade may not operate any video
booths until the system is repaired.
(18) Each Video Arcade will keep
a log for every time the camera system or an individual camera is not
working. The log also must note
any time that the sign required by
C.C.O. § 237.03(b)(14) is defaced or
removed. The log should show the
date and time the camera or camera
system stopped working, the date
and time a repair company fixed it,
and the repair company’s contact
information. The owner or operator
must immediately provide a copy of
this log to City officials on request.
(c) Restrooms may not contain
video-reproduction equipment and
shall not be used for viewing videos.

person who is the owner’s or operator’s agent or employee, shall fail to
ensure that the requirements of

(e)
Except
inside
the
video
booths, the owner or operator will
provide
artificial
light
at
the
premises in all areas where the public is permitted at a level that provides an average illumination of 10
foot candles (107 lux) over the area
at a height of 30 inches above the
floor level. Inside the video booths,
the owner or operator will provide
artificial light at a level that allows
the activities inside the booth to be
clearly visible on the camera system’s monitor and recordings. If
City officials cannot clearly see
activities inside the booths either on
the camera system’s monitor or
recordings, then the Video Arcades
must raise the light level inside the
booths to the point where the activities are clearly visible.
(f) It shall be the duty of the
operator, and it shall also be the
duty of any agents and employees
present in the premises, to ensure
that the illumination described above
is maintained at all times that any
patron is present in the premises.
(g) No viewing room or booth may
be occupied by more than one person at any time.
(h) No opening of any kind shall
exist between viewing rooms or
booths.
(i) It shall be the duty of the operator, and it shall also be the duty of
any agents and employees present in

than one person at a time occupies a
viewing booth or room, and to ensure
that no person attempts to make an
opening of any kind between the

of

Con-

The City Planning Commission
shall approve a conditional use only

layout and design, will function
principally to support the institutional and research uses in the district, as opposed to principally serving a larger geographic area.
Section 340.06
Site Plan and Design Review
No Building Permit shall be issued for the construction of a new
building
in
an
Institutional-Re-

search District without the approval
of the site plan and building design
by the City Planning Commission or
its Director, in accordance with
rules promulgated by the Commission and in accordance with the following standards.
(a) Master Plan. In reviewing development proposals in an Institutional-Research District, the City
Planning Commission shall assess
the development’s consistency with
any applicable master plan that has
been adopted or accepted by the
Commission. If no current master
plan for the district is available to
the Commission, the Commission
may request submission of a master
plan from an organization deemed
responsible for preparation of a plan
for the district.
(b) Urban Form. Except where
such design would be clearly inconsistent with the character of an
area, new development should take
an “urban form,” characterized by
multi-story
buildings,
streetside
building placement, and parking
located in garages or in lots behind
buildings.
(c) Architectural Design. In addition to meeting high standards of
architectural
design,
buildings
should be compatible with nearby
properties with respect to scale,
height, setback, spacing, orientation
to existing streets, architectural
style, materials, and colors. Variations and innovations in design are,
however, encouraged in order to
achieve visual interest and to create
distinct
identities
for
individual
buildings and districts. The goal is
compatibility in design, not uniformity.
(d) Pedestrian, Bicyclist and Transit Access. Developments should be
designed to facilitate safe and convenient access by pedestrians and
bicyclists and to facilitate use of
public transit.
(e) Parking and Circulation. Developments should be designed to
provide adequate and convenient offstreet and on-street parking and to
utilize opportunities for parking that
is shared by buildings and uses.
Streets, driveways, sidewalks and
paths should be designed in a manner that facilitates safe and convenient circulation for motorists, pedestrians, bicyclists and transit users.
(f) Landscaping and Open Space.
Developments should include landscaped areas and open spaces that
enhance the appearance of a property and provide areas for recreation and scenic enjoyment, while
meeting the environmental design
standards of this Section.
(g) Environmental Design. Developments should incorporate “sustainable” building techniques and other
measures, as feasible, in order to
conserve energy, minimize water
usage, recycle wastes, re-use building materials, and to achieve other
goals that promote environmental
sustainability.
Section 340.07 Off-Street Parking
Requirements
Off-street parking for individual
uses in an Institutional-Research
District shall be provided in accordance with the regulations of Section 349.04. Proposals for shared
parking shall be submitted and
