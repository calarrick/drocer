An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting
new Sections 350.22 and 350.23, relating to wall art murals and electronic and projected image signs;
and to renumber existing Section
350.22 of the codified ordinances to
new Section 350.24, as enacted by
Ordinance
No.
3076-A-89,
passed
December 10, 1990.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
supplemented by enacting new Sections 350.22 and 350.23 to read as follows:
Section 350.22 Wall Art Murals
(a) Intent. The regulations of this
section are established to facilitate
the
beautification
of
unsightly
building walls through the display
of wall art murals, where such displays would not otherwise be permitted
because
of
prohibitions
against off-premise advertising and
restrictions on the size of signs
(b) Definition. A “wall art mural”
is a visual image that conveys a
commercial off-premise advertising
message principally through pictorial rather than narrative means and
that meets a particularly high standard of graphic and artistic quality.
Such graphic image is either painted onto a building wall or is applied
to the wall through use of a flexible sheet of vinyl or similar material, without use of a visible structural border or a visible backing
panel. The commercial message may
take the form of either on-premise
or off-premise advertising. A “wall
art mural” is distinct from other
signs that may be termed “wall
murals” with respect to the requirement that a “wall art mural” must
meet a particularly high standard of
graphic and artistic quality, in
accordance with the approval process and approval criteria of this
section.
(c) Permitted Locations. Wall art
murals shall be permitted only within the Central Business District and
the Flats Oxbow Business Revitalization District, as shown on the
Zoning Map of the City of Cleveland, but shall not be permitted in
a One-Family, Two-Family, Townhouse or Multi-Family zoning district. Furthermore, such displays
shall be located in accordance with
the criteria of division (e) of this
section. A wall art mural may be
permitted in locations where a sign
would otherwise be prohibited by
virtue of its size or the fact that it
displayed off-premise advertising.
(d) Approval Process. No wall art
mural shall be displayed or replaced
without a Building Permit issued
pursuant to approval by the City
Planning Commission or Landmarks
Commission, as applicable. In making its determination, the Commission may seek the advice of individuals or organizations with expertise in the fields of public art or
graphic design. Each proposed wall
art mural, including a wall art
mural proposed to replace an existing wall art mural, shall be judged

16
on its own merits with respect to
graphic quality, in accordance with
the approval criteria of this section.
(e) Approval Criteria. The City
Planning Commission or Landmarks
Commission, as applicable, shall
approve an application for the display of a wall art mural only if the
Commission finds that the proposed
mural meets all of the following criteria.
(1) The wall on which the mural
is to be displayed is unsightly due
to its lack of ornamentation, poor
quality or inappropriate construction materials, and/or a poor state
of repair. Furthermore, display of
the mural would not obscure or compromise the design integrity of significant architectural features.
(2) Placement of a mural on the
subject wall would not detract from
the architectural or scenic character
of surrounding properties.
(3) The graphic quality of the
mural is such that its display would
significantly enhance the appearance of the subject property and
would serve to beautify and enliven
the urban district in which it is
located.
(4) The size and placement of the
wall mural sign is appropriate to
achieve the objective of beautifying
the unsightly wall, without detracting from the architectural or scenic
character of surrounding properties.
(f) Maximum Number and Duration of Display. No more than five
(5) wall art murals approved under
the provisions of this section shall
be displayed simultaneously. This
restriction does not apply to artwork
that is exempt from the sign regulations of this chapter. For purposes of enforcing this requirement, the
City Planning Commission shall
maintain an inventory of all such
wall art murals. In determining
whether the maximum number of
such signs has been reached, the
City Planning Commission shall consider signs that are currently displayed and any sign for which an
approved Building Permit is pending but which is not yet displayed.
The approval given to a wall art
mural shall be in effect for two (2)
years from the date of installation.
At the end of two years, the wall
art mural shall either be removed or
replaced, in accordance with the provisions of this section, unless the
applicable Commission approves an
extension in this time period.
(g) Submission Requirements. An
applicant requesting permission to
display a wall mural shall complete
a Building Permit application and
shall submit the following materials:
(1) a color drawing of the proposed mural, drawn to scale, marked
with dimensions, and clearly depicting all graphic elements, lettering
and logos (submitted as one original and four color copies);
(2) a color photograph of the subject building wall with the proposed
mural super-imposed on the wall
(submitted
as
four
color
photographs);
(3) a color photograph(s) of the
subject wall depicting its unsightly
current condition (submitted as one
set of photographs);
(4) calculations indicating the
surface area occupied by any lettering or logos conveying a commercial
message and comparing this to the
total surface area of the wall art
mural (submitted as four copies).
(g) Maintenance and Removal. All
wall art murals shall be maintained

The City Record
in good condition. A wall art mural
which is faded, peeling, torn or otherwise worn or damaged shall be
restored, replaced, or removed. Any
mural replacement or wall re-painting shall be subject to design
review and approval by the City
Planning Commission or Landmarks
Commission, as applicable. In the
case of a wall art mural which is
not maintained in good condition,
the Secretary of the City Planning
Commission or Landmarks Commission shall notify the building owner,
in writing, of the need for corrective
action. If no corrective action is
taken within thirty (30) days, or a
longer period of time as determined
by the Commission, the Commissioner of Building and Housing,
upon notification by the City Planning Director, shall issue a notice
requiring removal of the mural.
(h) Exceptions to Limit on Number of Signs. If an application has
been submitted for a wall art mural
that, if approved, would cause the
total number of wall art murals to
reach the maximum permitted number of wall art murals, the City may
accept additional applications while
the first permit application is pending. The Planning Commission or
Landmarks Commission, as applicable, and in collaboration if necessary, shall approve the conforming
application that best meets the
intent and approval criteria of this
section. Once the maximum number
of wall art murals has been reached,
the Planning Commission and Landmarks Commission may approve
additional wall art murals only if
the Commission determines that disapproval of a particular application
would deprive the city of an asset
that would be a significant benefit
to the attractiveness and economic
vitality of the surrounding district.
Section 350.23 Electronic and Projected Image Signs Displaying OffPremises Advertising
(a) Intent. The regulations of this
section are established to stimulate
economic activity in Cleveland’s
downtown and Flats districts by permitting, in appropriate locations,
well-designed electronic and projected image signs displaying offpremise advertising.
(b) Definitions.
(1) Projected Image Sign. A “projected image sign” is a sign whose
image is displayed through the projection of light onto a building wall
or other surface, where no sign
structure or fixed sign image is
located on that surface.
(2) Electronic Sign. An “electronic
sign” is a sign that displays multiple electronically generated images
on a sign panel, utilizing animation
or changeable copy.
(c) Applicability. The regulations
shall apply only to electronic signs
and projected image signs that display
off-premise
advertising,
in
addition to other messages. Electronic and projected image signs
that do not display off-premise
advertising shall be regulated as
are other signs under the provisions
of this chapter.
(d) Permitted Locations. Electronic and projected image signs subject
to the regulations of this section
shall be permitted only within the
Central Business District and the
Flats Oxbow Business Revitalization District, as shown on the Zoning Map of the City of Cleveland,
but shall not be permitted in a OneFamily, Two-Family, Townhouse or

2218

October 12, 2005
Multi-Family zoning district. Furthermore, such displays shall be
located in accordance with the criteria of division (f) of this section.
Electronic
and
projected
image
signs subject to the regulations of
this section may be permitted in
locations where a sign would otherwise be prohibited by virtue of its
size or the fact that it displayed offpremise advertising.
(e) Approval Process. No electronic or projected image sign subject to the regulations of this section shall be displayed without a
Building Permit issued pursuant to
approval by the City Planning Commission or Landmarks Commission,
as applicable, in accordance with
the approval criteria of this section.
(f) Approval Criteria. The City
Planning Commission or Landmarks
Commission, as applicable, shall
approve an application for the display of an electronic sign or projected image sign subject to the regulations of this section only if the
Commission finds that the proposed
sign meets all of the following criteria.
(1) The sign will be located such
that its presence will help to enliven a retail or entertainment district
and will not adversely impact nearby residential uses;
(2) In the case of an electronic
sign to be placed on a building wall
or rooftop, the sign will be designed
and placed in a manner that complements the architecture of the subject building and is compatible with
its environs. In the case of a freestanding electronic sign, the sign
will be designed and placed in a
manner that complements its environs and does not block significant
views or vistas;
(3) Use of animation and graphics, as opposed to static images and
text, shall be maximized in order to
best achieve the goals of enlivening
the surrounding district and stimulating economic activity;
(4) In the case of a projected
image sign, the owner of the property on which the projector will be
placed, if different from the owner
of the projection surface, has consented to the placement of the projector; and
(5) At least half of the display
time on the sign, during all times of
day and days of the week, shall be
devoted to messages that promote
public events in Cleveland, cultural
and community-based institutions in
Cleveland, and messages of a public
service nature.
(g) Maximum Number. For signs
subject to the regulations of this section, electronic signs shall be displayed in no more than five (5) locations simultaneously and projected
image signs shall be displayed in no
more than five (5) locations simultaneously, within the Central Business and Flats Oxbow Districts. For
purposes of this regulation, a “location” shall be considered a single
building, regardless of whether multiple electronic or projected image
signs are proposed or located on that
building. The City Planning Commission shall maintain an inventory
of all such electronic and projected
image signs for purposes of enforcing this requirement. In determining
whether the maximum number of
such signs has been reached, the
City Planning Commission shall consider signs that are currently displayed and any sign for which an
approved Building Permit is pending
but which is not yet displayed.

October 12, 2005
(h) Submission Requirements. An
applicant requesting permission to
display an electronic sign or projected image sign shall complete a
Building
Permit

proposed sign super-imposed on the
building or property (submitted as

of the sign (submitted as one set of
photographs);

(5) a statement certifying that
displays on the sign will meet the
requirements of division (f)(4) of
this section.

140th anniversary of the founding of
St. Vincent Charity Hospital and the

2223

21
154th anniversary of the arrival of
the Sisters of Charity of St. Augustine in Cleveland, Ohio; and
Whereas, Sr. Ignatia Gavin, C.S.A.
was a member of the religious community of the Sisters of Charity of
St. Augustine; and
Whereas, Sr. Ignatia Gavin, C.S.A.
was born in Ballyhane, County
Mayo, Ireland on January 2, 1889
and emigrated to Cleveland, Ohio,
U.S.A. as a small child and was
raised in City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, Sr. Ignatia Gavin, C.S.A.
helped co-found Alcoholics Anonymous at St. Thomas Hospital with
Dr. Robert H. Smith and Bill Wilson
in North East Ohio in 1939; and
Whereas, Alcoholics Anonymous
has helped millions upon millions of
people in every country; and
Whereas, Sr. Ignatia Gavin, C.S.A.
founded Rosary Hall Solarium in
1952 at St. Vincent Charity Hospital
as one of the first hospital-based
wards dedicated to the recovery of
people suffering from the disease of
alcoholism and addiction; and
Whereas, Sr. Ignatia Gavin, C.S.A.
died on April 1, 1966 and yet her
legacy, contribution, and gift to
Cleveland and the world continues
to this day; and
Whereas, in order to commemorate this anniversary and honor the
contributions of Sr. Ignatia Gavin,
C.S.A., the City of Cleveland would
like to designate E. 22nd Street
between Orange Ave. and Superior

An emergency resolution opposing
the federal, “Gasoline for America’s
Security Act of 2005”, H.R. 3893.
Whereas, late last month the
House Energy and Commerce Committee passed H.R. 3893, the “Gasoline for America’s Security Act of
2005”; and
Whereas, H.R. 3893 passed the
Committee without the opportunity
for state and local governments to
comment on the consequences of
this legislation’s sweeping preemptive measures; and

22
Whereas, H.R. 3893 would give the
Secretary of the Department of
Energy the final siting and permitting authority for local refineries,
thus overriding any state and local
authority to do so; and
Whereas, H.R. 3893 would expose
states and local governments to federal sanctions and lawsuits by
threatening federal transportation
and project development funding
based on siting decisions made by
the federal government; and
Whereas, H.R. 3893 would impact
public health by compromising long
standing federal environmental laws
in that it would allow modifications
that would expand the capacity of
any industrial source (not just a
refinery)
without
requiring
any
anti-pollution mechanisms; and
Whereas, H.R. 3893 reduces the
number of possible blends of diesel
and gasoline, without regard for the
individual needs of states and localities that depend on these special
blends to reduce emissions from
mobile sources, thus affecting the
health and well-being of Americans
everywhere; and
Whereas, H.R. 3893 masks attempts to dismantle environmental
laws that are not barriers to rebuilding the Gulf States affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby opposes the federal, “Gasoline for
America’s Security Act of 2005”, H.R.
3893.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to all members of the House of Representatives representing Cuyahoga County
and to the National League of Cities.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency

the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
