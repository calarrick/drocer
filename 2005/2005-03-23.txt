ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 131-05.
By Council Member Jackson.
An emergency resolution declaring the intention to vacate a portion
of East 72nd Place.
Whereas, this Council is satisfied
that there is good cause to vacate a
portion of East 72nd Place, as
described; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
declares its intention to vacate a
portion of the following described
real property:
Situated in the City of Cleveland,
County of Cuyahoga, and State of
Ohio and known as being all that
portion of East 72nd Place (14 feet
wide) extending Southerly from the
Westerly
prolongation
of
the
Northerly line of Sub Lot No. 80 in
the
H.C.Sterling
Subdivision
as
shown by the recorded plat in Volume 5 Page 60 of Cuyahoga County
records to the Westerly prolongation
of the Southerly line of Sub Lot No.
108 in the aforesaid Sterling Subdivision.
Description
approved
by
Greg
Esber, Acting Section Chief, Plats,
Surveys and House Numbering Section.
Section 2. That this resolution is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted March 14, 2005.
Effective March 15, 2005.

Res. No. 425-05.
By Council Members Polensek.
Cintron, Reed, Zone, Brady, Pierce
Scott, White, Jones, Conwell, Jackson, Britt, Cimperman, Coats, Dolan,
Gordon, Johnson, Lewis, O’Malley,
Rybka, Sweeney and Westbrook.
An emergency resolution objecting to the new authority of the Ohio
Department of Natural Resources to
charge parking fees at Ohio’s state
parks and urging the Mayor to
review the City’s lease with the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources to determine if such charge
violates the terms of the lease.
Whereas, the Ohio Department of
Natural Resources (ODNR) has received
approval
from
the
Taft
administration to charge a parking
fee at all state parks in Ohio; and
Whereas, beginning this spring,
the fee to park at any of the state’s
74 state parks is $5.00 a visit, or $25
a year for Ohioans; and
Whereas, the City’s five lakefront
parks, Edgewater Park, East 55th
Street Marina, Gordon Park, Euclid
Beach, and Villa Angela/Wildwood,
would all charge this fee; and

457

35
Whereas, this would have a negative impact on the ability of City
residents to use the state parks
located in the City; and
Whereas, in order to avoid paying
such a fee, parkgoers will simply
park their vehicles on the streets
and on private property in the vicinity of the state parks, which will
result in increased traffic, trespassing, noise, and disruption to citizens
residing near the state parks; and
Whereas, the lease that the City
of Cleveland has with ODNR may
prohibit charging a fee to park in
our lakefront state parks; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council objects to the new authority of the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources to charge parking fees at
Ohio’s state parks and urges the
Mayor to review the City’s lease
with the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources to determine if such
charge violates the terms of the
lease.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to ODNR
Director Sam Speck and State Parks
Chief Daniel West and state legislators
representing
the
City
of
Cleveland.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted March 14, 2005.
Effective March 15, 2005.

Res. No. 428-05.
By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency resolution objecting to the transfer of liquor license
of a C1 and C2 Liquor Permit to 1001
Fairfield Avenue.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Department of Liquor
Control of an application for the
transfer of liquor license of a C1
and C2 Liquor Permit from S & R
Browns Food Market, Inc., DBA
Browns Food Market, 761 Starkweather Avenue, 1st floor and basement, Cleveland, Ohio 44113, Permanent Number 8459405 to S & R
Browns Food Market, Inc., DBA
Browns Food Market, 1001 Fairfield
Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44113, Permanent Number 84594050001; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best
interests of the entire community;
and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local

36
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to
Section 4303.26 of the Ohio Revised
Code. Council’s objection to said
permit must be received by the
Director of Liquor Control within
30 days of notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
