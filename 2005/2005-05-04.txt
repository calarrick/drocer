Civil
enforcement
system

hereby adopts a civil enforcement
system for red light and speeding
offenders photographed by means of
an “automated traffic enforcement
camera system” as defined in division (m). This civil enforcement system imposes monetary liability on
the owner of a vehicle for failure of
an operator to stop at a traffic signal displaying a steady red light
indication or for the failure of an
operator to comply with a speed limitation.
(b) Red light offense - liability
imposed. The owner of a vehicle
shall be liable for the penalty
imposed under this section if the
vehicle crosses a marked stop line
or the intersection plane at a system location when the traffic signal
for that vehicle’s direction is emitting a steady red light.
(c) Speeding offense - liability
imposed. The owner of a vehicle
shall be liable for the penalty
imposed under this section if the
vehicle is operated at a speed in
excess of the limitations set forth in
Section 433.03.
(d) Liability does not constitute a
conviction. The imposition of liability under this section shall not be
deemed a conviction for any purpose
and shall not be made part of the
operating record of any person on
whom the liability is imposed.
(e) Other offenses and penalties
not abrogated. Nothing in this section shall be construed as altering
or limiting Sections 433.03 or 413.03
of these Codified Ordinances, the
criminal penalties imposed by those
sections, or the ability of a police
officer to enforce those sections
against any offender observed by
the officer violating either of those
sections. Nothing in this section
shall be construed to limit the liability of an operator of a vehicle for
any violation of division (b) or (c)
of this section.
(f) Selection of camera sites. The
selection of the sites where automated cameras are placed and the
enforcement of this ordinance shall
be made on the basis of sound professional traffic engineering and
law enforcement judgments. Automated cameras shall not be placed
at any site where the speed restric-

806

May 4, 2005
tions or the timing of the traffic signal fail to conform to sound professional traffic engineering principles.
(g) Site selection. Each site of a
red light camera or fixed speed camera shall be selected by ordinance
of Council properly published in the
City Record amending this section
to include the sites.
The Director of Public Safety
shall cause the general public to be
notified by means of a press release
issued at least thirty days before
any given camera is made fullyoperational and is used to issue tickets to offenders. Before a given camera issues actual tickets, there shall
be a period of at least two weeks,
which may run concurrently with
the 30-day public-notice period, during which only “warning” notices
shall be issued.
At each site of a red light or fixed
speed camera, the Director of Public Service shall cause signs to be
posted to apprise ordinarily observant
motorists
that
they
are
approaching an area where an automated camera is monitoring for red
light or speed violators. Mobile
speed units shall be plainly marked
vehicles.
(h) Notices of liability. Any ticket for an automated red light or
speeding system violation under this
section shall:
(1) Be reviewed by a Cleveland
police officer;
(2) Be forwarded by first-class
mail or personal service to the vehicle’s registered owner’s address as
given on the state’s motor vehicle
registration, and
(3) Clearly state the manner in
which
the
violation
may
be
appealed.
(i) Penalties. Any violation of
division (b) or division (c) of this
section shall be deemed a noncriminal violation for which a civil penalty shall be assessed and for which
no points authorized by Section
4507.021 of the Revised Code (“Point
system
for
license
suspension”)
shall be assigned to the owner or
driver of the vehicle.
(j) Ticket evaluation, public service, and appeals. The program
shall include a fair and sound ticket-evaluation process that includes
review by the vendor and a police
officer, a strong customer-service
commitment, and an appeals process
that accords due process to the ticket respondent and that conforms to
the
requirements
of
the
Ohio
Revised Code.
(k) Appeals. A notice of appeal
shall be filed with the Hearing Officer within twenty-one (21) days
from the date listed on the ticket.
The failure to give notice of appeal
or pay the civil penalty within this
time period shall constitute a waiver of the right to contest the ticket
and shall be considered an admission.
Appeals shall be heard by the
Parking Violations Bureau through
an administrative process established by the Clerk of the Cleveland
Municipal Court. At hearings, the
strict rules of evidence applicable to
courts of law shall not apply. The
contents of the ticket shall constitute a prima facie evidence of the
facts it contains. Liability may be
found by the hearing examiner
based upon a preponderance of the
evidence. If a finding of liability is
appealed, the record of the case
shall include the order of the Parking Violations Bureau, the Ticket,
other evidence submitted by the
respondent or the City of Cleveland,

May 4, 2005
and a transcript or record of the
hearing, in a written or electronic
form acceptable to the court to
which the case is appealed.
Liability shall not be found where
the evidence shows that the automated camera captured an event is
not an offense, including each of the
following events and such others as
may be established by rules and regulations issued by the Director of
Public Safety under the authority of
division (n) of this section:
1) The motorist stops in time to
avoid violating a red light indication;
2) The motorist proceeds through
a red light indication as part of
funeral procession;
3) The motorist is operating a
City-owned emergency vehicle with
its emergency lights activated and
proceeds through a red light indication or exceeds the posted speed limitation;
4) The motorist is directed by a
police officer on the scene contrary
to the traffic signal indication.
Liability shall also be excused if
a vehicle is observed committing an
offense
where
the
vehicle
was
stolen prior to the offense and the
owner has filed a police report;
The Director of Public Safety, in
coordination with the Parking Violations Bureau, shall establish a
process by which a vehicle owner
who was not the driver at the time
of the alleged offense may, by affidavit, name the person who the
owner believes was driving the vehicle at the time. Upon receipt of such
an affidavit timely submitted to the
Parking
Violations
Bureau,
the
Bureau shall suspend further action
against the owner of the vehicle and
instead direct notices and collection
efforts to the person identified in
the affidavit. If the person named in
the affidavit, when notified, denies
being the driver or denies liability,
then the Parking Violations Bureau
shall resume the notice and collection process against the vehicle
owner, the same as if no affidavit
had been submitted, and if the violation is found to have been committed by a preponderance of evidence, the owner shall be liable for
any
penalties
imposed
for
the
offense.
A decision in favor of the City of
Cleveland
may
be
enforced
by
means of a civil action or any other
means provided by the Revised
Code.
(l) Evidence of ownership. It is
prima facie evidence that the person
registered as the owner of the vehicle with the Ohio Bureau of Motor
Vehicles, or with any other State
vehicle registration office, was operating the vehicle at the time of the
offenses set out in divisions (b) and
(c) of this section.
(m)
Program
oversight.
The
Director of Public Safety shall oversee the program authorized by this
Section. The selection of the locations of automated cameras shall be
made by ordinance of Council as
specified in division (g), upon nomination of the Director of Public
Safety, in consultation with the
appropriate council members, the
Director
of
Public
Service,
the
Police Traffic Commissioner, and
the Commissioner of Traffic Engineering. The Director of Public Service shall oversee the installation
and maintenance of all automated
cameras. An encroachment permit
shall be authorized in the legislation in which locations are selected.

these

on
school grounds have made increased

laws hold parents accountable for
failure to supervise their children;

immediate preservation of public
