the City to be a public purpose,
thereby authorizing the exemption
of those Improvements from real
property taxation for a period of
time, and provide for the making of
service payments in lieu of taxes by
the owner of such parcels, and
establish
a
municipal
public

22
improvement tax increment equivalent fund into which such service
payments shall be deposited; and
Whereas, a residential and commercial development has been proposed (the “Project”) to be located

excluding the portions thereof to be
part of public streets and parks otherwise exempt from property taxation); and
Whereas, this Council desires to
construct or cause the construction
of the public infrastructure improvements described and placed in the
above-mentioned file (the “Public

directly benefit the Property; and
Whereas, the City has determined
that it is necessary and appropriate
and in the best interests of the City
to provide for service payments in

waived notice requirements on the
condition that a compensation agreement be entered into, as provided
herein (the “School Agreement”);
and
Whereas, the City desires that the
Cleveland Cuyahoga County Port
Authority (the “Port Authority”)
and/or the City and other governmental
entities
construct
and
finance a portion of the Public

by
the

(the

providing for the City’s transfer of
the portion of the Service Payments
not otherwise paid to the School District; and

blighted conditions and prevent the
recurrence of blight and as a result,
this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the
immediate preservation of the public, peace, property, health and safety, and for the usual daily operation

An emergency resolution supporting Ohio Senate Bill 13 which would
help rescue Ohio jobs by prohibiting
tax money to go toward outsourcing
of Ohio jobs to foreign countries.
Whereas, the federal government
and large U.S. corporations are outsourcing good, high-paying manufacturing and other jobs to foreign
countries; and
Whereas, states such as Ohio are
losing these jobs to foreign countries without anything in return;
and
Whereas, stopping the hemorrhaging of Ohio jobs is critical to Ohio’s
economic and social vitality; and
Whereas, the Ohio Senate has
introduced S.B. 13 which would require state contracts to specify that
labor or services are to be performed within the U.S., that any
supplies provided under a state contract will be from a U.S. location,
and would prohibit awarding state
contracts or giving state financial
assistance, including tax incentives,
loans or grants, for 5 years to
employers that have a net loss of
jobs due to the relocation of jobs
from Ohio to locations outside the
U.S.; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,

An emergency resolution encouraging the Ohio General Assembly to
enact legislation that would establish excessive pricing of prescription drugs as a violation of State
law, establish penalties for such
excessive pricing, and provide a
cause of action for an aggrieved
party.
Whereas, prescription drugs are
the fastest growing health care
expenditure in the United States;
and
Whereas, in 2002, U.S. spending on
prescription drugs reached $162 billion; this number is projected to
reach $369 billion by 2010; and
Whereas, paying for prescription
drugs is extremely difficult for
many people in the United States,
including many Ohio citizens, especially those that are poor, chronically ill and elderly; and
Whereas, in 2001, nearly 1 in 4
seniors reported skipping doses or
not filling prescriptions because of
the cost; and
Whereas, in 2002, the average
price of the top 50 drugs used by
seniors was $1,500 per year; a senior
without
supplementary
insurance
taking
6
different
medications
would spend $9,000 per year out-ofpocket; and
Whereas, prices of the top 30
brand-name drugs increased by 22%
over the past 3 years; in 2003 prescription costs increased four times
the rate of inflation; and
Whereas, American drug companies spend more money on marketing and advertising than they do on
research
and
development
and
invest enormous sums of money into
“me too” drugs, which provide little
to no innovation but are simply variations of existing drugs; and
Whereas, extraordinarily generous tax breaks have helped the
pharmaceutical industry become the
richest industry in the United States;
and
Whereas, it is well known that
the citizens of the United States pay
the
world’s
highest
prescription
drug prices and that most Americans struggle to pay skyrocketing
prescription drug bills; and
Whereas, the District of Columbia
has introduced a bill, and states
such as Vermont and Maine have
enacted bills, to prohibit excessive
prescription drug pricing; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby encourages the Ohio General
Assembly to enact legislation that
would establish excessive pricing of
prescription drugs as a violation of
State law, establish penalties for
such excessive pricing, and provide
a cause of action for an aggrieved
party.

An emergency resolution in support of Issues 2, 3, 4 and 5 which
would reform Ohio’s election laws to
restore faith, trust and confidence in
Ohio’s election system.
Whereas, on November 8, 2005,
several issues will be on the ballot
that, if passed, would reform Ohio’s
elections laws and restore faith and
trust in Ohio’s election system; and
Whereas, Issue 2 makes voting
easier by allowing Ohioans to vote
early by mail or in person at any
time for any reason up to 35 days
before any election; and
Whereas, Issue 3 helps stops the
influence of big money in elections
by restoring reasonable limits on
campaign
contributions;
contributions will be limited to $1,000 for
legislative candidates and $2,000 for
statewide candidates; and
Whereas, Issue 4 takes the politics out of drawing legislative districts and puts an independent commission in charge of the process
beginning in 2008; the commission
will focus on what is best for constituents, not politicians; and
Whereas, Issue 5 places a bi-partisan, nine-member board in charge
of Ohio’s elections instead of a partisan official that backs candidates
and takes sides in elections; and
Whereas, the above issues are
supported by the Reform Ohio Now
campaign and will help restore
faith, trust and confidence in the
elections system in Ohio; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of public peace, property, health or
safety, now therefore;
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
