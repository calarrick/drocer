By Council Members Zone, Brady,
Lipovan Holan, Sweeney, White,

Scott, Brancatelli and Cimperman.
An emergency resolution opposing
the federal, “Gasoline for America’s
Security Act of 2005”, and encouraging
Ohio’s
senators
to
vote
against this bill when it is heard in
the Senate.
Whereas, late last month the
House Energy and Commerce Committee passed H.R. 3893, the “Gasoline for America’s Security Act of
2005”; and
Whereas, H.R. 3893 passed the
Committee without the opportunity
for state and local governments to
comment on the consequences of
this legislation’s sweeping preemptive measures; and
Whereas, last week, H.R. 3893
barely passed out of the House of
Representatives and will now be
heard in the Senate; and
Whereas, H.R. 3893 would give the
Secretary of the Department of
Energy the final siting and permitting authority for local refineries,
thus overriding any state and local
authority to do so; and
Whereas, H.R. 3893 would expose
states and local governments to federal sanctions and lawsuits by
threatening federal transportation
and project development funding
based on siting decisions made by
the federal government; and
Whereas, H.R. 3893 would impact
public health by compromising long
standing federal environmental laws
in that it would allow modifications
that would expand the capacity of
any industrial source (not just a
refinery)
without
requiring
any
anti-pollution mechanisms; and
Whereas, H.R. 3893 reduces the
number of possible blends of diesel
and gasoline, without regard for the
individual needs of states and local-

2258

October 19, 2005
ities that depend on these special
blends to reduce emissions from
mobile sources, thus affecting the
health and well-being of Americans
everywhere; and
Whereas, H.R. 3893 masks attempts to dismantle environmental
laws that are not barriers to rebuilding the Gulf States affected by
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby opposes the federal, “Gasoline for
America’s Security Act of 2005”, H.R.
3893 and encourages Ohio’s senators
to vote against this bill when it is
heard in the Senate.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit

An emergency resolution supporting increased federal regulation of
non-point sources of water pollution.
Whereas, the Clean Water Act has
had undeniable success in reaching
the goal of restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical and biological integrity of the nation’s surface waters; and
Whereas, for almost 30 years, federal law has focused primarily on
point source pollution, strictly controlling discharges from municipal
and other facilities; and
Whereas, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, using
data provided by the states, reported in its 2000 National Water Quality Inventory Report that thirty-nine
percent (39%) of assessed river and
stream miles and forty-five percent
(45%) of assessed lake acres are not
meeting applicable standards and
are impaired for one or more desired
uses; and
Whereas, these waters cross political boundaries and any mechanism
to address pollution must include
watershed-based solutions; and
Whereas, the EPA states that nonpoint sources are the main reason
for these water quality problems —
perhaps contributing as much as
fifty percent (50%) of the nation’s
water pollution; and

October 19, 2005
Whereas, estimates on the cost to
address national non-point pollution
are based on questionable data and
are likely too outdated to be useful;
and
Whereas, combating the problem
of non-point source pollution will
require significant federal investment; and
Whereas, existing federal mechanisms, programs, and funding to
address
non-point
sources
have
proved inadequate to combat this
problem; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
Congress to develop a comprehensive, consistent program to control
and regulate non-source pollution
that includes adequate federal resources to progress and research,
economic studies to estimate costs
to control non-point pollution, and
watershed-based water quality initiatives.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to United
States Senator George Voinovich,
United States Senator Mike DeWine,
all members of the United States
House of Representatives representing Cuyahoga County and the surrounding counties, and the National
League of Cities.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it

An emergency resolution opposing
that portion of House Bill 189 that
modifies the definition of “dangerous dog” and “vicious dog” by eliminating pit bull dog from the definition of “vicious dog”.
Whereas, current state law defines “vicious dog” as a dog that (1)
without provocation kills or causes
serious injury to any person, (2)
without provocation causes injury,
other than death or serious injury,
to any person or has killed another
dog, or (3) belongs to a breed that
is commonly know as a pit bull dog;
and
Whereas, current state law also
states that the ownership, keeping,
or harboring of a pit bull dog is
prima-face evidence of the ownership, keeping, or harboring of a
vicious dog”; and
Whereas, House Bill 189 modifies
the definition of “dangerous dog”

The City Record
and “vicious dog” by eliminating pit
bull dog from the definition of
“vicious dog”; and
Whereas, the presence of pit bull
dogs in neighborhoods often results
in fear and anxiety; and
Whereas, recent attacks by pit
bull dogs have increased this fear
and anxiety; and
Whereas, current state law requires owners of pit bull dogs and
other vicious dogs to satisfy certain
requirements
regarding
confinement, restraint, and liability insurance; and
Whereas, these requirements help
to protect the public; and
Whereas, removing pit bull dogs
from the vicious dog definition will
provide the public with less protection from pit bull dogs; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes that portion of House Bill 189
that modifies the definition of “dangerous dog” and “vicious dog” by
eliminating pit bull dog from the
definition of “vicious dog”.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a

public purpose.
Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of

which is more particularly described
in the documents set forth in the file
described in this ordinance (the
“Real Property”); and
Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of
the Revised Code, such improvements so declared to be a public purpose may be exempt from real property taxation; and
Whereas, under Section 5709.42 of
the Revised Code, the owners of the
improvements may be required to
make annual service payments in
lieu of taxes that would have been
paid had such improvements not
been exempt; and
Whereas, under Section 5709.41 of
the Revised Code, the exemption
may exceed 75% of the improvements for up to 30 years without
the approval of the board of education of the school district within
the territory of which the improvements are or will be located if the
ordinance declaring improvements
to a parcel to be a public purpose
specifies that service payments in
lieu of taxes provided for in Section 5709.42 of the Ohio Revised
Code shall be paid to the school
district in which the parcel is located in the amount of the taxes that
would have been payable to the
school district if the improvements
had not been exempted from taxation; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

taxes that would have been paid had
the Improvements not been exempt
from taxation.
Section 4. That a portion of the
service payments collected under
Section 3 of this ordinance shall be
distributed by the Cuyahoga County Treasurer to the Treasurer of

Improvement not been exempt from
taxation.
Section 5. That the Mayor or
Director of Economic Development,
with the approval of the Director of
Law, is authorized to enter into one
or more agreements with such parties as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the purposes of
this ordinance.

5709.43 of the Revised Code there
is hereby established a Steelyard

Urban
Redevelopment
Tax Increment Equivalent Fund
(“Steelyard Commons TIF Fund”),
70% of which shall be used for
acquisition of land and to make
improvements to the Tow Path
Trail and Canal Basin Park. Of
this 70%, if there are remaining
funds, they shall be used for additional connector trails.
The remaining 30% shall be used
for retail assistance programs and
other commercial and industrial initiatives, including land acquisition,
within the City. This 30% will be
used primarily for projects that offset the impacts of Steelyard Commons on adjacent neighborhood commercial districts, and use of these
funds will be guided by the retail
impact study currently underway.
These funds will be disbursed quarterly as grants, on a competitive
basis, under criteria established by
this Council and the Cleveland Citywide

Development
and
the
Director of Law, money deposited in
the Steelyard Commons TIF Fund
shall be used to for the purposes
described in Section 6.

employment of local residents and
minority and female business enterprises can best be advanced. The
Director of the Office of Equal
Opportunity shall report back to this
Council on the results of those discussions and shall make recommendations on how to achieve those
goals.
Section 9. That the developer has
agreed that in all its bid packages
for construction work of the Improvement it will give preference to
bidders that include employment of
City workers, MBE and FBE subcontractors, and union labor.

created an Advisory Committee that
shall consist of five members selected as follows: one (1) member shall
be appointed by this Council; one
(1) member shall be appointed by
the Mayor; one (1) member shall be

An emergency resolution designating the portion of East 22nd

Whereas, October 10th, 2005 is the
140th anniversary of the founding of
St. Vincent Charity Hospital and the
154th anniversary of the arrival of
the Sisters of Charity of St. Augustine in Cleveland, Ohio; and
Whereas, Sr. Ignatia Gavin, C.S.A.
was a member of the religious community of the Sisters of Charity of
St. Augustine; and
Whereas, Sr. Ignatia Gavin, C.S.A.
was born in Ballyhane, County
Mayo, Ireland on January 2, 1889
and emigrated to Cleveland, Ohio,
U.S.A. as a small child and was
raised in City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, Sr. Ignatia Gavin, C.S.A.
helped co-found Alcoholics Anonymous at St. Thomas Hospital with
Dr. Robert H. Smith and Bill Wilson
in North East Ohio in 1939; and
Whereas, Alcoholics Anonymous
has helped millions upon millions of
people in every country; and
Whereas, Sr. Ignatia Gavin, C.S.A.
founded Rosary Hall Solarium in
1952 at St. Vincent Charity Hospital
as one of the first hospital-based

Res. No. 1905-05.
By Council Members Zone, Sweeney,
Kelley,
Knight,
Polensek,
Coats, Pierce Scott, Reed, Westbrook, Conwell, Brady and Lewis.
An emergency resolution opposing
the federal, “Gasoline for America’s
Security Act of 2005”, H.R. 3893.
Whereas, late last month the
House Energy and Commerce Committee passed H.R. 3893, the “Gasoline for America’s Security Act of
2005”; and
Whereas, H.R. 3893 passed the
Committee without the opportunity
for state and local governments to
comment on the consequences of
this legislation’s sweeping preemptive measures; and
Whereas, H.R. 3893 would give the
Secretary of the Department of
Energy the final siting and permitting authority for local refineries,
thus overriding any state and local
authority to do so; and
Whereas, H.R. 3893 would expose
states and local governments to federal sanctions and lawsuits by
threatening federal transportation
and project development funding
based on siting decisions made by
the federal government; and
Whereas, H.R. 3893 would impact
public health by compromising long
standing federal environmental laws
in that it would allow modifications
that would expand the capacity of
any industrial source (not just a
refinery)
without
requiring
any
anti-pollution mechanisms; and
Whereas, H.R. 3893 reduces the
number of possible blends of diesel
and gasoline, without regard for the
individual needs of states and localities that depend on these special
blends to reduce emissions from
mobile sources, thus affecting the
health and well-being of Americans
everywhere; and
Whereas, H.R. 3893 masks attempts to dismantle environmental
laws that are not barriers to rebuilding the Gulf States affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby opposes the federal, “Gasoline for
America’s Security Act of 2005”, H.R.
3893.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to all members of the House of Representatives representing Cuyahoga County
and to the National League of Cities.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it

The City Record
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
