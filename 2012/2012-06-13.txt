RENT ADJUSTMENT
Any rental rate stated in Schedules I-IV above may be adjusted by
the Director based upon the determination for a particular event upon
compliance with all of the following
requirements:
(a) Adjustment Limits. No rental
rate may be increased or decreased
by a percentage greater than sixty
percent (60%) of the rental rate
stated in the applicable Schedule.
(b) Standards for Rent Increases
or Decreases. In adopting this Rent
Schedule Resolution, the Board of
Control understands that a proposed
Cleveland Public Auditorium and
Conference Center event will provide direct and indirect benefits to
the City of Cleveland in addition to
the rent collected for use of the
facility. These benefits include revenues from food and beverage concessions, revenues from the transient occupancy tax assessed pursuant to Chapter 193 of the C.O., revenues from novelty sales, and revenues from event services provided
by City of Cleveland staff and outside contractors (collectively, “Additional Benefits”). The rates set forth
in Schedule I-IV above assume the
event will generate an average level
of Additional Benefits. However, if
the Director determines, that an
event will generate Additional Benefits substantially less than or substantially greater than the Additional Benefits generated by an
average Cleveland Public Auditorium and Conference Center event, the
Director may adjust the event rental
rate accordingly. For example, if by
reducing the rental rate the Director is able to attract an event which
would yield substantial Additional
Benefits the Director may reduce
the rental rate within the range set
forth in paragraph (a) above. By
contrast, if a proposed event will
yield minimal Additional Benefits,
the Director may increase the rental
rate within range set forth in paragraph (a) above.
(c) Required Approvals for Rental
Increases or Decreases. Rent adjustments shall require the additional
approval of the Director of Law or
his/her designee. These additional
approvals may be evidenced by
these
parties’
execution
and/or
approval of the event contract, as
applicable, provided that a brief justification for the adjustments is set
forth in an “Additional Provisions”
section completed by the Director at
the end of the contract immediately
above these parties’ signature lines.
(d) Rent Adjustment Record keeping.
The
Director
shall
keep
detailed records of all rent adjustments. The Director shall submit to
the Office of the Mayor, and the
Director of Law, a written report
summarizing all rent adjustments
made during that calendar year, on
or before January 15 of the following year.
Be it further resolved that Resolution No. 117-03 adopted by the
Board of Control February 26, 2003
is rescinded.

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 818-12.
By Council Member Sweeney (by
departmental request).
An emergency resolution to adopt
and declare a Tax Budget for the City
of Cleveland for the year 2013 and
submit it to the County Budget Commission as required by State Law,
Chapter 5705 of the Revised Code.
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council, under
the provisions of Chapter 5705 of the
Revised Code, after public hearings
as required by law, does adopt the
statements of the year 2013 requirements for the several funds of the
City of Cleveland as being the budget required by state law to be submitted to the County Budget Commission, which requirements are
contained in File No. 818-12-A
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to certify a copy of the res-

olution to the County Auditor of Cuyahoga County.
Section 3. That this resolution is
declared to be an emergency measure
and, provided it receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take
effect and be in force immediately
upon its adoption and approval by the
Mayor; otherwise it shall take effect
and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.
Adopted June 4, 2012.
Effective June 8, 2012.

Res. No. 847-12.
By Council Member Sweeney.
An emergency resolution supporting the striking Teamsters Local 507
members employed by the American
Red Cross.
Whereas, members of Teamsters
Local 507 employed by the American
Red Cross Blood Services Division of
Cleveland have been on strike since
February 14, 2012 in a dispute about
staffing levels; and
Whereas, these union members
want to preserve their right to collectively bargain, a right that they
believe the American Red Cross is trying to take away; and
Whereas, members of Teamsters
Local 507 seek to maintain adequate
staffing levels so that the blood supply is not endangered; and
Whereas, historically the American
Red Cross has served a beneficial
public purpose and promoted a high
quality work environment; this work
stoppage and the resulting conflict
jeopardizes the good standing of the
American Red Cross; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the striking Teamsters Local
507 members employed by the American Red Cross.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit a copy of this
resolution to Mary-Alice Frank, CEO
and Dennis M. Chack, Chairman of
the Board, American Red Cross of
Greater Cleveland.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted June 4, 2012.
Effective June 11, 2012, without
the signature of the Mayor.

Res. No. 849-12.
By Council Members J. Johnson,
Polensek, Cummins, Kelley, Keane,
Pruitt, Zone, Cleveland and Mitchell.
An emergency resolution supporting the MetroHealth System and State
of Ohio’s Medicaid Waiver Demonstration application to the U.S. Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services.

958

June 13, 2012
Whereas, Cuyahoga County residents have median incomes that are
18 percent below national levels and
Cleveland city residents earn about
half the national average; and
Whereas, an estimated 158,000
Cuyahoga County adults are estimated to be uninsured, and do not presently qualify for Medicaid programs; and
Whereas, Cleveland is ranked the
third poorest city in the nation, and
over 60 percent of the region’s poor
now live in the surrounding suburbs;
and
Whereas, as a public hospital, The
MetroHealth System provides health
care to all, regardless of a patient’s
ability to pay; and
Whereas, The MetroHealth System
provided over 226,000 uninsured
patient visits in 2011, which amounts
to an increase of 42 percent since 2008;
and
Whereas, all eleven MetroHealth
primary care practices have achieved
the highest level of recognition from
the National Center for Quality Assurance; and
Whereas, MetroHealth has been
recognized by Better Health Greater
Cleveland for providing outstanding
care to uninsured and Medicaid
patients with diabetes, heart failure,
and high blood pressure; and
Whereas, The MetroHealth System,
Cuyahoga County, and the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have an opportunity to
partner to reduce the uninsured rate
in Cuyahoga County, to improve the
health status and quality of care for
thousands of county and city of Cleveland residents, and help prepare the
safety net system and uninsured individuals for the health coverage
expansion in 2014 through a waiver of
existing rules from CMS, such
waivers being the standard practice
for demonstrating new and innovative ways of providing health care;
and
Whereas, the State of Ohio in conjunction with the MetroHealth System submitted the Medicaid Waiver
Demonstration application to CMS on
or about April 24, 2012; and
Whereas, it is necessary that this
Resolution
become
immediately
effective in order to ensure that
Cleveland City Council’s support is
communicated immediately to CMS.
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City
of
Cleveland
supports
the
MetroHealth System and State of
Ohio’s Medicaid Waiver Demonstration application to the U.S. Centers
for Medicaid and Medicare Services.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
resolution to the U.S. Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed

Whereas, the NEORSD was in a contract situation that allowed them to
act quickly to stop the discharge into
the Cuyahoga River and to repair the

Whereas, the Director of Public
Utilities has determined, based on
considerations of capability, immediate availability, and completion date,
quality, cost, and safety, that the City
