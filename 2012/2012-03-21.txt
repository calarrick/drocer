shall not exceed six percent (6%) per
year. Interest on the Bonds shall be
payable when due, or until the principal amount is paid, semiannually as
specified in the Certificate of Award
as the dates on which interest on the
Bonds shall be payable (the “Interest
Payment Dates”), beginning on the
date specified in the Certificate of
Award as the first Interest Payment
Date.
The Bonds shall mature in the
years and principal amounts as shall
be permitted by law and determined
by the Director of Finance and specified in the Certificate of Award, based
on the written advice of a Financial
Advisor to be in the best interests of
the City, provided that (i) each principal payment shall occur on an Interest Payment Date, (ii) the first principal payment on the Bonds shall be
no earlier than November 15, 2012 and
no later than December 31, 2013, (iii)
the final maturity date of the Bonds
shall be no later than 18 years from
that date which is 12 months prior to
the first date on which provision for
payment of principal is made, and
(iv) the principal amount thereof
shall be payable in annual installments such that the total principal
and interest payments on the Bonds
in any fiscal year in which principal
is payable is not more than three
times the amount of those payments
in any other fiscal year.
The Bonds stated to mature in any
year may be issued as term bonds (the
“Term Bonds”), payable pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements as defined and further
described below. The Director of
Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award whether any of the
Bonds shall be issued as Term Bonds,
any dates (the “Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable pursuant to mandatory sinking fund installments rather than at
stated maturity and the amount of
principal to be paid on each Mandatory Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption or purchase prior to stated maturity as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory
sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100%
of the principal amount redeemed,
plus interest accrued to the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to be
deposited with the Escrow Agent, currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of and
interest on any Term Bonds shall
include amounts sufficient to redeem
on the Mandatory Redemption Dates
the principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to

The City Record
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided
below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined in
Section  3 hereof) for cancellation
Term Bonds in any aggregate principal amount and to receive a credit
against the then-current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City for
any Term Bonds. That option shall be
exercised by the City on or before the
forty-fifth day preceding the applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, by
furnishing the Escrow Agent a certificate, signed by the Registrar, setting forth the extent of the credit to
be applied with respect to the thencurrent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement. If the certificate is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
corresponding
mandatory
(and
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the thencurrent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding
mandatory
redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds that
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and cancelled
by the Registrar, to the extent not
applied theretofore as a credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and cancelled, shall be credited by the
Escrow Agent at 100% of the principal amount thereof against the thencurrent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding
mandatory
redemption
obligation). Any excess of that
amount over the then-current Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirement
shall
be
credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligations) in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(b) Optional Redemption. The
Bonds may be subject to redemption
prior to maturity by and at the option
of the City, in whole or in part on any
date, in integral multiples of $5,000,
on the optional redemption dates and
at the redemption prices (expressed
as a percentage of the principal
amount redeemed) specified in the
Certificate of Award, plus, in each
case, accrued interest to the redemption date. The first optional redemption date shall not be later than ten
years from the first Interest Payment
Date, and the highest redemption
price shall not be greater than 102%
of the principal amount redeemed
plus accrued interest to the redemption date. Based on the written advice
of a financial advisor, the Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that it is in the best
interests of the City for some or all of
the Bonds not to be callable prior to
their stated maturity.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, the Bonds, or portions thereof, to be redeemed option-

296

March 21, 2012
ally shall be selected by lot prior to
the selection by lot of the Bonds to be
redeemed on the same date by operation of the Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds shall be
redeemed pursuant to this paragraph
only upon written notice from the
Director of Finance to the Registrar.
That notice shall specify the redemption date and the principal amount of
each maturity of Bonds to be
redeemed, and shall be given at least
45 days prior to the redemption date
or such shorter period as shall be
acceptable to the Registrar. There
shall be deposited with the Registrar
on or prior to the redemption date
funds sufficient to redeem at the
redemption
price
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice of
redemption has been given.
(c) Purchase in Lieu of Redemption. If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the City may
elect to purchase Bonds called for
optional redemption in lieu of redeeming those Bonds. That election shall
be exercised by written direction
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar and the Escrow Agent.
That written direction shall state
whether all or less than all of the
Bonds called for optional redemption
are to be purchased by the City in lieu
of redemption, shall identify the
Bonds to be purchased by their maturity date and shall specify the principal amount of each maturity to be purchased in lieu of redemption. If less
than all of the Bonds called for optional redemption are to be purchased in
lieu of redemption, the amount of
each maturity to be purchased shall
be in amounts of $5,000 or integral
multiples of $5,000. Any Bonds called
for optional redemption that are not
to be purchased shall be redeemed in
accordance with their redemption provisions. The purchase price of the
Bonds to be purchased in lieu of
redemption shall be equal to the principal of, any accrued but unpaid interest on, and any premium that would
have been payable on the Bonds on
the redemption date if the Bonds had
been optionally redeemed instead of
being purchased. No notice of the purchase in lieu of redemption is
required to be given to the owners of
the Bonds in addition to the notice of
redemption required by this Ordinance. The Escrow Agent or Registrar, as paying agent, shall not purchase Bonds if sufficient moneys
have not been deposited with the
Escrow Agent or Registrar, as paying
agent, by the City for the purpose. On
or prior to the scheduled date for
optional redemption, the City may
rescind its direction to purchase the
Bonds in lieu of redemption by written notice from the Director of
Finance to the Registrar and the
Escrow Agent. In the event that the
direction to purchase is rescinded, the
Bonds shall be redeemed on the
redemption date set forth in the notice
of redemption delivered to the owners
of the Bonds and in accordance with
the provisions of this Ordinance.
(d) Partial Redemption or Purchase. If fewer than all of the outstanding Bonds are called for redemption at one time (whether for redemption or purchase in lieu of redemption), they shall be called in the order
of maturities directed by the Director
of Finance. If fewer than all Bonds of
a single maturity are to be redeemed
or purchased in lieu of redemption,

March 21, 2012
the selection of Bonds to be redeemed
or purchased, or portions thereof in
amounts of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof, shall be made by the
Registrar by lot in a manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of
a partial redemption or purchase of
Bonds by lot when Bonds of denominations greater than $5,000 are then
outstanding, each $5,000 unit of principal thereof shall be treated as
though it were a separate Bond of the
denomination of $5,000. If it is determined that one or more, but not all of
the $5,000 units of principal amount
represented by a Bond are to be called
for redemption, then upon notice of
redemption of a $5,000 unit or units,
the registered owner of that Bond
shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i) for payment of the redemption
or purchase price of the $5,000 unit or
units called for redemption (including, without limitation, the interest
accrued to the date fixed for redemption and any premium), and (ii) for
issuance, without charge to the registered owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured portion of the Bond not
redeemed or purchased and bearing
interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date as the Bond surrendered.
(e) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii) the
redemption price to be paid, (iii) the
date fixed for redemption, and (iv)
the place or places where the amounts
due upon redemption are payable.
The notice shall be given by the Registrar on behalf of the City by mailing
a copy of the redemption notice by
first-class mail, postage prepaid, at
least 30 days prior to the date fixed
for redemption (or such period specified in the Certificate of Award), to
the registered owner of each Bond
subject to redemption in whole or in
part at the registered owner’s address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close of
business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing and to any provider
of a Credit Support Instrument (as
defined in Section 15 hereof) for the
Bonds or designated portions thereof.
Failure to receive notice by mail or
any defect in that notice regarding
any Bond, however, shall not affect
the validity of the proceedings for the
redemption of any Bond. Any notice
of redemption of any Bonds may specify that the redemption is contingent
on the deposit of moneys with the
Escrow Agent or Registrar, as paying
agent, on or prior to the redemption
date in an amount sufficient to pay
the redemption price of the Bonds to
be redeemed.
(f) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the manner provided in the preceding paragraph, and moneys having been
deposited by the City with the Escrow
Agent or Registrar, as paying agent,
in an amount sufficient to pay the
redemption price, the Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption
shall become due and payable on the
redemption date, and, upon presentation and surrender at the place or
places specified in that notice, shall
be paid. If money for the redemption
of all of the Bonds and portions there-

The City Record
of to be redeemed, including interest
accrued to the redemption date, is
held by the Registrar on the redemption date, and, if notice of redemption
has been deposited in the mail, then
from and after the redemption date
those Bonds and portions thereof
called for redemption shall cease to
bear interest and no longer shall be
considered to be outstanding. If that
money shall not be so available on the
redemption date, or that notice shall
not have been deposited in the mail,
those Bonds and portions thereof
shall continue to bear interest, until
they are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money held
by the Registrar for the redemption of
particular Bonds shall be held in trust
for the account of the registered owners and shall be paid to them, respectively, upon presentation and surrender of those Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without
deduction for the services of the Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent. Principal shall be payable
when due upon presentation and surrender of the Bonds at the principal
corporate trust office of the Registrar. Interest on a Bond shall be paid
on each Interest Payment Date by
check or draft mailed to the person in
whose name the Bond was registered,
and to that person’s address appearing, on the Bond Register (as defined
in Section  3 hereof) at the close of
business on the date provided in the
Registrar Agreement authorized and
defined in Section  3 hereof (the
“Record Date”). Notwithstanding any
contrary provision in the General
Bond Ordinance, so long as the Bonds
are held by a Depository in a book
entry system (as described in Section  3 hereof), debt charges on the
Bonds will be payable in lawful
money of the United States by wire
transfer to the Depository made by
the Escrow Agent on each Interest
Payment Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance. The General Bond Ordinance, except for the third paragraph
of Section 13(a) (pertaining generally to an adjustment of the interest
rate in an event of default) and the
third paragraph of Section 4 (pertaining generally to the periods during
which the City is not required to make
any transfers or exchanges of bonds
issued under the General Bond Ordinance), will apply to the Bonds.
Except for those provisions, the General Bond Ordinance is included as a
part of this Ordinance as fully as if
restated in this Ordinance. Words and
terms not otherwise defined in this
Ordinance shall have the same meaning as set forth in the General Bond
Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of the
Bonds; Paying Agents. The Bonds
shall express upon their faces the purpose for which they are issued and
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance. Pursuant to Section  4 of
the General Bond Ordinance, each
Bond shall be authenticated by the
manual signature of an authorized
officer of the Trustee (as defined
therein). The Bonds shall be signed
by the City’s Mayor and by the City’s
Director of Finance, and, consistent
with Section  133.27 of the Ohio

297

17
Revised Code and notwithstanding
Section  177.02 of the Codified Ordinances of the City, either or both of
those signatures may be a facsimile.
The Bonds shall bear the seal of the
City, which seal may be a facsimile
seal. Pursuant to Section  83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
shall prepare the Bonds and shall
endorse thereon his approval of the
form and correctness thereof by his
manual or facsimile signature.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating
agent, bond registrar, transfer agent
and paying agent for the Bonds (the
“Registrar”). The Registrar shall also
act as paying agent for the Bonds so
long as the Bonds are held in a book
entry system. The Director of Finance
is authorized to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City, an
agreement between the City and the
Registrar (the “Registrar Agreement”), approved as to form and correctness by the Director of Law, providing for services relating to the registration, transfer, exchange and payment of the Bonds on terms approved
by the Director of Finance on behalf
of the City and consistent with this
Ordinance and not substantially
adverse to the City. That approval
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Registrar Agreement by the Director of Finance. The
Director of Finance shall provide for
the payment of the services rendered
and for reimbursement of expenses
incurred pursuant to the Registrar
Agreement from the proceeds of the
Bonds to the extent available and
then from other money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds remain
outstanding, the City will cause the
Registrar to maintain and keep at its
principal corporate trust office all
books and records necessary for the
registration, exchange and transfer
of Bonds as provided in this Section
(the “Bond Register”). The person in
whose name a Bond is registered on
the Bond Register shall be regarded
as the absolute owner of that Bond for
all purposes of this Ordinance. Payment of or on account of the debt
charges on any Bond shall be made
only to or upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar
shall be affected by any notice to the
contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid and
effectual to satisfy and discharge the
City’s liability upon the Bond, including interest, to the extent of the
amount or amounts so paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender
at the principal corporate trust office
of the Registrar, together with a
request for exchange signed by the
registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. A Bond may
be transferred only on the Bond Register upon presentation and surrender
of the Bond at the principal corporate
trust office of the Registrar together
with an assignment signed by the registered owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner equal

18
in the aggregate to the unmatured
principal amount of the Bond surrendered and bearing interest at the
same rate and maturing on the same
date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any tax or
other governmental charge required
to be paid with respect to the
exchange or transfer. The City or the
Registrar may require that those
charges, if any, be paid before the procedure is begun for the exchange or
transfer. All Bonds issued and
authenticated upon any exchange or
transfer shall be valid obligations of
the City, evidencing the same debt,
and entitled to the same security and
benefit under this Ordinance, as the
surrendered
upon
that
Bonds
exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds and the principal of and interest on the Bonds may
be transferred only through a book
entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are
issued by the City only to a Depository or its nominee as registered owner,
with the Bonds “immobilized” in the
custody of the Depository. The book
entry maintained by others than the
City is the record that identifies the
owners of beneficial interests in those
Bonds and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited
purpose trust company), New York,
New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers,
banks and trust companies, and clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized: (i) the Bonds
may be issued in the form of a single,
fully registered Bond representing
each maturity and registered in the
name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository;
(ii) the beneficial owners in book
entry form shall have no right to
receive Bonds in the form of physical
securities or certificates; (iii) owner-

The City Record
ship of beneficial interests in book
entry form shall be shown by book
entry on the system maintained and
operated by the Depository and its
Participants, and transfers of the
ownership of beneficial interests
shall be made only by book entry by
the Depository and its Participants;
and (iv) the Bonds as such shall not
be transferable or exchangeable,
except for transfer to another Depository or to another nominee of a Depository, without further action by the
City.
If any Depository determines not to
continue to act as a Depository for the
Bonds for use in a book entry system,
the Director of Finance may attempt
to
establish
a
securities
depository/book entry relationship with
another qualified Depository. If the
Director of Finance does not or is
unable to do so, the Registrar, after
making provision for notification of
the beneficial owners by the then
Depository and any other arrangements deemed necessary, shall permit
withdrawal of the Bonds from the
Depository, and the Trustee and Registrar shall authenticate and deliver
bond certificates in registered form to
the assigns of the Depository or its
nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to the
extent necessary or required to enter
into any agreements determined necessary in connection with the book
entry system for the Bonds, after
determining that the signing thereof
will not endanger the funds or securities of the City and after the approval
of the form of any such agreement by
the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The Bonds
shall first be offered for purchase to
the Trustees of the Sinking Fund and,
if not purchased by them, shall be
offered to the Treasury Investment
Account for purchase and, if not purchased for that Account, shall be sold
to one or more firms that have proposed to underwrite the Bonds and
have been selected by the Director of
Finance based on an evaluation of the
qualifications of those firms (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”).
The Bonds shall be awarded to the
Original Purchaser in the Certificate
of Award which shall specify the
final terms of the Bonds in accordance with law, the provisions of this
Ordinance, the written advice of a
financial advisor retained under
authority of Section 16 hereof and the
Original Purchaser’s offer to purchase the Bonds, including: the principal amount of the Bonds, the purchase price (which shall be not less
than 97% of the principal amount of
the Bonds plus any accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate or
rates, the amounts and years in which
principal installments are payable
(at stated maturity or pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements), the Interest Payment
Dates and the date of the Bonds and
any other matters required in this
Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. As appropriate under the
Charter, the Mayor, Director of
Finance, Director of Law, Clerk of
Council and other appropriate officers of the City are, and each of them
is, authorized to take such actions as
are necessary, appropriate and in the

298

March 21, 2012
best interest of the City to establish
the terms and requirements for delivery of the Bonds and to make such
arrangements as are necessary with
the Original Purchaser in order to
establish the date, location, procedures, and conditions for the delivery
of the Bonds to the Original Purchaser, to give all appropriate notices and
certificates, to cause a true transcript
of proceedings with reference to the
issuance of the Bonds to be delivered
to the Original Purchaser, to sign any
transcript
certificates,
financial
statements and other documents and
instruments and to take such actions
as are necessary or appropriate to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take
all steps necessary to effect the due
execution, authentication and delivery of the Bonds. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to sign
and deliver on behalf of the City a
bond purchase agreement between
the City and the Original Purchaser
(the “Bond Purchase Agreement”),
approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, setting forth
the terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell the Bonds and the
Original Purchaser agrees to buy the
Bonds, which shall be consistent with
this Ordinance, not substantially
adverse to the City, and approved by
the Director of Finance and Director
of Law on behalf of the City, all of
which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of the Bond
Purchase Agreement by the Director
of Finance. It is determined that the
terms of the Bonds, as provided in this
Ordinance and as may be provided in
or pursuant to the Certificate of
Award, are in the best interest of the
City and in compliance with all legal
requirements.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B) of the
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds with
other bonds into a single consolidated
issue of bonds for purposes of their
sale as a single issue to be designated
“Various Purpose General Obligation
Bonds, Series 2012” or such other designation as may be set forth in the
Certificate of Award. Such bonds
shall contain a summary statement of
purposes encompassing the purpose
for which the Bonds are issued and
shall state that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds promptly when and as the same falls due,
and also to provide for the discharge
of the Bonds at maturity, there shall
be and is levied on all the taxable
property in the City, in addition to all
other taxes, a direct tax annually during the period the Bonds are outstanding, in an amount sufficient to
provide for the payment of that interest, when and as the same shall fall
due, and also to discharge the principal of the Bonds at maturity, which
tax shall not be less than the interest
and sinking fund tax required by Section 11 of Article XII of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is ordered computed, certified, levied and extended
upon the tax duplicate and collected
by the same officers, in the same manner and at the same time that taxes
for general purposes for each of those
years are certified, extended and collected. The tax shall be placed before
and in preference to all other items

March 21, 2012
and for the full amount thereof. The
funds derived from those tax levies
shall be placed in the Unvoted Tax
Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund as required by the General Bond Ordinance, and those funds,
together with the interest collected on
them, shall be irrevocably pledged for
the payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds when and as the
same fall due; provided, however,
that, subject to the provisions of Section 8 of the General Bond Ordinance,
in each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the Bonds
and are appropriated for such purpose, the amount of such tax shall be
reduced by the amount of such revenues so available and appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections  133.25(B)(1) and 5705.51 of
the Ohio Revised Code, and in accordance with the provisions of and to
the extent required or permitted by
the General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt charges
for the Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended and applied for the objects
and purposes for which the Bonds are
issued. The proceeds of the Bonds to
be applied to pay costs of any Credit
Support Instruments obtained pursuant to Section 15 hereof shall be
paid to the provider or providers of
those Credit Support Instruments.
The proceeds of the Bonds to be used
to pay costs of issuing the Bonds shall
be deposited with the Registrar in a
separate account under the Registrar
Agreement pending their application
to the payment of such costs. Pursuant to Chapter 133 of the Ohio
Revised Code and this Ordinance, and
notwithstanding Chapter 179 of the
Codified Ordinances, any accrued
interest and any premium received
from the sale of the Bonds shall be
deposited in the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund to be applied to the payment of the principal of and interest
on the Bonds.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Bonds are secured by a pledge and
lien on a parity with the pledges and
liens authorized by the General Bond
Ordinance and, in addition to the
taxes and revenues specifically
pledged pursuant to this Ordinance
and the General Bond Ordinance and
the other covenants, terms and agreements provided hereunder and in the
General Bond Ordinance to secure
payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds, the City hereby
determines, declares, warrants and
covenants that the Bonds are general
obligations of the City and that the
full faith and credit of the City are
hereby pledged for the payment of the
principal of and interest on the Bonds
in accordance with the laws and Constitution of the State of Ohio, this
Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid and
discharged all the outstanding Bonds,
or there shall otherwise be paid to the
holders of the outstanding Bonds all

The City Record
debt charges due or to become due
thereon, and provision shall also be
made for paying all other sums
payable hereunder, then and in that
event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of
further effect, and the covenants,
agreements and other obligations of
the City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the request
of the City execute and deliver to the
City such instruments in writing as
shall discharge the lien hereof and
enter on the record such discharge of
the lien and such other instruments as
may be reasonably required by the
City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if:
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or subaccounts, in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold in
special accounts or subaccounts, in
trust for and irrevocably committed
solely thereto, direct obligations of
the United States certified by an independent public accounting firm of
national reputation to be of such
maturities and interest payment
dates and to bear such interest, without further investment or reinvestment of either the principal amount
thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held in trust and
committed, except as hereinafter provided), as will be sufficient, together
with moneys referred to in (i) above,
for the payment, at their maturities or
redemption dates, of all debt charges
on the Bonds to their date of maturity
or redemption, as the case may be, or
if default in such payment shall have
occurred on such date then to the date
of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds are to be
redeemed prior to the maturity thereof, notice of such redemption shall
have been duly given or irrevocable
provision satisfactory to the Trustee
shall have been duly made for the giving of such notice. Any moneys held
by the Escrow Agent in accordance
with the provisions of this Section
shall be invested by the Escrow
Agent in direct obligations of the
United States of America maturing, or
redeemable at the option of the holder, at times and in amounts sufficient
to meet payment of debt charges on
the Bonds, as directed by the Director
of Finance. Any income or interest
earned by, or increment to, the investments held under this Section shall, to
the extent determined from time to
time by the Escrow Agent to be in
excess of the amount required to be
held by it for the purposes of this Section, be transferred at the time of
such determination as provided in
Section  17(a) of the General Bond
Ordinance for unclaimed funds held
by a Paying Agent. In the event of
nonpresentment of any Bond as
described in Section 17(a) of the General Bond Ordinance, the moneys held
pursuant to this Section shall be held
and paid as provided in said Section  17(a) for unclaimed funds held
by a Paying Agent.
Section 9. Bond Anticipation Notes.
For the purpose of raising money in
anticipation of the issuance of the
Bonds for the purpose set forth in Sec-

299

19
tion 1 hereof, notes of the City may be
issued in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed Fourteen Million Six Hundred Thousand Dollars
($14,600,000) (the “Notes”) upon the
direction of the Director of Finance to
be set forth in a certificate providing
for the final terms of the Notes and
the sale of the Notes and signed by the
Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate of Award”).
(a) Terms of the Notes. The Notes
shall bear interest at such rate, not
exceeding six percent (6%) per year,
as may be fixed by the Director of
Finance of the City in the Note Certificate of Award; shall be dated their
date of issuance; shall mature on the
date set forth in the Note Certificate
of Award, which shall be no later than
five years from such date of issuance;
shall be subject to redemption by the
City at any time prior to maturity
without penalty, provided that, if the
Director of Finance, based on the
advice of a financial advisor, determines that it is in the best interest of
the City in order to enhance the marketability of the Notes, the Director of
Finance may cause the Notes to not be
redeemable for a period which ends
no later than the date which is two
years following the date of issuance
of the Notes; shall be designated “Public Facilities Improvement Bond
Anticipation Notes”; shall be issued in
such numbers and denominations as
may be requested by the Note Purchaser (hereinafter defined); and
shall be issued in fully registered
form (which may be in a book entry
only system) in denominations of
$5,000 or integral multiples thereof.
Interest shall be payable semiannually on the dates set forth in the Note
Certificate of Award; provided that if
the Notes mature on or before the end
of the twelfth month following their
date of issuance, interest on the Notes
shall be payable at maturity.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating
agent, registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Notes (the “Note
Registrar”). The Escrow Agent also
shall act as paying agent for the
Notes if the Notes are held in a book
entry system. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, an agreement among the City, the Note Registrar and the Escrow Agent (the “Note
Registrar Agreement”) providing for
services relating to the registration,
transfer, exchange and payment of
Notes on terms that are approved by
the Director of Finance on behalf of
the City. That approval shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the Note Registrar Agreement by the
Director of Finance. The Director of
Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and for
reimbursement of expenses incurred
pursuant to the Note Registrar Agreement from the proceeds of the Notes to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Notes remain
outstanding, the City will cause the
Note Registrar to maintain and keep
at its principal corporate trust office
all books and records necessary for
the registration, exchange and transfer of Notes as provided in this Section
(the “Note Register”). The person in
whose name a Note is registered on
the Note Register shall be regarded as
the absolute owner of that Note for all

20
purposes of this Ordinance. Payment
of or on account of the debt charges
on any Note shall be made only to or
upon the order of that person; neither
the City nor the Note Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid and
effectual to satisfy and discharge the
City’s liability upon the Note, including interest, to the extent of the
amount or amounts so paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for
Notes of any authorized denomination
upon presentation and surrender at
the principal corporate trust office of
the Note Registrar, together with a
request for exchange signed by the
registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Note Registrar. A Note
may be transferred only on the Note
Register upon presentation and surrender of the Note at the principal corporate trust office of the Note Registrar together with an assignment
signed by the registered owner or by
a person legally empowered to do so
in a form satisfactory to the Note Registrar. Upon exchange or transfer the
Registrar
shall
complete,
Note
authenticate and deliver a new Note
or Notes of any authorized denomination or denominations requested by
the owner equal in the aggregate to
the unmatured principal amount of
the Note surrendered and bearing
interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Note Registrar shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Notes only after the new
Notes are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Notes exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Note Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Notes
in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Note Registrar may make a charge
sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to the
exchange or transfer. The City or the
Note Registrar may require that those
charges, if any, be paid before the procedure is begun for the exchange or
transfer. All Notes issued and authenticated upon any exchange or transfer shall be valid obligations of the
City, evidencing the same debt, and
entitled to the same security and benefit under this Ordinance, as the Notes
surrendered upon that exchange or
transfer.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B) of the
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Notes with
other bond anticipation notes of the
City for purposes of their sale as a single issue to be designated “Various
Purpose General Obligation Bond
Anticipation Notes.” The Notes shall
contain a summary statement of purposes encompassing the purpose for
which the Notes are issued and shall
state that they are issued pursuant to
this Ordinance.
(b) Execution and Payment of the
Notes. The Notes shall express upon
their faces the purpose for which they
are issued and that they are issued
pursuant to this Ordinance. Each Note
shall be authenticated by the manual
signature of an authorized officer of
the Trustee (as defined therein). The
Notes shall be signed by the City’s

The City Record
Mayor and by the City’s Director of
Finance, and, consistent with Section
133.27 of the Ohio Revised Code and
notwithstanding Section 177.02 of the
Codified Ordinances of the City,
either or both of those signatures may
be a facsimile. The Notes shall bear
the seal of the City, which seal may be
a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section 83 of the City’s Charter, the Director of Law shall prepare the Notes and
shall endorse thereon his approval of
the form and correctness thereof by
his manual or facsimile signature.
(c) Sale of the Notes. The Notes
shall first be offered for purchase to
the Trustees of the Sinking Fund and,
if not purchased by them, shall be
offered to the Treasury Investment
Account for purchase and, if not purchased for that Account, shall be sold
to one or more firms that have proposed to underwrite the Notes and
have been selected by the Director of
Finance based on an evaluation of the
qualifications of those firms (the
“Note Purchaser”) in the principal
amount set forth in a certificate of
award to be executed by the Director
of Finance (the  “Note Certificate of
Award”) at not less than par and
accrued interest and at a rate not
exceeding that set forth in Section 10
hereof. The proceeds of such sale
shall be paid into the proper fund and
used for the purpose for which the
Notes are being issued under the provisions of this Ordinance.
(d) Security for the Notes. The
Notes shall be the full general obligations of the City, and the full faith,
credit and revenue of the City are
hereby pledged for the prompt payment of the same. The par value to be
received from the sale of the Notes
and any excess funds resulting from
the issuance of the Notes shall, to the
extent necessary, be used for the
retirement of the Notes at maturity,
together with the interest thereon,
and are hereby pledged for such purpose.
Section 10. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. During the year
or years while the Notes are outstanding there shall be levied on all the
taxable property in the City, in addition to all other taxes but within tax
limitations, a direct tax annually not
less than that which would have been
levied if bonds had been issued therefor without the prior issue of the
Notes. That tax shall be and is
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers, in
the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes
for each year are certified, extended
and collected. That tax shall be
placed before and in preference to all
other items and for the full amount
thereof. The funds derived from the
tax levies required by this Ordinance
shall be placed in the Unvoted Tax
Supported Obligations Account, and
those funds, together with the interest collected on them, shall be irrevocably pledged for the payment of the
principal and interest of the Notes or
the Bonds in anticipation of which
they are issued, when and as the same
falls due; provided, however, that in
each year to the extent that revenues
are available from other sources for
the payment of the Notes and Bonds
and are appropriated for such purpose, the amount of such direct tax
upon all of the taxable property in the
City may be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and appropriated.

Section 11. Official Statement; Continuing Disclosure. If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a disclosure document (each, an “Official
Statement”) is appropriate or necessary in connection with the sale of the
Notes or the Bonds, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare or
cause to be prepared on behalf of the
City an Official Statement with
respect to the Notes or the Bonds, as
the case may be, and any necessary
supplements and to authorize the use
and distribution of each Official
Statement and any supplements. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign on behalf of the City and in her
official capacity each Official Statement and any supplements approved
by her. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign and deliver on
behalf of the City and in her official
capacity such certificates in connection with the accuracy of each Official Statement and any supplements
as may, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, be necessary or appropriate. The Director of Finance is also
authorized to determine and certify
on behalf of the City that such disclosure document is “deemed final” by
the City within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission
Rule 15c2-12 (the “SEC Rule”). The
Director of Finance is authorized to
contract for services for the production and distribution of preliminary
and final Official Statements, including by printed and electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time of
the Notes or the Bonds, the City
agrees, in accordance with, and as the
only obligated person with respect to
the Notes and the Bonds under the
SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be
provided such financial information
and operating data and notices, in
such manner as may be required for
purposes of the SEC Rule. In order to
describe and specify certain terms of
the City’s continuing disclosure
agreement for that purpose, and
thereby to implement that agreement,
including provisions for enforcement,
amendment and termination, the
Director of Finance is authorized and
directed to prepare, or cause to be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of the City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the
continuing
disclosure
agreement
made by the City for the benefit of the
holders and beneficial owners of the
Notes or the Bonds, as the case may
be, in accordance with the SEC Rule.
The performance of that agreement
shall be subject to the availability of
funds and their annual appropriation
to meet costs the City would be
required to incur to perform it. The
Director of Finance is further authorized and directed to establish procedures in order to ensure compliance
by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely
provision of information and notices.

Ordinances of the City that are inconsistent with the provisions of this
Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance shall not apply to the Bonds or
the Notes authorized herein.

are fully applicable to the Bonds and
the Notes authorized herein, and nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed
to alter or restrict such full applica-

March 21, 2012
tion of the General Bond Ordinance,
except for the exclusion from application to the Bonds and the Notes authorized herein of the provisions of the
third paragraph of Section 13(a) and
the third paragraph of Section 4 of the
General Bond Ordinance, pursuant to
Section 2 hereof.
Section 13. Captions. The captions
or headings in this Ordinance are for
convenience only and in no way
define, limit or describe the scope or
intent of any provisions or sections of
this Ordinance.
Section 14. Federal Tax Covenants.
The City covenants that it will use,
and will restrict the use and investment of, the proceeds of the Notes and
the Bonds in such manner and to such
extent as may be necessary so that
(a) the Notes and the Bonds will not
(i) constitute private activity bonds,
arbitrage bonds or hedge bonds under
Sections 141, 148 or 149 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the “Code”) or (ii) be treated other
than as bonds to which Section 103(a)
of the Code applies, and (b) the interest thereon will not be treated as an
item of tax preference under Section 57 of the Code.
The City further covenants that (a)
it will take or cause to be taken such
actions that may be required of it for
the interest on the Notes and the
Bonds to be and to remain excluded
from gross income for federal income
tax purposes, (b) it will not take or
authorize to be taken any actions that
would adversely affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting for
it, will, among other acts of compliance, (i) apply the proceeds of the
Notes and the Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing, (ii)
restrict the yield on investment property acquired with those proceeds,
(iii) make timely and adequate payments to the federal government, (iv)
maintain books and records and make
calculations and reports, and (v)
refrain from certain uses of those proceeds, and, as applicable, of property
financed with such proceeds, all in
such manner and to the extent necessary to assure such exclusion of that
interest under the Code.
Each covenant made in this Section
with respect to the Notes and the
Bonds is also made with respect to all
issues any portion of the debt service
on which is paid from proceeds of the
Notes or the Bonds (and, if different,
the original issue and any refunding
issues in a series of refundings), to
the extent such compliance is necessary to assure exclusion of interest on
the Notes and the Bonds from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, and the officers identified above
are authorized to take actions with
respect to those issues as they are
authorized in this Section to take with
respect to the Notes and the Bonds.
The Director of Finance, as the fiscal officer, or any other officer of the
City
having
responsibility
for
issuance of the Notes and the Bonds is
hereby authorized (a) to make or
effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or
waiver on behalf of the City with
respect to the Notes and the Bonds as
the City is permitted or required to
make or give under the federal
income tax laws, including, without
limitation thereto, any of the elections
provided
for
in
Section  148(f)(4)(C) of the Code or
available under Section  148 of the
Code, for the purpose of assuring,

The City Record
enhancing or protecting favorable
tax treatment or status of the Notes
and the Bonds or interest thereon or
assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose, reducing the
burden or expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or
payments or penalties, or making
payments of special amounts in lieu
of making computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as
rebate, or obviating those amounts or
payments, as determined by that officer, which action shall be in writing
and signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf of
the City, as may be appropriate to
assure the exclusion of interest from
gross income and the intended tax
status of the Notes and the Bonds, and
(c) to give one or more appropriate
certificates of the City, for inclusion
in the transcript of proceedings for
the Notes and the Bonds, setting forth
the reasonable expectations of the
City regarding the amount and use of
all the proceeds of the Notes and the
Bonds, the facts, circumstances and
estimates on which they are based,
and other facts and circumstances relevant to the tax treatment of the
interest on and the tax status of the
Notes and the Bonds.
Section 15. Credit Enhancement and
Ratings. If, in the judgment of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
the filing of an application for a rating on the Bonds or designated portion thereof by one or more nationally
recognized rating agencies is in the
best interest of the City, the Director
of Finance is authorized to prepare
and submit those applications and to
provide to each such agency such
information as may be required for
the purpose. The Director of Finance
is authorized to contract for one or
more Credit Support Instruments for
the Bonds or designated portions
thereof if the Director determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the Credit
Support Instruments will result in
debt service savings to the City. As
used in this Section, “Credit Support
Instrument” means an insurance policy, surety, letter of credit, or other
instrument used to enhance or provide for the security of Bonds. The
cost of obtaining each rating and the
cost of obtaining each Credit Support
Instrument, except to the extent paid
by the Original Purchasers in accordance with the Bond Purchase Agreement, shall be paid from the proceeds
of Bonds or funds appropriated for
that purpose.
Section 16. Financial Advisor. The
Director of Finance may obtain the
services of one or more financial advisors, from time to time, to assist the
Director of Finance in making any of
the determinations required by this
Ordinance to be determined by the
Director of Finance. The Director of
Finance may rely on the written
advice of any financial advisor so
retained. Any financial advisor
employed under the authority of this
Ordinance shall be disinterested in
the transaction and be independent of
the Original Purchasers and any
other party interested in the transaction.

that all formal actions of this Council

301

21
and of any of its committees concerning and relating to the passage of this
Ordinance were taken, and that all
deliberations of this Council and any
of its committees that resulted in
these formal actions were held, in
meetings open to the public in compliance with all legal requirements,
including, without limitation, Section 121.22 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Section 18. Findings and Recitals of
Validity. It is hereby determined, represented and recited that all acts, conditions and things necessary to be
done precedent to and in the issuing

obligations of the City have happened, been done and been performed
in regular and due form as required
by law; and that no limitation of
indebtedness or taxation, either statutory or constitutional, will have been
exceeded in the issuance of the Bonds
or the Notes. It is further found and
determined, and is hereby represented and recited, that the provisions of

this Ordinance is hereby declared to
be an independent section or part of a
section and, notwithstanding any
other evidence of legislative intent, it
is hereby declared to be the controlling legislative intent that if any such
section or part of a section or any provision thereof, or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the
remaining sections or parts of sections and the application of such provisions to any other person or circumstance, other than those as to which it
is held invalid, shall not be affected
thereby, and it is hereby declared to
be the legislative intent that the other
provisions of this Ordinance would
have been passed independently of
such section, or parts of a section, so
held to be invalid.
Section 21. Legislative Intent. All
terms, conditions, pledges, covenants
or agreements on the part of the City
provided for in this Ordinance are
made by the voluntary act of the City
under its lawful authority, including
its authority under its Charter and
Article XVIII of the Constitution of
Ohio.
Nothing in this Ordinance is intended to, and no provision hereof shall be
applied in any manner as would,
impair the obligation of contract of
the City with respect to any outstanding bonds, notes, certificates of
indebtedness, other obligations, trust
indentures, trust agreements, or other
agreements or contracts made or
entered into by the City and for which
consideration was duly received by
the City prior to the passage of this
Ordinance or the General Bond Ordinance.

This Ordinance is declared to be an
emergency measure for the immediate preservation of the public peace,
property, health and safety of the City
by providing funds to pay the costs of
certain permanent improvements
which are urgently needed for the
benefit of the City and for the usual
daily operation of a municipal department, and, provided this Ordinance

Ord. No. 272-12.
By Council Member Sweeney (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the issuance and sale of bonds in
the maximum principal amount of

Whereas, this Council desires to
issue bonds in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed Five Hundred
Twenty Thousand Dollars ($520,000)
(the “Bonds”) to finance the costs of
certain permanent improvements
described in Section  1 of this ordinance (this “Ordinance”); and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of this City, has previously certified to this Council that
the estimated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be financed with the
proceeds of the Bonds is at least five
years and that the maximum maturity of the Bonds is 20 years, a copy of
which is contained in File No. 272-12A; and
Whereas, this Council passed Ordinance No. 1749-80 on October 8, 1980,
and thereafter amended that ordinance by Ordinance No. 1112-83,
passed May 6, 1983, and Ordinance No.
944-96, passed June 10, 1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so amended and
as the same may further be amended
from time to time in accordance with
its provisions, is referred to as the
“General Bond Ordinance”), providing the general terms and provisions
for the issuance of unvoted general
obligations of the City, with the specific terms of each series of Bonds to
be contained in ordinances authorizing the issuance of Bonds in accordance with the provisions thereof
(the “Series Bond Ordinances”); and
Whereas, the authorization for
issuance of the Bonds is necessary to
provide funds to pay the costs of certain
permanent
improvements
described in Section 1 hereof that are
urgently needed for the benefit of the
City, and as a result, this Ordinance
constitutes an emergency measure
providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,

Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:

incurred in connection with the
issuance of the securities, including
all financing costs within the meaning of Section 133.01(K) of the Ohio
Revised Code and such other costs of
the foregoing permanent improvements that may be financed with the
proceeds of securities as permitted by
Section 133.15(B) of the Ohio Revised
Code and as otherwise permitted by
law.
Section 2. Authority and Terms. The
Bonds shall be issued pursuant to the
provisions of Article XVIII of the Constitution of Ohio, Chapter 133 of the
Ohio Revised Code and other applicable provisions of the Ohio Revised
Code, the Charter of the City, the General Bond Ordinance and this Ordinance for the purpose stated in Section 1 hereof. The Bonds shall be designated “Cemeteries Improvement
Bonds” and may contain such further
designation as provided in the certificate of award providing for the final
terms of the Bonds and the sale of the
Bonds signed by the Director of
Finance in accordance with this Ordinance (the “Certificate of Award”).
The Bonds shall be issued in one lot
as fully registered Bonds in denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. The Bonds shall be numbered as determined by the Director
of Finance.
The Bonds shall be issued in the
principal amount specified in the Certificate of Award, which shall not
exceed the amount stated in Section 1
hereof. The Bonds shall be dated the
date and shall bear interest from their
date until the principal amount is
paid at the rate or rates per year specified in the Certificate of Award, provided that the weighted average of
such rates (taking into account the
principal amount and maturity of
each Bond to which a rate applies)
shall not exceed six percent (6%) per
year. Interest on the Bonds shall be
payable when due, or until the principal amount is paid, semiannually as
specified in the Certificate of Award
as the dates on which interest on the
Bonds shall be payable (the “Interest
Payment Dates”), beginning on the
date specified in the Certificate of
Award as the first Interest Payment
Date.
The Bonds shall mature in the
years and principal amounts as shall
be permitted by law and determined
by the Director of Finance and specified in the Certificate of Award, based
on the written advice of a Financial
Advisor to be in the best interests of
the City, provided that (i) each principal payment shall occur on an Inter-

302

March 21, 2012
est Payment Date, (ii) the first principal payment on the Bonds shall be
no earlier than November 15, 2012 and
no later than December 31, 2013, (iii)
the final maturity date of the Bonds
shall be no later than 20 years from
that date which is 12 months prior to
the first date on which provision for
payment of principal is made, and
(iv) the principal amount thereof
shall be payable in annual installments such that the total principal
and interest payments on the Bonds
in any fiscal year in which principal
is payable is not more than three
times the amount of those payments
in any other fiscal year.
The Bonds stated to mature in any
year may be issued as term bonds (the
“Term Bonds”), payable pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements as defined and further
described below. The Director of
Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award whether any of the
Bonds shall be issued as Term Bonds,
any dates (the “Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable pursuant to mandatory sinking fund installments rather than at
stated maturity and the amount of
principal to be paid on each Mandatory Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption or purchase prior to stated maturity as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory
sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100%
of the principal amount redeemed,
plus interest accrued to the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to be
deposited with the Escrow Agent, currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of and
interest on any Term Bonds shall
include amounts sufficient to redeem
on the Mandatory Redemption Dates
the principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided
below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined in
Section  3 hereof) for cancellation
Term Bonds in any aggregate principal amount and to receive a credit
against the then-current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City for
any Term Bonds. That option shall be
exercised by the City on or before the
forty-fifth day preceding the applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, by
furnishing the Escrow Agent a certificate, signed by the Registrar, setting forth the extent of the credit to
be applied with respect to the thencurrent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement. If the certificate is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the thencurrent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corre-

March 21, 2012
sponding
mandatory
redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds that
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
the
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and cancelled
by the Registrar, to the extent not
applied theretofore as a credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and cancelled, shall be credited by the
Escrow Agent at 100% of the principal amount thereof against the thencurrent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding
mandatory
redemption
obligation). Any excess of that
amount over the then-current MandaSinking
Fund
Redemption
tory
shall
be
credited
Requirement
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements
corresponding
mandatory
(and
redemption obligations) in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(b) Optional Redemption. The
Bonds may be subject to redemption
prior to maturity by and at the option
of the City, in whole or in part on any
date, in integral multiples of $5,000,
on the optional redemption dates and
at the redemption prices (expressed
as a percentage of the principal
amount redeemed) specified in the
Certificate of Award, plus, in each
case, accrued interest to the redemption date. The first optional redemption date shall not be later than ten
years from the first Interest Payment
Date, and the highest redemption
price shall not be greater than 102%
of the principal amount redeemed
plus accrued interest to the redemption date. Based on the written advice
of a financial advisor, the Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that it is in the best
interests of the City for some or all of
the Bonds not to be callable prior to
their stated maturity.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, the Bonds, or portions thereof, to be redeemed optionally shall be selected by lot prior to
the selection by lot of the Bonds to be
redeemed on the same date by operation of the Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds shall be
redeemed pursuant to this paragraph
only upon written notice from the
Director of Finance to the Registrar.
That notice shall specify the redemption date and the principal amount of
each maturity of Bonds to be
redeemed, and shall be given at least
45 days prior to the redemption date
or such shorter period as shall be
acceptable to the Registrar. There
shall be deposited with the Registrar
on or prior to the redemption date
funds sufficient to redeem at the
redemption
price
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice of
redemption has been given.
(c) Purchase in Lieu of Redemption. If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the City may
elect to purchase Bonds called for
optional redemption in lieu of redeeming those Bonds. That election shall
be exercised by written direction
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar and the Escrow Agent.

The City Record
That written direction shall state
whether all or less than all of the
Bonds called for optional redemption
are to be purchased by the City in lieu
of redemption, shall identify the
Bonds to be purchased by their maturity date and shall specify the principal amount of each maturity to be purchased in lieu of redemption. If less
than all of the Bonds called for optional redemption are to be purchased in
lieu of redemption, the amount of
each maturity to be purchased shall
be in amounts of $5,000 or integral
multiples of $5,000. Any Bonds called
for optional redemption that are not
to be purchased shall be redeemed in
accordance with their redemption provisions. The purchase price of the
Bonds to be purchased in lieu of
redemption shall be equal to the principal of, any accrued but unpaid interest on, and any premium that would
have been payable on the Bonds on
the redemption date if the Bonds had
been optionally redeemed instead of
being purchased. No notice of the purchase in lieu of redemption is
required to be given to the owners of
the Bonds in addition to the notice of
redemption required by this Ordinance. The Escrow Agent or Registrar, as paying agent, shall not purchase Bonds if sufficient moneys
have not been deposited with the
Escrow Agent or Registrar, as paying
agent, by the City for the purpose. On
or prior to the scheduled date for
optional redemption, the City may
rescind its direction to purchase the
Bonds in lieu of redemption by written notice from the Director of
Finance to the Registrar and the
Escrow Agent. In the event that the
direction to purchase is rescinded, the
Bonds shall be redeemed on the
redemption date set forth in the notice
of redemption delivered to the owners
of the Bonds and in accordance with
the provisions of this Ordinance.
(d) Partial Redemption or Purchase. If fewer than all of the outstanding Bonds are called for redemption at one time (whether for redemption or purchase in lieu of redemption), they shall be called in the order
of maturities directed by the Director
of Finance. If fewer than all Bonds of
a single maturity are to be redeemed
or purchased in lieu of redemption,
the selection of Bonds to be redeemed
or purchased, or portions thereof in
amounts of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof, shall be made by the
Registrar by lot in a manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of
a partial redemption or purchase of
Bonds by lot when Bonds of denominations greater than $5,000 are then
outstanding, each $5,000 unit of principal thereof shall be treated as
though it were a separate Bond of the
denomination of $5,000. If it is determined that one or more, but not all of
the $5,000 units of principal amount
represented by a Bond are to be called
for redemption, then upon notice of
redemption of a $5,000 unit or units,
the registered owner of that Bond
shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i) for payment of the redemption
or purchase price of the $5,000 unit or
units called for redemption (including, without limitation, the interest
accrued to the date fixed for redemption and any premium), and (ii) for
issuance, without charge to the registered owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the

303

23
unmatured portion of the Bond not
redeemed or purchased and bearing
interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date as the Bond surrendered.
(e) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii) the
redemption price to be paid, (iii) the
date fixed for redemption, and (iv)
the place or places where the amounts
due upon redemption are payable.
The notice shall be given by the Registrar on behalf of the City by mailing
a copy of the redemption notice by
first-class mail, postage prepaid, at
least 30 days prior to the date fixed
for redemption (or such period specified in the Certificate of Award), to
the registered owner of each Bond
subject to redemption in whole or in
part at the registered owner’s address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close of
business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing and to any provider
of a Credit Support Instrument (as
defined in Section 15 hereof) for the
Bonds or designated portions thereof.
Failure to receive notice by mail or
any defect in that notice regarding
any Bond, however, shall not affect
the validity of the proceedings for the
redemption of any Bond. Any notice
of redemption of any Bonds may specify that the redemption is contingent
on the deposit of moneys with the
Escrow Agent or Registrar, as paying
agent, on or prior to the redemption
date in an amount sufficient to pay
the redemption price of the Bonds to
be redeemed.
(f) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the manner provided in the preceding paragraph, and moneys having been
deposited by the City with the Escrow
Agent or Registrar, as paying agent,
in an amount sufficient to pay the
redemption price, the Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption
shall become due and payable on the
redemption date, and, upon presentation and surrender at the place or
places specified in that notice, shall
be paid. If money for the redemption
of all of the Bonds and portions thereof to be redeemed, including interest
accrued to the redemption date, is
held by the Registrar on the redemption date, and, if notice of redemption
has been deposited in the mail, then
from and after the redemption date
those Bonds and portions thereof
called for redemption shall cease to
bear interest and no longer shall be
considered to be outstanding. If that
money shall not be so available on the
redemption date, or that notice shall
not have been deposited in the mail,
those Bonds and portions thereof
shall continue to bear interest, until
they are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money held
by the Registrar for the redemption of
particular Bonds shall be held in trust
for the account of the registered owners and shall be paid to them, respectively, upon presentation and surrender of those Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without
deduction for the services of the Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent. Principal shall be payable
when due upon presentation and sur-

24
render of the Bonds at the principal
corporate trust office of the Registrar. Interest on a Bond shall be paid
on each Interest Payment Date by
check or draft mailed to the person in
whose name the Bond was registered,
and to that person’s address appearing, on the Bond Register (as defined
in Section  3 hereof) at the close of
business on the date provided in the
Registrar Agreement authorized and
defined in Section  3 hereof (the
“Record Date”). Notwithstanding any
contrary provision in the General
Bond Ordinance, so long as the Bonds
are held by a Depository in a book
entry system (as described in Section  3 hereof), debt charges on the
Bonds will be payable in lawful
money of the United States by wire
transfer to the Depository made by
the Escrow Agent on each Interest
Payment Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance. The General Bond Ordinance, except for the third paragraph
of Section 13(a) (pertaining generally to an adjustment of the interest
rate in an event of default) and the
third paragraph of Section 4 (pertaining generally to the periods during
which the City is not required to make
any transfers or exchanges of bonds
issued under the General Bond Ordinance), will apply to the Bonds.
Except for those provisions, the General Bond Ordinance is included as a
part of this Ordinance as fully as if
restated in this Ordinance. Words and
terms not otherwise defined in this
Ordinance shall have the same meaning as set forth in the General Bond
Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of the
Bonds; Paying Agents. The Bonds
shall express upon their faces the purpose for which they are issued and
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance. Pursuant to Section  4 of
the General Bond Ordinance, each
Bond shall be authenticated by the
manual signature of an authorized
officer of the Trustee (as defined
therein). The Bonds shall be signed
by the City’s Mayor and by the City’s
Director of Finance, and, consistent
with Section  133.27 of the Ohio
Revised Code and notwithstanding
Section  177.02 of the Codified Ordinances of the City, either or both of
those signatures may be a facsimile.
The Bonds shall bear the seal of the
City, which seal may be a facsimile
seal. Pursuant to Section  83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
shall prepare the Bonds and shall
endorse thereon his approval of the
form and correctness thereof by his
manual or facsimile signature.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating
agent, bond registrar, transfer agent
and paying agent for the Bonds (the
“Registrar”). The Registrar shall also
act as paying agent for the Bonds so
long as the Bonds are held in a book
entry system. The Director of Finance
is authorized to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City, an
agreement between the City and the
Registrar (the “Registrar Agreement”), approved as to form and correctness by the Director of Law, providing for services relating to the registration, transfer, exchange and payment of the Bonds on terms approved
by the Director of Finance on behalf
of the City and consistent with this

The City Record
Ordinance and not substantially
adverse to the City. That approval
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Registrar Agreement by the Director of Finance. The
Director of Finance shall provide for
the payment of the services rendered
and for reimbursement of expenses
incurred pursuant to the Registrar
Agreement from the proceeds of the
Bonds to the extent available and
then from other money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds remain
outstanding, the City will cause the
Registrar to maintain and keep at its
principal corporate trust office all
books and records necessary for the
registration, exchange and transfer
of Bonds as provided in this Section
(the “Bond Register”). The person in
whose name a Bond is registered on
the Bond Register shall be regarded
as the absolute owner of that Bond for
all purposes of this Ordinance. Payment of or on account of the debt
charges on any Bond shall be made
only to or upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar
shall be affected by any notice to the
contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid and
effectual to satisfy and discharge the
City’s liability upon the Bond, including interest, to the extent of the
amount or amounts so paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender
at the principal corporate trust office
of the Registrar, together with a
request for exchange signed by the
registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. A Bond may
be transferred only on the Bond Register upon presentation and surrender
of the Bond at the principal corporate
trust office of the Registrar together
with an assignment signed by the registered owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner equal
in the aggregate to the unmatured
principal amount of the Bond surrendered and bearing interest at the
same rate and maturing on the same
date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any tax or
other governmental charge required
to be paid with respect to the
exchange or transfer. The City or the
Registrar may require that those
charges, if any, be paid before the procedure is begun for the exchange or
transfer. All Bonds issued and
authenticated upon any exchange or
transfer shall be valid obligations of
the City, evidencing the same debt,
and entitled to the same security and

304

March 21, 2012
benefit under this Ordinance, as the
Bonds
surrendered
upon
that
exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds and the principal of and interest on the Bonds may
be transferred only through a book
entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are
issued by the City only to a Depository or its nominee as registered owner,
with the Bonds “immobilized” in the
custody of the Depository. The book
entry maintained by others than the
City is the record that identifies the
owners of beneficial interests in those
Bonds and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited
purpose trust company), New York,
New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers,
banks and trust companies, and clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized: (i) the Bonds
may be issued in the form of a single,
fully registered Bond representing
each maturity and registered in the
name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository;
(ii) the beneficial owners in book
entry form shall have no right to
receive Bonds in the form of physical
securities or certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book
entry form shall be shown by book
entry on the system maintained and
operated by the Depository and its
Participants, and transfers of the
ownership of beneficial interests
shall be made only by book entry by
the Depository and its Participants;
and (iv) the Bonds as such shall not
be transferable or exchangeable,
except for transfer to another Depository or to another nominee of a Depository, without further action by the
City.
If any Depository determines not to
continue to act as a Depository for the
Bonds for use in a book entry system,
the Director of Finance may attempt
to
establish
a
securities
depository/book entry relationship with
another qualified Depository. If the
Director of Finance does not or is
unable to do so, the Registrar, after
making provision for notification of
the beneficial owners by the then
Depository and any other arrangements deemed necessary, shall permit
withdrawal of the Bonds from the
Depository, and the Trustee and Registrar shall authenticate and deliver
bond certificates in registered form to

March 21, 2012
the assigns of the Depository or its
nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to the
extent necessary or required to enter
into any agreements determined necessary in connection with the book
entry system for the Bonds, after
determining that the signing thereof
will not endanger the funds or securities of the City and after the approval
of the form of any such agreement by
the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The Bonds
shall first be offered for purchase to
the Trustees of the Sinking Fund and,
if not purchased by them, shall be
offered to the Treasury Investment
Account for purchase and, if not purchased for that Account, shall be sold
to one or more firms that have proposed to underwrite the Bonds and
have been selected by the Director of
Finance based on an evaluation of the
qualifications of those firms (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”).
The Bonds shall be awarded to the
Original Purchaser in the Certificate
of Award which shall specify the
final terms of the Bonds in accordance with law, the provisions of this
Ordinance, the written advice of a
financial advisor retained under
authority of Section 16 hereof and the
Original Purchaser’s offer to purchase the Bonds, including: the principal amount of the Bonds, the purchase price (which shall be not less
than 97% of the principal amount of
the Bonds plus any accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate or
rates, the amounts and years in which
principal installments are payable
(at stated maturity or pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements), the Interest Payment
Dates and the date of the Bonds and
any other matters required in this
Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. As appropriate under the
Charter, the Mayor, Director of
Finance, Director of Law, Clerk of
Council and other appropriate officers of the City are, and each of them
is, authorized to take such actions as
are necessary, appropriate and in the
best interest of the City to establish
the terms and requirements for delivery of the Bonds and to make such
arrangements as are necessary with
the Original Purchaser in order to
establish the date, location, procedures, and conditions for the delivery
of the Bonds to the Original Purchaser, to give all appropriate notices and
certificates, to cause a true transcript
of proceedings with reference to the
issuance of the Bonds to be delivered
to the Original Purchaser, to sign any
transcript
certificates,
financial
statements and other documents and
instruments and to take such actions
as are necessary or appropriate to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take
all steps necessary to effect the due
execution, authentication and delivery of the Bonds. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to sign
and deliver on behalf of the City a
bond purchase agreement between
the City and the Original Purchaser
(the “Bond Purchase Agreement”),
approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, setting forth
the terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell the Bonds and the

The City Record
Original Purchaser agrees to buy the
Bonds, which shall be consistent with
this Ordinance, not substantially
adverse to the City, and approved by
the Director of Finance and Director
of Law on behalf of the City, all of
which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of the Bond
Purchase Agreement by the Director
of Finance. It is determined that the
terms of the Bonds, as provided in this
Ordinance and as may be provided in
or pursuant to the Certificate of
Award, are in the best interest of the
City and in compliance with all legal
requirements.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B) of the
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds with
other bonds into a single consolidated
issue of bonds for purposes of their
sale as a single issue to be designated
“Various Purpose General Obligation
Bonds, Series 2012” or such other designation as may be set forth in the
Certificate of Award. Such bonds
shall contain a summary statement of
purposes encompassing the purpose
for which the Bonds are issued and
shall state that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds promptly when and as the same falls due,
and also to provide for the discharge
of the Bonds at maturity, there shall
be and is levied on all the taxable
property in the City, in addition to all
other taxes, a direct tax annually during the period the Bonds are outstanding, in an amount sufficient to
provide for the payment of that interest, when and as the same shall fall
due, and also to discharge the principal of the Bonds at maturity, which
tax shall not be less than the interest
and sinking fund tax required by Section 11 of Article XII of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is ordered computed, certified, levied and extended
upon the tax duplicate and collected
by the same officers, in the same manner and at the same time that taxes
for general purposes for each of those
years are certified, extended and collected. The tax shall be placed before
and in preference to all other items
and for the full amount thereof. The
funds derived from those tax levies
shall be placed in the Unvoted Tax
Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund as required by the General Bond Ordinance, and those funds,
together with the interest collected on
them, shall be irrevocably pledged for
the payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds when and as the
same fall due; provided, however,
that, subject to the provisions of Section 8 of the General Bond Ordinance,
in each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the Bonds
and are appropriated for such purpose, the amount of such tax shall be
reduced by the amount of such revenues so available and appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections  133.25(B)(1) and 5705.51 of
the Ohio Revised Code, and in accordance with the provisions of and to
the extent required or permitted by
the General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is neces-

305

25
sary to meet the annual debt charges
for the Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended and applied for the objects
and purposes for which the Bonds are
issued. The proceeds of the Bonds to
be applied to pay costs of any Credit
Support Instruments obtained pursuant to Section 15 hereof shall be
paid to the provider or providers of
those Credit Support Instruments.
The proceeds of the Bonds to be used
to pay costs of issuing the Bonds shall
be deposited with the Registrar in a
separate account under the Registrar
Agreement pending their application
to the payment of such costs. Pursuant to Chapter 133 of the Ohio
Revised Code and this Ordinance, and
notwithstanding Chapter 179 of the
Codified Ordinances, any accrued
interest and any premium received
from the sale of the Bonds shall be
deposited in the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund to be applied to the payment of the principal of and interest
on the Bonds.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Bonds are secured by a pledge and
lien on a parity with the pledges and
liens authorized by the General Bond
Ordinance and, in addition to the
taxes and revenues specifically
pledged pursuant to this Ordinance
and the General Bond Ordinance and
the other covenants, terms and agreements provided hereunder and in the
General Bond Ordinance to secure
payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds, the City hereby
determines, declares, warrants and
covenants that the Bonds are general
obligations of the City and that the
full faith and credit of the City are
hereby pledged for the payment of the
principal of and interest on the Bonds
in accordance with the laws and Constitution of the State of Ohio, this
Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid and
discharged all the outstanding Bonds,
or there shall otherwise be paid to the
holders of the outstanding Bonds all
debt charges due or to become due
thereon, and provision shall also be
made for paying all other sums
payable hereunder, then and in that
event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of
further effect, and the covenants,
agreements and other obligations of
the City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the request
of the City execute and deliver to the
City such instruments in writing as
shall discharge the lien hereof and
enter on the record such discharge of
the lien and such other instruments as
may be reasonably required by the
City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if:
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or subaccounts, in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold in
special accounts or subaccounts, in

26
trust for and irrevocably committed
solely thereto, direct obligations of
the United States certified by an independent public accounting firm of
national reputation to be of such
maturities and interest payment
dates and to bear such interest, without further investment or reinvestment of either the principal amount
thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held in trust and
committed, except as hereinafter provided), as will be sufficient, together
with moneys referred to in (i) above,
for the payment, at their maturities or
redemption dates, of all debt charges
on the Bonds to their date of maturity
or redemption, as the case may be, or
if default in such payment shall have
occurred on such date then to the date
of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds are to be
redeemed prior to the maturity thereof, notice of such redemption shall
have been duly given or irrevocable
provision satisfactory to the Trustee
shall have been duly made for the giving of such notice. Any moneys held
by the Escrow Agent in accordance
with the provisions of this Section
shall be invested by the Escrow
Agent in direct obligations of the
United States of America maturing, or
redeemable at the option of the holder, at times and in amounts sufficient
to meet payment of debt charges on
the Bonds, as directed by the Director
of Finance. Any income or interest
earned by, or increment to, the investments held under this Section shall, to
the extent determined from time to
time by the Escrow Agent to be in
excess of the amount required to be
held by it for the purposes of this Section, be transferred at the time of
such determination as provided in
Section  17(a) of the General Bond
Ordinance for unclaimed funds held
by a Paying Agent. In the event of
nonpresentment of any Bond as
described in Section 17(a) of the General Bond Ordinance, the moneys held
pursuant to this Section shall be held
and paid as provided in said Section  17(a) for unclaimed funds held
by a Paying Agent.
Section 9. Bond Anticipation Notes.
For the purpose of raising money in
anticipation of the issuance of the
Bonds for the purpose set forth in Section 1 hereof, notes of the City may be
issued in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed Five Hundred
Twenty Thousand Dollars ($520,000)
(the “Notes”) upon the direction of the
Director of Finance to be set forth in a
certificate providing for the final
terms of the Notes and the sale of the
Notes and signed by the Director of
Finance (the  “Note Certificate of
Award”).
(a) Terms of the Notes. The Notes
shall bear interest at such rate, not
exceeding six percent (6%) per year,
as may be fixed by the Director of
Finance of the City in the Note Certificate of Award; shall be dated their
date of issuance; shall mature on the
date set forth in the Note Certificate
of Award, which shall be no later than
five years from such date of issuance;
shall be subject to redemption by the
City at any time prior to maturity
without penalty, provided that, if the
Director of Finance, based on the
advice of a financial advisor, determines that it is in the best interest of
the City in order to enhance the marketability of the Notes, the Director of
Finance may cause the Notes to not be
redeemable for a period which ends

The City Record
no later than the date which is two
years following the date of issuance
of the Notes; shall be designated
Improvement
Bond
“Cemeteries
Anticipation Notes”; shall be issued in
such numbers and denominations as
may be requested by the Note Purchaser (hereinafter defined); and
shall be issued in fully registered
form (which may be in a book entry
only system) in denominations of
$5,000 or integral multiples thereof.
Interest shall be payable semiannually on the dates set forth in the Note
Certificate of Award; provided that if
the Notes mature on or before the end
of the twelfth month following their
date of issuance, interest on the Notes
shall be payable at maturity.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating
agent, registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Notes (the “Note
Registrar”). The Escrow Agent also
shall act as paying agent for the
Notes if the Notes are held in a book
entry system. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, an agreement among the City, the Note Registrar and the Escrow Agent (the “Note
Registrar Agreement”) providing for
services relating to the registration,
transfer, exchange and payment of
Notes on terms that are approved by
the Director of Finance on behalf of
the City. That approval shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the Note Registrar Agreement by the
Director of Finance. The Director of
Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and for
reimbursement of expenses incurred
pursuant to the Note Registrar Agreement from the proceeds of the Notes to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Notes remain
outstanding, the City will cause the
Note Registrar to maintain and keep
at its principal corporate trust office
all books and records necessary for
the registration, exchange and transfer of Notes as provided in this Section
(the “Note Register”). The person in
whose name a Note is registered on
the Note Register shall be regarded as
the absolute owner of that Note for all
purposes of this Ordinance. Payment
of or on account of the debt charges
on any Note shall be made only to or
upon the order of that person; neither
the City nor the Note Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid and
effectual to satisfy and discharge the
City’s liability upon the Note, including interest, to the extent of the
amount or amounts so paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for
Notes of any authorized denomination
upon presentation and surrender at
the principal corporate trust office of
the Note Registrar, together with a
request for exchange signed by the
registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Note Registrar. A Note
may be transferred only on the Note
Register upon presentation and surrender of the Note at the principal corporate trust office of the Note Registrar together with an assignment
signed by the registered owner or by
a person legally empowered to do so
in a form satisfactory to the Note Registrar. Upon exchange or transfer the

306

March 21, 2012
Note
Registrar
shall
complete,
authenticate and deliver a new Note
or Notes of any authorized denomination or denominations requested by
the owner equal in the aggregate to
the unmatured principal amount of
the Note surrendered and bearing
interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Note Registrar shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Notes only after the new
Notes are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Notes exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Note Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Notes
in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Note Registrar may make a charge
sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to the
exchange or transfer. The City or the
Note Registrar may require that those
charges, if any, be paid before the procedure is begun for the exchange or
transfer. All Notes issued and authenticated upon any exchange or transfer shall be valid obligations of the
City, evidencing the same debt, and
entitled to the same security and benefit under this Ordinance, as the Notes
surrendered upon that exchange or
transfer.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B) of the
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Notes with
other bond anticipation notes of the
City for purposes of their sale as a single issue to be designated “Various
Purpose General Obligation Bond
Anticipation Notes.” The Notes shall
contain a summary statement of purposes encompassing the purpose for
which the Notes are issued and shall
state that they are issued pursuant to
this Ordinance.
(b) Execution and Payment of the
Notes. The Notes shall express upon
their faces the purpose for which they
are issued and that they are issued
pursuant to this Ordinance. Each Note
shall be authenticated by the manual
signature of an authorized officer of
the Trustee (as defined therein). The
Notes shall be signed by the City’s
Mayor and by the City’s Director of
Finance, and, consistent with Section
133.27 of the Ohio Revised Code and
notwithstanding Section 177.02 of the
Codified Ordinances of the City,
either or both of those signatures may
be a facsimile. The Notes shall bear
the seal of the City, which seal may be
a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section 83 of the City’s Charter, the Director of Law shall prepare the Notes and
shall endorse thereon his approval of
the form and correctness thereof by
his manual or facsimile signature.
(c) Sale of the Notes. The Notes
shall first be offered for purchase to
the Trustees of the Sinking Fund and,
if not purchased by them, shall be
offered to the Treasury Investment
Account for purchase and, if not purchased for that Account, shall be sold
to one or more firms that have proposed to underwrite the Notes and
have been selected by the Director of
Finance based on an evaluation of the
qualifications of those firms (the
“Note Purchaser”) in the principal
amount set forth in a certificate of
award to be executed by the Director
of Finance (the  “Note Certificate of
Award”) at not less than par and

March 21, 2012
accrued interest and at a rate not
exceeding that set forth in Section 10
hereof. The proceeds of such sale
shall be paid into the proper fund and
used for the purpose for which the
Notes are being issued under the provisions of this Ordinance.
(d) Security for the Notes. The
Notes shall be the full general obligations of the City, and the full faith,
credit and revenue of the City are
hereby pledged for the prompt payment of the same. The par value to be
received from the sale of the Notes
and any excess funds resulting from
the issuance of the Notes shall, to the
extent necessary, be used for the
retirement of the Notes at maturity,
together with the interest thereon,
and are hereby pledged for such purpose.
Section 10. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. During the year
or years while the Notes are outstanding there shall be levied on all the
taxable property in the City, in addition to all other taxes but within tax
limitations, a direct tax annually not
less than that which would have been
levied if bonds had been issued therefor without the prior issue of the
Notes. That tax shall be and is
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers, in
the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes
for each year are certified, extended
and collected. That tax shall be
placed before and in preference to all
other items and for the full amount
thereof. The funds derived from the
tax levies required by this Ordinance
shall be placed in the Unvoted Tax
Supported Obligations Account, and
those funds, together with the interest collected on them, shall be irrevocably pledged for the payment of the
principal and interest of the Notes or
the Bonds in anticipation of which
they are issued, when and as the same
falls due; provided, however, that in
each year to the extent that revenues
are available from other sources for
the payment of the Notes and Bonds
and are appropriated for such purpose, the amount of such direct tax
upon all of the taxable property in the
City may be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and appropriated.
Section 11. Official Statement; Continuing Disclosure. If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a disclosure document (each, an “Official
Statement”) is appropriate or necessary in connection with the sale of the
Notes or the Bonds, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare or
cause to be prepared on behalf of the
City an Official Statement with
respect to the Notes or the Bonds, as
the case may be, and any necessary
supplements and to authorize the use
and distribution of each Official
Statement and any supplements. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign on behalf of the City and in her
official capacity each Official Statement and any supplements approved
by her. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign and deliver on
behalf of the City and in her official
capacity such certificates in connection with the accuracy of each Official Statement and any supplements
as may, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, be necessary or appropriate. The Director of Finance is also
authorized to determine and certify
on behalf of the City that such disclo-

The City Record
sure document is “deemed final” by
the City within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission
Rule 15c2-12 (the “SEC Rule”). The
Director of Finance is authorized to
contract for services for the production and distribution of preliminary
and final Official Statements, including by printed and electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time of
the Notes or the Bonds, the City
agrees, in accordance with, and as the
only obligated person with respect to
the Notes and the Bonds under the
SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be
provided such financial information
and operating data and notices, in
such manner as may be required for
purposes of the SEC Rule. In order to
describe and specify certain terms of
the City’s continuing disclosure
agreement for that purpose, and
thereby to implement that agreement,
including provisions for enforcement,
amendment and termination, the
Director of Finance is authorized and
directed to prepare, or cause to be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of the City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the
continuing
disclosure
agreement
made by the City for the benefit of the
holders and beneficial owners of the
Notes or the Bonds, as the case may
be, in accordance with the SEC Rule.
The performance of that agreement
shall be subject to the availability of
funds and their annual appropriation
to meet costs the City would be
required to incur to perform it. The
Director of Finance is further authorized and directed to establish procedures in order to ensure compliance
by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely
provision of information and notices.
Section 12. Miscellaneous.
(a) Any provisions of the Codified
Ordinances of the City that are inconsistent with the provisions of this
Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance shall not apply to the Bonds or
the Notes authorized herein.
(b) All covenants, terms and provisions of the General Bond Ordinance
are fully applicable to the Bonds and
the Notes authorized herein, and nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed
to alter or restrict such full application of the General Bond Ordinance,
except for the exclusion from application to the Bonds and the Notes authorized herein of the provisions of the
third paragraph of Section 13(a) and
the third paragraph of Section 4 of the
General Bond Ordinance, pursuant to
Section 2 hereof.
Section 13. Captions. The captions
or headings in this Ordinance are for
convenience only and in no way
define, limit or describe the scope or
intent of any provisions or sections of
this Ordinance.
Section 14. Federal Tax Covenants.
The City covenants that it will use,
and will restrict the use and investment of, the proceeds of the Notes and
the Bonds in such manner and to such
extent as may be necessary so that
(a) the Notes and the Bonds will not
(i) constitute private activity bonds,
arbitrage bonds or hedge bonds under
Sections 141, 148 or 149 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the “Code”) or (ii) be treated other
than as bonds to which Section 103(a)
of the Code applies, and (b) the interest thereon will not be treated as an
item of tax preference under Section 57 of the Code.

307

27
The City further covenants that (a)
it will take or cause to be taken such
actions that may be required of it for
the interest on the Notes and the
Bonds to be and to remain excluded
from gross income for federal income
tax purposes, (b) it will not take or
authorize to be taken any actions that
would adversely affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting for
it, will, among other acts of compliance, (i) apply the proceeds of the
Notes and the Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing, (ii)
restrict the yield on investment property acquired with those proceeds,
(iii) make timely and adequate payments to the federal government, (iv)
maintain books and records and make
calculations and reports, and (v)
refrain from certain uses of those proceeds, and, as applicable, of property
financed with such proceeds, all in
such manner and to the extent necessary to assure such exclusion of that
interest under the Code.
Each covenant made in this Section
with respect to the Notes and the
Bonds is also made with respect to all
issues any portion of the debt service
on which is paid from proceeds of the
Notes or the Bonds (and, if different,
the original issue and any refunding
issues in a series of refundings), to
the extent such compliance is necessary to assure exclusion of interest on
the Notes and the Bonds from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, and the officers identified above
are authorized to take actions with
respect to those issues as they are
authorized in this Section to take with
respect to the Notes and the Bonds.
The Director of Finance, as the fiscal officer, or any other officer of the
City
having
responsibility
for
issuance of the Notes and the Bonds is
hereby authorized (a) to make or
effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or
waiver on behalf of the City with
respect to the Notes and the Bonds as
the City is permitted or required to
make or give under the federal
income tax laws, including, without
limitation thereto, any of the elections
provided
for
in
Section  148(f)(4)(C) of the Code or
available under Section  148 of the
Code, for the purpose of assuring,
enhancing or protecting favorable
tax treatment or status of the Notes
and the Bonds or interest thereon or
assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose, reducing the
burden or expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or
payments or penalties, or making
payments of special amounts in lieu
of making computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as
rebate, or obviating those amounts or
payments, as determined by that officer, which action shall be in writing
and signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf of
the City, as may be appropriate to
assure the exclusion of interest from
gross income and the intended tax
status of the Notes and the Bonds, and
(c) to give one or more appropriate
certificates of the City, for inclusion
in the transcript of proceedings for
the Notes and the Bonds, setting forth
the reasonable expectations of the
City regarding the amount and use of
all the proceeds of the Notes and the
Bonds, the facts, circumstances and

28
estimates on which they are based,
and other facts and circumstances relevant to the tax treatment of the
interest on and the tax status of the
Notes and the Bonds.
Section 15. Credit Enhancement and
Ratings. If, in the judgment of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
the filing of an application for a rating on the Bonds or designated portion thereof by one or more nationally
recognized rating agencies is in the
best interest of the City, the Director
of Finance is authorized to prepare
and submit those applications and to
provide to each such agency such
information as may be required for
the purpose. The Director of Finance
is authorized to contract for one or
more Credit Support Instruments for
the Bonds or designated portions
thereof if the Director determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the Credit
Support Instruments will result in
debt service savings to the City. As
used in this Section, “Credit Support
Instrument” means an insurance policy, surety, letter of credit, or other
instrument used to enhance or provide for the security of Bonds. The
cost of obtaining each rating and the
cost of obtaining each Credit Support
Instrument, except to the extent paid
by the Original Purchasers in accordance with the Bond Purchase Agreement, shall be paid from the proceeds
of Bonds or funds appropriated for
that purpose.
Section 16. Financial Advisor. The
Director of Finance may obtain the
services of one or more financial advisors, from time to time, to assist the
Director of Finance in making any of
the determinations required by this
Ordinance to be determined by the
Director of Finance. The Director of
Finance may rely on the written
advice of any financial advisor so
retained. Any financial advisor
employed under the authority of this
Ordinance shall be disinterested in
the transaction and be independent of
the Original Purchasers and any
other party interested in the transaction.
Section 17. Open Meeting Determination. It is found and determined
that all formal actions of this Council
and of any of its committees concerning and relating to the passage of this
Ordinance were taken, and that all
deliberations of this Council and any
of its committees that resulted in
these formal actions were held, in
meetings open to the public in compliance with all legal requirements,
including, without limitation, Section 121.22 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Section 18. Findings and Recitals of
Validity. It is hereby determined, represented and recited that all acts, conditions and things necessary to be
done precedent to and in the issuing
of the Bonds and the Notes in order to
make them legal, valid and binding
obligations of the City have happened, been done and been performed
in regular and due form as required
by law; and that no limitation of
indebtedness or taxation, either statutory or constitutional, will have been
exceeded in the issuance of the Bonds
or the Notes. It is further found and
determined, and is hereby represented and recited, that the provisions of
Sections 28, 29, 32, 33 (including the
provisions of Section 33 with respect
to readings on three separate days or
dispensing with such readings by a
two-thirds vote of all members of the

The City Record
Council), 36, 37, 48 and all other
applicable provisions of the City’s
Charter and the rules of this Council
have been fully complied with and
this Ordinance was passed in conformity therewith.
Section 19. Delivery to County. The
Director of Finance is directed to forward a certified copy of this Ordinance and of the Certificate of Award
for the Bonds and any Note Certificate of Award to the appropriate official of the County of Cuyahoga, Ohio
and to secure a receipt therefor.
Section 20. Severability. Each section and each part of each section of
this Ordinance is hereby declared to
be an independent section or part of a
section and, notwithstanding any
other evidence of legislative intent, it
is hereby declared to be the controlling legislative intent that if any such
section or part of a section or any provision thereof, or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the
remaining sections or parts of sections and the application of such provisions to any other person or circumstance, other than those as to which it
is held invalid, shall not be affected
thereby, and it is hereby declared to
be the legislative intent that the other
provisions of this Ordinance would
have been passed independently of
such section, or parts of a section, so
held to be invalid.
Section 21. Legislative Intent. All
terms, conditions, pledges, covenants
or agreements on the part of the City
provided for in this Ordinance are
made by the voluntary act of the City
under its lawful authority, including
its authority under its Charter and
Article XVIII of the Constitution of
Ohio.
Nothing in this Ordinance is intended to, and no provision hereof shall be
applied in any manner as would,
impair the obligation of contract of
the City with respect to any outstanding bonds, notes, certificates of
indebtedness, other obligations, trust
indentures, trust agreements, or other
agreements or contracts made or
entered into by the City and for which
consideration was duly received by
the City prior to the passage of this
Ordinance or the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 22. Emergency Measure.
This Ordinance is declared to be an
emergency measure for the immediate preservation of the public peace,
property, health and safety of the City
by providing funds to pay the costs of
certain permanent improvements
which are urgently needed for the
benefit of the City and for the usual
daily operation of a municipal department, and, provided this Ordinance
receives the affirmative vote of twothirds of all members elected to Council, it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest date allowed by
law.

for the issuance of unvoted general
obligations of the City, with the specific terms of each series of Bonds to

Whereas, the authorization for

Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:

March 21, 2012
Section 2. Authority and Terms. The
Bonds shall be issued pursuant to the
provisions of Article XVIII of the Constitution of Ohio, Chapter 133 of the
Ohio Revised Code and other applicable provisions of the Ohio Revised
Code, the Charter of the City, the General Bond Ordinance and this Ordinance for the purpose stated in Section 1 hereof. The Bonds shall be designated “Parks and Recreation Facilities Improvement Bonds” and may
contain such further designation as
provided in the certificate of award
providing for the final terms of the
Bonds and the sale of the Bonds
signed by the Director of Finance in
accordance with this Ordinance (the
“Certificate of Award”). The Bonds
shall be issued in one lot as fully registered Bonds in denominations of
$5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. The Bonds shall be numbered as
by
the
Director
of
determined
Finance.
The Bonds shall be issued in the
principal amount specified in the Certificate of Award, which shall not
exceed the amount stated in Section 1
hereof. The Bonds shall be dated the
date and shall bear interest from their
date until the principal amount is
paid at the rate or rates per year specified in the Certificate of Award, provided that the weighted average of
such rates (taking into account the
principal amount and maturity of
each Bond to which a rate applies)
shall not exceed six percent (6%) per
year. Interest on the Bonds shall be
payable when due, or until the principal amount is paid, semiannually as
specified in the Certificate of Award
as the dates on which interest on the
Bonds shall be payable (the “Interest
Payment Dates”), beginning on the
date specified in the Certificate of
Award as the first Interest Payment
Date.
The Bonds shall mature in the
years and principal amounts as shall
be permitted by law and determined
by the Director of Finance and specified in the Certificate of Award, based
on the written advice of a Financial
Advisor to be in the best interests of
the City, provided that (i) each principal payment shall occur on an Interest Payment Date, (ii) the first principal payment on the Bonds shall be
no earlier than November 15, 2012 and
no later than December 31, 2013, (iii)
the final maturity date of the Bonds
shall be no later than 20 years from
that date which is 12 months prior to
the first date on which provision for
payment of principal is made, and
(iv) the principal amount thereof
shall be payable in annual installments such that the total principal
and interest payments on the Bonds
in any fiscal year in which principal
is payable is not more than three
times the amount of those payments
in any other fiscal year.
The Bonds stated to mature in any
year may be issued as term bonds (the
“Term Bonds”), payable pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements as defined and further
described below. The Director of
Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award whether any of the
Bonds shall be issued as Term Bonds,
any dates (the “Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable pursuant to mandatory sinking fund installments rather than at
stated maturity and the amount of
principal to be paid on each Mandato-

The City Record
ry Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption or purchase prior to stated maturity as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory
sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100%
of the principal amount redeemed,
plus interest accrued to the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to be
deposited with the Escrow Agent, currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of and
interest on any Term Bonds shall
include amounts sufficient to redeem
on the Mandatory Redemption Dates
the principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided
below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined in
Section  3 hereof) for cancellation
Term Bonds in any aggregate principal amount and to receive a credit
against the then-current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City for
any Term Bonds. That option shall be
exercised by the City on or before the
forty-fifth day preceding the applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, by
furnishing the Escrow Agent a certificate, signed by the Registrar, setting forth the extent of the credit to
be applied with respect to the thencurrent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement. If the certificate is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the thencurrent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding
mandatory
redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds that
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and cancelled
by the Registrar, to the extent not
applied theretofore as a credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and cancelled, shall be credited by the
Escrow Agent at 100% of the principal amount thereof against the thencurrent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding
mandatory
redemption
obligation). Any excess of that
amount over the then-current Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirement
shall
be
credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligations) in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(b) Optional Redemption. The
Bonds may be subject to redemption
prior to maturity by and at the option
of the City, in whole or in part on any

309

29
date, in integral multiples of $5,000,
on the optional redemption dates and
at the redemption prices (expressed
as a percentage of the principal
amount redeemed) specified in the
Certificate of Award, plus, in each
case, accrued interest to the redemption date. The first optional redemption date shall not be later than ten
years from the first Interest Payment
Date, and the highest redemption
price shall not be greater than 102%
of the principal amount redeemed
plus accrued interest to the redemption date. Based on the written advice
of a financial advisor, the Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that it is in the best
interests of the City for some or all of
the Bonds not to be callable prior to
their stated maturity.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, the Bonds, or portions thereof, to be redeemed optionally shall be selected by lot prior to
the selection by lot of the Bonds to be
redeemed on the same date by operation of the Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds shall be
redeemed pursuant to this paragraph
only upon written notice from the
Director of Finance to the Registrar.
That notice shall specify the redemption date and the principal amount of
each maturity of Bonds to be
redeemed, and shall be given at least
45 days prior to the redemption date
or such shorter period as shall be
acceptable to the Registrar. There
shall be deposited with the Registrar
on or prior to the redemption date
funds sufficient to redeem at the
redemption
price
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice of
redemption has been given.
(c) Purchase in Lieu of Redemption. If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the City may
elect to purchase Bonds called for
optional redemption in lieu of redeeming those Bonds. That election shall
be exercised by written direction
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar and the Escrow Agent.
That written direction shall state
whether all or less than all of the
Bonds called for optional redemption
are to be purchased by the City in lieu
of redemption, shall identify the
Bonds to be purchased by their maturity date and shall specify the principal amount of each maturity to be purchased in lieu of redemption. If less
than all of the Bonds called for optional redemption are to be purchased in
lieu of redemption, the amount of
each maturity to be purchased shall
be in amounts of $5,000 or integral
multiples of $5,000. Any Bonds called
for optional redemption that are not
to be purchased shall be redeemed in
accordance with their redemption provisions. The purchase price of the
Bonds to be purchased in lieu of
redemption shall be equal to the principal of, any accrued but unpaid interest on, and any premium that would
have been payable on the Bonds on
the redemption date if the Bonds had
been optionally redeemed instead of
being purchased. No notice of the purchase in lieu of redemption is
required to be given to the owners of
the Bonds in addition to the notice of
redemption required by this Ordinance. The Escrow Agent or Registrar, as paying agent, shall not pur-

30
chase Bonds if sufficient moneys
have not been deposited with the
Escrow Agent or Registrar, as paying
agent, by the City for the purpose. On
or prior to the scheduled date for
optional redemption, the City may
rescind its direction to purchase the
Bonds in lieu of redemption by written notice from the Director of
Finance to the Registrar and the
Escrow Agent. In the event that the
direction to purchase is rescinded, the
Bonds shall be redeemed on the
redemption date set forth in the notice
of redemption delivered to the owners
of the Bonds and in accordance with
the provisions of this Ordinance.
(d) Partial Redemption or Purchase. If fewer than all of the outstanding Bonds are called for redemption at one time (whether for redemption or purchase in lieu of redemption), they shall be called in the order
of maturities directed by the Director
of Finance. If fewer than all Bonds of
a single maturity are to be redeemed
or purchased in lieu of redemption,
the selection of Bonds to be redeemed
or purchased, or portions thereof in
amounts of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof, shall be made by the
Registrar by lot in a manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of
a partial redemption or purchase of
Bonds by lot when Bonds of denominations greater than $5,000 are then
outstanding, each $5,000 unit of principal thereof shall be treated as
though it were a separate Bond of the
denomination of $5,000. If it is determined that one or more, but not all of
the $5,000 units of principal amount
represented by a Bond are to be called
for redemption, then upon notice of
redemption of a $5,000 unit or units,
the registered owner of that Bond
shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i) for payment of the redemption
or purchase price of the $5,000 unit or
units called for redemption (including, without limitation, the interest
accrued to the date fixed for redemption and any premium), and (ii) for
issuance, without charge to the registered owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured portion of the Bond not
redeemed or purchased and bearing
interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date as the Bond surrendered.
(e) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii) the
redemption price to be paid, (iii) the
date fixed for redemption, and (iv)
the place or places where the amounts
due upon redemption are payable.
The notice shall be given by the Registrar on behalf of the City by mailing
a copy of the redemption notice by
first-class mail, postage prepaid, at
least 30 days prior to the date fixed
for redemption (or such period specified in the Certificate of Award), to
the registered owner of each Bond
subject to redemption in whole or in
part at the registered owner’s address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close of
business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing and to any provider
of a Credit Support Instrument (as
defined in Section 15 hereof) for the
Bonds or designated portions thereof.
Failure to receive notice by mail or

The City Record
any defect in that notice regarding
any Bond, however, shall not affect
the validity of the proceedings for the
redemption of any Bond. Any notice
of redemption of any Bonds may specify that the redemption is contingent
on the deposit of moneys with the
Escrow Agent or Registrar, as paying
agent, on or prior to the redemption
date in an amount sufficient to pay
the redemption price of the Bonds to
be redeemed.
(f) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the manner provided in the preceding paragraph, and moneys having been
deposited by the City with the Escrow
Agent or Registrar, as paying agent,
in an amount sufficient to pay the
redemption price, the Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption
shall become due and payable on the
redemption date, and, upon presentation and surrender at the place or
places specified in that notice, shall
be paid. If money for the redemption
of all of the Bonds and portions thereof to be redeemed, including interest
accrued to the redemption date, is
held by the Registrar on the redemption date, and, if notice of redemption
has been deposited in the mail, then
from and after the redemption date
those Bonds and portions thereof
called for redemption shall cease to
bear interest and no longer shall be
considered to be outstanding. If that
money shall not be so available on the
redemption date, or that notice shall
not have been deposited in the mail,
those Bonds and portions thereof
shall continue to bear interest, until
they are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money held
by the Registrar for the redemption of
particular Bonds shall be held in trust
for the account of the registered owners and shall be paid to them, respectively, upon presentation and surrender of those Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without
deduction for the services of the Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent. Principal shall be payable
when due upon presentation and surrender of the Bonds at the principal
corporate trust office of the Registrar. Interest on a Bond shall be paid
on each Interest Payment Date by
check or draft mailed to the person in
whose name the Bond was registered,
and to that person’s address appearing, on the Bond Register (as defined
in Section  3 hereof) at the close of
business on the date provided in the
Registrar Agreement authorized and
defined in Section  3 hereof (the
“Record Date”). Notwithstanding any
contrary provision in the General
Bond Ordinance, so long as the Bonds
are held by a Depository in a book
entry system (as described in Section  3 hereof), debt charges on the
Bonds will be payable in lawful
money of the United States by wire
transfer to the Depository made by
the Escrow Agent on each Interest
Payment Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance. The General Bond Ordinance, except for the third paragraph
of Section 13(a) (pertaining generally to an adjustment of the interest
rate in an event of default) and the
third paragraph of Section 4 (pertaining generally to the periods during
which the City is not required to make

310

March 21, 2012
any transfers or exchanges of bonds
issued under the General Bond Ordinance), will apply to the Bonds.
Except for those provisions, the General Bond Ordinance is included as a
part of this Ordinance as fully as if
restated in this Ordinance. Words and
terms not otherwise defined in this
Ordinance shall have the same meaning as set forth in the General Bond
Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of the
Bonds; Paying Agents. The Bonds
shall express upon their faces the purpose for which they are issued and
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance. Pursuant to Section  4 of
the General Bond Ordinance, each
Bond shall be authenticated by the
manual signature of an authorized
officer of the Trustee (as defined
therein). The Bonds shall be signed
by the City’s Mayor and by the City’s
Director of Finance, and, consistent
with Section  133.27 of the Ohio
Revised Code and notwithstanding
Section  177.02 of the Codified Ordinances of the City, either or both of
those signatures may be a facsimile.
The Bonds shall bear the seal of the
City, which seal may be a facsimile
seal. Pursuant to Section  83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
shall prepare the Bonds and shall
endorse thereon his approval of the
form and correctness thereof by his
manual or facsimile signature.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating
agent, bond registrar, transfer agent
and paying agent for the Bonds (the
“Registrar”). The Registrar shall also
act as paying agent for the Bonds so
long as the Bonds are held in a book
entry system. The Director of Finance
is authorized to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City, an
agreement between the City and the
Registrar (the “Registrar Agreement”), approved as to form and correctness by the Director of Law, providing for services relating to the registration, transfer, exchange and payment of the Bonds on terms approved
by the Director of Finance on behalf
of the City and consistent with this
Ordinance and not substantially
adverse to the City. That approval
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Registrar Agreement by the Director of Finance. The
Director of Finance shall provide for
the payment of the services rendered
and for reimbursement of expenses
incurred pursuant to the Registrar
Agreement from the proceeds of the
Bonds to the extent available and
then from other money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds remain
outstanding, the City will cause the
Registrar to maintain and keep at its
principal corporate trust office all
books and records necessary for the
registration, exchange and transfer
of Bonds as provided in this Section
(the “Bond Register”). The person in
whose name a Bond is registered on
the Bond Register shall be regarded
as the absolute owner of that Bond for
all purposes of this Ordinance. Payment of or on account of the debt
charges on any Bond shall be made
only to or upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar
shall be affected by any notice to the
contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.

March 21, 2012
All such payments shall be valid and
effectual to satisfy and discharge the
City’s liability upon the Bond, including interest, to the extent of the
amount or amounts so paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender
at the principal corporate trust office
of the Registrar, together with a
request for exchange signed by the
registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. A Bond may
be transferred only on the Bond Register upon presentation and surrender
of the Bond at the principal corporate
trust office of the Registrar together
with an assignment signed by the registered owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner equal
in the aggregate to the unmatured
principal amount of the Bond surrendered and bearing interest at the
same rate and maturing on the same
date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any tax or
other governmental charge required
to be paid with respect to the
exchange or transfer. The City or the
Registrar may require that those
charges, if any, be paid before the procedure is begun for the exchange or
transfer. All Bonds issued and
authenticated upon any exchange or
transfer shall be valid obligations of
the City, evidencing the same debt,
and entitled to the same security and
benefit under this Ordinance, as the
Bonds
surrendered
upon
that
exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds and the principal of and interest on the Bonds may
be transferred only through a book
entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are
issued by the City only to a Depository or its nominee as registered owner,
with the Bonds “immobilized” in the
custody of the Depository. The book
entry maintained by others than the
City is the record that identifies the
owners of beneficial interests in those
Bonds and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial inter-

The City Record
ests in bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited
purpose trust company), New York,
New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers,
banks and trust companies, and clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized: (i) the Bonds
may be issued in the form of a single,
fully registered Bond representing
each maturity and registered in the
name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository;
(ii) the beneficial owners in book
entry form shall have no right to
receive Bonds in the form of physical
securities or certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book
entry form shall be shown by book
entry on the system maintained and
operated by the Depository and its
Participants, and transfers of the
ownership of beneficial interests
shall be made only by book entry by
the Depository and its Participants;
and (iv) the Bonds as such shall not
be transferable or exchangeable,
except for transfer to another Depository or to another nominee of a Depository, without further action by the
City.
If any Depository determines not to
continue to act as a Depository for the
Bonds for use in a book entry system,
the Director of Finance may attempt
to
establish
a
securities
depository/book entry relationship
with another qualified Depository. If
the Director of Finance does not or is
unable to do so, the Registrar, after
making provision for notification of
the beneficial owners by the then
Depository and any other arrangements deemed necessary, shall permit
withdrawal of the Bonds from the
Depository, and the Trustee and Registrar shall authenticate and deliver
bond certificates in registered form to
the assigns of the Depository or its
nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to the
extent necessary or required to enter
into any agreements determined necessary in connection with the book
entry system for the Bonds, after
determining that the signing thereof
will not endanger the funds or securities of the City and after the approval
of the form of any such agreement by
the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The Bonds
shall first be offered for purchase to
the Trustees of the Sinking Fund and,
if not purchased by them, shall be
offered to the Treasury Investment
Account for purchase and, if not purchased for that Account, shall be sold
to one or more firms that have proposed to underwrite the Bonds and
have been selected by the Director of
Finance based on an evaluation of the
qualifications of those firms (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”).
The Bonds shall be awarded to the
Original Purchaser in the Certificate
of Award which shall specify the

311

31
final terms of the Bonds in accordance with law, the provisions of this
Ordinance, the written advice of a
financial advisor retained under
authority of Section 16 hereof and the
Original Purchaser’s offer to purchase the Bonds, including: the principal amount of the Bonds, the purchase price (which shall be not less
than 97% of the principal amount of
the Bonds plus any accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate or
rates, the amounts and years in which
principal installments are payable
(at stated maturity or pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements), the Interest Payment
Dates and the date of the Bonds and
any other matters required in this
Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. As appropriate under the
Charter, the Mayor, Director of
Finance, Director of Law, Clerk of
Council and other appropriate officers of the City are, and each of them
is, authorized to take such actions as
are necessary, appropriate and in the
best interest of the City to establish
the terms and requirements for delivery of the Bonds and to make such
arrangements as are necessary with
the Original Purchaser in order to
establish the date, location, procedures, and conditions for the delivery
of the Bonds to the Original Purchaser, to give all appropriate notices and
certificates, to cause a true transcript
of proceedings with reference to the
issuance of the Bonds to be delivered
to the Original Purchaser, to sign any
transcript
certificates,
financial
statements and other documents and
instruments and to take such actions
as are necessary or appropriate to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take
all steps necessary to effect the due
execution, authentication and delivery of the Bonds. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to sign
and deliver on behalf of the City a
bond purchase agreement between
the City and the Original Purchaser
(the “Bond Purchase Agreement”),
approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, setting forth
the terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell the Bonds and the
Original Purchaser agrees to buy the
Bonds, which shall be consistent with
this Ordinance, not substantially
adverse to the City, and approved by
the Director of Finance and Director
of Law on behalf of the City, all of
which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of the Bond
Purchase Agreement by the Director
of Finance. It is determined that the
terms of the Bonds, as provided in this
Ordinance and as may be provided in
or pursuant to the Certificate of
Award, are in the best interest of the
City and in compliance with all legal
requirements.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B) of the
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds with
other bonds into a single consolidated
issue of bonds for purposes of their
sale as a single issue to be designated
“Various Purpose General Obligation
Bonds, Series 2012” or such other designation as may be set forth in the
Certificate of Award. Such bonds
shall contain a summary statement of
purposes encompassing the purpose
for which the Bonds are issued and
shall state that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose

32
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds promptly when and as the same falls due,
and also to provide for the discharge
of the Bonds at maturity, there shall
be and is levied on all the taxable
property in the City, in addition to all
other taxes, a direct tax annually during the period the Bonds are outstanding, in an amount sufficient to
provide for the payment of that interest, when and as the same shall fall
due, and also to discharge the principal of the Bonds at maturity, which
tax shall not be less than the interest
and sinking fund tax required by Section 11 of Article XII of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is ordered computed, certified, levied and extended
upon the tax duplicate and collected
by the same officers, in the same manner and at the same time that taxes
for general purposes for each of those
years are certified, extended and collected. The tax shall be placed before
and in preference to all other items
and for the full amount thereof. The
funds derived from those tax levies
shall be placed in the Unvoted Tax
Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund as required by the General Bond Ordinance, and those funds,
together with the interest collected on
them, shall be irrevocably pledged for
the payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds when and as the
same fall due; provided, however,
that, subject to the provisions of Section 8 of the General Bond Ordinance,
in each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the Bonds
and are appropriated for such purpose, the amount of such tax shall be
reduced by the amount of such revenues so available and appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections  133.25(B)(1) and 5705.51 of
the Ohio Revised Code, and in accordance with the provisions of and to
the extent required or permitted by
the General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt charges
for the Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended and applied for the objects
and purposes for which the Bonds are
issued. The proceeds of the Bonds to
be applied to pay costs of any Credit
Support Instruments obtained pursuant to Section 15 hereof shall be
paid to the provider or providers of
those Credit Support Instruments.
The proceeds of the Bonds to be used
to pay costs of issuing the Bonds shall
be deposited with the Registrar in a
separate account under the Registrar
Agreement pending their application
to the payment of such costs. Pursuant to Chapter 133 of the Ohio
Revised Code and this Ordinance, and
notwithstanding Chapter 179 of the
Codified Ordinances, any accrued
interest and any premium received
from the sale of the Bonds shall be
deposited in the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund to be applied to the payment of the principal of and interest
on the Bonds.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Bonds are secured by a pledge and

The City Record
lien on a parity with the pledges and
liens authorized by the General Bond
Ordinance and, in addition to the
taxes and revenues specifically
pledged pursuant to this Ordinance
and the General Bond Ordinance and
the other covenants, terms and agreements provided hereunder and in the
General Bond Ordinance to secure
payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds, the City hereby
determines, declares, warrants and
covenants that the Bonds are general
obligations of the City and that the
full faith and credit of the City are
hereby pledged for the payment of the
principal of and interest on the Bonds
in accordance with the laws and Constitution of the State of Ohio, this
Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid and
discharged all the outstanding Bonds,
or there shall otherwise be paid to the
holders of the outstanding Bonds all
debt charges due or to become due
thereon, and provision shall also be
made for paying all other sums
payable hereunder, then and in that
event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of
further effect, and the covenants,
agreements and other obligations of
the City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the request
of the City execute and deliver to the
City such instruments in writing as
shall discharge the lien hereof and
enter on the record such discharge of
the lien and such other instruments as
may be reasonably required by the
City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if:
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or subaccounts, in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold in
special accounts or subaccounts, in
trust for and irrevocably committed
solely thereto, direct obligations of
the United States certified by an independent public accounting firm of
national reputation to be of such
maturities and interest payment
dates and to bear such interest, without further investment or reinvestment of either the principal amount
thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held in trust and
committed, except as hereinafter provided), as will be sufficient, together
with moneys referred to in (i) above,
for the payment, at their maturities or
redemption dates, of all debt charges
on the Bonds to their date of maturity
or redemption, as the case may be, or
if default in such payment shall have
occurred on such date then to the date
of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds are to be
redeemed prior to the maturity thereof, notice of such redemption shall
have been duly given or irrevocable
provision satisfactory to the Trustee
shall have been duly made for the giving of such notice. Any moneys held
by the Escrow Agent in accordance
with the provisions of this Section
shall be invested by the Escrow
Agent in direct obligations of the
United States of America maturing, or

312

March 21, 2012
redeemable at the option of the holder, at times and in amounts sufficient
to meet payment of debt charges on
the Bonds, as directed by the Director
of Finance. Any income or interest
earned by, or increment to, the investments held under this Section shall, to
the extent determined from time to
time by the Escrow Agent to be in
excess of the amount required to be
held by it for the purposes of this Section, be transferred at the time of
such determination as provided in
Section  17(a) of the General Bond
Ordinance for unclaimed funds held
by a Paying Agent. In the event of
nonpresentment of any Bond as
described in Section 17(a) of the General Bond Ordinance, the moneys held
pursuant to this Section shall be held
and paid as provided in said Section  17(a) for unclaimed funds held
by a Paying Agent.
Section 9. Bond Anticipation Notes.
For the purpose of raising money in
anticipation of the issuance of the
Bonds for the purpose set forth in Section 1 hereof, notes of the City may be
issued in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed Four Million
One Hundred Thousand Dollars
($4,100,000) (the “Notes”) upon the
direction of the Director of Finance to
be set forth in a certificate providing
for the final terms of the Notes and
the sale of the Notes and signed by the
Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate of Award”).
(a) Terms of the Notes. The Notes
shall bear interest at such rate, not
exceeding six percent (6%) per year,
as may be fixed by the Director of
Finance of the City in the Note Certificate of Award; shall be dated their
date of issuance; shall mature on the
date set forth in the Note Certificate
of Award, which shall be no later than
five years from such date of issuance;
shall be subject to redemption by the
City at any time prior to maturity
without penalty, provided that, if the
Director of Finance, based on the
advice of a financial advisor, determines that it is in the best interest of
the City in order to enhance the marketability of the Notes, the Director of
Finance may cause the Notes to not be
redeemable for a period which ends
no later than the date which is two
years following the date of issuance
of the Notes; shall be designated
“Parks and Recreation Facilities
Improvement
Bond
Anticipation
Notes”; shall be issued in such numbers and denominations as may be
requested by the Note Purchaser
(hereinafter defined); and shall be
issued in fully registered form (which
may be in a book entry only system)
in denominations of $5,000 or integral
multiples thereof. Interest shall be
payable semiannually on the dates
set forth in the Note Certificate of
Award; provided that if the Notes
mature on or before the end of the
twelfth month following their date of
issuance, interest on the Notes shall
be payable at maturity.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating
agent, registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Notes (the “Note
Registrar”). The Escrow Agent also
shall act as paying agent for the
Notes if the Notes are held in a book
entry system. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, an agreement among the City, the Note Registrar and the Escrow Agent (the “Note
Registrar Agreement”) providing for

March 21, 2012
services relating to the registration,
transfer, exchange and payment of
Notes on terms that are approved by
the Director of Finance on behalf of
the City. That approval shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the Note Registrar Agreement by the
Director of Finance. The Director of
Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and for
reimbursement of expenses incurred
pursuant to the Note Registrar Agreement from the proceeds of the Notes to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Notes remain
outstanding, the City will cause the
Note Registrar to maintain and keep
at its principal corporate trust office
all books and records necessary for
the registration, exchange and transfer of Notes as provided in this Section
(the “Note Register”). The person in
whose name a Note is registered on
the Note Register shall be regarded as
the absolute owner of that Note for all
purposes of this Ordinance. Payment
of or on account of the debt charges
on any Note shall be made only to or
upon the order of that person; neither
the City nor the Note Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid and
effectual to satisfy and discharge the
City’s liability upon the Note, including interest, to the extent of the
amount or amounts so paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for
Notes of any authorized denomination
upon presentation and surrender at
the principal corporate trust office of
the Note Registrar, together with a
request for exchange signed by the
registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Note Registrar. A Note
may be transferred only on the Note
Register upon presentation and surrender of the Note at the principal corporate trust office of the Note Registrar together with an assignment
signed by the registered owner or by
a person legally empowered to do so
in a form satisfactory to the Note Registrar. Upon exchange or transfer the
Note
Registrar
shall
complete,
authenticate and deliver a new Note
or Notes of any authorized denomination or denominations requested by
the owner equal in the aggregate to
the unmatured principal amount of
the Note surrendered and bearing
interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Note Registrar shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Notes only after the new
Notes are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Notes exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Note Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Notes
in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Note Registrar may make a charge
sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to the
exchange or transfer. The City or the
Note Registrar may require that those
charges, if any, be paid before the procedure is begun for the exchange or
transfer. All Notes issued and authenticated upon any exchange or trans-

The City Record
fer shall be valid obligations of the
City, evidencing the same debt, and
entitled to the same security and benefit under this Ordinance, as the Notes
surrendered upon that exchange or
transfer.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B) of the
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Notes with
other bond anticipation notes of the
City for purposes of their sale as a single issue to be designated “Various
Purpose General Obligation Bond
Anticipation Notes.” The Notes shall
contain a summary statement of purposes encompassing the purpose for
which the Notes are issued and shall
state that they are issued pursuant to
this Ordinance.
(b) Execution and Payment of the
Notes. The Notes shall express upon
their faces the purpose for which they
are issued and that they are issued
pursuant to this Ordinance. Each Note
shall be authenticated by the manual
signature of an authorized officer of
the Trustee (as defined therein). The
Notes shall be signed by the City’s
Mayor and by the City’s Director of
Finance, and, consistent with Section
133.27 of the Ohio Revised Code and
notwithstanding Section 177.02 of the
Codified Ordinances of the City,
either or both of those signatures may
be a facsimile. The Notes shall bear
the seal of the City, which seal may be
a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section 83 of the City’s Charter, the Director of Law shall prepare the Notes and
shall endorse thereon his approval of
the form and correctness thereof by
his manual or facsimile signature.
(c) Sale of the Notes. The Notes
shall first be offered for purchase to
the Trustees of the Sinking Fund and,
if not purchased by them, shall be
offered to the Treasury Investment
Account for purchase and, if not purchased for that Account, shall be sold
to one or more firms that have proposed to underwrite the Notes and
have been selected by the Director of
Finance based on an evaluation of the
qualifications of those firms (the
“Note Purchaser”) in the principal
amount set forth in a certificate of
award to be executed by the Director
of Finance (the  “Note Certificate of
Award”) at not less than par and
accrued interest and at a rate not
exceeding that set forth in Section 10
hereof. The proceeds of such sale
shall be paid into the proper fund and
used for the purpose for which the
Notes are being issued under the provisions of this Ordinance.
(d) Security for the Notes. The
Notes shall be the full general obligations of the City, and the full faith,
credit and revenue of the City are
hereby pledged for the prompt payment of the same. The par value to be
received from the sale of the Notes
and any excess funds resulting from
the issuance of the Notes shall, to the
extent necessary, be used for the
retirement of the Notes at maturity,
together with the interest thereon,
and are hereby pledged for such purpose.
Section 10. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. During the year
or years while the Notes are outstanding there shall be levied on all the
taxable property in the City, in addition to all other taxes but within tax
limitations, a direct tax annually not
less than that which would have been
levied if bonds had been issued therefor without the prior issue of the
Notes. That tax shall be and is

313

33
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate
and collected by the same officers, in
the same manner and at the same
time that taxes for general purposes
for each year are certified, extended
and collected. That tax shall be
placed before and in preference to all
other items and for the full amount
thereof. The funds derived from the
tax levies required by this Ordinance
shall be placed in the Unvoted Tax
Supported Obligations Account, and
those funds, together with the interest collected on them, shall be irrevocably pledged for the payment of the
principal and interest of the Notes or
the Bonds in anticipation of which
they are issued, when and as the same
falls due; provided, however, that in
each year to the extent that revenues
are available from other sources for
the payment of the Notes and Bonds
and are appropriated for such purpose, the amount of such direct tax
upon all of the taxable property in the
City may be reduced by the amount of
such revenues so available and appropriated.
Section 11. Official Statement; Continuing Disclosure. If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a disclosure document (each, an “Official
Statement”) is appropriate or necessary in connection with the sale of the
Notes or the Bonds, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare or
cause to be prepared on behalf of the
City an Official Statement with
respect to the Notes or the Bonds, as
the case may be, and any necessary
supplements and to authorize the use
and distribution of each Official
Statement and any supplements. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign on behalf of the City and in her
official capacity each Official Statement and any supplements approved
by her. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign and deliver on
behalf of the City and in her official
capacity such certificates in connection with the accuracy of each Official Statement and any supplements
as may, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, be necessary or appropriate. The Director of Finance is also
authorized to determine and certify
on behalf of the City that such disclosure document is “deemed final” by
the City within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission
Rule 15c2-12 (the “SEC Rule”). The
Director of Finance is authorized to
contract for services for the production and distribution of preliminary
and final Official Statements, including by printed and electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time of
the Notes or the Bonds, the City
agrees, in accordance with, and as the
only obligated person with respect to
the Notes and the Bonds under the
SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be
provided such financial information
and operating data and notices, in
such manner as may be required for
purposes of the SEC Rule. In order to
describe and specify certain terms of
the City’s continuing disclosure
agreement for that purpose, and
thereby to implement that agreement,
including provisions for enforcement,
amendment and termination, the
Director of Finance is authorized and
directed to prepare, or cause to be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of the City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the

34
continuing
disclosure
agreement
made by the City for the benefit of the
holders and beneficial owners of the
Notes or the Bonds, as the case may
be, in accordance with the SEC Rule.
The performance of that agreement
shall be subject to the availability of
funds and their annual appropriation
to meet costs the City would be
required to incur to perform it. The
Director of Finance is further authorized and directed to establish procedures in order to ensure compliance
by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely
provision of information and notices.
Section 12. Miscellaneous.
(a) Any provisions of the Codified
Ordinances of the City that are inconsistent with the provisions of this
Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance shall not apply to the Bonds or
the Notes authorized herein.
(b) All covenants, terms and provisions of the General Bond Ordinance
are fully applicable to the Bonds and
the Notes authorized herein, and nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed
to alter or restrict such full application of the General Bond Ordinance,
except for the exclusion from application to the Bonds and the Notes authorized herein of the provisions of the
third paragraph of Section 13(a) and
the third paragraph of Section 4 of the
General Bond Ordinance, pursuant to
Section 2 hereof.
Section 13. Captions. The captions
or headings in this Ordinance are for
convenience only and in no way
define, limit or describe the scope or
intent of any provisions or sections of
this Ordinance.
Section 14. Federal Tax Covenants.
The City covenants that it will use,
and will restrict the use and investment of, the proceeds of the Notes and
the Bonds in such manner and to such
extent as may be necessary so that
(a) the Notes and the Bonds will not
(i) constitute private activity bonds,
arbitrage bonds or hedge bonds under
Sections 141, 148 or 149 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the “Code”) or (ii) be treated other
than as bonds to which Section 103(a)
of the Code applies, and (b) the interest thereon will not be treated as an
item of tax preference under Section 57 of the Code.
The City further covenants that (a)
it will take or cause to be taken such
actions that may be required of it for
the interest on the Notes and the
Bonds to be and to remain excluded
from gross income for federal income
tax purposes, (b) it will not take or
authorize to be taken any actions that
would adversely affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting for
it, will, among other acts of compliance, (i) apply the proceeds of the
Notes and the Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing, (ii)
restrict the yield on investment property acquired with those proceeds,
(iii) make timely and adequate payments to the federal government, (iv)
maintain books and records and make
calculations and reports, and (v)
refrain from certain uses of those proceeds, and, as applicable, of property
financed with such proceeds, all in
such manner and to the extent necessary to assure such exclusion of that
interest under the Code.
Each covenant made in this Section
with respect to the Notes and the
Bonds is also made with respect to all
issues any portion of the debt service
on which is paid from proceeds of the

The City Record
Notes or the Bonds (and, if different,
the original issue and any refunding
issues in a series of refundings), to
the extent such compliance is necessary to assure exclusion of interest on
the Notes and the Bonds from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, and the officers identified above
are authorized to take actions with
respect to those issues as they are
authorized in this Section to take with
respect to the Notes and the Bonds.
The Director of Finance, as the fiscal officer, or any other officer of the
City
having
responsibility
for
issuance of the Notes and the Bonds is
hereby authorized (a) to make or
effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or
waiver on behalf of the City with
respect to the Notes and the Bonds as
the City is permitted or required to
make or give under the federal
income tax laws, including, without
limitation thereto, any of the elections
provided
for
in
Section  148(f)(4)(C) of the Code or
available under Section  148 of the
Code, for the purpose of assuring,
enhancing or protecting favorable
tax treatment or status of the Notes
and the Bonds or interest thereon or
assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose, reducing the
burden or expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or
payments or penalties, or making
payments of special amounts in lieu
of making computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as
rebate, or obviating those amounts or
payments, as determined by that officer, which action shall be in writing
and signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf of
the City, as may be appropriate to
assure the exclusion of interest from
gross income and the intended tax
status of the Notes and the Bonds, and
(c) to give one or more appropriate
certificates of the City, for inclusion
in the transcript of proceedings for
the Notes and the Bonds, setting forth
the reasonable expectations of the
City regarding the amount and use of
all the proceeds of the Notes and the
Bonds, the facts, circumstances and
estimates on which they are based,
and other facts and circumstances relevant to the tax treatment of the
interest on and the tax status of the
Notes and the Bonds.
Section 15. Credit Enhancement and
Ratings. If, in the judgment of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
the filing of an application for a rating on the Bonds or designated portion thereof by one or more nationally
recognized rating agencies is in the
best interest of the City, the Director
of Finance is authorized to prepare
and submit those applications and to
provide to each such agency such
information as may be required for
the purpose. The Director of Finance
is authorized to contract for one or
more Credit Support Instruments for
the Bonds or designated portions
thereof if the Director determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the Credit
Support Instruments will result in
debt service savings to the City. As
used in this Section, “Credit Support
Instrument” means an insurance policy, surety, letter of credit, or other
instrument used to enhance or pro-

314

March 21, 2012
vide for the security of Bonds. The
cost of obtaining each rating and the
cost of obtaining each Credit Support
Instrument, except to the extent paid
by the Original Purchasers in accordance with the Bond Purchase Agreement, shall be paid from the proceeds
of Bonds or funds appropriated for
that purpose.
Section 16. Financial Advisor. The
Director of Finance may obtain the
services of one or more financial advisors, from time to time, to assist the
Director of Finance in making any of
the determinations required by this
Ordinance to be determined by the
Director of Finance. The Director of
Finance may rely on the written
advice of any financial advisor so
retained. Any financial advisor
employed under the authority of this
Ordinance shall be disinterested in
the transaction and be independent of
the Original Purchasers and any
other party interested in the transaction.
Section 17. Open Meeting Determination. It is found and determined
that all formal actions of this Council
and of any of its committees concerning and relating to the passage of this
Ordinance were taken, and that all
deliberations of this Council and any
of its committees that resulted in
these formal actions were held, in
meetings open to the public in compliance with all legal requirements,
including, without limitation, Section 121.22 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Section 18. Findings and Recitals of

make them legal, valid and binding
obligations of the City have happened, been done and been performed
in regular and due form as required
by law; and that no limitation of
indebtedness or taxation, either statutory or constitutional, will have been
exceeded in the issuance of the Bonds
or the Notes. It is further found and
determined, and is hereby represented and recited, that the provisions of
Sections 28, 29, 32, 33 (including the
provisions of Section 33 with respect

dispensing with such readings by a
two-thirds vote of all members of the
Council), 36, 37, 48 and all other

have been fully complied with and
this Ordinance was passed in conformity therewith.

for the Bonds and any Note Certificate of Award to the appropriate official of the County of Cuyahoga, Ohio
and to secure a receipt therefor.
Section 20. Severability. Each section and each part of each section of
this Ordinance is hereby declared to
be an independent section or part of a
section and, notwithstanding any
other evidence of legislative intent, it
is hereby declared to be the controlling legislative intent that if any such
section or part of a section or any provision thereof, or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the
remaining sections or parts of sections and the application of such provisions to any other person or circumstance, other than those as to which it

March 21, 2012
is held invalid, shall not be affected
thereby, and it is hereby declared to
be the legislative intent that the other
provisions of this Ordinance would
have been passed independently of
such section, or parts of a section, so
held to be invalid.
Section 21. Legislative Intent. All
terms, conditions, pledges, covenants
or agreements on the part of the City
provided for in this Ordinance are
made by the voluntary act of the City
under its lawful authority, including
its authority under its Charter and
Article XVIII of the Constitution of
Ohio.
Nothing in this Ordinance is intended to, and no provision hereof shall be
applied in any manner as would,
impair the obligation of contract of
the City with respect to any outstanding bonds, notes, certificates of
indebtedness, other obligations, trust
indentures, trust agreements, or other
agreements or contracts made or
entered into by the City and for which
consideration was duly received by
the City prior to the passage of this
Ordinance or the General Bond Ordinance.

emergency measure for the immediate preservation of the public peace,
property, health and safety of the City
by providing funds to pay the costs of
certain permanent improvements
which are urgently needed for the

immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest date allowed by
law.

from time to time in accordance with

The City Record
“General Bond Ordinance”), providing the general terms and provisions
for the issuance of unvoted general
obligations of the City, with the specific terms of each series of Bonds to
be contained in ordinances authorizing the issuance of Bonds in accordance with the provisions thereof
(the “Series Bond Ordinances”); and
Whereas, the authorization for
issuance of the Bonds is necessary to
provide funds to pay the costs of certain

improvements
described in Section 1 hereof that are
urgently needed for the benefit of the
City, and as a result, this Ordinance
constitutes an emergency measure
providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health and safety, and for the usual
daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed necessary to issue the Bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed
Twenty Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($20,500,000) for the purpose of providing funds to improve
the municipal street system and related
facilities,
including
streets,
expressways, roadways, driveways,
underground vaults, sidewalks, bikeways and walkways, by acquiring,
constructing, reconstructing, opening, extending, widening, grading,
draining, paving, resurfacing, lighting and curbing, removing or reconstructing underground vaults to preserve the public right of way,
installing gutters, sidewalks and
related pedestrian improvements,
constructing and improving culverts,

necessary and incidental appurtenances, and to pay any capitalized
interest and all expenses incurred in
connection with the issuance of the
securities, including all financing
costs within the meaning of Section  133.01(K) of the Ohio Revised
Code and such other costs of the foregoing permanent improvements that
may be financed with the proceeds of
securities as permitted by Section  133.15(B) of the Ohio Revised
Code and as otherwise permitted by
law.
Section 2. Authority and Terms. The
Bonds shall be issued pursuant to the
provisions of Article XVIII of the Constitution of Ohio, Chapter 133 of the
Ohio Revised Code and other applicable provisions of the Ohio Revised
Code, the Charter of the City, the General Bond Ordinance and this Ordinance for the purpose stated in Section 1 hereof. The Bonds shall be designated “Bridges and Roadways
Improvement Bonds” and may contain such further designation as provided in the certificate of award providing for the final terms of the Bonds
and the sale of the Bonds signed by
the Director of Finance in accordance
with this Ordinance (the “Certificate
of Award”). The Bonds shall be issued
in one lot as fully registered Bonds in
denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. The Bonds
shall be numbered as determined by
the Director of Finance.

315

35
The Bonds shall be issued in the
principal amount specified in the Certificate of Award, which shall not
exceed the amount stated in Section 1
hereof. The Bonds shall be dated the
date and shall bear interest from their
date until the principal amount is
paid at the rate or rates per year specified in the Certificate of Award, provided that the weighted average of
such rates (taking into account the
principal amount and maturity of
each Bond to which a rate applies)
shall not exceed six percent (6%) per
year. Interest on the Bonds shall be
payable when due, or until the principal amount is paid, semiannually as
specified in the Certificate of Award
as the dates on which interest on the
Bonds shall be payable (the “Interest
Payment Dates”), beginning on the
date specified in the Certificate of
Award as the first Interest Payment
Date.
The Bonds shall mature in the
years and principal amounts as shall
be permitted by law and determined
by the Director of Finance and specified in the Certificate of Award, based
on the written advice of a Financial
Advisor to be in the best interests of
the City, provided that (i) each principal payment shall occur on an Interest Payment Date, (ii) the first principal payment on the Bonds shall be
no earlier than November 15, 2012 and
no later than December 31, 2013, (iii)
the final maturity date of the Bonds
shall be no later than 18 years from
that date which is 12 months prior to
the first date on which provision for
payment of principal is made, and
(iv) the principal amount thereof
shall be payable in annual installments such that the total principal
and interest payments on the Bonds
in any fiscal year in which principal
is payable is not more than three
times the amount of those payments
in any other fiscal year.
The Bonds stated to mature in any
year may be issued as term bonds (the
“Term Bonds”), payable pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements as defined and further
described below. The Director of
Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award whether any of the
Bonds shall be issued as Term Bonds,
any dates (the “Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable pursuant to mandatory sinking fund installments rather than at
stated maturity and the amount of
principal to be paid on each Mandatory Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption or purchase prior to stated maturity as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory
sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100%
of the principal amount redeemed,
plus interest accrued to the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to be
deposited with the Escrow Agent, currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of and
interest on any Term Bonds shall
include amounts sufficient to redeem
on the Mandatory Redemption Dates

36
the principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided
below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined in
Section  3 hereof) for cancellation
Term Bonds in any aggregate principal amount and to receive a credit
against the then-current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City for
any Term Bonds. That option shall be
exercised by the City on or before the
forty-fifth day preceding the applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, by
furnishing the Escrow Agent a certificate, signed by the Registrar, setting forth the extent of the credit to
be applied with respect to the thencurrent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement. If the certificate is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the thencurrent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corremandatory
redemption
sponding
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds that
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and cancelled
by the Registrar, to the extent not
applied theretofore as a credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and cancelled, shall be credited by the
Escrow Agent at 100% of the principal amount thereof against the thencurrent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding
mandatory
redemption
obligation). Any excess of that
amount over the then-current Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirement
shall
be
credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligations) in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(b) Optional Redemption. The
Bonds may be subject to redemption
prior to maturity by and at the option
of the City, in whole or in part on any
date, in integral multiples of $5,000,
on the optional redemption dates and
at the redemption prices (expressed
as a percentage of the principal
amount redeemed) specified in the
Certificate of Award, plus, in each
case, accrued interest to the redemption date. The first optional redemption date shall not be later than ten
years from the first Interest Payment
Date, and the highest redemption
price shall not be greater than 102%
of the principal amount redeemed
plus accrued interest to the redemption date. Based on the written advice
of a financial advisor, the Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that it is in the best
interests of the City for some or all of
the Bonds not to be callable prior to
their stated maturity.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory

The City Record
Redemption Date, the Bonds, or portions thereof, to be redeemed optionally shall be selected by lot prior to
the selection by lot of the Bonds to be
redeemed on the same date by operation of the Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds shall be
redeemed pursuant to this paragraph
only upon written notice from the
Director of Finance to the Registrar.
That notice shall specify the redemption date and the principal amount of
each maturity of Bonds to be
redeemed, and shall be given at least
45 days prior to the redemption date
or such shorter period as shall be
acceptable to the Registrar. There
shall be deposited with the Registrar
on or prior to the redemption date
funds sufficient to redeem at the
redemption
price
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice of
redemption has been given.
(c) Purchase in Lieu of Redemption. If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the City may
elect to purchase Bonds called for
optional redemption in lieu of redeeming those Bonds. That election shall
be exercised by written direction
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar and the Escrow Agent.
That written direction shall state
whether all or less than all of the
Bonds called for optional redemption
are to be purchased by the City in lieu
of redemption, shall identify the
Bonds to be purchased by their maturity date and shall specify the principal amount of each maturity to be purchased in lieu of redemption. If less
than all of the Bonds called for optional redemption are to be purchased in
lieu of redemption, the amount of
each maturity to be purchased shall
be in amounts of $5,000 or integral
multiples of $5,000. Any Bonds called
for optional redemption that are not
to be purchased shall be redeemed in
accordance with their redemption provisions. The purchase price of the
Bonds to be purchased in lieu of
redemption shall be equal to the principal of, any accrued but unpaid interest on, and any premium that would
have been payable on the Bonds on
the redemption date if the Bonds had
been optionally redeemed instead of
being purchased. No notice of the purchase in lieu of redemption is
required to be given to the owners of
the Bonds in addition to the notice of
redemption required by this Ordinance. The Escrow Agent or Registrar, as paying agent, shall not purchase Bonds if sufficient moneys
have not been deposited with the
Escrow Agent or Registrar, as paying
agent, by the City for the purpose. On
or prior to the scheduled date for
optional redemption, the City may
rescind its direction to purchase the
Bonds in lieu of redemption by written notice from the Director of
Finance to the Registrar and the
Escrow Agent. In the event that the
direction to purchase is rescinded, the
Bonds shall be redeemed on the
redemption date set forth in the notice
of redemption delivered to the owners
of the Bonds and in accordance with
the provisions of this Ordinance.
(d) Partial Redemption or Purchase. If fewer than all of the outstanding Bonds are called for redemption at one time (whether for redemption or purchase in lieu of redemption), they shall be called in the order
of maturities directed by the Director
of Finance. If fewer than all Bonds of

316

March 21, 2012
a single maturity are to be redeemed
or purchased in lieu of redemption,
the selection of Bonds to be redeemed
or purchased, or portions thereof in
amounts of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof, shall be made by the
Registrar by lot in a manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of
a partial redemption or purchase of
Bonds by lot when Bonds of denominations greater than $5,000 are then
outstanding, each $5,000 unit of principal thereof shall be treated as
though it were a separate Bond of the
denomination of $5,000. If it is determined that one or more, but not all of
the $5,000 units of principal amount
represented by a Bond are to be called
for redemption, then upon notice of
redemption of a $5,000 unit or units,
the registered owner of that Bond
shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i) for payment of the redemption
or purchase price of the $5,000 unit or
units called for redemption (including, without limitation, the interest
accrued to the date fixed for redemption and any premium), and (ii) for
issuance, without charge to the registered owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured portion of the Bond not
redeemed or purchased and bearing
interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date as the Bond surrendered.
(e) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii) the
redemption price to be paid, (iii) the
date fixed for redemption, and (iv)
the place or places where the amounts
due upon redemption are payable.
The notice shall be given by the Registrar on behalf of the City by mailing
a copy of the redemption notice by
first-class mail, postage prepaid, at
least 30 days prior to the date fixed
for redemption (or such period specified in the Certificate of Award), to
the registered owner of each Bond
subject to redemption in whole or in
part at the registered owner’s address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close of
business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing and to any provider
of a Credit Support Instrument (as
defined in Section 15 hereof) for the
Bonds or designated portions thereof.
Failure to receive notice by mail or
any defect in that notice regarding
any Bond, however, shall not affect
the validity of the proceedings for the
redemption of any Bond. Any notice
of redemption of any Bonds may specify that the redemption is contingent
on the deposit of moneys with the
Escrow Agent or Registrar, as paying
agent, on or prior to the redemption
date in an amount sufficient to pay
the redemption price of the Bonds to
be redeemed.
(f) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the manner provided in the preceding paragraph, and moneys having been
deposited by the City with the Escrow
Agent or Registrar, as paying agent,
in an amount sufficient to pay the
redemption price, the Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption
shall become due and payable on the
redemption date, and, upon presentation and surrender at the place or
places specified in that notice, shall

March 21, 2012
be paid. If money for the redemption
of all of the Bonds and portions thereof to be redeemed, including interest
accrued to the redemption date, is
held by the Registrar on the redemption date, and, if notice of redemption
has been deposited in the mail, then
from and after the redemption date
those Bonds and portions thereof
called for redemption shall cease to
bear interest and no longer shall be
considered to be outstanding. If that
money shall not be so available on the
redemption date, or that notice shall
not have been deposited in the mail,
those Bonds and portions thereof
shall continue to bear interest, until
they are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money held
by the Registrar for the redemption of
particular Bonds shall be held in trust
for the account of the registered owners and shall be paid to them, respectively, upon presentation and surrender of those Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without
deduction for the services of the Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent. Principal shall be payable
when due upon presentation and surrender of the Bonds at the principal
corporate trust office of the Registrar. Interest on a Bond shall be paid
on each Interest Payment Date by
check or draft mailed to the person in
whose name the Bond was registered,
and to that person’s address appearing, on the Bond Register (as defined
in Section  3 hereof) at the close of
business on the date provided in the
Registrar Agreement authorized and
defined in Section  3 hereof (the
“Record Date”). Notwithstanding any
contrary provision in the General
Bond Ordinance, so long as the Bonds
are held by a Depository in a book
entry system (as described in Section  3 hereof), debt charges on the
Bonds will be payable in lawful
money of the United States by wire
transfer to the Depository made by
the Escrow Agent on each Interest
Payment Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance. The General Bond Ordinance, except for the third paragraph
of Section 13(a) (pertaining generally to an adjustment of the interest
rate in an event of default) and the
third paragraph of Section 4 (pertaining generally to the periods during
which the City is not required to make
any transfers or exchanges of bonds
issued under the General Bond Ordinance), will apply to the Bonds.
Except for those provisions, the General Bond Ordinance is included as a
part of this Ordinance as fully as if
restated in this Ordinance. Words and
terms not otherwise defined in this
Ordinance shall have the same meaning as set forth in the General Bond
Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of the
Bonds; Paying Agents. The Bonds
shall express upon their faces the purpose for which they are issued and
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance. Pursuant to Section  4 of
the General Bond Ordinance, each
Bond shall be authenticated by the
manual signature of an authorized
officer of the Trustee (as defined
therein). The Bonds shall be signed
by the City’s Mayor and by the City’s

The City Record
Director of Finance, and, consistent
with Section  133.27 of the Ohio
Revised Code and notwithstanding
Section  177.02 of the Codified Ordinances of the City, either or both of
those signatures may be a facsimile.
The Bonds shall bear the seal of the
City, which seal may be a facsimile
seal. Pursuant to Section  83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
shall prepare the Bonds and shall
endorse thereon his approval of the
form and correctness thereof by his
manual or facsimile signature.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating
agent, bond registrar, transfer agent
and paying agent for the Bonds (the
“Registrar”). The Registrar shall also
act as paying agent for the Bonds so
long as the Bonds are held in a book
entry system. The Director of Finance
is authorized to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City, an
agreement between the City and the
Registrar (the “Registrar Agreement”), approved as to form and correctness by the Director of Law, providing for services relating to the registration, transfer, exchange and payment of the Bonds on terms approved
by the Director of Finance on behalf
of the City and consistent with this
Ordinance and not substantially
adverse to the City. That approval
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Registrar Agreement by the Director of Finance. The
Director of Finance shall provide for
the payment of the services rendered
and for reimbursement of expenses
incurred pursuant to the Registrar
Agreement from the proceeds of the
Bonds to the extent available and
then from other money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds remain
outstanding, the City will cause the
Registrar to maintain and keep at its
principal corporate trust office all
books and records necessary for the
registration, exchange and transfer
of Bonds as provided in this Section
(the “Bond Register”). The person in
whose name a Bond is registered on
the Bond Register shall be regarded
as the absolute owner of that Bond for
all purposes of this Ordinance. Payment of or on account of the debt
charges on any Bond shall be made
only to or upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar
shall be affected by any notice to the
contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid and
effectual to satisfy and discharge the
City’s liability upon the Bond, including interest, to the extent of the
amount or amounts so paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender
at the principal corporate trust office
of the Registrar, together with a
request for exchange signed by the
registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. A Bond may
be transferred only on the Bond Register upon presentation and surrender
of the Bond at the principal corporate
trust office of the Registrar together
with an assignment signed by the registered owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any

317

37
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner equal
in the aggregate to the unmatured
principal amount of the Bond surrendered and bearing interest at the
same rate and maturing on the same
date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any tax or
other governmental charge required
to be paid with respect to the
exchange or transfer. The City or the
Registrar may require that those
charges, if any, be paid before the procedure is begun for the exchange or
transfer. All Bonds issued and
authenticated upon any exchange or
transfer shall be valid obligations of
the City, evidencing the same debt,
and entitled to the same security and
benefit under this Ordinance, as the
surrendered
upon
that
Bonds
exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds and the principal of and interest on the Bonds may
be transferred only through a book
entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are
issued by the City only to a Depository or its nominee as registered owner,
with the Bonds “immobilized” in the
custody of the Depository. The book
entry maintained by others than the
City is the record that identifies the
owners of beneficial interests in those
Bonds and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited
purpose trust company), New York,
New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers,
banks and trust companies, and clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized: (i) the Bonds
may be issued in the form of a single,
fully registered Bond representing
each maturity and registered in the
name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository;
(ii) the beneficial owners in book
entry form shall have no right to

38
receive Bonds in the form of physical
securities or certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book
entry form shall be shown by book
entry on the system maintained and
operated by the Depository and its
Participants, and transfers of the
ownership of beneficial interests
shall be made only by book entry by
the Depository and its Participants;
and (iv) the Bonds as such shall not
be transferable or exchangeable,
except for transfer to another Depository or to another nominee of a Depository, without further action by the
City.
If any Depository determines not to
continue to act as a Depository for the
Bonds for use in a book entry system,
the Director of Finance may attempt
to
establish
a
securities
depository/book entry relationship with
another qualified Depository. If the
Director of Finance does not or is
unable to do so, the Registrar, after
making provision for notification of
the beneficial owners by the then
Depository and any other arrangements deemed necessary, shall permit
withdrawal of the Bonds from the
Depository, and the Trustee and Registrar shall authenticate and deliver
bond certificates in registered form to
the assigns of the Depository or its
nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to the
extent necessary or required to enter
into any agreements determined necessary in connection with the book
entry system for the Bonds, after
determining that the signing thereof
will not endanger the funds or securities of the City and after the approval
of the form of any such agreement by
the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The Bonds
shall first be offered for purchase to
the Trustees of the Sinking Fund and,
if not purchased by them, shall be
offered to the Treasury Investment
Account for purchase and, if not purchased for that Account, shall be sold
to one or more firms that have proposed to underwrite the Bonds and
have been selected by the Director of
Finance based on an evaluation of the
qualifications of those firms (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”).
The Bonds shall be awarded to the
Original Purchaser in the Certificate
of Award which shall specify the
final terms of the Bonds in accordance with law, the provisions of this
Ordinance, the written advice of a
financial advisor retained under
authority of Section 16 hereof and the
Original Purchaser’s offer to purchase the Bonds, including: the principal amount of the Bonds, the purchase price (which shall be not less
than 97% of the principal amount of
the Bonds plus any accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate or
rates, the amounts and years in which
principal installments are payable
(at stated maturity or pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements), the Interest Payment
Dates and the date of the Bonds and
any other matters required in this
Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. As appropriate under the
Charter, the Mayor, Director of
Finance, Director of Law, Clerk of
Council and other appropriate officers of the City are, and each of them

The City Record
is, authorized to take such actions as
are necessary, appropriate and in the
best interest of the City to establish
the terms and requirements for delivery of the Bonds and to make such
arrangements as are necessary with
the Original Purchaser in order to
establish the date, location, procedures, and conditions for the delivery
of the Bonds to the Original Purchaser, to give all appropriate notices and
certificates, to cause a true transcript
of proceedings with reference to the
issuance of the Bonds to be delivered
to the Original Purchaser, to sign any
certificates,
financial
transcript
statements and other documents and
instruments and to take such actions
as are necessary or appropriate to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take
all steps necessary to effect the due
execution, authentication and delivery of the Bonds. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to sign
and deliver on behalf of the City a
bond purchase agreement between
the City and the Original Purchaser
(the “Bond Purchase Agreement”),
approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, setting forth
the terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell the Bonds and the
Original Purchaser agrees to buy the
Bonds, which shall be consistent with
this Ordinance, not substantially
adverse to the City, and approved by
the Director of Finance and Director
of Law on behalf of the City, all of
which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of the Bond
Purchase Agreement by the Director
of Finance. It is determined that the
terms of the Bonds, as provided in this
Ordinance and as may be provided in
or pursuant to the Certificate of
Award, are in the best interest of the
City and in compliance with all legal
requirements.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B) of the
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds with
other bonds into a single consolidated
issue of bonds for purposes of their
sale as a single issue to be designated
“Various Purpose General Obligation
Bonds, Series 2012” or such other designation as may be set forth in the
Certificate of Award. Such bonds
shall contain a summary statement of
purposes encompassing the purpose
for which the Bonds are issued and
shall state that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds promptly when and as the same falls due,
and also to provide for the discharge
of the Bonds at maturity, there shall
be and is levied on all the taxable
property in the City, in addition to all
other taxes, a direct tax annually during the period the Bonds are outstanding, in an amount sufficient to
provide for the payment of that interest, when and as the same shall fall
due, and also to discharge the principal of the Bonds at maturity, which
tax shall not be less than the interest
and sinking fund tax required by Section 11 of Article XII of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is ordered computed, certified, levied and extended
upon the tax duplicate and collected
by the same officers, in the same manner and at the same time that taxes
for general purposes for each of those
years are certified, extended and col-

318

March 21, 2012
lected. The tax shall be placed before
and in preference to all other items
and for the full amount thereof. The
funds derived from those tax levies
shall be placed in the Unvoted Tax
Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund as required by the General Bond Ordinance, and those funds,
together with the interest collected on
them, shall be irrevocably pledged for
the payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds when and as the
same fall due; provided, however,
that, subject to the provisions of Section 8 of the General Bond Ordinance,
in each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the Bonds
and are appropriated for such purpose, the amount of such tax shall be
reduced by the amount of such revenues so available and appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections  133.25(B)(1) and 5705.51 of
the Ohio Revised Code, and in accordance with the provisions of and to
the extent required or permitted by
the General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt charges
for the Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended and applied for the objects
and purposes for which the Bonds are
issued. The proceeds of the Bonds to
be applied to pay costs of any Credit
Support Instruments obtained pursuant to Section 15 hereof shall be
paid to the provider or providers of
those Credit Support Instruments.
The proceeds of the Bonds to be used
to pay costs of issuing the Bonds shall
be deposited with the Registrar in a
separate account under the Registrar
Agreement pending their application
to the payment of such costs. Pursuant to Chapter 133 of the Ohio
Revised Code and this Ordinance, and
notwithstanding Chapter 179 of the
Codified Ordinances, any accrued
interest and any premium received
from the sale of the Bonds shall be
deposited in the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund to be applied to the payment of the principal of and interest
on the Bonds.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Bonds are secured by a pledge and
lien on a parity with the pledges and
liens authorized by the General Bond
Ordinance and, in addition to the
taxes and revenues specifically
pledged pursuant to this Ordinance
and the General Bond Ordinance and
the other covenants, terms and agreements provided hereunder and in the
General Bond Ordinance to secure
payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds, the City hereby
determines, declares, warrants and
covenants that the Bonds are general
obligations of the City and that the
full faith and credit of the City are
hereby pledged for the payment of the
principal of and interest on the Bonds
in accordance with the laws and Constitution of the State of Ohio, this
Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid and
discharged all the outstanding Bonds,

March 21, 2012
or there shall otherwise be paid to the
holders of the outstanding Bonds all
debt charges due or to become due
thereon, and provision shall also be
made for paying all other sums
payable hereunder, then and in that
event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of
further effect, and the covenants,
agreements and other obligations of
the City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the request
of the City execute and deliver to the
City such instruments in writing as
shall discharge the lien hereof and
enter on the record such discharge of
the lien and such other instruments as
may be reasonably required by the
City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if:
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or subaccounts, in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold in
special accounts or subaccounts, in
trust for and irrevocably committed
solely thereto, direct obligations of
the United States certified by an independent public accounting firm of
national reputation to be of such
maturities and interest payment
dates and to bear such interest, without further investment or reinvestment of either the principal amount
thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held in trust and
committed, except as hereinafter provided), as will be sufficient, together
with moneys referred to in (i) above,
for the payment, at their maturities or
redemption dates, of all debt charges
on the Bonds to their date of maturity
or redemption, as the case may be, or
if default in such payment shall have
occurred on such date then to the date
of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds are to be
redeemed prior to the maturity thereof, notice of such redemption shall
have been duly given or irrevocable
provision satisfactory to the Trustee
shall have been duly made for the giving of such notice. Any moneys held
by the Escrow Agent in accordance
with the provisions of this Section
shall be invested by the Escrow
Agent in direct obligations of the
United States of America maturing, or
redeemable at the option of the holder, at times and in amounts sufficient
to meet payment of debt charges on
the Bonds, as directed by the Director
of Finance. Any income or interest
earned by, or increment to, the investments held under this Section shall, to
the extent determined from time to
time by the Escrow Agent to be in
excess of the amount required to be
held by it for the purposes of this Section, be transferred at the time of
such determination as provided in
Section  17(a) of the General Bond
Ordinance for unclaimed funds held
by a Paying Agent. In the event of
nonpresentment of any Bond as
described in Section 17(a) of the General Bond Ordinance, the moneys held
pursuant to this Section shall be held
and paid as provided in said Section  17(a) for unclaimed funds held
by a Paying Agent.
Section 9. Bond Anticipation Notes.
For the purpose of raising money in

The City Record
anticipation of the issuance of the
Bonds for the purpose set forth in Section 1 hereof, notes of the City may be
issued in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed Twenty Million
Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($20,500,000) (the “Notes”) upon the
direction of the Director of Finance to
be set forth in a certificate providing
for the final terms of the Notes and
the sale of the Notes and signed by the
Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate of Award”).
(a) Terms of the Notes. The Notes
shall bear interest at such rate, not
exceeding six percent (6%) per year,
as may be fixed by the Director of
Finance of the City in the Note Certificate of Award; shall be dated their
date of issuance; shall mature on the
date set forth in the Note Certificate
of Award, which shall be no later than
five years from such date of issuance;
shall be subject to redemption by the
City at any time prior to maturity
without penalty, provided that, if the
Director of Finance, based on the
advice of a financial advisor, determines that it is in the best interest of
the City in order to enhance the marketability of the Notes, the Director of
Finance may cause the Notes to not be
redeemable for a period which ends
no later than the date which is two
years following the date of issuance
of the Notes; shall be designated
“Bridges and Roadways Improvement
Bond Anticipation Notes”; shall be
issued in such numbers and denominations as may be requested by the
Note Purchaser (hereinafter defined);
and shall be issued in fully registered
form (which may be in a book entry
only system) in denominations of
$5,000 or integral multiples thereof.
Interest shall be payable semiannually on the dates set forth in the Note
Certificate of Award; provided that if
the Notes mature on or before the end
of the twelfth month following their
date of issuance, interest on the Notes
shall be payable at maturity.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating
agent, registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Notes (the “Note
Registrar”). The Escrow Agent also
shall act as paying agent for the
Notes if the Notes are held in a book
entry system. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, an agreement among the City, the Note Registrar and the Escrow Agent (the “Note
Registrar Agreement”) providing for
services relating to the registration,
transfer, exchange and payment of
Notes on terms that are approved by
the Director of Finance on behalf of
the City. That approval shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the Note Registrar Agreement by the
Director of Finance. The Director of
Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and for
reimbursement of expenses incurred
pursuant to the Note Registrar Agreement from the proceeds of the Notes to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Notes remain
outstanding, the City will cause the
Note Registrar to maintain and keep
at its principal corporate trust office
all books and records necessary for
the registration, exchange and transfer of Notes as provided in this Section
(the “Note Register”). The person in
whose name a Note is registered on

319

39
the Note Register shall be regarded as
the absolute owner of that Note for all
purposes of this Ordinance. Payment
of or on account of the debt charges
on any Note shall be made only to or
upon the order of that person; neither
the City nor the Note Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid and
effectual to satisfy and discharge the
City’s liability upon the Note, including interest, to the extent of the
amount or amounts so paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for
Notes of any authorized denomination
upon presentation and surrender at
the principal corporate trust office of
the Note Registrar, together with a
request for exchange signed by the
registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Note Registrar. A Note
may be transferred only on the Note
Register upon presentation and surrender of the Note at the principal corporate trust office of the Note Registrar together with an assignment
signed by the registered owner or by
a person legally empowered to do so
in a form satisfactory to the Note Registrar. Upon exchange or transfer the
Registrar
shall
complete,
Note
authenticate and deliver a new Note
or Notes of any authorized denomination or denominations requested by
the owner equal in the aggregate to
the unmatured principal amount of
the Note surrendered and bearing
interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Note Registrar shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Notes only after the new
Notes are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Notes exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Note Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Notes
in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Note Registrar may make a charge
sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to the
exchange or transfer. The City or the
Note Registrar may require that those
charges, if any, be paid before the procedure is begun for the exchange or
transfer. All Notes issued and authenticated upon any exchange or transfer shall be valid obligations of the
City, evidencing the same debt, and
entitled to the same security and benefit under this Ordinance, as the Notes
surrendered upon that exchange or
transfer.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B) of the
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Notes with
other bond anticipation notes of the
City for purposes of their sale as a single issue to be designated “Various
Purpose General Obligation Bond
Anticipation Notes.” The Notes shall
contain a summary statement of purposes encompassing the purpose for
which the Notes are issued and shall
state that they are issued pursuant to
this Ordinance.
(b) Execution and Payment of the
Notes. The Notes shall express upon
their faces the purpose for which they
are issued and that they are issued
pursuant to this Ordinance. Each Note
shall be authenticated by the manual
signature of an authorized officer of

40
the Trustee (as defined therein). The
Notes shall be signed by the City’s
Mayor and by the City’s Director of
Finance, and, consistent with Section
133.27 of the Ohio Revised Code and
notwithstanding Section 177.02 of the
Codified Ordinances of the City,
either or both of those signatures may
be a facsimile. The Notes shall bear
the seal of the City, which seal may be
a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section 83 of the City’s Charter, the Director of Law shall prepare the Notes and
shall endorse thereon his approval of
the form and correctness thereof by
his manual or facsimile signature.
(c) Sale of the Notes. The Notes
shall first be offered for purchase to
the Trustees of the Sinking Fund and,
if not purchased by them, shall be
offered to the Treasury Investment
Account for purchase and, if not purchased for that Account, shall be sold
to one or more firms that have proposed to underwrite the Notes and
have been selected by the Director of
Finance based on an evaluation of the
qualifications of those firms (the
“Note Purchaser”) in the principal
amount set forth in a certificate of
award to be executed by the Director
of Finance (the  “Note Certificate of
Award”) at not less than par and
accrued interest and at a rate not
exceeding that set forth in Section 10
hereof. The proceeds of such sale
shall be paid into the proper fund and
used for the purpose for which the
Notes are being issued under the provisions of this Ordinance.
(d) Security for the Notes. The
Notes shall be the full general obligations of the City, and the full faith,
credit and revenue of the City are
hereby pledged for the prompt payment of the same. The par value to be
received from the sale of the Notes
and any excess funds resulting from
the issuance of the Notes shall, to the
extent necessary, be used for the
retirement of the Notes at maturity,
together with the interest thereon,
and are hereby pledged for such purpose.
Section 10. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. During the year
or years while the Notes are outstanding there shall be levied on all the
taxable property in the City, in addition to all other taxes but within tax
limitations, a direct tax annually not
less than that which would have been
levied if bonds had been issued therefor without the prior issue of the
Notes. That tax shall be and is
ordered computed, certified, levied
and extended upon the tax duplicate

Notes or the Bonds, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare or
cause to be prepared on behalf of the

official capacity each Official Statement and any supplements approved
by her. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign and deliver on

capacity such certificates in connection with the accuracy of each Official Statement and any supplements
as may, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, be necessary or appropriate. The Director of Finance is also

be, in accordance with the SEC Rule.
The performance of that agreement
shall be subject to the availability of
funds and their annual appropriation
to meet costs the City would be
required to incur to perform it. The
Director of Finance is further authorized and directed to establish procedures in order to ensure compliance
by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely
provision of information and notices.

Section 14. Federal Tax Covenants.
The City covenants that it will use,
and will restrict the use and investment of, the proceeds of the Notes and
the Bonds in such manner and to such
extent as may be necessary so that
(a) the Notes and the Bonds will not
(i) constitute private activity bonds,
arbitrage bonds or hedge bonds under
Sections 141, 148 or 149 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the “Code”) or (ii) be treated other
than as bonds to which Section 103(a)
of the Code applies, and (b) the interest thereon will not be treated as an
item of tax preference under Section 57 of the Code.
The City further covenants that (a)
it will take or cause to be taken such
actions that may be required of it for
the interest on the Notes and the
Bonds to be and to remain excluded
from gross income for federal income
tax purposes, (b) it will not take or
authorize to be taken any actions that
would adversely affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting for
it, will, among other acts of compliance, (i) apply the proceeds of the
Notes and the Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing, (ii)
restrict the yield on investment property acquired with those proceeds,
(iii) make timely and adequate payments to the federal government, (iv)
maintain books and records and make
calculations and reports, and (v)
refrain from certain uses of those proceeds, and, as applicable, of property
financed with such proceeds, all in
such manner and to the extent necessary to assure such exclusion of that
interest under the Code.
Each covenant made in this Section
with respect to the Notes and the
Bonds is also made with respect to all
issues any portion of the debt service
on which is paid from proceeds of the
Notes or the Bonds (and, if different,
the original issue and any refunding
issues in a series of refundings), to
the extent such compliance is necessary to assure exclusion of interest on
the Notes and the Bonds from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, and the officers identified above
are authorized to take actions with
respect to those issues as they are
authorized in this Section to take with
respect to the Notes and the Bonds.
The Director of Finance, as the fiscal officer, or any other officer of the
City
having
responsibility
for
issuance of the Notes and the Bonds is
hereby authorized (a) to make or
effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or
waiver on behalf of the City with
respect to the Notes and the Bonds as
the City is permitted or required to

income tax laws, including, without
limitation thereto, any of the elections
provided
for

Section  148(f)(4)(C) of the Code or
available under Section  148 of the
Code, for the purpose of assuring,
enhancing or protecting favorable
tax treatment or status of the Notes
and the Bonds or interest thereon or
assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose, reducing the
burden or expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or
payments or penalties, or making
payments of special amounts in lieu
of making computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as
rebate, or obviating those amounts or
payments, as determined by that officer, which action shall be in writing
and signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf of
the City, as may be appropriate to
assure the exclusion of interest from
gross income and the intended tax
status of the Notes and the Bonds, and
(c) to give one or more appropriate
certificates of the City, for inclusion
in the transcript of proceedings for
the Notes and the Bonds, setting forth
the reasonable expectations of the
City regarding the amount and use of
all the proceeds of the Notes and the
Bonds, the facts, circumstances and
estimates on which they are based,
and other facts and circumstances relevant to the tax treatment of the
interest on and the tax status of the
Notes and the Bonds.
Section 15. Credit Enhancement and
Ratings. If, in the judgment of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
the filing of an application for a rating on the Bonds or designated portion thereof by one or more nationally
recognized rating agencies is in the
best interest of the City, the Director
of Finance is authorized to prepare
and submit those applications and to
provide to each such agency such
information as may be required for
the purpose. The Director of Finance
is authorized to contract for one or
more Credit Support Instruments for
the Bonds or designated portions
thereof if the Director determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the Credit
Support Instruments will result in
debt service savings to the City. As
used in this Section, “Credit Support
Instrument” means an insurance policy, surety, letter of credit, or other
instrument used to enhance or provide for the security of Bonds. The
cost of obtaining each rating and the
cost of obtaining each Credit Support
Instrument, except to the extent paid
by the Original Purchasers in accordance with the Bond Purchase Agreement, shall be paid from the proceeds
of Bonds or funds appropriated for
that purpose.
Section 16. Financial Advisor. The
Director of Finance may obtain the
services of one or more financial advisors, from time to time, to assist the
Director of Finance in making any of
the determinations required by this
Ordinance to be determined by the

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 252-12.
By Council Member Miller.
An emergency resolution supporting certain amendments to U. S. Senate Bill 1813, the transportation
authorization legislation.
Whereas, U.S. Senate Bill 1813 (“S
1813”), is the 2 year surface transportation authorization bill funding
federal highway, transit and bridge
programs; and
Whereas, S 1813 as written, generally takes certain funding away
from local governments as well as
local governments’ ability to control
the allocation of money and gives
more authority to the states to allocate transportation funds; and
Whereas, certain amendments to S
1813 seek to restore local funding
and local authority over the allocation of transportation funds; and
Whereas, as written, S 1813 would
shift more authority to states to control the allocation and programming
of transportation dollars into a
newly created Transportation Mobility Program (“TMP”) and end several
locally
targeted
programs,
thereby reducing the overall funding directed to local governments;
the
Begich
amendment
would
restore the local share of funding
under the TMP program contained
in S 1813; and
Whereas, S 1813 would collapse
federal bridge programs into a larger program for states to spend on
all
transportation
programs
and
eliminates a 15 percent set-aside for
off-system bridges which funds local
bridges; the Casey-Blunt amendment
would provide full funding for the
15 percent set-aside to fund local offsystem bridges; and
Whereas, current law provides
that areas over 50,000 in population
are designated as a metropolitan
planning organization (“MPO”) and
have regional planning responsibilities and decision making authority
over transportation and other projects in their region.   S 1813 would
change that threshold to 200,000 in
population and set up new criteria
for remaining as an MPO; the Shaheen amendment would grandfather
in existing MPOs; and   
Whereas, S 1813 creates a new
program called “Additional Activities” that includes a broad range of

eligible projects such as Main Street
revitalizations, local street safety
improvements, and Safe Routes to
Schools, among many others; the
Cardin-Cochran amendment would
turn that Additional Activities program into a competitive grant program for local governments, giving
local elected leaders more control
over how to spend the funds; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports certain amendments to U.S.
Senate Bill 1813, the transportation
authorization legislation.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
resolution to the appropriate persons
at the National League of Cities and
to Senators Sherrod Brown and Rob
Portman.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immeupon
its
adoption
and

private businesses and individuals
to support “Earth Hour 2012” by
turning off their lights for one hour,

Whereas, on March 31, 2012, the
world

“Earth Hour” when hundreds of millions of people, organizations, corporations and governments around
the world will come together to
make a bold statement about their

dirty air, dangerous dependency on
foreign
oil
and
costly
climate
change
impacts,
and
make
the
switch to cleaner air, a strong economic future and a more secure
nation; and
Whereas, since its inception five
years ago, Earth Hour has become
a global phenomenon; and
Whereas, more than 5,200 cities
and towns in 135 countries worldwide switched off their lights for
Earth Hour 2011, sending a powerful message for action on climate
change; also in 2011, members went
Beyond the Hour to commit to lasting action for the planet; and
Whereas, as in years past, during
Earth Hour 2012, iconic buildings
and landmarks from Asia Pacific to

338

March 21, 2012
Europe and Africa to the Americas
will be switched off; people across
the world from all walks of life will
turn off their lights and come
together in celebration and contemplation of the one thing we all have
in common – our planet; and
Whereas, in past years, landmarks
from around the world went dark
for
Earth
Hour,
including:

Broadway
Theater
Marquees; the Las Vegas Strip; United
Nations Headquarters; the Golden

Whereas,
municipalities, businesses and citizens should pledge to participate in

Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
local area municipalities, public and
