feet
of
a
Pedestrian
Retail

(f) Criteria for Conditional Uses.
The City Planning Commission shall
approve a Conditional Use application if it determines that the application meets the following criteria:
(1) In the case of a proposed residential, institutional or non-retail
office use, one (1) or more of the
following conditions apply:
A. The subject building space was
designed specifically for the type of
use proposed and, as such, occupancy by an allowed use is an unreasonable expectation;
B. Denial of the application for
occupancy by a conditional use
would result in a long- term vacancy of the subject property, as demonstrated by the applicant;
C. It has been determined that the
proposed use is needed in the immediate area and that suitable alternative locations are unavailable.
(2) In the case of a proposed off
street parking or loading area or
driveway, one (1) or both of the following conditions apply.
A. The size, shape or layout of the
subject property does not permit
placement of the parking, loading or
driveway in a more suitable location.
B. It has been demonstrated by
the applicant that placement of the
parking, loading or driveway in an
allowed location would jeopardize
the continued occupancy of the subject property by uses suited to the
PRO District.
(3) In the case of a building
enclosed use that does not have an
entrance from the Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage, one (1) or both of
the following conditions apply:
A. The proposed use will occupy
an existing building that lacks such
pedestrian entrance, and the addition of a conforming pedestrian
entrance is made infeasible by the
configuration of the interior space
or other factors related to the
design and placement of the building.
B. Placement of the pedestrian
entrance in a location other than on
the
Pedestrian
Retail
Street
Frontage will result in more suitable pedestrian access.
(4) In the case of a proposed use
with more than forty (40) feet of
frontage along the Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage, the subject space
was designed for use at such size
and the proposed use, in the determination of the City Planning Commission,
will
not
have
adverse
impacts on the functioning of nearby pedestrian-oriented retail uses.
(5) In the case of an interior side

be occupied by residential units
which require the greater side yard
area to allow for desirable levels of

building on a lot abutting a Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage shall be
set back more than five (5) feet

The City Record
Frontage unless the City Planning
Commission has approved establishment of a surface parking lot in
such location as a Conditional Use.
Such building features as entrances
and display windows may be set

feet as long as these features occupy no more than fifty percent (50%)
of the building’s total frontage.
These setback regulations shall not
apply to portions of buildings above
the first-story level.
(2) Interior Side Yard. No portion
of an interior side yard located within forty (40) feet of a Pedestrian
Retail Street Frontage shall exceed
four (4) feet in width on the ground
floor level, unless the City Planning
Commission has approved a driveway or a residential side yard in
such location as a Conditional Use.
(3) Exceptions for Outdoor Cafes.
A building may be set back a maximum of fifteen (15) feet from the
Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage in
order to accommodate a permanent
outdoor café. If use of such café is
discontinued for a period of two (2)
years or more, the setback area
shall be landscaped or otherwise
improved in accordance with a plan
approved by the City Planning Commission.
(h) Window Areas. For any nonresidential building or storefront

(33%) for retail business uses in the

The Board of Zoning

requirements where it has been
demonstrated that additional parking is available in common or
shared parking facilities or in onstreet parking areas located within
a reasonable walking distance of
the use, given the nature of the use
and the district.
The Board shall
also consider factors as the number
of bicycle racks available in proximity to a use. In making its determination, the Board shall be guided
by an up-to-date analysis of parking
supply and demand and other relevant factors submitted by or on
behalf of the applicant.
The City
Planning Commission shall maintain a file of all such parking analyses submitted for properties in each
PRO District.
(j) Signs in the Public Street
Right-of-Way. An ordinance to map
a PRO District in a particular location may include permission to place
private signs in the public street
right-of-way under the regulations
of Chapter 512 of the Codified Ordinances.
Such provision shall be
included in the PRO designation
only if it is determined, on the basis
of a survey and analysis conducted
by the City Planning Commission,

1874

November 28, 2012
that the particular PRO District is
characterized by a preponderance of
restaurants and small independent
stores for which signs placed near
the street curb would provide useful
information to pedestrians seeking
goods
and
services
and
would
enhance
the
pedestrian-oriented
image of the district. Any PRO District designated for display of signs
in the street right-of- way shall be
shown on the Zoning Map as a
“PRO-S” District, with “S” noting the
presence of special sign provisions.
No sign permitted by these provisions shall be displayed without
design approval of the sign’s structure and permanent elements by the
City Planning Commission, or where
applicable, by the Landmarks Commission.
