ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 11-12.
By Mayor Jackson and Council
Members Kelley, Sweeney, Polensek,
Cleveland,
Brancatelli,
Keane,
Mitchell, Westbrook and Brady.
An emergency resolution urging
Ohio United States Senators and Ohio
United States Representatives to
introduce and support legislation
which enacts the provisions of the
U.S. Conference of Mayors’ Resolution
No. 43 regarding the United States
Environmental Protection Agency’s
enforcement policies of the Clean
Water Act.
Whereas, due to the growing need
to clean up America’s waterways, The
Clean Water Act (“CWA”) was enacted in 1972 as the principal law governing pollution of surface waters in
the United States; and
Whereas, this legislation, among
other things, outlined ambitious
goals to improve water quality; and
Whereas, 40 years later, our cities
and our nation have made great
progress in cleaning up our waterways, and Ohio members of the U.S.
Conference of Mayors (“Conference of
Mayors”) acknowledge that more
needs to be done; and

January 18, 2012
Whereas, the United States Environmental
Protection
Agency
(“USEPA”) is the regulatory agency
of the CWA and works to assure compliance with the CWA; and
Whereas, however, USEPA’s current enforcement policies have resulted in various stages of vigorous
enforcement actions that result in
consent decrees creating billions of
dollars in long-term liabilities to our
cities; and
Whereas, these liabilities now
translate into customer utility rates
that are burdensome for poor households, and impose greater costs on our
middle class families who have
experienced
real
wage
already
decline over the past decade; and
Whereas, additionally, the USEPA
continues to, or plans to, issue other
water and wastewater/stormwater
mandates that will force Ohio cities
into yet more long-term borrowing
that is unaffordable in light of substantially reduced local government
revenue shortfalls and reductions in
state and federal financial assistance; and
Whereas, at its June 2011 meeting,
the Conference of Mayors adopted
Resolution 43 to highlight these problems and also to offer a set of very
practical solutions that still meets the
goals and objectives of the CWA, but
changes the policies guiding the
USEPA’s enforcement actions (“Resolution 43”); and
Whereas, over 20 Ohio cities, sewer
districts, and professional associations, which represent millions of
Ohio residents, have already adopted
resolutions endorsing Resolution 43
and have urged their Congressional
legislature to introduce and support
legislation to enact the provisions of
Resolution 43; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of
the public peace, property, health, and
safety in that this Council supports
Resolution 43 and strongly urges our
Ohio United States Senators and Ohio
United States Representatives to
introduce and support legislation
which enacts the provisions of Resolution No. 43 to identify alternatives
to the current enforcement policies of
the USEPA while still meeting the
goals and objectives of the CWA;
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio United States Senators and
Ohio United States Representatives to
introduce and support legislation
which enacts the provisions of the
Conference of Mayors’ Resolution 43
regarding the USEPA’s enforcement
policies of the CWA. A copy of Resolution 43 has been placed in File No.
11-12-A.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
resolution and file to Ohio United
States Senators Sherrod Brown and
Rob Portman and to all Ohio United
States Representatives.
Section 3. That this resolution is
declared to be an emergency measure
and, provided it receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take
effect and be in force immediately
upon its adoption and approval by the
Mayor; otherwise it shall take effect
and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.
