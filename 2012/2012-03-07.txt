Res. No. 219-12.
By Council Members Westbrook,
Pruitt, Brancatelli, Dow, Cleveland,
Brady, Keane, Zone, J. Johnson,
Mitchell, Polensek, Cummins, Miller,
Kelley, Sweeney and K. Johnson.
An emergency resolution urging
the United States Congress to reconsider our national priorities, reduce
military spending, and redirect our
federal tax dollars to fund urgently
needed deficit reduction and City
and State domestic services.
Whereas, the United States is
engaged in a serious crisis and
debate about our national priorities,
international role, national debt, and
government spending; and
Whereas, Cleveland and Ohio have
been adversely affected by budget
cuts, deficit reduction, and are facing serious financial shortfalls in
the current recession with domestic
spending being the hardest hit, and
Cleveland has been forced to cut
essential services and personnel;
and
Whereas, Cleveland’s taxpayers,

254

March 7, 2012
even in this time of economic crisis
and fiscal austerity, are posed to
pay $518.4 million this coming year
as their share of the military budget of the United States; and
Whereas, for a similar amount of
money, all of the following could be
provided:
• 25,188 children receiving lowincome healthcare for one year, and
8016 people receiving low-income
healthcare for one year;
• 696 elementary school teachers
for one year, and 6844 Head Start slots
for children for one year;
• 20,550 households with solar photovoltaic electricity for one year, and
43,156 households with wind-power
electricity for one year;
• 5847 military veterans receiving
VA medical care for one year;
• 702 police and sheriff’s patrol
officers for one year, and 890 firefighters for one year; and
• 5430 scholarships for university
students for one year, and 8491 students receiving Pell Grants of $5550.
Whereas, U.S. troops, including
those from Cleveland and other
cities and towns across Ohio have
served
valiantly
in
Iraq
and
Afghanistan, and our troops have
made the ultimate sacrifice with
over 4,400 U.S. troops having been
killed in Iraq and over 1,140 U.S.
troops
having
been
killed
in
Afghanistan; over 39,000 U.S. troops
have been wounded in both conflicts
according to the Department of
Defense;
and
Whereas, the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan have become controversial with the American public; and
Whereas, overall military spending is in excess of what is actually
needed
to
defend
our
country,
including the military budget of
now $670 billion per year, more than
700 United States military bases
overseas, plans to spend $185 billion
to expand and modernize the U.S.
nuclear weapons complex, weapons
systems the Pentagon doesn’t need,
and scores of other unnecessary
Pentagon programs; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
urges U.S. Senator Brown, U.S. Senator Portman, U.S. Representative
Fudge,
and
U.S.
Representative
Kucinich to oppose further funding
of the war Afghanistan and urge
them to take leadership in the Congress to bring our troops safely
home, substantially reduce overall
military spending, and redirect our
federal tax dollars to the pressing
educational,
employment,
health,
housing, nutritional, infrastructure,
energy, and environmental needs of
our city, state, and country; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
supports public discussion and dialogue about the cost of military
spending to our community, and this
Council supports a more balanced
approach to military spending and
priority-setting by the Federal government; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
calls on Congress members Fudge,
Kucinich, Brown and Portman to
support federal funding for the over
2 million new Iraq and Afghanistan
war veterans – particularly the thousands who have come home disabled
or otherwise physically or mentally
wounded – to ensure they receive
health care, housing, jobs, education
and other support services they
deserve; and
Whereas, this resolution consti-

March 7, 2012
tutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Cleveland City Council
urges the United States Congress to
reconsider our national priorities,
reduce military spending, and redirect our federal tax dollars to fund
urgently needed deficit reduction
and City and State domestic services.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit copies
of this resolution to the United States
Congress, U.S. Senator Brown, U.S.
Senator Portman, U.S. Representative
Fudge, and U.S. Representative
Kucinich.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from

by law.
