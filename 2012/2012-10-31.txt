Res. No. 1557-12.
By Council Member Conwell.
An emergency resolution requesting the Ohio General Assembly to
make physical assault on public transit workers a felony under Ohio law.
Whereas, recently a bus driver for
the Regional Transit Authority in
Cleveland was the subject of an
assault by a passenger; and
Whereas, bus drivers and all transit
workers are at greater risk of
assaults, verbal abuse and other
injuries due to the intimate nature of
their work with the general public;
and
Whereas, other states have laws
that provide specific penalties for
harming public transportation workers; and
Whereas, in order to better protect
our public transportation workers
while on the job, the state of Ohio
should adopt a law specifically making assault on a public transportation
worker a felony; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,

Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

cited in this division.

loan lender or mortgage loan lender
shall be established on a lot or lots
within 1,000 feet of another lot or lots
containing an existing check-cashing
business, short-term loan lender,
small loan lender or mortgage loan
lender. No two check-cashing businesses, short-term loan lenders, small
loan lenders or mortgage loan
lenders, in any combination, shall be
located in the same building or on the
same lot.
(d) Maximum Number. There shall
be no more than one check-cashing
business, short-term loan lender,
small loan lender or mortgage loan
lender located within the City of
Cleveland for each 20,000 persons
residing in the City as recorded in the
most recent decennial U.S. Census. No
additional check-cashing businesses,
short-term loan lenders, small loan
lenders or mortgage loan lenders
shall be established if the current
number of check-cashing businesses,
