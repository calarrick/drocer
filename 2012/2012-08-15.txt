Whereas, Council has been notified
by the Department of Liquor Control

ownership of a C1 Liquor Permit from
Poni, Inc., DBA The Outlet Store,
12029 Lorain Avenue, 1st floor and
basement, Cleveland, Ohio 44111, Permanent Number 70111610005 to Lalitaambika, Inc., DBA The Outlet Store,
12029 Lorain Avenue, 1st floor and
basement, Cleveland, Ohio 44111, Permanent Number 4986593; and
Whereas, the granting of this application for a liquor permit to this high
crime area, which is already saturated with other liquor outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire
community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard of
the laws, regulations or local ordinances of this state or any other state;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed to
the building, safety or health requirements of the governing body of this
County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or constructed that law enforcement officers or agents of the Department of
Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based on
other legal grounds as set forth in
Revised Code Section 4303.292; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of
the public peace, prosperity, safety
and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby record its objection to the transfer of ownership of a C1 Liquor Permit from Poni, Inc., DBA The Outlet Store, 12029 Lorain Avenue, 1st

An emergency resolution calling
upon the Cuyahoga County Council
and County Executive Ed FitzGerald
to research upgrading the current 9-11 emergency system to a “Next Generation 9-1-1 System” that includes new
technology such as text messaging,
video and picture images.
Whereas, the current 9-1-1 system in
the United States is based on decadesold technology that cannot handle the
text, data, images and video that are
increasingly common today; and
Whereas, the limitations of the current 9-1-1 system mean that each introduction of a new access technology,
for example, wireless phones, or
expansion
of
system
functions,
requires significant engineering and
system modifications; and
Whereas, the nation’s current 9-1-1
system is “an analog technology in an
overwhelmingly digital world”; and
Whereas, the U.S Department of
Transportation believes that a fundamental reexamination of the technological approach to 9-1-1 is essential
as the nation’s public safety emergency service networks struggle to
accommodate the challenges of wireless communications and digital services; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby calls upon the Cuyahoga County
Council and County Executive Ed
FitzGerald to research upgrading
the current 9-1-1 emergency system
to a “Next Generation 9-1-1 System”
that includes new technology such
as text messaging, video and picture
images.
Section 2. That the Clerk is directed
to forward copies of this resolution to
all members of the Cuyahoga County
Council and to County Executive Ed
FitzGerald.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it

its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from

An emergency resolution cautioning and educating the public on the
upcoming Nathanial “Than” Merrill
“Find and Flip Real Estate Seminar”
that could leave buyers of properties
with thousands of dollars in back
taxes, assessments and other fees.
Whereas, a flurry of ads on local
radio in Cleveland promise to teach
the public how to quickly flip homes
for profit from experts of HGTV’s
“Flip this House”, but Cleveland City
Council and other community leaders
caution the public if it sounds too
good to be true, it is; and  
Whereas, house flipping is not a get
rich overnight investment, and it
could end up costing the purchaser
tens of thousands of dollars and possible jail time; and
Whereas, the Nathanial “Than”
Merrill “Find and Flip Real Estate
Seminar” will take place at hotels
across Northeast Ohio during the
week of August 5th and uses the popularity of HGTV’s “Flip this House,”
along with the promise of making
$10,000-$40,000 per deal, as an enticing
draw with no money down and no
credit; and
Whereas, the free seminar claims to
teach the public the secret to making
money by flipping homes, but typically require fees for further training,
often $1,500 or more per session;
dozens of complaints have been filed
with Better Business Bureaus and
government offices across the country; and
Whereas, four such events are
scheduled for Greater Cleveland

The City Record
alone at the Marriot East on August
8th, the Marriot Airport on August
9th, the Hilton Garden Inn Mayfield
Village on August 10th, and the DoubleTree Hotel in Independence on
August 11th; and
Whereas, “We as a city are not out
of the woods yet when it comes to navigating the issues of home foreclosures, abandoned properties and companies preying on unsuspecting consumers to make a quick buck,” said
Council Member Brancatelli; “It is
upsetting to my colleagues and
myself that so many radio stations
have agreed to air this advertisement
fully knowing the fragile condition
our neighborhoods are in, and unsuspecting buyers could end up with
properties that are well beyond
repair, or have already been condemned”; and
Whereas, while house flipping and
real estate can be a profitable business venture, it takes an informed
and knowledgeable professional to
research, buy, renovate, market and
sell a home, and Cleveland City Council wants prospective house buyers
and flippers to be aware of the legal
and financial responsibilities that
comes with taking title and ownership of a property; and
Whereas, sellers of properties may
not always be honest or knowledgeable about the home’s condition and
various liens or other financial
responsibilities; furthermore, many
unsuspecting investors acquire property through a quiet claim with specific language that the buyer is
responsible for municipal fees and
assessments; and
Whereas, if you purchase a home in
Cleveland, you may be responsible for
the following: any past-due taxes on
the property; back water fees; back
city assessment fees (board ups, lot
cutting, etc.); repairing all code violations on the property; pending legal
actions against the property; and if
the property is condemned, the owner
is responsible for demolition costs
including attorney’s fees, costs of
inspection, administrative and support staff, property maintenance
costs, court costs, title search feed,
process server fees, skip tracing, discovery and deposition expenses; and
Whereas, , “As a city we value those
who have an entrepreneurial spirit,
and some residents have been successful in recent years with starting a
business on their own, and Cleveland
is benefiting from this,” said Council
Member Westbrook; “What we do not
want to see is our residents tricked
into believing you can make money
overnight in buying, fixing and selling property; the real estate market is
a difficult one to succeed in and it will
take more than a brief workshop to
make you an expert on the nuances it
takes to succeed;” and
Whereas, the foreclosure and housing crisis has greatly affected the city
of Cleveland and Cuyahoga County,
with more than 10,000 abandoned or
unfit homes in the city need to be
demolished or significantly invested
in; the city alone has spent $30 million
to date on demolitions; and
Whereas, the combined impact of
the housing market crash and economic downturn on Cuyahoga County
is $1.5 billion is loss of value, making
it very difficult for sellers to make a
profit on property sales; and
Whereas, the city has taken on the
following number of initiatives, programs and legal actions to help stabi-

1267

41
lize neighborhoods, transform our
communities, and hold parties responsible:
Codified Ordinance Sections 3103.09
and 367.08 allow the city to recover
costs of demolition of condemned
structures from any and all owners
jointly from the time of the notice of
condemnation to the demolition;
Under Codified Ordinance Sections
3103.092 and 367.13, anyone buying,
owning, selling or transferring real
property in Cleveland must register
and identify a statutory agent with
the Ohio Secretary of State.  Ord. 20467: No person shall knowingly misrepresent the legal occupancy of a
dwelling, building or structure as an
inducement for the sale of such property;
Certificate of disclosure is required
at sale under Codified Ordinance Section 367.112 and 367.113; and
Rental registration is required
upon ownership under Codified Ordinance Sections 365.01, 365.02, and
365.05; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
encourages anyone with questions
about property they are interested in
purchasing to call a local licensed
real estate agent or their local community development corporation; and
Whereas, unless an individual is an
experienced investor, they should ask
for a warranty deed from a reputable
title company; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Cautioning and educating the public on the upcoming
Nathanial “Than” Merrill “Find and
Flip Real Estate Seminar” that
could leave buyers of properties
with thousands of dollars in back
taxes, assessments and other fees.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit copies
of this resolution to the Better Business Bureau, the Real Estate Board,
Mike DeWine, Ohio Attorney General,
William Mason and Timothy McGinty, Cuyahoga County Prosecutor, and
the Mortgage Fraud Task Force.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon

An emergency resolution objecting

Whereas, Council has been notified
by the Department of Liquor Control

Poni, Inc., DBA The Outlet Store,
12029 Lorain Avenue, 1st floor and
basement, Cleveland, Ohio 44111, Permanent Number 70111610005 to Lalitaambika, Inc., DBA The Outlet Store,
12029 Lorain Avenue, 1st floor and
basement, Cleveland, Ohio 44111, Permanent Number 4986593; and
Whereas, the granting of this application for a liquor permit to this high
crime area, which is already saturated with other liquor outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire
community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard of
the laws, regulations or local ordinances of this state or any other state;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed to
the building, safety or health requirements of the governing body of this
County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or constructed that law enforcement officers or agents of the Department of
Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based on
other legal grounds as set forth in
Revised Code Section 4303.292; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of
the public peace, prosperity, safety
and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.

1286

August 15, 2012
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby record its objection to the transfer of ownership of a C1 Liquor Permit from Poni, Inc., DBA The Outlet Store, 12029 Lorain Avenue, 1st
floor and basement, Cleveland, Ohio
44111,
Permanent
Number
70111610005 to Lalitaambika, Inc.,
DBA The Outlet Store, 12029 Lorain
Avenue, 1st floor and basement,
Cleveland, Ohio 44111, Permanent
Number 4986593; and requests the
Director of Liquor Control to set a
hearing for said application in
accordance with provisions of Section 4303.26 of the Revised Code of

Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
be and she is hereby directed to transmit two certified copies of this resolution, together with two copies of a letter of objection and two copies of a
letter requesting that the hearing be
held in Cleveland, Cuyahoga County.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it

Adopted August 8, 2012.
Effective August 16, 2012.

Res. No. 1022-12.
By Council Member Conwell.
An emergency resolution calling
upon the Cuyahoga County Council
and County Executive Ed FitzGerald
to research upgrading the current 9-11 emergency system to a “Next Generation 9-1-1 System” that includes new
technology such as text messaging,
video and picture images.
Whereas, the current 9-1-1 system in
the United States is based on decadesold technology that cannot handle the
text, data, images and video that are
increasingly common today; and
Whereas, the limitations of the current 9-1-1 system mean that each introduction of a new access technology,
for example, wireless phones, or
expansion
of
system
functions,
requires significant engineering and
system modifications; and
Whereas, the nation’s current 9-1-1
system is “an analog technology in an
overwhelmingly digital world”; and
Whereas, the U.S Department of
Transportation believes that a fundamental reexamination of the technological approach to 9-1-1 is essential
as the nation’s public safety emergency service networks struggle to
accommodate the challenges of wireless communications and digital services; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby calls upon the Cuyahoga County
Council and County Executive Ed
FitzGerald to research upgrading
the current 9-1-1 emergency system

August 15, 2012
to a “Next Generation 9-1-1 System”
that includes new technology such
as text messaging, video and picture
images.
Section 2. That the Clerk is directed
to forward copies of this resolution to
all members of the Cuyahoga County
Council and to County Executive Ed
FitzGerald.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.

An emergency resolution cautioning and educating the public on the
upcoming Nathanial “Than” Merrill
“Find and Flip Real Estate Seminar”
that could leave buyers of properties
with thousands of dollars in back
taxes, assessments and other fees.
Whereas, a flurry of ads on local
radio in Cleveland promise to teach
the public how to quickly flip homes
for profit from experts of HGTV’s
“Flip this House”, but Cleveland City
Council and other community leaders
caution the public if it sounds too
good to be true, it is; and  
Whereas, house flipping is not a get
rich overnight investment, and it
could end up costing the purchaser
tens of thousands of dollars and possible jail time; and
Whereas, the Nathanial “Than”
Merrill “Find and Flip Real Estate
Seminar” will take place at hotels
across Northeast Ohio during the
week of August 5th and uses the popularity of HGTV’s “Flip this House,”
along with the promise of making
$10,000-$40,000 per deal, as an enticing
draw with no money down and no
credit; and
Whereas, the free seminar claims to
teach the public the secret to making
money by flipping homes, but typically require fees for further training,
often $1,500 or more per session;
dozens of complaints have been filed
with Better Business Bureaus and
government offices across the country; and
Whereas, four such events are
scheduled for Greater Cleveland
alone at the Marriot East on August
8th, the Marriot Airport on August
9th, the Hilton Garden Inn Mayfield
Village on August 10th, and the DoubleTree Hotel in Independence on
August 11th; and
Whereas, “We as a city are not out
of the woods yet when it comes to navigating the issues of home foreclosures, abandoned properties and companies preying on unsuspecting consumers to make a quick buck,” said

1298

August 15, 2012
Council Member Brancatelli; “It is
upsetting to my colleagues and
myself that so many radio stations
have agreed to air this advertisement
fully knowing the fragile condition
our neighborhoods are in, and unsuspecting buyers could end up with
properties that are well beyond
repair, or have already been condemned”; and
Whereas, while house flipping and
real estate can be a profitable business venture, it takes an informed
and knowledgeable professional to
research, buy, renovate, market and
sell a home, and Cleveland City Council wants prospective house buyers
and flippers to be aware of the legal
and financial responsibilities that
comes with taking title and ownership of a property; and
Whereas, sellers of properties may
not always be honest or knowledgeable about the home’s condition and
various liens or other financial
responsibilities; furthermore, many
unsuspecting investors acquire property through a quiet claim with specific language that the buyer is
responsible for municipal fees and
assessments; and
Whereas, if you purchase a home in
Cleveland, you may be responsible for
the following: any past-due taxes on
the property; back water fees; back
city assessment fees (board ups, lot
cutting, etc.); repairing all code violations on the property; pending legal
actions against the property; and if
the property is condemned, the owner
is responsible for demolition costs
including attorney’s fees, costs of
inspection, administrative and support staff, property maintenance
costs, court costs, title search feed,
process server fees, skip tracing, discovery and deposition expenses; and
Whereas, , “As a city we value those
who have an entrepreneurial spirit,
and some residents have been successful in recent years with starting a
business on their own, and Cleveland
is benefiting from this,” said Council
Member Westbrook; “What we do not
want to see is our residents tricked
into believing you can make money
overnight in buying, fixing and selling property; the real estate market is
a difficult one to succeed in and it will
take more than a brief workshop to
make you an expert on the nuances it
takes to succeed;” and
Whereas, the foreclosure and housing crisis has greatly affected the city
of Cleveland and Cuyahoga County,
with more than 10,000 abandoned or
unfit homes in the city need to be
demolished or significantly invested
in; the city alone has spent $30 million
to date on demolitions; and
Whereas, the combined impact of
the housing market crash and economic downturn on Cuyahoga County
is $1.5 billion is loss of value, making
it very difficult for sellers to make a
profit on property sales; and
Whereas, the city has taken on the
following number of initiatives, programs and legal actions to help stabilize neighborhoods, transform our
communities, and hold parties responsible:
Codified Ordinance Sections 3103.09
and 367.08 allow the city to recover
costs of demolition of condemned
structures from any and all owners
jointly from the time of the notice of
condemnation to the demolition;
Under Codified Ordinance Sections
3103.092 and 367.13, anyone buying,
owning, selling or transferring real

August 15, 2012
property in Cleveland must register
and identify a statutory agent with
the Ohio Secretary of State.  Ord. 20467: No person shall knowingly misrepresent the legal occupancy of a
dwelling, building or structure as an
inducement for the sale of such property;
Certificate of disclosure is required
at sale under Codified Ordinance Section 367.112 and 367.113; and
Rental registration is required
upon ownership under Codified Ordinance Sections 365.01, 365.02, and
365.05; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
encourages anyone with questions
about property they are interested in
purchasing to call a local licensed
real estate agent or their local community development corporation; and
Whereas, unless an individual is an
experienced investor, they should ask
for a warranty deed from a reputable
title company; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Cautioning and educating the public on the upcoming
Nathanial “Than” Merrill “Find and
Flip Real Estate Seminar” that
could leave buyers of properties
with thousands of dollars in back
taxes, assessments and other fees.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit copies
of this resolution to the Better Business Bureau, the Real Estate Board,
Mike DeWine, Ohio Attorney General,
William Mason and Timothy McGinty, Cuyahoga County Prosecutor, and
the Mortgage Fraud Task Force.

a basis subordinate to the Bonds, to
provide interim financing for certain
improvements to the Utility; and
Whereas, pursuant to Ordinance No.
1360-10 passed by this Council on
November  8, 2010 (the “Refunding
Ordinance”), this Council authorized
the City to issue Refunding Bonds in
one or more Series for the purpose of
refunding one or more Series of Outstanding Revenue Bonds, or designated portions thereof, and to issue Subordinated Refunding Notes in one or
more Series for the purpose of making
provision for payment of Outstanding
Subordinated Notes when due or upon
prior redemption, all as defined in the
Refunding Ordinance; and
Whereas, this Council has determined to authorize the issuance by
the City of additional Bonds under the
Indenture for the purpose of (i) paying costs of improvements to the Utility, and (ii) refunding Outstanding

1312

August 15, 2012
Subordinated Notes, and has further
determined to authorize the issuance
of Subordinate Lien Bonds for those
same purposes and to provide for the
securing of Subordinate Lien Bonds
on a basis subordinate to the Bonds,
all as defined and provided in this
Ordinance; and
Whereas, this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of a
municipal department and providing
for the immediate preservation of
public peace, property, health or safety, in that authorizing the issuance
and sale of obligations to pay for
improvements to the Utility is
required
to
fund
contracts
for
improvements needed to provide for
the continued operation of the Utility
and thereby provide for the usual
daily operation of a municipal department, and in that authorizing the
issuance and sale of obligations to
refund the Outstanding Subordinated
Notes is necessary to enable the City
to fund the retirement of the Outstanding Subordinated Notes on a
timely basis and in a manner advantageous to the City under current market conditions; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:

“Bond Purchase Agreement” means
one or more purchase agreements
between the City and the Original

Lien Bonds are Bonds under the
Indenture.
“Certificate of Award” means one or

Section 2. Authorization of the 2012
Bonds. This Council finds and determines it is necessary and proper and
in the best interest of the City to issue
the 2012 Bonds for the purpose of paying costs of improvements to the Utility and refunding the Outstanding
Subordinated Notes. The 2012 Bonds
may be issued in one or more Series,
any or all of which may be 2012 Senior
Lien Bonds or 2012 Subordinate Lien
Bonds, and the use of the term
“Series” with reference to 2012 Subordinate Lien Bonds shall not imply or
be interpreted to mean that the referenced 2012 Subordinate Lien Bonds
are Bonds under the Indenture. The
principal amount of each Series of
2012 Bonds is to be the amount set
forth in the Certificate of Award
authorized in Section 3 and determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, to be necessary (i)
to pay costs of improvements to the
Utility and to pay interest on the 2012
Bonds issued for that purpose during
the construction of those improvements, (ii) to refund the Outstanding
Subordinated Notes, (iii) to fund any
deposit to the Debt Service Reserve
Fund required under the Indenture or
any special reserve fund for that
Series separate from the Debt Service
Reserve Fund (provided that funds
for deposit to any debt service reserve

The City Record
fund or similar fund for 2012 Subordinate Lien Bonds shall not be derived
from proceeds of 2012 Senior Lien
Bonds), (iv) to pay costs of any Credit Support Instruments, (v) to pay any
amounts owed under Hedge Agreements, and (vi) to pay costs of issuing
the 2012 Bonds and refunding the Outstanding Subordinated Notes. The
aggregate principal amount of 2012
Bonds of all Series issued for the purpose of paying costs of improvements
and any related costs under clauses
(iii) through (vi) of the preceding
sentence shall not exceed $155,000,000
and the aggregate principal amount
of 2012 Bonds issued for the purpose
of refunding the Outstanding Subordinated Notes and any related costs
under clauses (iii) through (vi) of the
preceding sentence shall not exceed
$56,000,000. The proceeds from the
sale of each Series of 2012 Bonds shall
be allocated, deposited and applied as
provided in Section 4 of this Ordinance.
If the 2012 Bonds are issued in more
than one Series, the 2012 Bonds of
each Series shall satisfy the requirements of this Ordinance, and each
Series shall bear a distinctive designation, indicating, among other
things, whether the 2012 Bonds of that
Series are 2012 Senior Lien Bonds or
2012 Subordinate Lien Bonds. Separate Series of 2012 Bonds may be
issued at the same or different times.
The 2012 Bonds of each Series shall be
designated as provided in the applicable Certificate of Award. A separate
Certificate of Award may be delivered for each Series. A separate Supplemental Indenture may be delivered for each Series of 2012 Senior
Lien Bonds, and a separate Subordinate Lien Bonds Security Agreement
may be delivered for each Series of
2012 Subordinate Lien Bonds.
In the event that the Director of
Finance, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, determines
that the City’s best interests will be
served by causing a Series of 2012
Bonds to be obligations bearing interest at variable interest rates, then the
Director of Finance is authorized to
so specify in the Certificate of Award
for that Series. If the Director of
Finance so determines, then the
method and procedure by which the
variable rate of interest to be borne
by the 2012 Bonds of that Series shall
be determined as provided in the
applicable Supplemental Indenture in
the case of 2012 Senior Lien Bonds or
in the applicable Subordinate Lien
Security Agreement in the case of
2012 Subordinate Lien Bonds, whether
by reference to a market index, by a
remarketing agent or otherwise; provided that no Series of 2012 Bonds
shall bear interest at a rate in excess
of sixteen percent (16%) per year.
Notwithstanding that limitation, a
Series of 2012 Bonds held by a
provider of a Credit Support Instrument may bear interest at a rate not
in excess of twenty-five percent
(25%) per year as provided in the
agreement with the provider of the
Credit Support Instrument. The Director of Finance may determine that the
terms of a variable rate Series of 2012
Bonds may or may not permit the
Holders to tender their variable rate
2012 Bonds for purchase by the City.
If the Director of Finance designates
any Series of 2012 Bonds as variable
rate 2012 Bonds, and if the Holders of
that Series of 2012 Bonds are to be
entitled to tender those 2012 Bonds for

1313

87
purchase, then the Director of
Finance shall also designate in the
Certificate of Award for those variable rate 2012 Bonds, the tender agent
or agents and the remarketing agent
or agents, which designations shall
be based on the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
that the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed to
provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable. The Director of Finance is authorized to enter
into agreements in connection with
the delivery of the 2012 Bonds, and
from time to time thereafter so long
as the variable rate 2012 Bonds are
outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support Instruments, tender agents
(which may be the Trustee), remarketing agents (which may be any of
the Original Purchasers), purchasers
of tendered 2012 Bonds, and others as
may be determined by the Director of
Finance, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, to be necessary or appropriate to provide for (i)
the method of determining the variable interest rates, (ii) the rights and
procedures for tender, (iii) liquidity
or credit support, (iv) repayment by
the City of any amounts drawn under
the Credit Support Instrument, (v)
the direct purchase of tendered 2012
Bonds, and (vi) other arrangements
in the best interests of the City. The
Director of Finance is further authorized to terminate any such agreements if the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the City’s best interests will be served
by such termination. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to enter
into agreements, from time to time so
long as the variable rate 2012 Bonds
are outstanding, supplementing or
amending the applicable Supplemental Indenture or Subordinate Lien
Bonds Security Agreement for a
Series of 2012 Bonds as provided in
Section 6. The Director of Finance is
authorized to pay any fees associated
with agreements entered into or terminated pursuant to this Section from
proceeds of 2012 Bonds, to the extent
permitted by the Indenture, and from
the Net Revenues of the Utility.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of any
Series of 2012 Bonds, and regardless
of whether that Series of 2012 Bonds
bears interest at variable or fixed
rates, is authorized to contract for a
Credit Support Instrument, and to pay
the costs of it from proceeds of the
2012 Bonds, if the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the Credit Support Instrument will
result in a savings in the cost of the
financing to the City.
Section 3. Award and Sale of 2012
Bonds. The Director of Finance shall
sign and deliver a Certificate of
Award for the 2012 Bonds. In the
event the 2012 Bonds are issued in
more than one Series, a separate Certificate of Award shall be signed and
delivered for each separately delivered Series. The sale of each Series of
2012 Bonds shall be awarded to the
Original Purchasers selected by the
Director of Finance, based on an evaluation of the qualifications of firms
that have proposed to underwrite the
2012 Bonds. The Original Purchasers

88
so selected shall be identified in the
Certificate of Award. The 2012 Bonds
shall be sold to the Original Purchasers pursuant to a Bond Purchase
Agreement; provided, however, that if
the Certificate of Award applicable to
any Series specifies that the 2012
Bonds of that Series are to be sold
through a private or direct placement,
rather than through an underwritten
public offering, then the Bond Purchase Agreement applicable to that
Series shall contain such provisions
as the officer signing the Bond Purchase Agreement on behalf of the
City determines are appropriate to
reflect that manner of sale and are
not inconsistent with the Indenture or
the Subordinate Lien Bonds Security
Agreement, as the case may be, or this
Ordinance and not substantially
adverse to the City. The Certificate of
Award for the 2012 Bonds of each
Series shall specify whether the 2012
Bonds of that Series are to be 2012
Senior Lien Bonds or 2012 Subordinate
Lien Bonds and shall set forth the
final terms of the applicable Series of
2012 Bonds determined by the Director of Finance, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor and
consistent with this Ordinance and
the Indenture, including the following:
(a) the aggregate principal amount
of the 2012 Bonds issued, provided
that the aggregate principal amount
of all 2012 Bonds shall not exceed the
limits specified in Section 2, assuming
that the 2012 Bonds are to be initially
offered to the public at a price at least
equal to their aggregate principal
amount, but if any of the 2012 Bonds
are to be initially offered to the public
at an original issue discount, the maximum aggregate principal amount of
2012 Bonds shall be increased over
those specified maximum amounts by
an amount equal to the aggregate
original issue discount net of the
aggregate original issue premium;
(b) the date or dates of the 2012
Bonds;
(c) the purchase price to be paid to
the City by the Original Purchasers,
which amount shall be not less than:
(i) 97% of the amount determined by
subtracting from the aggregate principal amount of the 2012 Bonds any
aggregate original issue discount net
of any aggregate original issue premium with respect to the 2012 Bonds,
plus (ii) any accrued interest on the
2012 Bonds from their date to the date
of their delivery to the Original Purchasers;
(d) whether any 2012 Bonds are
subject to optional redemption prior
to maturity, the earliest optional
redemption date for those 2012 Bonds
subject to prior redemption, which
shall be not later than ten years from
the first interest payment date of the
applicable Series, and the applicable
redemption price, which shall be not
greater than 102% of the principal
amount redeemed;
(e) the dates on which and amounts
in which principal of the 2012 Bonds is
to be paid, which shall be not later
than forty (40) years from their
respective dates of issuance, with an
identification of whether the payment is due by stated maturity or by
mandatory sinking fund redemption
of 2012 Bonds of a particular maturity;
(f) the interest rates to be borne by
2012 Bonds bearing interest at a fixed
rate, the weighted average of which
shall not exceed six percent (6%) as

The City Record
to 2012 Bonds of any Series, or by the
method by which the interest rate is
to be determined for 2012 Bonds bearing interest at variable rates, consistent with Section 2. The 2012 Bonds of
the same Series and same maturity
may bear interest at different interest
rates;
(g) any deposit required to be made
to the Debt Service Reserve Fund or a
special reserve fund with respect to
2012 Senior Lien Bonds and any debt
service reserve fund or comparable
fund for 2012 Subordinate Lien Bonds;
(h) the title and Series designation
for the 2012 Bonds; and
(i) whether any 2012 Bonds are to
be secured by or payable from any
Credit Support Instruments.
It is determined that the terms of
the 2012 Bonds as so determined within the limitations set forth in this
Ordinance and as so specified and set
forth in the Certificate of Award will
be in the best interest of the City and
consistent with all legal requirements.
Section 4. Application of Proceeds
of 2012 Bonds. The proceeds of the
sale of the 2012 Bonds shall be
deposited as provided in the applicable Supplemental Indenture or Subordinate Lien Bonds Security Agreement, including:
(a) (i) to the Trustee, for deposit to

2012 Bonds;
(c) to the Trustee, for deposit to the
Subordinate Lien Debt Service Fund

Supplemental Indenture or in the Subordinate Lien Bonds Security Agreement for the creation of separate
accounts within the funds established
under the Indenture or the Subordinate Lien Bonds Security Agreement.
The proceeds from the sale of each
Series of 2012 Bonds are appropriated

which those 2012 Bonds are issued as
provided in this Ordinance.

Section 6. Authorization of Supplemental Indentures and Subordinate
Lien Bonds Security Agreements.
(a) Supplemental Indentures. In
order to secure the payment of the
principal of and any premium and
interest on the 2012 Senior Lien
Bonds, the Mayor, Director of Finance
and Director of Public Utilities, or
any two of them, are authorized and
directed, in the name and on behalf of
the City, to sign and deliver to the
Trustee, in trust for the Original Purchasers and subsequent holders of the
2012 Senior Lien Bonds, a Supplemental Indenture, approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, not inconsistent with this Ordinance, the Certificate of Award and
the Indenture and not substantially
adverse to the City as may be
approved by the officers signing the
same on behalf of the City. The determination by those officers that the
Supplemental Indenture is not substantially adverse to the City shall be
conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery of that Supplemental
Indenture by those officers. Subject to
the Indenture as theretofore amended, any Supplemental Indenture may
contain amendments to the Indenture,
as theretofore amended, or amend and
restate the Indenture, to permit the
City to obtain a Credit Support Instrument or to permit increased flexibility for the use of financial or credit
structures and techniques determined
by the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, to be in the best interests of
the City.
(b) Subordinate Lien Bonds Security Agreements. In order to secure the
payment of the principal of and any
premium and interest on the 2012 Subordinate Lien Bonds, the Mayor,
Director of Finance and Director of
Public Utilities, or any two of them,
are authorized and directed, in the
name and on behalf of the City, to
sign and deliver to the Trustee, in
trust for the Original Purchasers and
subsequent holders of the 2012 Subordinate Lien Bonds, the Subordinate
Lien Bonds Security Agreement,
approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, not inconsistent with this Ordinance, the Certifi-

The City Record
cate of Award and the Indenture and
not substantially adverse to the City
as may be approved by the officers
signing the same on behalf of the
City. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Subordinate Lien
Bonds Security Agreement shall in all
respects conform to the requirements
of the Indenture for the application,
deposit and disbursement of Revenues and moneys on deposit in the
Pledged Funds for the benefit and
protection of the holders of Bonds and
shall in no manner violate or interfere
with the exercise of remedies or the
enforcement of rights by the holders
of Bonds or by the Trustee on their
behalf under the Indenture. The
determination by those officers that
the Subordinate Lien Bonds Security
Agreement
is
not
substantially
adverse to the City and that it otherwise conforms to the authorization in
this paragraph shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing and delivery
of that Subordinate Lien Bond Security Agreement by those officers. Nothing in this Ordinance shall be interpreted to require that the Subordinate
Lien Bonds Security Agreement not
take the form of a Supplemental
Indenture.
Section 7. Rebate Fund. There is
hereby established and ordered to be
maintained one or more separate
accounts (except when invested as
provided in the Indenture) within the
Rebate Fund held in the custody of
the Trustee under the Indenture or
within a rebate fund established for
comparable purpose under the Subordinate Lien Bonds Security Agreement. The Rebate Fund is not pledged
to the payment of debt service and is
free and clear of any pledge or lien
given under the Indenture as security
for the 2012 Senior Lien Bonds or the
Outstanding Bonds or given under the
Subordinate Lien Bonds Security
Agreement as security for the 2012
Subordinate Lien Bonds or other Subordinate Lien Bonds that may be
issued thereunder. Calculations of
excess earnings that may be due and
payable to the federal government
pursuant to the Code and deposits to
those accounts of the Rebate Fund
shall be made as provided in the
applicable Supplemental Indenture or
the Subordinate Lien Bonds Security
Agreement.
Section 8. Remarketing. In the
event that the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that it
is advantageous to the City to convert
the interest on any variable rate 2012
Bonds to fixed interest rates for a
period of time or to maturity, or to
convert the interest on any 2012
Bonds to a different variable rate
period or mode, or to terminate or
take other actions with respect to any
Credit Support Instrument that will
require a tender and remarketing of
any 2012 Bonds under the Indenture
or the Subordinate Lien Bonds Security Agreement, as the case may be
(such conversion or other actions and
the tender and remarketing being collectively referred to in this Section as
“remarketing”), the City shall undertake the remarketing in accordance
therewith. In connection with any
remarketing of 2012 Bonds, the Director of Finance is authorized to take
such actions that she determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, will facilitate the
remarketing of the 2012 Bonds or otherwise be in the best interests of the

1315

89
City, including without limitation,
obtaining one or more Credit Support
Instruments, terminating any Credit
Support Instrument, and entering into
agreements with one or more purchasers for their direct purchase of
the remarketed 2012 Bonds in lieu of a
public offering of the 2012 Bonds by a
remarketing agent. In the event the
Director of Finance determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that it is necessary to supplement or amend the Supplemental Indenture or Subordinate
Lien Bonds Security Agreement
applicable to a Series of 2012 Bonds to
be remarketed in order to address current market conditions or to permit
the use of or to terminate a Credit Support Instrument or otherwise obtain
financing arrangements advantageous to the City, the Mayor, the
Director of Finance and the Director
of Public Utilities, or any two of them,
are authorized to sign and deliver an
amendment of that Supplemental
Indenture or Subordinate Lien Bonds
Security Agreement, or an amended
and restated Supplemental Indenture
or Subordinate Lien Bonds Security
Agreement, approved as to form by
the Director of Law, subject to the
Indenture or the Subordinate Lien
Bonds Security Agreement as theretofore amended.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized to satisfy the Debt Service
Reserve Requirement or any special
reserve fund requirement for the
Series of 2012 Bonds to be remarketed,
by the deposit of a Credit Support
Instrument in lieu of cash, as permitted and more specifically provided in
the Indenture, and to apply cash
released from the Debt Service
Reserve Fund or such special reserve
fund to the payment of costs of remarketing or other purposes permitted by
applicable laws. To the extent the
costs of remarketing are not paid
from any cash released from the Debt
Service Reserve Fund or such special
reserve fund, those costs shall be paid
from funds of the Water Division,
which are appropriated for that purpose.
The Director of Finance and the
Director of Public Utilities are authorized to prepare one or more disclosure documents in connection with
any remarketing of 2012 Bonds under
the same terms and conditions as set
forth in Section 12 of this Ordinance
with respect to the issuance of 2012
Bonds. The Director of Finance, the
Director of Public Utilities or any
other officer of the City, as appropriate under the Charter, is authorized to
take such actions or cause to be taken
such actions as are necessary to maintain the applicable tax status of such
2012 Bonds and the covenants and
authorizations in Section 10 of this
Ordinance shall apply to such 2012
Bonds. The Mayor, the Director of
Finance, the Director of Public Utilities and other City officials, as appropriate under the Charter, are authorized to sign and deliver such instruments, certificates and documents as
are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions authorized
by this Section. The Director of
Finance, the Director of Public Utilities, the Director of Law and other
City officials, as appropriate under
the Charter, are authorized to make
the
necessary
arrangements
on
behalf of the City to establish the
date, location, procedure and conditions for the remarketing of any 2012

90
Bonds and to take all actions necessary to effect the remarketing of any
2012 Bonds under the terms of this
Ordinance and the Indenture. The
Clerk of Council or other appropriate
official of the City shall furnish the
Trustee a true transcript of proceedings certified by the Clerk or other
official, of all proceedings had with
reference to the remarketing of any
2012 Bonds along with such information for the records as is necessary to
determine the validity of the remarketing.
Section 9. Interest Hedge Agreements. This Council finds that by
engaging in interest hedge transactions with respect to the 2012 Bonds,
from time to time, the City can, in
effect, convert interest on all or a portion of the 2012 Bonds from a fixed
rate to a variable rate, or from a variable rate to a fixed rate, and thereby
may reduce its cost of borrowing by
optimizing the relative amounts of
fixed and variable rate obligations
and minimizing the risk of variations
in its debt service costs. To permit the
City to have the flexibility to undertake interest rate swap, swaption,
rate cap, rate collar and other hedging transactions, from time to time,
and to establish the procedures for
approving those transactions, this
Council authorizes the execution and
delivery of one or more hedge agreements (each, a “Hedge Agreement”)
and any related agreements necessary for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by each
Hedge Agreement.
Upon the written recommendation
of a Financial Advisor to the Director
of Finance that an interest rate hedge
transaction be undertaken by the
City, the Director of Finance may
authorize one or more interest rate
hedge transactions in accordance
with the applicable Hedge Agreement; provided that (a) the maximum
aggregate notional amount of interest rate hedge transactions outstanding at any one time, net of offsetting
interest rate hedge transactions,
shall not exceed such amount as will
result in a lowering of the ratings
assigned to the Bonds by the rating
agencies, as is evidenced by written
correspondence from the rating agencies or policies published in writing
by the rating, and (b) the term of each
interest rate swap transaction shall
not exceed 30 years. The approval of
each interest rate hedge transaction
by the Director of Finance shall be
conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery of the applicable
Hedge Agreement by the Director of
Finance.
The Director of Finance shall negotiate the terms of each Hedge Agreement with a counterparty that satisfies any criteria that the City may
apply to such agreements or counterparties from time to time. The City
shall receive a written opinion of a
Financial Advisor that the payments
to be made by the counterparty to the
City, or by the City to the counterparty, shall be fair value for the Hedge
Agreement, considering, among other
things, the credit of the City and the
counterparty and the terms and conditions of the Hedge Agreement. The
Director of Finance shall determine
the terms and conditions of the Hedge
Agreement, including without limitation, the rates to be paid by the counterparty to the City and by the City to
the counterparty under the Hedge
Agreement, the time or times and pro-

The City Record
cedures for the exercise by the counterparty or the City, as the case may
be, of any option under the Hedge
Agreement, and whether the obligations of the City under the Hedge
Agreement shall be secured by a Credit Support Instrument. The approval
of each interest rate hedge transaction by the Director of Finance shall
be conclusively evidenced by the
signing and delivery of the applicable
Hedge Agreement by the Director of
Finance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to terminate any Hedge Agreements in whole or in part or any Credit Support Instrument securing a
Hedge Agreement if the Director of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
that the City’s best interests will be
served by such termination. The
Director of Finance is further authorized to enter into amendments or
modifications of a Hedge Agreement
or any Credit Support Instrument
securing a Hedge Agreement determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the City’s best
interests will be served by such
amendment or modification.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from the Net Revenues of the Utility
and may be payable also from other
funds permitted by law to be used for
the purpose, as identified by the
Director of Finance in the Hedge
Agreement. Those payments may be
secured by a pledge of Net Revenues,
to the extent permitted by the Indenture, all as determined by the Director
of Finance and set forth in the Hedge
Agreement. The City’s payment obligations under each Hedge Agreement
related to Subordinate Lien Bonds
shall be payable only as provided in
the Subordinate Lien Bonds Security
Agreement. The obligation of the City
to make payments under any Hedge
Agreement does not and shall not represent or constitute a general obligation, debt, bonded indebtedness or a
pledge of the faith and credit of the
City or the State of Ohio. Nothing
gives any party to any Hedge Agreement the right to have excises, ad valorem or other taxes levied by the City
or the State of Ohio for the payment of
any amounts due under any Hedge
Agreement.
Section 10. Covenants of the City.
The City, by issuance of the 2012
Bonds, covenants and agrees with the
Holders of the 2012 Bonds, that:
(a) The City will use the proceeds
of the 2012 Bonds for the purposes
specified in Section 2 of this Ordinance.
(b) The Clerk, or other appropriate
officer of the City, will furnish to the
Original Purchasers and to the

Bonds, together with information
from the City’s records as is necessary to determine the regularity and
validity of the issuance of the 2012
Bonds.
(c) The City will, at any and all
times, cause to be done all such further acts and things and cause to be
signed and delivered all further
instruments as may be necessary to
carry out the purpose of the 2012
Bonds and this Ordinance or as may
be required by Section 13, Article
XVIII of the Constitution of Ohio or

1316

August 15, 2012
the Charter of the City or the Indenture or the applicable Supplemental
Indenture or the Subordinate Lien
Bonds Security Agreement and will
comply with all requirements of law
applicable to the Utility and the operation thereof.
(d) The City will observe and perform all its agreements and obligations provided for in the 2012 Bonds,
this Ordinance, the Indenture, each
Supplemental Indenture and the Subordinate Lien Bonds Security Agreement. All of the obligations under this
Ordinance and the Indenture, each
Supplemental Indenture and the Subordinate Lien Bonds Security Agreement are hereby established as duties
specifically enjoined by law and
resulting from an office, trust or station upon the City within the meaning
of Section 2731.01, Ohio Revised Code.
(e) The City will use, and will
restrict the use and investment of, the
proceeds of the 2012 Bonds in such
manner and to such extent as may be
necessary so that (a) the 2012 Bonds
will not (i) constitute private activity
bonds, arbitrage bonds or hedge
bonds under Sections 141, 148 or 149 of
the Code or (ii) be treated other than
as bonds to which Section 103(a) of
the Code applies, and (b) the interest
thereon will not be treated as an item
of tax preference under Section 57 of
the Code.
(f) The City covenants that (a) it
will take or cause to be taken such
actions that may be required of it for
the interest on the 2012 Bonds to be
and to remain excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will not take or authorize to
be taken any actions that would
adversely affect that exclusion, and
(c) it, or persons acting for it, will,
among other acts of compliance, (i)
apply the proceeds of the 2012 Bonds
to the governmental purpose of the
borrowing, (ii) restrict the yield on
investment property acquired with
those proceeds, (iii) make timely
rebate payments to the federal government, (iv) maintain books and
records and make calculations and
reports, and (v) refrain from certain
uses of proceeds, and, as applicable,
of property financed with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the
extent necessary to assure such
exclusion of that interest under the
Code.
Each covenant made in this section
with respect to the 2012 Bonds is also
made with respect to all issues for
which any portion of the debt service
is paid from proceeds of the 2012
Bonds (and, if different, the original
issue and any refunding issues in a
series of refundings), to the extent
such compliance is necessary to
assure exclusion of interest on the
2012 Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes, and the
Director of Finance, or any other officer having responsibility with respect
to the 2012 Bonds, is authorized to
take such actions with respect to
those issues as they are authorized in
this section to take with respect to the
2012 Bonds.
The Mayor, the Director of Finance
or any other officer of the City, as
appropriate under the Charter, is
authorized (a) to make or effect any
election,
selection,
designation,
choice, consent, approval or waiver on
behalf of the City with respect to the
2012 Bonds as the City is permitted or
required to make or give under the
federal income tax laws, including,

August 15, 2012
without limitation, any of the elections available under Section 148 of
the Code, for the purpose of assuring,
enhancing or protecting the favorable
tax treatment or status of the 2012
Bonds or interest thereon or assisting
compliance with requirements for
that purpose, reducing the burden or
expense of compliance, reducing the
rebate amount or payments or penalties, or making payments of special
amounts in lieu of making computations to determine, or paying, excess
earnings as rebate, or obviating those
amount or payments, as determined
by that officer, (b) to take any and all
other actions, make or obtain calculations, make payments, and make or
give reports, covenants and certifications of and on behalf of the City, as
may be appropriate to assure the
exclusion of interest from gross
income and the intended tax status of
the 2012 Bonds, and (c) to give one or
more appropriate certificates of the
City, for inclusion in the transcript of
proceedings for the 2012 Bonds, setting forth the reasonable expectations of the City regarding the
amount and use of all the proceeds of
the 2012 Bonds, the facts, circumstances and estimates on which they
are based, and other facts and circumstances relevant to the tax treatment
or status of the 2012 Bonds and interest thereon.
Section
11.
Ratings;
Credit
Enhancement. If, in the judgment of
the Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
the filing of an application for a rating on one or more Series of 2012
Bonds by one or more nationally recognized rating agencies is in the best
interests of the City, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare and
submit those applications and to provide to each such agency such information as may be required for the purpose. The Director of Finance is
authorized to contract for one or more
Credit Support Instruments for any
Series of 2012 Bonds or designated
portions thereof if the Director determines, based on the written advice of
a Financial Advisor, that the Credit
Support Instruments will result in
debt service savings to the City, or
will stabilize interest rates on those
2012 Bonds or will minimize the risk
of increased interest expense on those
2012 Bonds. The Director of Finance
is further authorized to terminate any
such contract if the Director of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
that the City’s best interests will be
served by such termination. The cost
of obtaining each rating and the cost
of obtaining or terminating each
Credit Support Instrument, except to
the extent paid by the Original Purchasers in accordance with the Bond
Purchase Agreement, shall be paid
from the proceeds of 2012 Bonds or
funds of the Water Division, which
are appropriated for that purpose.
Section 12. Official Statements; Continuing Disclosure. The Mayor, the
Director of Finance, the Director of
Public Utilities, the Commissioner of
Water, or other City officials, as
appropriate under the Charter, each is
authorized, on behalf of the City and
in their official capacities, to (i) prepare or cause to be prepared, and
make or authorize modifications,
completions or changes of or supplements to, disclosure documents in the
form of a preliminary official statement relating to the issuance of 2012

The City Record

official statement as so prepared is a
“deemed final” official statement

(“SEC”) Rule 15c2-12(b)(1). The distribution and use of one or more preliminary official statements are

also authorized, on behalf of the City
and in their official capacities, as
appropriate under the Charter, to
complete each preliminary official
statement with such modifications,
changes and supplements as those
