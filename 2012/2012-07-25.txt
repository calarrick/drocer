costs may be applied to the rates
prescribed in Sections 523.02 to
523.065 C.O. and any other rate
schedule as may be adopted by the

power cost per kilowatt hour delivered
calculated
under
divisions
(c)(1) and (2) of this section.
(c)(1) The fuel and purchase
power cost per kilowatt hour sold to
residential ratepayers shall be determined by dividing the sum of the
cost of the kilowatt hours purchased
from the Power Authority of the
State of New York and the average
cost of kilowatt hours purchased
from other sources needed to supply
the residential customers by the
total kilowatt hours distributed to
residential customers. The incremental charge calculated herein
shall be adjusted by subtracting 15
mils per kilowatt hour for residential customers who provide the Division of Cleveland Public Power with
a certificate of reduction of taxes
obtained pursuant to the Homestead
Exemption provisions of Sections
323.151
through
323.157
of
the
Revised Code, and 9.75 mils per kilowatt hour for all other residential

523.048 C.O., the fuel and purchase
power cost per kilowatt hour sold to
all ratepayers, other than residential
ratepayers,
during
the
twelve
months of the year, shall be determined by dividing the sum of the
total cost of coal, oil, gas and purchase power by the total kilowatt
hours distributed, except that the
computation shall exclude the cost
of PASNY power and the amount of
PASNY power allocable to kilowatt
hours distributed, and shall exclude
the costs of all purchase power and
hours
from
a
specific
kilowatt
source or sources purchased by the
Division for distribution to ratepayers
under
Sections
523.048
and
523.049 C.O. The incremental charge
calculated herein shall be adjusted
by subtracting 3.0 mils per kilowatt
hour.
(d) At the end of each month, the
Division of Cleveland Public Power
shall determine the excess fuel and
power charge during such month as
herein provided.
Be it further resolved that all
other provisions of Resolution No.
140-95, adopted February 27, 1995, as
amended by Resolution No. 152-95,
