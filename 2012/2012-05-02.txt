ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 579-12.
By Council Members Reed, Brancatelli, Polensek, J. Johnson, Zone
and Mitchell.
An emergency resolution supporting the U.S. Department of Transportation’s declaration of April as
national Distracted Driving Awareness Month.
Whereas, the U.S. Department of
Transportation has declared April
national Distracted Driving Awareness Month, continuing Secretary
Ray LaHood’s push to enact laws
banning texting and hand-held cell
phone use while driving; and
Whereas, according to the Department of Transportation’s website,
Distraction.gov, using a cell phone
while driving delays the driver’s
reaction time as much as having a
blood alcohol concentration of .08,
the legal limit for drunk driving;
and
Whereas, drivers who use handheld devices are four times more
likely to get into a crash serious
enough to cause injury, and texting
drivers are 23 times more likely to
be involved in a crash, according to
the Department of Transportation;
and
Whereas, during a two-week period of stepped up law enforcement,
in
Hartford,
Connecticut
police
wrote approximately 4,956 tickets
and Syracuse, New York police
issued 4,446 tickets for violations
involving talking or texting on cell
phones; and
Whereas, as a result of effective
law enforcement and public-service
announcements,
hand-held
cell
phone use dropped 56 percent in
Hartford and 38 percent in Syracuse,
and texting while driving decreased
by 68 percent in Hartford and 42
percent in Syracuse; and
Whereas, 37 states across the
country have enacted laws banning
texting and/or hand-held cell phone
use while driving; and
Whereas, distracted driving led to
at least 31,000 accidents and automobile crashes in the state of Ohio
from 2009 to 2011, and approximately one out of four of those collisions
took place in Cuyahoga County,
according to information by the
State Highway Patrol; and
Whereas, a recently released State
Highway Patrol analysis of crash
reports linked 74 fatal automobile
crashes over a three year period to
distracted driving; and
Whereas, Cuyahoga County led
the state of Ohio with 7,087 distracted driving crashes, which is
more than the combined total from
Franklin, Hamilton and Lucas counties, including major metropolitan
areas of Columbus, Cincinnati and
Toledo; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the U.S. Department of Transportation’s declaration of April as
national Distracted Driving Awareness Month.

Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
resolution to U.S. Department of
Secretary
Ray
Transportation
LaHood.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immeupon
its
adoption
and
diately
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted April 23, 2012.
Effective April 26, 2012.

Res. No. 580-12.
By Council Members Brancatelli,
Westbrook, Dow, Brady, Mitchell, J.
Johnson, Cimperman, Conwell, Cummins, K. Johnson, Keane, Kelley,
Miller, Polensek, Pruitt, Reed, Zone
and Sweeney.
An emergency resolution urging
the U.S. House of Representatives to
support the passage of H.R 4210 the
Restore Our Neighborhoods Act of
2012,
which
will
establish
$4,000,000,000 in new funding through
bonding to take on significant residential and commercial structure
demolition projects in urban areas.
Whereas, vacant, uninhabitable,
ravaged properties often become a
breeding ground for crime and fires,
and
require
a
disproportionate
amount of government maintenance,
from securing properties against
criminal activity to removal of
garbage and rodents to demolition,
all at a cost to taxpayers; and
Whereas, vacant, uninhabitable,
ravaged properties reduce city tax
revenue in three ways: they are
often tax delinquent; their low value
means they generate little in taxes;
and they depress property values
across an entire neighborhood; and
Whereas, the citizens who live in
a neighborhood with many vacant
and
abandoned
properties
have
great difficulty obtaining homeowner’s insurance, mortgages and loans
for home improvements; and
Whereas,
vacant
properties
degrade and devalue the quality of
life for remaining residents, isolating and weakening the neighborhood, and increasing the likelihood
that property values will continue to
decline and further abandonment
will set in; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has demolished 6,000 vacant building since 2006 at a cost of approximately $42,000,000; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
still
has
approximately
15,000
vacant structures and has limited
financial capacity to fund additional demolition at that scale; and
Whereas, H.R. 4210 will create
National Urban Demolition Bonds,
which will provide $4 billion for
states and establish land banks to
issue 30-year demolition bonds; and
Whereas, those states which have
been highly impacted by foreclosed
and abandoned homes will also benefit from the passage of H.R. 4210;
and
Whereas, the H.R. 4210 will allow
for more flexibility than the Neighborhood
Stabilization
Program
(NSP), and

668

May 2, 2012
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,

of Representatives to support the
passage of H.R 4210, the Restore

take on significant residential and

is hereby directed to transmit copies
of this resolution to Barack Obama,
President of the United States, John
Boehner, Speaker, U.S. House of Representatives, Marcia Fudge, Congresswoman, Steven LaTourette, Congressman, Marcy Kaptur, Congresswoman, Dennis Kucinich, Congressman, John Kasich, the Governor of
the State of Ohio, Frank G. Jackson,
Mayor, City of Cleveland.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from
