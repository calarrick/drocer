FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTION REFERRED
Res. No. 1496-12.
By Council Member Miller.
An emergency resolution supporting the use of race as one factor to
attain a “critical mass” of minority
students in order to achieve diversity
on college campuses.
Whereas, universities in this country want and need to attain and maintain racial diversity on their campuses; and
Whereas, in 2003, the United States
Supreme Court found that that idea of
a “critical mass” of minority students
is an educational goal important
enough to allow colleges and universities to use race as a plus-factor in
admissions decisions; and
Whereas, recently the Supreme
Court heard arguments revisiting the
issue of affirmative action on college
campuses, wherein it seems that the
Court will determine exactly what is
“critical mass” on college campuses;
and
Whereas, a diverse learning environment helps prepare all students
for jobs and citizenship; and
Whereas, this Council supports the
Supreme Court’s determination that
race may be used in admissions in
order to attain “critical mass” of
minorities; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public

Purpose
The purpose of this document is to
identify the policy that will govern
the investment activities of the
Treasurer’s Office of the City of
Cleveland. This policy has been
adopted by, and, if necessary, will
be revised on an annual basis by,
the Director of Finance.
This policy is designed to ensure
prudent
management
of
public
funds, conformance to Chapter 178
of the Codified Ordinances of the
City of Cleveland, availability of
operating and capital funds when
needed, and an investment return
competitive with comparable funds
and financial market indices.
All participants in the investment
process shall act responsibly as custodians of the public trust. Investment officials shall recognize that
the investment portfolio is subject
to public review and evaluation. The
overall program shall be designed
and managed with a degree of pro-

1652

1.  Preservation of Principal – The
single most important objective
of the City of Cleveland investment program is the preservation of principal of those funds
within the Portfolio.
2.  Maintenance of Liquidity – The
Portfolio shall be managed in
such a manner that assures that
funds are available as needed to
meet those immediate and/or
future operating requirements
of the City of Cleveland.
3.  Maximize Return – The Portfolio shall be managed in such a
fashion as to attain a marketaverage rate of return throughout budgetary and economic
cycles, within the context and
parameters set forth by objectives 1 and 2 above.

Delegation of Authority
The Treasurer is responsible for the
prudent investment of the City of
Cleveland Treasury and shall oversee the establishment of investment
procedures consistent with this policy. Such procedures shall include
explicit delegation of authority to
persons responsible for investment
transactions. No person may engage
in an investment transaction except
as provided under the terms of this
policy and the procedures established by the Treasurer. The Treasurer shall be responsible for all
trades undertaken, and shall establish a system of controls to regulate
the activities of subordinate officials and shall exercise control over
that staff. Investment staff shall be
bonded in amounts appropriate to
levels of responsibility and portfolio
characteristics.
The City’s Internal Auditor will
review the investment program to
ensure compliance with this policy.

Standard of Prudence
The standard of prudence to be
applied to the investment of the City
of Cleveland shall be the industry

The City Record

October 17, 2012
standard “Prudent
which states:

Investor

Rule”,

“Investments shall be made with
judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing which
persons of prudence, discretion
and intelligence exercise in the
management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for
investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as
well as the probable income to
be derived.”
Treasury staff acting in accordance
with this policy or any other written procedures pertaining to the
administration and management of
the City of Cleveland and who exercise the proper due diligence shall
be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or market price changes, provided that these deviations are
reported immediately to the Treasurer and that appropriate action is
taken to control and prevent any
further adverse developments.

Ethics and Conflict of Interest
Employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could
conflict with the proper execution
and management of the investment
program, or that could impair their
ability to make impartial decisions.
Further, no employee involved in
the investment process shall use the
authority to influence of office or
employment to secure anything of
value or the promise or offer of anything of value that would create an
improper influence upon the public
official or employee with respect to
that person’s duties.
Employees and investment officials
shall comply fully with the reporting and disclosure requirements of
Chapter 102 of the Ohio Revised
Code.

which agreement the City Treasurer purchases for the City, and
such eligible depository or securities broker/dealer agrees to
unconditionally repurchase, any
of the securities listed in Section
178.12, divisions (b)(1), (b)(2), or
(b)(3), of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland.

Diversification
Each Portfolio shall be structured to
diversify investments to reduce the
risk of loss resulting from over-concentration of assets in a specific
maturity, a specific issuer or a specific type of security. The maximum
percentage of the Total Average
Portfolio permitted in each security
is as follows:
A. U.S. Treasury
B. Federal Agency
(Fixed Rate)
C. Federal Agency
(Callable)
D. Certificates of
Deposit
E. Repurchase
Agreements
F. State Bonds and
Notes
G. Municipal Bonds
and Notes
H. STAR Ohio
I. Money Market
Mutual Funds

100% maximum

Maximum Maturity
Maintenance of adequate liquidity to
meet the cash flow needs of the City
is essential. Accordingly, each Portfolio will be structured in a manner
that ensures sufficient cash is available to meet anticipated liquidity
needs. Selection of investment maturities must be consistent with the
cash requirements in order to avoid
the forced sale of securities prior to
maturity.
Assets will be invested in permitted
investments with a stated maturity
of no more than five (5) years from
the date of purchase unless the security is matched to a specific obligation or debt of the City. To control
the volatility of the assets, the Treasurer of the City will determine a
duration target, not to exceed three
(3) years.
Notwithstanding these limitations,
in no case will the assets in any
Portfolio be invested in securities
with
a
term
to
maturity
that
exceeds the expected disbursement
date of those funds.

Prohibited Investments and
Investment Practices
The Treasurer is expressly prohibited from the following investments
and investment practices. This is
not an exclusive list.
1.  Short sales (selling a specific
security before it has been
legally purchased);
2.  Investment in complex derivatives such as range notes, dual
index notes, inverse floating
rate
notes
and
deleveraged
notes, or notes linked to lagging
indices or to long-term indices;
3.  Collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) and real estate
mortgage investment conduits
(REMICs);
4.  Investing in any security not
specifically permitted by this
Policy.

Those responsible for the day-to-day
management of the Portfolios will
routinely monitor the contents of
each Portfolio, the available markets and the relative values of competing instruments, and will adjust
each Portfolio as necessary to meet
the
investment
objectives
listed
above. It is recognized and understood that this non-speculative active management of Portfolio holdings may cause a loss on the sale
of an owned investment. It is the
policy of the City of Cleveland to
charge any such loss against the
interest income account during the
month in which the loss was realized.
The City of Cleveland Office of Budget and Management, on a quarterly
basis,
allocates
the
net
income/losses earned on investments
of the General Revenue Account to
various funds based on each fund’s
cash balance in proportion to the
City of Cleveland as a whole.

16
Internal Controls
The City Treasurer is responsible
for monitoring a system of internal
controls governing the administration and management of the Portfolio which include a review of all
investment activity, trade reconciliation, and targeting cash balances.
Such controls are designed to prevent and control losses of the City
funds arising from fraud, employee
error, misrepresentation by third
parties, unanticipated changes in
financial
markets,
or
imprudent
actions by any personnel. The internal controls address: control of collusion, separation of duties, separating transaction authority from
accounting and record keeping, custodial safekeeping, clear delegation
of authority, written confirmation of
telephone transactions, minimizing
the number of authorized investments officials and documentation
of investment transactions.

Eligible Banks and Broker/Dealers
The Director of Finance will establish and the Treasurer will maintain
a list of eligible brokers, dealers,
and banks with which investment
can
be
made,
as
transactions
described in Section 178.11 of the
Codified Ordinances of the City of
Cleveland. Qualified firms will be
limited to “primary” dealers and
other dealers that qualify under
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15C3-1 (uniform net capital rule) that are registered with
the Ohio Department of Commerce
to do business in the State of Ohio.
All financial institutions and broker
dealers must provide the following
information, on an annual basis:
1.  Sworn statement pledging to
adhere to “Capital Adequacy
Standards”
2.  Annual financial statements for
the most recent year showing
the amount of liquid capital
3.  A written statement from a certified public accountant certifying no weakness in the internal
systems of controls of the dealer or broker were found
4.  A completed “Broker/Dealer Request for Information” and all
documentation required by Section 178.12 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland.
Preference will be given to banks
and broker/dealers who are headquartered or maintain a presence in
the City of Cleveland.
Financial
institutions
and
broker/dealers will be required to comply with this policy and to pledge
to offer for sale only appropriate
securities.

Competitive Selection of Investment
Instruments
It will be the policy of the Treasurer to transact all security purchases/sales only with approved
financial institutions through a competitive process. The City shall
accept the offer which (a) has the
highest rate of return within the
maturity required; and (b) optimizes

The City Record

the investment objective of the overall portfolio. When selling a security, the Treasurer will select the bid
that generates the highest sale
price.

reports in sufficient detail to provide full disclosure of all investment
activities to the Director of Finance.

Primary fixed price Federal Agency
offerings may be purchased from
the list of qualified broker/dealers
without competitive solicitation.

In the event that any portion of this
policy is in conflict with any City,
State, or Federal law, that law will
prevail.

In making investment decisions, all
other things being equal and subject
to compliance with any applicable
Internal Revenue Code requirements
for bond proceeds, investment in corporations and financial institutions
doing business in the City of Cleveland will be given preference over
other investment options.

Investment Policy Effective Date
This policy is adopted this 9th day
of April 2009 and shall remain in
effect until rescinded or amended by
the Director of Finance.

Safekeeping and Custody

_____
October 17, 2012

All investment securities purchased
by the Treasurer or held as collateral on deposits or investments shall
be held in third-party safekeeping at
the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland or at a secured and insured
depository as required by Chapter
178 of the City of Cleveland Codified
Ordinance and Section 113.05 of the
Ohio Revised Code.
All securities in the Portfolio shall
be held in the name of the Treasurer of the City of Cleveland and
will be free and clear of any lien.
Further, all investment transactions
will be conducted on a delivery-vs.payment basis. The depository shall
issue a safekeeping receipt to the
Treasurer listing the specific instrument, rate, maturity and other
pertinent information.
Appropriate Treasury officials and
representatives of the depository
responsible for, or in any manner
involved with, the safekeeping and
custody process of the City of Cleveland shall be bonded in such a fashion as to protect the City from losses from malfeasance and misfeasance.

Performance Standards
The investment portfolios shall be
designed and managed with the
objective of obtaining a market rate
of return throughout budgetary and
economic cycles, commensurate with
the investment risk constraints and
cash flows needs of the City.

Reporting
The City Treasury shall maintain
accurate,
complete,
and
timely
records of all investment activities.
Each business day, the Treasurer
shall provide the Commissioner of
Accounts and the City Controller a
sworn statement (Daily Treasurer’s
Report) showing the total amount
deposited in and withdrawn from
each depository from the preceding
business day. Within fifteen (15)
business days of the end of the
month, the City Treasurer shall submit an investment report to the
Director of Finance. This report
shall include: (i.) a listing of the
existing
portfolios
in
terms
of
investment securities, book value,
maturity date, return, market value,
and other features deemed relevant,
(ii.) a listing of all transactions executed during the month. The City
