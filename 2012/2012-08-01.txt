ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Ord. No. 952-12.
By Council Member Kelley.
An ordinance to amend Sections 1

April 30, 2012, regarding the amendment and extension of the franchise
with Cleveland Thermal, LLC for the
transmission and supply of steam and
water for heating, cooling and power
purposes.
Whereas, the Charter of the City of
Cleveland authorizes this Council by
ordinance to grant a non-exclusive
franchise to any person, firm or corporation to construct, install, maintain and operate a utility in, under,
over, along, across and upon any of
the streets and public grounds of the
City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, on April 30, 2012, this
Council passed Ordinance No. 550-12
which authorized the amendment and
extension of the franchise to Cleveland Thermal, LLC for the transmission and supply of steam and water
for heating, cooling and power purposes; and
Whereas, it was the intention of
this Council and Cleveland Thermal,
LLC, to extend the franchise for the
maximum period of 25 years allowed
by law, but the final date of the franchise permitted by law was not
known until final passage and
approval of Ordinance No. 550-12; and
Whereas, it is necessary and in the
best interests of the City to amend
Ordinance No. 550-12 by correcting the
date through which the franchise was
granted; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 1 of Ordinance No. 550-12, passed April 30,
2012, is amended to read as follows:

12
Section 1. That under Chapter 35 of
the Charter of the City of Cleveland
and Section 1 of the franchise granted
by Ordinance No. 1519-04, passed October 25, 2004 (the “Franchise Ordinance”), this Council approves the
extension of the franchise agreement
to June 1, 2037, and the amendments
thereto regarding certain administrative matters as set forth therein.
Section 2. That existing Section 1 of
Ordinance No. 550-12, passed April 30,
2012, is repealed.
Section 3. That Section 2 of Ordinance No. 550-12, passed April 30, 2012,
is amended to read as follows:
Section 2. That the franchise agreement granted to Cleveland Thermal
Holdings, LLC, as successor to CT
Acquisitions I Inc., by the Franchise
Ordinance described in Section 1 is
amended, and the entirety of the franchise agreement as contained in the
Franchise Ordinance as amended by
this ordinance is as follows:
Section 1. Grant of Franchise.
Under the Charter of the City of
Cleveland (“City”), and subject to
the terms and conditions set forth in
this franchise, Cleveland Thermal,
LLC (“Grantee”), is granted a nonexclusive franchise, until June 1,
2037, unless sooner terminated as

in that Service Area, with the full

sufficient
capacity, through leases, power purchase agreements or other means, to
meet Customers’ reasonably antici-

pated requirements.
The grant of
this franchise does not establish priority or lack of priority for use of
the streets and public grounds to

any other person or entity directly
or indirectly controlling, controlled
by or under common control with

Grantee, or facilities removed by the
Grantee, the Grantee shall at its cost
restore the same to their original condition. Grantee shall clear all streets
and public grounds of obstructions or
anything that might constitute a nuisance or prevent such streets and public grounds from being open and in
repair, if such obstruction or nuisance
was caused by the Grantee or related

If the Grantee fails to complete such
work within a reasonable period of
time, the appropriate officer of the
City may, in writing, notify the
Grantee that the City will complete
such work if not completed by the
Grantee as soon as practicable as
determined by the City after receipt
of notice by Grantee. Any work not
completed as determined by the City’s
officer may be completed by the City

the Steam System in the streets and
public grounds of the Service Area, all

the opinion of the Council, be necessary in the public interest. The Council shall at all times control the distribution of space in, under, over, along,
across or upon all streets and public
grounds occupied by fixtures of the
Steam System. In the construction,
installation, maintenance or repair of
its properties, the Grantee shall comply with all laws and regulations
existing at the effective date of this
franchise or that may thereafter be
made by the City applicable to the
Grantee and the Grantee shall be
liable for damages caused by its failure or neglect to comply with such
laws and regulations and shall save
the City harmless from any and all
claims for damages by reason of such
failure or neglect.

allow or to the extent of its capacity
obtained from alternate sources as
permitted pursuant to Section 1 hereof, deliver live steam or water to any
person or entity requesting Steam Service who complies with its reasonable
regulations and whose property
either abuts upon Grantee’s service
lines or can be legally and reasonably
be connected to the Steam System
(“Customer”). At the point of delivery, the steam will be dry and saturated in accordance with the steam
table established by American Society
of
Mechanical
Engineers
(“ASME”).
The Grantee shall be
responsible to maintain, at its
expense, all mains and lines up to the
property line of the Customer’s facility, except where otherwise set forth
in an agreement between Grantee and

The City Record
a particular Customer, and shall keep
such lines in sound operating condition and free of undue leakage.
B. Abandonment of Services. In the
event Grantee makes an application
to the Public Utilities Commission of
Ohio (“PUCO”), to abandon service to
any part or all of its Service Area,
Grantee shall send a copy of any such
application to each of its then existing Customers.
C. Existing Rates. All valid contracts or agreements establishing
rates, charges or billing arrangements
between
Customers
and
Grantee (including, but not limited to,
agreements combining billings for
one or more premises owned or operated by a Customer) in effect as of the
effective date of this ordinance, shall
remain in effect until the expiration
of the contract or agreement as set
forth in such contract or agreement
(or as may have been extended by

allowed or required by any Court or
arbitration panel, or as agreed by
Customer and Grantee. All tariff and
contract rates for Steam Service in
effect as of the effective date of this
ordinance shall, except for fuel
adjustment clause increases and
authorized by the PUCO or in accordance with Ohio law, remain in effect
through the term of the franchise.
D. Rates and Charges.
If the
Grantee and any Customer cannot
agree on a contract which sets rates
for Steam Service to that Customer,
the rates and charges for Steam Service rendered by Grantee for such
Customer or Customers shall be set by
the PUCO, by Council, or as otherwise
may be provided by law. During the
term of this franchise, Grantee shall,
upon the request of the City or Council, provide such data and information
as the City reasonably requires to
review the rates, charges, terms and
conditions of Steam Service provided
by Grantee. Nothing contained in the

waiver of the Grantee to appeal to or
seek review of PUCO in connection
with any rates.

shall at all times provide safe, adequate and reliable service to its Customers and shall, except as may otherwise be permitted by law, provide
same without discrimination. In so
doing, Grantee shall maintain the
Steam System in a manner to ensure
such service and to ensure the efficient and safe operation of the Steam
System. Grantee shall maintain the

repair material leaks in the Steam
System. Grantee shall also promptly
repair any pavement, tree lawn, curb
or other portion of the street or public
ground which is damaged by Grantee
or due to defects in or leaks in or emanating from the Steam System.
If
there is any dispute between Grantee
and a Customer as to whether the

1207

13
Grantee or Customer is responsible to
repair damage in the streets or public
grounds caused by Grantee or due to
defects or leaks in the Steam System,
Grantee shall promptly make any necessary repairs pending resolution of
such dispute. The cost of such repairs
may be part of any such resolution,
and may be charged to the Customer
if it is determined that the repairs
were the responsibility of the Customer. The Grantee acknowledges its
obligation to operate and maintain
the Steam System so that it is not in
such condition as to be a hazard to the
health, safety or welfare of the public,
and acknowledges the right of the
City to reasonably require the
Grantee to make necessary repairs or
improvements to abate said condition.
Grantee shall promptly comply with
an order of the Director of the appropriate department of the City having
