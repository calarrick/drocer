constitutes an emergency measure
providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health and safety, and for the usual
daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary to issue the Series 2012
Bonds in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed Sixteen Million Dollars ($16,000,000) for the purpose of providing funds to improve
facilities for the discharge of governmental functions or for services
otherwise benefiting the public safety, health and welfare, including

Source of Payment. The Series 2012
Bonds shall be issued pursuant to the

Ohio Revised Code, the Charter of the
City, and this Ordinance for the purpose stated in Section  1. The Series
2012 Bonds shall be payable from and

the City on a basis subordinate to the
security given to the General Obligation Bonds of the City (“General
Obligation Bonds”) under Ordinance
No. 1749-80 passed by the Council on

National Association, as trustee (the
“Trustee”), as amended by Section 6.1
of the Second Supplemental Trust
Indenture, dated as of June 1, 2010,

four series of Subordinate Lien

additional bonds, from time to time,
subject to certain restrictions. The
Series 2008 Bonds, the Series 2010
Bonds, the Series 2012 Bonds and any
additional bonds issued under the
Indenture are collectively referred to
in this Ordinance as the “Bonds.”
Section 3. Pledge and Covenant to
Maintain Income Tax. So long as
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City pledges the
municipal income taxes of the City
and grants a lien thereon, subordinate to the lien granted in the General Bond Ordinance as security for the
General Obligation Bonds of the City
issued and outstanding under the
General Bond Ordinance, to the full
extent required to meet debt charges
payable on the Bonds issued and outstanding, from time to time, under the
Indenture. The City covenants to
appropriate
annually
sufficient
amounts from the income taxes to pay
all debt charges on the General Obligation Bonds, the Bonds outstanding
under the Indenture, any Parity
Obligations and the Unrestricted
Income Tax Obligations (each as
defined in the Indenture). The City
further covenants that so long as any
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City shall not repeal or
amend, or suffer the repeal of, any
ordinance for the levy or collection of
its income taxes in any manner or to
such extent that the City would not be
able to meet its obligations to the
holders of the Bonds.
Section 4. Terms of the Series 2012
Bonds. The Series 2012 Bonds shall be
issued in fully registered form. The
Series 2012 Bonds may be issued in
one or more series or subseries. The
Series 2012 Bonds may be delivered
only in book-entry form, and if so

name of the Depository (as defined in
the Indenture) or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the
custody of the Depository, and shall

(except for transfer to another Depository or its nominee) without further
action by the City pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture and the Third

The Series 2012 Bonds shall be designated “Public Facilities Improvement

delivery or such other date specified
in the certificate of award providing
for the final terms of the Series 2012
Bonds and the sale of the Series 2012
Bonds in accordance with this Ordinance (the “Certificate of Award”).
The Series 2012 Bonds shall bear
interest from their date until the principal amount is paid at the rate or
rates per year specified in the Certificate of Award, provided that the yield
(determined in accordance with the
arbitrage provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) of
the Series 2012 Bonds shall not exceed
six per cent (6.00%) per year. Interest
on the Series 2012 Bonds shall be
payable semi-annually on April 1 and
October 1, or such other dates specified in the Certificate of Award (the
“Interest Payment Dates”).
The Series 2012 Bonds shall mature

set forth in the Certificate of Award,
provided that (i) each principal payment shall occur on an Interest Payment Date, and (ii) the final maturity
date of the Series 2012 Bonds shall be

Series 2012 Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as serial
Series 2012 Bonds or as term Series
2012 Bonds payable prior to stated
maturity pursuant to sinking fund
redemption (the “Term Bonds”). The
Director of Finance shall determine
in the Certificate of Award whether
any of the Series 2012 Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates (the
“Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on
which the principal amount of the
Term Bonds shall be payable pursuant to mandatory sinking fund
installments rather than at stated
maturity and the amount of principal
to be paid on each Mandatory
Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements”). If any of the Series 2012
Bonds are issued as Term Series 2012
Bonds, the Term Bonds shall be
redeemed pursuant to the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to the
redemption date, on the Mandatory
Redemption Dates. The aggregate of
the moneys to be deposited with the
Trustee for payment of principal of
and interest on any Term Bonds shall
include amounts sufficient to redeem
on the Mandatory Redemption Dates
the principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided in
the Indenture and the Third Supplement).

(the

and this Ordinance, the Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award, based on the written
advice of a financial advisor, that the
City’s best interests will be served by
causing all or a portion of the Notes to
be obligations bearing interest at
variable rates. If the Director of
Finance so determines, then the
Director of Finance shall specify in
the Certificate of Award the method
and procedure by which the variable
rate of interest to be borne by the variable rate Notes shall be determined;
provided that the variable rate Notes
shall not bear interest at a rate in
excess
of

(25.00%) per year. The Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements in connection with the
delivery of the variable rate Notes,
and from time to time thereafter so
long as the variable rate Notes are
outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support Instruments (as defined in
Section 11) and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance, based on the written advice
of a financial advisor, to be necessary
or appropriate to provide for the
method of determining the variable
interest rates, permitting holders the
right of tender, providing for liquidi-

the Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased for
that Account, shall be sold at not less
than par and accrued interest to one
or more firms that have proposed to
underwrite the Notes and have been
selected by the Director of Finance
based on an evaluation of the qualifications of those firms (the “Note Purchaser”) in the principal amount set
forth in a certificate of award to be
executed by the Director of Finance
(the “Note Certificate of Award”).
The proceeds of such sale shall be
paid into the proper fund or funds set
forth in the Note Certificate of Award
and used for the purpose for which
the Notes are being issued under the
provisions of this Ordinance.
Section 9. Official Statement; Continuing Disclosure. If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a disclosure document (each, an “Official

treated other than as bonds the interest on which is excluded from gross
income under Section 103 of the Code,
and (ii) the interest on the TaxExempt Bonds will not be an item of
tax preference under Section 57 of the
Code.
The City further covenants that (i)

actions that may be required of it for
the interest on the Tax-Exempt Bonds
to be and remain excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, (ii) it will not take or authorize to
be taken any actions that would
adversely affect that exclusion, and

the borrowing, (B) restrict the yield
on investment property, (C) make
timely and adequate payments to the
federal government, (D) maintain
books and records and make calculations and reports and (E)  refrain
from certain uses of those proceeds,
and, as applicable, of property
financed with such proceeds, all in
such manner and to the extent necessary to assure such exclusion of that
interest under the Code.
(b) Further Actions. The Director
of Finance or any other officer of the
City
having
responsibility
for

or obtain calculations, make payments, and make or give reports,
covenants and certifications of and on
behalf of the City, as may be appropriate to assure the intended tax status of the Series 2012 Bonds and any
