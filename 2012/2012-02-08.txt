to include Poland and other U.S.
allies.
Whereas, recently the House Subcommittee on Immigration Policy

Whereas, expansion of the VWP

national security; and
Whereas, in 2008, the countries in
the VWP generated more than 16
million visits to the United States,
accounting for 65% of all overseas
arrivals that year; and
Whereas, VWP travelers spent
more than 61 billion dollars in the
U.S., which generated about 512,000
jobs, $13 billion in payroll and $7.8
billion in taxes for the U.S. economy; and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
the importance to the nation’s economy to keep its doors open to foreign travelers from long-standing
allied countries; and
