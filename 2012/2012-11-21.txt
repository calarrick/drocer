Section 343.23 Pedestrian Retail
Overlay (PRO) District
(a) Purpose. The Pedestrian Retail
Overlay (PRO) District is established
to maintain the economic viability of
older neighborhood shopping districts by preserving the pedestrianoriented character of those districts
and to protect public safety by minimizing conflicts between vehicles
and pedestrians in neighborhood
shopping districts.
(b) Mapping. The PRO District is
an overlay district which shall be
mapped only in an area where at least
seventy-five (75%) of the underlying
zoning is either Local Retail or General Retail. In every PRO District,
any street frontage to be considered a
“Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage,”
as defined in this section, shall be
marked on the Zoning Map, with
either one (1) or both sides of a street
designated as such.
(c) Applicability. The PRO District
regulations shall apply only in those
portions of a PRO District in which
the underlying zoning is either Local
Retail or General Retail. In the relevant portions of a PRO District, the
regulations of the underlying zoning
district shall govern except where in
conflict with the regulations of the
PRO District, in which case the regulations of the PRO District shall govern.
(d) Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall be
defined as stated below:
(1)
“Pedestrian
Retail
Street
Frontage” means that side or sides of
a public street frontage where pedestrian-oriented retail shopping activity exists or is expected to exist and
such street frontage is specifically
designated on the Zoning Map.
(2) “Pedestrian Retail Space”
means that portion of a building or
property located at or closest to the
level of the public sidewalk and within forty (40) feet of a Pedestrian
Retail Street Frontage.

(4) “Institutional Use” means, for
purposes of this section, a school, day
care center, place of worship, place of
assembly, hospital, nursing home, residential treatment facility, or similar
use.
(5) “Non-Retail Office” means an
office use whose primary activity
does not involve service to customers
or clients on the premises.
(e) Use Regulations. All uses permitted in the underlying retail zoning
district shall be permitted in the PRO
District, except that the use of Pedestrian Retail Spaces, as defined in this
section, shall be further limited as follows.
(1) Prohibited Uses. For Pedestrian
Retail Spaces, as defined in this section, the following uses shall be prohibited:
A. Open sales lots, as defined in this
section;

1821

11
B. Filling and service stations;
C. Car washes; and
D. Any business served by a drivethrough lane providing access to windows or other facilities at which an
order can be placed and merchandise
can be picked up.
(2) Conditional Uses. For Pedestrian Retail Spaces, as defined in this
section, the following uses shall be
permitted as Conditional Uses, as
approved by the City Planning Commission under the approval criteria
provided in this section:
A. Off-street parking or loading
areas;
B. Driveways extending across a
public sidewalk;
C. Residential, institutional and
non- retail office uses, as defined
herein, except that ground- floor
entrances and lobbies serving such
uses located on upper floors or in a
basement level shall be permitted
without the requirement for conditional approval;
D. Any building-enclosed use that
does not have a public pedestrian
entrance from the Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage;
E. Any use with more than forty
(40) feet of frontage along the Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage; and
F. A building with an interior side
yard more than four (4) feet in width
and located within forty (40) feet of a
Pedestrian Retail Frontage.
(f) Criteria for Conditional Uses.
The City Planning Commission shall
approve a Conditional Use application if it determines that the application meets the following criteria:
(1) In the case of a proposed residential, institutional or non-retail
office use, one (1) or more of the following conditions apply:
A. The subject building space was
designed specifically for the type of
use proposed and, as such, occupancy
by an allowed use is an unreasonable
expectation;
B. Denial of the application for
occupancy by a conditional use would
result in a long- term vacancy of the
subject property, as demonstrated by
the applicant;
C. It has been determined that the
proposed use is needed in the immediate area and that suitable alternative
locations are unavailable.
(2) In the case of a proposed off
street parking or loading area or driveway, one (1) or both of the following conditions apply.
A. The size, shape or layout of the
subject property does not permit
placement of the parking, loading or
driveway in a more suitable location.
B. It has been demonstrated by the
applicant that placement of the parking, loading or driveway in an
allowed location would jeopardize
the continued occupancy of the subject property by uses suited to the
PRO District.
(3) In the case of a building
enclosed use that does not have an
entrance from the Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage, one (1) or both of the
following conditions apply:
A. The proposed use will occupy an
existing building that lacks such
pedestrian entrance, and the addition
of a conforming pedestrian entrance
is made infeasible by the configuration of the interior space or other factors related to the design and placement of the building.
B. Placement of the pedestrian
entrance in a location other than on

12
the Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage
will result in more suitable pedestrian access.
(4) In the case of a proposed use
with more than forty (40) feet of
frontage along the Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage, the subject space
was designed for use at such size and
the proposed use, in the determination of the City Planning Commission,
will not have adverse impacts on the
functioning of nearby pedestrian-oriented retail uses.
(5) In the case of an interior side
yard more than four (4) feet in width
and located within forty (40) feet of a
Pedestrian Retail Frontage, the subject building will be occupied by residential units which require the
greater side yard area to allow for
desirable levels of light and air.
(g) Maximum Setbacks. Notwithstanding the provisions of the underlying zoning district, properties in
PRO Districts shall conform to the following regulations with respect to
maximum setbacks.
(1) Front Street Yard. No main
building on a lot abutting a Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage shall be set
back more than five (5) feet from the
Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage
unless the City Planning Commission
has approved establishment of a surface parking lot in such location as a
Conditional Use. Such building features as entrances and display windows may be set back up to an additional five (5) feet as long as these
features occupy no more than fifty
percent (50%) of the building’s total
frontage. These setback regulations
shall not apply to portions of buildings above the first-story level.
(2) Interior Side Yard. No portion of
an interior side yard located within
forty (40) feet of a Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage shall exceed four (4)
feet in width on the ground floor
level, unless the City Planning Commission has approved a driveway or a
residential side yard in such location
as a Conditional Use.
(3) Exceptions for Outdoor Cafes. A
building may be set back a maximum
of fifteen (15) feet from the Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage in order to
accommodate a permanent outdoor
café. If use of such café is discontinued for a period of two (2) years or
more, the setback area shall be landscaped or otherwise improved in
accordance with a plan approved by
the City Planning Commission.
(h) Window Areas. For any nonresidential building or storefront facing
a Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage,
not less than sixty percent (60%) of
the front facade between two and onehalf (2-1/2) and seven and one-half (71/2) feet in height shall be composed
of transparent windows or doors. In
addition, not more than twenty-five
percent (25%) of such window or door
area on a building or storefront shall
be covered with permanent signs.
(i) Parking. In recognition of the
expected greater use of public transit,
bicycles and walking by customers
and employees traveling to PRO Districts, the minimum number of parking spaces otherwise required by the
Zoning Code shall be reduced by thirty- three percent (33%) for retail business uses in the districts. The Board
of Zoning Appeals may further reduce
parking requirements where it has
been demonstrated that additional
parking is available in common or
shared parking facilities or in onstreet parking areas located within a

The City Record
reasonable walking distance of the
use, given the nature of the use and
the district. The Board shall also consider factors as the number of bicycle
racks available in proximity to a use.
In making its determination, the
Board shall be guided by an up-todate analysis of parking supply and
demand and other relevant factors
submitted by or on behalf of the applicant. The City Planning Commission
shall maintain a file of all such parking analyses submitted for properties
in each PRO District.
(j) Signs in the Public Street Rightof-Way. An ordinance to map a PRO
District in a particular location may
include permission to place private
signs in the public street right-of-way
under the regulations of Chapter 512
of the Codified Ordinances. Such provision shall be included in the PRO
designation only if it is determined,
on the basis of a survey and analysis
conducted by the City Planning Commission, that the particular PRO District is characterized by a preponderance of restaurants and small independent stores for which signs placed
near the street curb would provide
useful information to pedestrians
seeking goods and services and
would enhance the pedestrian-oriented image of the district. Any PRO District designated for display of signs
in the street right-of- way shall be
shown on the Zoning Map as a “PROS” District, with “S” noting the presence of special sign provisions. No
sign permitted by these provisions
shall be displayed without design
approval of the sign’s structure and
permanent elements by the City Planning Commission, or where applicable, by the Landmarks Commission.
(k) Variances. The Board of Zoning
Appeals may grant variances to
requirements of this section under the
applicable criteria stated in Chapter
329 of this code. In the case of an
appeal for a variance to permit a
drive-through business in a PRO District, the Board shall consider following factors:
(1) the anticipated volume of vehicular use of the proposed drivethrough facility, with higher volumes
considered to detract from the pedestrian character of the district;
(2) the anticipated proportion of all
customer sales represented by drivethrough sales at the business, with
higher proportions indicating that
the business is an inappropriate use
for a Pedestrian Retail District;
(3) the impact of the drive-through
facility on the pedestrian character of
the designated Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage;
(4) the impact on traffic safety and
pedestrian safety in the vicinity of
the drive-through business.
(l) Appeals. Appeals from the decision of the City Planning Commission
to approve or disapprove Conditional
Uses in Pedestrian Retail Spaces
shall be made to the Board of Zoning
Appeals.
