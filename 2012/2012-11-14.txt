in order to further the provision of
decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable

27, 2000 (the “HUD Deed”), and (ii)
made the Grant available to the City
pursuant to an UpFront Grant Agreement (the “UpFront Agreement”)
dated September 28, 2000 between

(the “Authorizing Legislation”) the

Whereas, an affiliate of the Borrower (the “Developer”) purchased
the Original Property from the City
pursuant to a Redevelopment Agreement between the City and the Developer (the “Redevelopment Agreement”), which property was transferred to the Developer by an Official
Quitclaim Deed recorded in Cuyahoga
County AFN 20000920724 on September 29, 2000, and the Developer agreed
to redevelop, or to cause the redevelopment by its permitted assignees of,
a portion of the Original Property,
together with additional property
conveyed by the City (the “City Property”), into a multifamily housing
complex containing a total of 629
affordable living units, together with
related amenities and supporting
facilities (the “Project”) in up to four
phases; and
Whereas, as authorized by the
Authorizing Legislation, in order to
further the redevelopment of the Project in accordance with the terms of
HUD Deed, the Grant Agreement and
the Redevelopment Agreement (the
“Controlling Documents”), the City
agreed to loan the proceeds of the
Grant (the “City Loan”) to the Developer or its permitted assignees pursuant to an UpFront Loan Agreement
between the City and the Developer
(the “Original Loan Agreement”) (the
City Loan Agreement, as amended
from time to time, shall be referred to
as the “Agreement”); and
Whereas, the Borrower was formed
to develop, on behalf of the Developer,
the first Phase of the Project, consisting of 282 affordable living units,
together with related amenities and
supporting facilities including a management office, community center,
and supportive services (“Phase One
Project”) on a portion of the Original
Property and the City Property (collectively, the “Phase One Project
Site”) and in connection therewith,

1788

November 14, 2012
the Developer conveyed the Phase
One Project Site to the Borrower; and
Whereas, pursuant to the Developer’s request and in order to enable the
Borrower to develop the Phase One
Project, the City (1) loaned $5,280,000
of the Grant proceeds (the “Phase One
Loan”) and (2) agreed to use
$6,000,000 of the Grant proceeds to
purchase all of the $6,000,000 County
of Cuyahoga, Ohio Subordinate Multifamily Housing Mortgage Revenue
Bonds, 2001 Series B (Longwood
Phase One Associates, L.P. Project)
(the “Outstanding Bonds”); and
Whereas, the Mortgagor’s obligation to repay the Consolidated Phase
One Loan was evidenced by a Promissory Note in the amount of $5,280,000
(the “Original Note”) and secured by
an Open-End Mortgage and Security
Agreement from Mortgagor to the
City, dated as of August 1, 2001 and
recorded in the Official Cuyahoga
County Records as Instrument No.
2001081001343 (the “Original City
Loan Mortgage”) and the Mortgagor’s

from Mortgagor to National City

the Borrower financed the Phase One
Project with the proceeds of an FHAinsured loan funded through the
issuance of $17,000,000 County of
Cuyahoga, Ohio Multifamily Housing
Mortgage Revenue Bonds, 2001 Series
A (Longwood Phase One Associates,
L.P. Project) (the “Senior Loan
Bonds”); and
Whereas, as a requirement of the
Senior Loan Bonds, the Original City
Mortgage, the Original Bond Mortgage and other documents securing
the Phase One Loan and the Outstanding Bonds (collectively, the “City
Loan Collateral Documents”) were
subordinated to the mortgage and
other documents securing the Senior
Loan Bonds; and
Whereas, in order to reduce the
interest expense incurred by the Borrower and thereby make additional
funds available to pay costs of operating and maintaining the Phase One
Project, the Borrower is refinancing
the Senior Loan Bonds with the proceeds of a $17,000,000 FHA-insured
loan from Forest City Capital Corporation (the “Senior Lender”), pursuant to Section 223(a)(7) of the
National Housing Act (the “New
Senior Loan”); and
Whereas, as a condition to the making of the New Senior Loan, the City is
being asked to (1) extend the maturity date of the Phase One Loan and the
Outstanding Bonds to a date not earlier than the maturity date of the New
Senior Loan and (2) re-subordinate
the interests granted to the City in the
City Loan Collateral Documents; and
Whereas, in order to allow for
administrative and operating efficiencies going forward, the Borrower
has asked the City to consolidate the
Outstanding Bonds and the Phase
One Loan into a single loan; now,

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 1557-12.
By Council Member Conwell.
An emergency resolution requesting the Ohio General Assembly to
make physical assault on public transit workers a felony under Ohio law.
Whereas, recently a bus driver for
the Regional Transit Authority in
Cleveland was the subject of an
assault by a passenger; and
Whereas, bus drivers and all transit
workers are at greater risk of
assaults, verbal abuse and other
injuries due to the intimate nature of
their work with the general public;
and

The City Record
Whereas, other states have laws
that provide specific penalties for
harming public transportation workers; and
Whereas, in order to better protect
our public transportation workers
while on the job, the state of Ohio
should adopt a law specifically making assault on a public transportation
worker a felony; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby requests the Ohio General Assembly to make physical assault on public transit workers a felony under
Ohio law.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit certified copies of this resolution to all
members of the Ohio General Assembly.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted October 29, 2012.
Effective November 9, 2012, without the signature of the Mayor.
