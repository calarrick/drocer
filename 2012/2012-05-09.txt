May 9, 2012
far as the capacity of its plant will
allow or to the extent of its capacity
obtained from alternate sources as
permitted pursuant to Section 1 hereof, deliver live steam or water to any
person or entity requesting Steam Service who complies with its reasonable
regulations and whose property
either abuts upon Grantee’s service
lines or can legally and reasonably
(as mutually agreed to in a contract
between such person or entity and
Grantee) be connected to the Steam
System (“Customer”). At the point of
delivery, the steam will be dry and
saturated in accordance with the
steam table established by American
Society of Mechanical Engineers
(“ASME”). The Grantee shall be
responsible to maintain, at its
expense, all mains and lines up to the
property line of the Customer’s facility, except where otherwise set forth
in an agreement between Grantee and
a particular Customer, and shall keep
such lines in sound operating condition and free of undue leakage.
B. Abandonment of Services. In the
event Grantee makes an application
to the Public Utilities Commission of
Ohio (“PUCO”), to abandon service to
any part or all of its Service Area,
Grantee shall send a copy of any such
application to each of its then existing Customers.
C. Existing Rates. All valid contracts or agreements establishing
rates, charges or billing arrangements
between
Customers
and
Grantee (including, but not limited to,
agreements combining billings for
one or more premises owned or operated by a Customer) in effect as of the
effective date of this ordinance, shall
remain in effect until the expiration
of the contract or agreement as set
forth in such contract or agreement
(or as may have been extended by
PUCO order), except as may be
allowed or required by any Court or
arbitration panel, or as agreed by
Customer and Grantee. All tariff and
contract rates for Steam Service in
effect as of the effective date of this
ordinance shall, except for fuel
adjustment clause increases and
authorized by the PUCO or in accordance with Ohio law, remain in effect
through the term of the franchise.
D. Rates and Charges. If the
Grantee and any Customer cannot
agree on a contract which sets rates
for Steam Service to that Customer,
the rates and charges for Steam Service rendered by Grantee for such
Customer or Customers shall be set by
the PUCO, by Council, or as otherwise
may be provided by law. During the
term of this franchise, Grantee shall,
upon the request of the City or Council, provide such data and information
as the City reasonably requires to
review the rates, charges, terms and
conditions of Steam Service provided
by Grantee. Nothing contained in the
subparagraph shall be deemed a
waiver of the Grantee to appeal to or
seek review of PUCO in connection
with any rates.
E. Contract Rates. Grantee may
enter into contracts for the provision
of Steam Service to one or more of its
Customers provided that the contracts are entered into under the
requirements of the Revised Code or

and provided that copies of all contracts for Steam Service are provided
to the Clerk of Council of the City to

shall at all times provide safe, adequate and reliable service to its Customers and shall, except as may otherwise be permitted by law, provide
same without discrimination. In so
doing, Grantee shall maintain the
Steam System in a manner to ensure
such service and to ensure the efficient and safe operation of the Steam
System. Grantee shall maintain the
Steam System so as to avoid substantial leakage, and shall promptly
repair material leaks in the Steam
System. Grantee shall also promptly
repair any pavement, tree lawn, curb
or other portion of the street or public
ground which is damaged by Grantee
or due to defects in or leaks in or emanating from the Steam System. If
there is any dispute between Grantee
and a Customer as to whether the
Grantee or Customer is responsible to
repair damage in the streets or public
grounds caused by Grantee or due to
defects or leaks in the Steam System,
Grantee shall promptly make any necessary repairs pending resolution of
such dispute. The cost of such repairs
may be part of any such resolution,
and may be charged to the Customer
if it is determined that the repairs
were the responsibility of the Customer. The Grantee acknowledges its
obligation to operate and maintain
the Steam System so that it is not in
such condition as to be a hazard to the
health, safety or welfare of the public,
and acknowledges the right of the
City to reasonably require the
Grantee to make necessary repairs or
improvements to abate said condition.
Grantee shall promptly comply with
an order of the Director of the appropriate department of the City having
custody and control of the particular
property or the responsibility to
ensure the health, safety or welfare of
the public in the particular situation
to make any such repairs or improvements.

participation and female business
enterprise participation, i.e., thirty
percent (30%) and ten percent (10%),
respectively, in Grantee’s proposed
construction of the improvement and

efforts to meet such goals, the City
shall give consideration to the availability of certain specialty items of
equipment for the Steam System that
are not readily available from minority and female vendors.
Grantee shall adhere to the standards set forth in division (a) of Section 187.04 of the Codified Ordinances
of the City, as presently in effect with
respect
to
nondiscrimination
in
employment, and shall use its best
efforts to improve the percentage of
minority and female employment in
the various occupations involved in
the performance of the Grantee’s business. With respect to any construction
of the improvement and expansion of
the Steam System comprising real
property, Grantee shall comply with
the requirements of Chapter 188 of the
Codified Ordinances of the City and
with all other City, State of Ohio and
federal laws and regulations now or
hereafter applicable to Grantee.

The franchise granted to the
Grantee herein shall not be transferable either directly or indirectly
except with the consent of Council,
provided, however, that the grant of a
mortgage on or security interest in or
assignment of real or personal property comprising the Steam System,
including but not limited to Grantee’s

of its business to or by any other heating, cooling or power company now
operating or that may in the future
operate in the City, including any
company which would by such action
by Grantee first enter into the business of providing heating, cooling or
power, nor shall Grantee assign or
transfer so much of the assets of the

or substantially all of the assets and
business of Grantee may, without the
prior approval of Council, be (i) transferred to any corporation or other

all of the property of the Grantee in
the streets and highways in the City
and elsewhere used in or useful for
the operation of the utility at a price
to be fixed in the manner provided in
the following sentence. If the City
and Grantee cannot agree on the price
to be paid by the City for such property, the value shall be determined by
three appraisers, one each selected by
the City and Grantee, and the other
selected by the two appraisers
appointed. If the three appraisers cannot agree upon a value for such property, the average of the three separate appraisals of the appraisers shall
be the value of such property. The
standard to be used by the appraisers
shall be the fair market value of such
property as a going concern. Further,
to the extent provided in Section 184
of the Charter of the City, the price to
be paid by the City for the property

or lease to purchase by requirements
contract of various types of vehicles
and apparatus for various Divisions
in the Departments of Public Works
and Public Safety, among others.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Public Works is hereby authorized
and directed to make a written
requirements contract in accordance
with the Charter and the Codified
Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
for the requirements for the period
of one year for the necessary items
of various types of vehicles and
apparatus described in the Vehicle
List placed in File No. 570-12-A, or
such other vehicle or apparatus in
substitution
thereof
as
may
be
approved by the Directors of Public
Works and Finance as replacement
vehicles or apparatus, in the estimated sum of $6,477,400, to be purchased, leased or leased to purchase
by the Commissioner of Purchases
and Supplies upon a unit basis for
various Divisions in the Departments of Public Works and Public
Safety, among others. Bids shall be
taken in such manner as to permit
an award to be made for all items
as a single contract, or by separate
contract for each or any combination of said items as the Board of
Control shall determine. Alternate
bids for a period less than a year
may be taken if deemed desirable
by the Commissioner of Purchases
and Supplies until provision is made
for a requirements contract for the
entire year.
Section 2. The cost of said contract
or contracts shall be charged against
the proper appropriation accounts
and the Director of Finance shall certify the amount of any purchase or
procurement under the contract, each

712

May 9, 2012
of which purchases or procurement
shall be made on order of the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies
under a delivery order against the
contract or contracts certified by the
Director of Finance.
Section 3. That the City may enter
into a lease-purchase arrangement
for the vehicles and apparatus with a
bank, leasing company or any other
organization that is not the manufacturer or vendor of the vehicles or
apparatus that submitted a bid for the
sale, lease or lease to purchase
described in Section 1 of this ordinance, provided that: (I) the Director
of Finance determines that it is in the
best interest of the City to enter into
that lease-purchase arrangement,
(II) the maximum term of any leasepurchase arrangement does not
exceed ten (10) years, (III) the aggregate principal obligation of the City
under the lease-purchase arrangement does not exceed $6,900,000, (IV)
if the lease-purchase arrangement
provides that the lease payments are
to have a principal component and an
interest component, the maximum
interest rate for the interest component does not exceed seven percent
(7%) per annum, (V) the obligations
of the City under that lease-purchase
arrangement for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2012 are subject to annual appropriations being
made by the City sufficient to pay the
lease payments and to meet the other
obligations of the City under that
lease-purchase arrangement in each
of these fiscal years, and (VI) the
obligations of the City thereunder for
the current fiscal year do not exceed
$660,000, which amount is hereby
appropriated for that purpose. The
Director of Finance is authorized and
directed to sign and deliver, for and
on behalf of the City and in the Director’s official capacity, such written
agreements, certificates and instruments as may be necessary or appropriate in order to provide for that
lease-purchase arrangement under
the terms and conditions authorized
herein and containing such additional terms and conditions as are acceptable to the Director of Finance and
the Director of Law. Those agreements may include a lease-purchase
agreement, an escrow agreement for
the deposit by the lessor of the purchase price of the vehicles and apparatus, acceptance certificates evidencing the City’s acceptance of the
vehicles from the vendors, and certificates as to insurance, tax compliance
and related matters necessary to
carry out the transaction. The leasepurchase arrangement may provide
that the lease payments are to have a
principal component and an interest
component and that the interest component is to be excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes. In that event, the Director of
Finance and other City officials, as
appropriate,
are
authorized
to
covenant on behalf of the City that
(A) the City will use and will restrict
the use of the vehicles and apparatus
leased by the City under the lease-purchase agreement and will use, and
will restrict the investment of, any
proceeds of the lease-purchase agreement in such manner and to such
extent as may be necessary so that
the lease-purchase agreement will
not constitute a private activity bond,
an arbitrage bond or a hedge bond
under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “Code”), or be

The City Record

treated other than as an obligation to
which Section 103(a) of the Code
applies, and (B) the City will take or
cause to be taken such actions that
may be required of it for the interest
component of the lease payments to
be and to remain excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes and the City will not take or authorize to be taken any actions that
would adversely affect that exclusion. In the event that the City enters
into such a lease-purchase arrangement, the Director of Public Works
may assign to the lessor under the
lease-purchase arrangement, or the
lessor’s designee, the rights of the
City under the contracts for purchase
of the vehicles and apparatus authorized in Section 1 of this ordinance.

The Director of Law, Clerk of Council
and other appropriate officials of the
City are authorized to sign and deliver any documents, certificates and
other instruments as the Director of
Law determines are necessary and
appropriate to carry out the transactions authorized by this ordinance.

and determined that all formal
actions of this Council concerning
and relating to the passage of this
Ordinance where adopted in open
meetings of this Council, and any of
its committees that resulted in such
formal action were in meetings open

law.

of the Charter, the purchases autho-

29
rized by this ordinance may be made

with other governmental agencies.
The Director of Finance may sign all
documents that are necessary to
make the purchases, and may enter
into one or more contracts with the
vendors selected through that cooperative process.

hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately upon its passage and approval
by the Mayor; otherwise it shall take
effect and be in force from and after
the earliest period allowed by law.

enter into contract with Zenith Systems LLC for the immediate purchase
of labor, equipment, and materials
necessary to repair the West 3rd
Street lift bridge; and to enter into
contract with TranSystems Corporation Ohio for the immediate professional services necessary for the

systems; and
Whereas, ODOT road construction

preclude lengthy, time-consuming,
costly, inefficient, and environmentally damaging detours of heavy
truck and other commercial and consumer vehicular traffic to and from
the Flats locations the bridge connects; and
Whereas, the Director of Capital
Projects has determined, based on
considerations of movable bridge
repair capability and experience,
project approach, immediate availability, project delivery capability
and completion date, quality, cost,
and safety, that the City should contract with Zenith Systems L.L.C. for
the immediate purchase of labor,
equipment, and materials necessary

713

to repair the West 3rd Street lift
bridge, including all components;
and
Whereas, the Director of Capital
Projects has also determined, based
on the above-stated considerations,
