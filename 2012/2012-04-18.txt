the City identified in the map contained in File No. 1519-04-A and incorporated by reference and as expanded
or extended within the boundaries of
the City (the “Service Area”) in,
under, over, along, across and upon
the streets and public grounds
(including, but not limited to, the
streets, lanes, alleys, avenues, easements and other public thoroughfares
and public rights of way of the City in
the Service Area) in that Service
Area, with the full and necessary
privileges for the use of the streets
and public grounds in the Service
Area for the purpose of digging a

use. Any extension or expansion of
the Steam System shall be subject to
all of the obligations and reserved

hereunder may be provided or performed by the Grantee, acting itself,
or through an affiliate of Grantee,

installation, maintenance or operation of the Steam System, shall not
endanger or unnecessarily interfere
with the lives of persons, shall not
unnecessarily interfere with any
installations of the City or any public
utility or other person serving the
City or using the streets and public
grounds of the City, and shall not
unnecessarily interrupt or obstruct
the use of any streets and public

work within a reasonable period of
time, the appropriate officer of the
City may, in writing, notify the
Grantee that the City will complete
such work if not completed by the
Grantee as soon as practicable as
determined by the City after receipt
of notice by Grantee. Any work not
completed as determined by the City’s
officer may be completed by the City
and the actual out-of-pocket cost of
such work shall be charged to the
Grantee. Upon the doing of such work,
the City shall furnish the Grantee
with itemized bills of the actual outof-pocket cost of the work, and
Grantee shall pay the bills within
thirty (30) days after its receipt.

obtained from alternate sources as
permitted pursuant to Section 1 hereof, deliver live steam or water to any
person or entity requesting Steam Service who complies with its reasonable
regulations and whose property
either abuts upon Grantee’s service
lines or can legally and reasonably
(as mutually agreed to in a contract
between such person or entity and
Grantee) be connected to the Steam
System (“Customer”). At the point of
delivery, the steam will be dry and
saturated in accordance with the
steam table established by American
Society of Mechanical Engineers
(“ASME”). The Grantee shall be
responsible to maintain, at its
expense, all mains and lines up to the
property line of the Customer’s facility, except where otherwise set forth
in an agreement between Grantee and
a particular Customer, and shall keep
such lines in sound operating condition and free of undue leakage.
B. Abandonment of Services. In the
event Grantee makes an application
to the Public Utilities Commission of
Ohio (“PUCO”), to abandon service to
any part or all of its Service Area,
Grantee shall send a copy of any such
application to each of its then existing Customers.
C. Existing Rates. All valid contracts or agreements establishing
rates, charges or billing arrangements
between
Customers
and
Grantee (including, but not limited to,
agreements combining billings for
one or more premises owned or operated by a Customer) in effect as of the
effective date of this ordinance, shall
remain in effect until the expiration
of the contract or agreement as set
forth in such contract or agreement
(or as may have been extended by
PUCO order), except as may be
allowed or required by any Court or
arbitration panel, or as agreed by
Customer and Grantee. All tariff and
contract rates for Steam Service in
effect as of the effective date of this
ordinance shall, except for fuel
adjustment clause increases and
authorized by the PUCO or in accordance with Ohio law, remain in effect
through the term of the franchise.
D. Rates and Charges. If the
Grantee and any Customer cannot
agree on a contract which sets rates
for Steam Service to that Customer,
the rates and charges for Steam Service rendered by Grantee for such
Customer or Customers shall be set by
the PUCO, by Council, or as otherwise
may be provided by law. During the
term of this franchise, Grantee shall,
upon the request of the City or Council, provide such data and information
as the City reasonably requires to
review the rates, charges, terms and
conditions of Steam Service provided
by Grantee. Nothing contained in the
subparagraph shall be deemed a
waiver of the Grantee to appeal to or
seek review of PUCO in connection
with any rates.

April 18, 2012
E. Contract Rates. Grantee may
enter into contracts for the provision
of Steam Service to one or more of its
Customers provided that the contracts are entered into under the

shall at all times provide safe, adequate and reliable service to its Customers and shall, except as may otherwise be permitted by law, provide
same without discrimination. In so
doing, Grantee shall maintain the
Steam System in a manner to ensure
such service and to ensure the efficient and safe operation of the Steam
System. Grantee shall maintain the
Steam System so as to avoid substantial leakage, and shall promptly
repair material leaks in the Steam
System. Grantee shall also promptly
repair any pavement, tree lawn, curb
or other portion of the street or public
ground which is damaged by Grantee
or due to defects in or leaks in or emanating from the Steam System. If
there is any dispute between Grantee
and a Customer as to whether the
Grantee or Customer is responsible to
repair damage in the streets or public
grounds caused by Grantee or due to
defects or leaks in the Steam System,
Grantee shall promptly make any necessary repairs pending resolution of
such dispute. The cost of such repairs
may be part of any such resolution,
and may be charged to the Customer
if it is determined that the repairs
were the responsibility of the Customer. The Grantee acknowledges its
obligation to operate and maintain
the Steam System so that it is not in
such condition as to be a hazard to the
health, safety or welfare of the public,
and acknowledges the right of the
City to reasonably require the
Grantee to make necessary repairs or
improvements to abate said condition.
Grantee shall promptly comply with
an order of the Director of the appropriate department of the City having
custody and control of the particular
property or the responsibility to
ensure the health, safety or welfare of
the public in the particular situation
to make any such repairs or improvements.

efforts to meet such goals, the City
shall give consideration to the availability of certain specialty items of
equipment for the Steam System that
are not readily available from minority and female vendors.
Grantee shall adhere to the standards set forth in division (a) of Section 187.04 of the Codified Ordinances
of the City, as presently in effect with
respect
to
nondiscrimination

of the improvement and expansion of
the Steam System comprising real

the requirements of Chapter 188 of the
Codified Ordinances of the City and
with all other City, State of Ohio and
federal laws and regulations now or
hereafter applicable to Grantee.
Section 6. Transfers and Assignments.
The franchise granted to the
Grantee herein shall not be transferable either directly or indirectly
except with the consent of Council,
provided, however, that the grant of a
mortgage on or security interest in or
assignment of real or personal property comprising the Steam System,
including but not limited to Grantee’s
right to receive payments from Customers (including the City) with
respect to the Steam System, as collateral security for financing of obligations of Grantee, shall not constitute
or be deemed to be a transfer for purposes of this Section 6; and provided,
further that nothing in any such mortgage, security interest or assignment
shall purport to transfer the franchise
granted herein except with the consent of Council. Additionally, Grantee
shall not, without consent of Council,
either directly or indirectly, consolidate, merge or in any other way give
or permit control of the management
of its business to or by any other heating, cooling or power company now
operating or that may in the future
operate in the City, including any
company which would by such action
by Grantee first enter into the business of providing heating, cooling or
power, nor shall Grantee assign or
transfer so much of the assets of the
Steam System so as to render Grantee
unable to continue providing adequate service as required herein.

this Section 6, the capital stock or all
or substantially all of the assets and
business of Grantee may, without the
prior approval of Council, be (i) transferred to any corporation or other
entity which is affiliated with

and elsewhere used in or useful for
the operation of the utility at a price
to be fixed in the manner provided in
the following sentence. If the City
and Grantee cannot agree on the price
to be paid by the City for such property, the value shall be determined by
three appraisers, one each selected by
the City and Grantee, and the other
selected by the two appraisers
appointed. If the three appraisers cannot agree upon a value for such property, the average of the three sepa-

555

11
rate appraisals of the appraisers shall
be the value of such property. The
standard to be used by the appraisers
shall be the fair market value of such
property as a going concern. Further,
to the extent provided in Section 184
of the Charter of the City, the price to
be paid by the City for the property

The Director of Public Service and
other appropriate City officials are
hereby authorized to issue such permits to the Grantee and any of its construction contractors or subcontractors for construction, installation and

An emergency ordinance to extend
the moratorium on the review and

or permit applications for internet
sweepstakes operations in the City of
Cleveland.
Whereas, under Ordinance No. 136710, passed October 18, 2010, this Council declared a moratorium on the
review and issuance of zoning permits, certificates of occupancy, and
other license or permit applications
for internet sweepstakes operations
in the City of Cleveland, until April
18, 2011; and
Whereas, under Ordinance No. 50811, passed April 11, 2011, this Council

Whereas, this Council has been
researching internet sweepstakes
operations in order to make a determination regarding their classification under the City’s zoning code, and
possible regulations associated with
their activities; and
Whereas, on or about March 19,
2012, a jury returned guilty verdicts
in several cases for Gambling, Operating a Gambling House, and Possession of Criminal Tools, against individuals
that
operated
or
were
employed by internet sweepstakes
businesses prior to the initial moratorium declared by this council, raising
concerns about the legality of all such
businesses; and

April 18, 2012
Whereas, The Ohio General Assembly is considering legislation to
define sweepstakes terminal devices,
to license sweepstakes terminal
device operators and distributors and
to regulate their business operations;
and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure for the immediate preservation of the public peace,
property, health, safety, or welfare in
that an extension of the moratorium
on such internet sweepstakes operations for another six month period
will allow Council to continue to
study the recent court decisions and
other developments involving internet sweepstakes operations in order
to make a determination as to what
action is appropriate for the City;
now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the moratorium on

By Council Members Pruitt, Keane,
Westbrook, Cimperman, Miller, Conwell, Mitchell, Kelley, Cleveland,
Brancatelli, J. Johnson, K. Johnson
and Sweeney.
An emergency resolution supporting Mayor Jackson’s Plan for Transforming the Cleveland Schools, urging all stakeholders to continue working in good faith to resolve all elements of the plan for the benefit of
students, and urging the Ohio General
Assembly to give the highest priority
to pass legislation needed to implement the plan.
Whereas, the Ohio General Assembly changed the governance structure in Cleveland from an elected to
a mayoral appointed board in 1997
by passing House Bill 269, and this
decision
was
overwhelmingly
approved by Cleveland voters in
2002; and
Whereas, while the Cleveland Metropolitan School District has made
progress in student outcomes, the
overall
quality
of
education
in
Cleveland schools is unacceptable
and the pace of improvement is
inadequate — 55 percent of Cleveland schools (district and charter)
were in academic watch or academic emergency in the 2010-11 school
year; and
Whereas, for every 100 students
entering ninth grade in Cleveland,
63 will graduate high school, 34 of
those graduates will enroll in college, and just seven will graduate
with a bachelor’s degree; and
Whereas, the Mayor of the City of
Cleveland has declared his highest
priority the transformation plan to
reinvent public education in our city
with a goal to ensure every child in
Cleveland attends a high quality
school and every neighborhood has
a multitude of great schools from
which families can choose; and
Whereas, to do this, Cleveland
must transition from a traditional
school district to a new system of
district and charter schools held to
the highest standards and work in
partnership to create dramatic student achievement gains; and
Whereas, the plan is driven by a
fierce sense of urgency and sense of
hope, as Cleveland has already
started this journey to transformation with investments in new and
redesigned
schools,
partnerships
between the district and high-performing charter schools, and investments in schools; and
Whereas, the number of excellent
and effective district and charter
schools in Cleveland has grown

April 18, 2012
from 14 in 2006 to 37 in 2011, and
the plan will grow this number of
excellent schools in exchange for
accountability
for
performance
while creating an environment that
empowers and values principals and
teachers as professionals and makes
certain that our students are held to
the highest expectations; and
Whereas,
Cleveland’s
plan
is
based on emerging national models,
or portfolio strategy, that implements seven tenets of autonomy and
accountability, including Citywide
choices and options for all families,
school autonomy, pupil-based funding, diverse support providers, talent-seeking strategy, extensive public engagement, and performancebased accountability for all schools;
and
Whereas, Cleveland’s goal is that
at the end of six years, the number
of Cleveland students enrolled in
high-performing district and charter
schools will be tripled, and failing
schools eliminated; and
Whereas, Mayor Jackson and the
Cleveland Metropolitan School District have identified the following
areas where the General Assembly’s
action is necessary to give the District
the
flexibility
needed
to
achieve academic excellence: district autonomy and flexibility, modern employment practices without
eroding the principals of collective
bargaining, District-Charter partnerships, charter sector quality, and
targeted financial support for the
plan; and
Whereas, this Council encourages
engagement of all interested parties, including the Mayor, Superintendent, and Cleveland Teachers
Union, and urges them to continue
to work together with open discussion and urgent intent solely in the
interest of the children of the City
of Cleveland; and
Whereas, this Council calls on the
Majority and Minority Delegations
of the House and Senate to join with
the sponsors and act on legislation,
House Bill 506 and Senate Bill 325,
needed to implement this plan; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports Mayor Jackson’s Plan for
Transforming the Cleveland Schools,
urges all stakeholders to continue
working in good faith to resolve all
elements of the plan for the benefit
of students, and urges the Ohio General Assembly to give the highest
priority to pass legislation needed to
implement the plan.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to send copies of this resolution to the Chief of Government
Affairs to distribute to members of
the Ohio General Assembly.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
