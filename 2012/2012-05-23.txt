Ord. No. 756-12.
By Council Members Mitchell and J.
Johnson.
An emergency ordinance designating East 89th Street from Carnegie
Avenue to Quincy Avenue with a secondary and honorary designation of
“William F. Boyd Sr. Way”.
Whereas, William F. Boyd Sr.
recently celebrated his 75th Anniversary of public service to the Greater
Cleveland community, and still conducts services at his family business
funeral home; and
Whereas, William Francis Boyd
was born on February 7, 1915 on 38th
and Central Avenue, and attended
Quincy
Elementary
School
and
Patrick Henry Junior High School,
graduated
from
Glenville
High
School in 1933 and completed postgraduate courses for one year at Central High School; and
Whereas, having no money to pursue a degree during the Depression,
Mr. Boyd graduated from Cleveland
College of Embalming in 1938, and
joined his father Elmer Boyd in
expanding his funeral home business
with the purchase of Slaughter Funeral Home at 2165 East 89th Street, and
the “& Son” was added to the firm
name; and
Whereas, “Bill” as he is affectionately known and his wife, Mary,
raised three children, William F.
“Pepper” Boyd, II, Marina Elisabeth,
and Marcella Millicent, and are members of Antioch Baptist Church where
Bill served as a Trustee and Deacon;
and
Whereas, Mr. Boyd chaired the first
Cleveland NAACP Freedom Fund
Dinner in 1959, and was appointed to
the Cleveland School Board in 1963
where he later became Vice President;
Whereas, he is committed to the
African-American community, having
served on the Eliza Bryant Skilled
Nursing Facility Board for over 24
years, received the Silver Beaver
Award from the Boy Scouts, served as
a member of the Central Area Council,
the Urban League, and the Prince
Hall Excelsior Masonic Lodge; and
Whereas, the Urban League recognized the Boyd Family as the “Family
of the Year” in the 1970s, and Bill’s
example inspired all three of the Boyd
children to become a part of the family funeral home business; Bill and
Mary are grandparents of 9 and greatgrandparents of 14; and
Whereas, this Council wants to
honor William F. Boyd Sr. for his tireless public service to our community
with a bright smile, infectious laugh,
strong work ethic, boundless Christian faith and belief in integrity that
have inspired many to say he is the
kindest man they’ve ever known; and

May 23, 2012
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes

and
Whereas,

Inc. assigned all of its rights under
the MDA to Chagrin Highlands, Ltd.
contemporaneously with the execution of the first amendment to the
MDA; and
Whereas, the City and Chagrin
Highlands, Ltd, wish to amend the
MDA to incorporate certain agreedupon terms; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Economic Development is authorized to enter into a Second Amendment to the Master Development
Agreement, Contract No. 40622, with
Chagrin Highlands Ltd., to change
the following terms of the agreement:
1. Tract Purchase Limits Deleted.
The definition of “Reserved Land” in
Section 1 of the MDA is deleted and
replaced with:
“Reserved land” shall mean any
portions of the Property designated
as such by the Developer in its exercise notice under Section 4.2; provided, however, that in no event may the
Developer designate more than thirty-six percent (36%) of the Area of
the Adjusted Property as Reserved
Land, except that for purposes of this
limitation after New Land is added to
the Property, Developer may additionally designate as Reserved Land
(whether in the New Land or in any
other location) additional acreage
equivalent to not more than forty percent (40%) of the Area of New Land.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Reserved Land shall in no
event be deemed to include the Areas
of the Initial Parcel, the Seed Parcel
or any part of the Property (or any
interest therein) which is directly or
indirectly conveyed, or is to be conveyed, to the State of Ohio, any municipality or any governmental or quasigovernmental entity for use in conjunction with the construction or
improvement of the Interchange or
any public highway, dedicated street
or public right-of-way, or any widening, extension or reconfiguration
thereof.”.
2. Updated Appraiser Qualifications.
Exhibit
D
to
the
MDA
(Appraisal Procedure), Exhibit 4
(Appraisal Procedure) to Exhibit D
(Form of Ground Lease) and Exhibit
O (Calculated Land Rental Appraisal
Procedure) are amended by deleting
clauses (i) and (ii) from paragraph 1
of each Exhibit, and substituting:
(i) an MAI or SRPA member of the
Appraisal Institute (or its successor
organization or, if it no longer exists,
an organization with similar requirements for membership, existing at
such time), or

833

61
(ii) an ASA accreditation from the
American Society of Appraisers (or
its successor organization or, if it no
longer exists, an organization with

existing at such time); and
3. Exhibit G to the MDA (Appraisal
Procedure) is amended to add the following paragraph:
For each purchase of Reserved
Land which (a) closed during the
period of five (5) years prior to the
Occurrence Date and (b) was effected
by transfer of such Reserved Land
directly from the City to a nominee of
Developer which was not an affiliate
of Developer (an “Independent Purchaser”), Developer shall make available for review by the appraiser(s)
and the City such documentation as is
reasonably required to determine the
full value of all consideration paid by
each Independent Purchaser for
Reserved Land. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if Developer is subject to a
covenant for the benefit of such Independent Purchaser which prohibits
disclosure to the appraiser(s) and the
City of the consideration paid by the
Independent Purchaser, Developer
shall not be required to make documents pertaining to such transaction
available unless Developer obtains a
waiver of the covenant from such
Independent Purchaser; provided,
however, that Developer shall use
reasonable efforts (without payment
or other consideration) to obtain such
waiver. From and after the date of the
Second Amendment of the Master
Development Agreement, Developer
shall not enter into any agreement
with an Independent Purchaser
which would prevent Developer from
making available for review by the
appraiser(s) and the City such documentation as is reasonably required
to determine the full value of all consideration paid by such Independent
Purchaser for Reserved Land.
4. Diversity. Developer agrees that
from and after the date of this Second
Amendment, Developer shall (a)
request assurance from each Independent Purchaser (as defined in Exhibit
G) and each independent third party
to
which
Developer
transfers
Reserved Land purchased by Developer (each an “Independent Purchaser”) that such Independent Purchaser
has adopted, or will adopt, meaningful diversity policies, and (b) provide
to Independent Purchasers information necessary to access (i) the City’s
current registry of certified Minority
Business Enterprises (“MBE”) and
Female
Business
Enterprises
(“FBE”) for construction and supply
chain needs, and (ii) the services of
Employment Connections for human
capital needs.
5. Miscellaneous. All capitalized
terms not defined in this Amendment
shall have the meaning given such
terms in the MDA. The MDA, as
amended by this Second Amendment,
is ratified and affirmed and shall
remain in full force and effect. This
Second Amendment may be executed
in counterparts, each of which shall
be deemed an original, but all of
which shall constitute one and the
same instrument.
Section 2. That the Second Amendment shall be prepared by the Director of Law.
Section 3. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure
and, provided it receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take

62
effect and be in force immediately
upon its passage and approval by the
