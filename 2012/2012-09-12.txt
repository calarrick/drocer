An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Economic Development to enter into an amendment to

Court Apartment Associates Limited
Partnership, to accept a discount prepayment of the SBRL loan regarding
the construction of the Crittenden
Court Apartments; and authorizing
the Director of Economic Development to enter into a subordination
agreement concerning the UDAG loan
for the project.
Whereas, the current owners of the
Crittenden Court Apartments, the
Crittenden Court Apartment Associates Limited Partnership (“CCAA”)
are seeking to refinance their FHAinsured 223(a)(7) loan at a lower
interest rate in order to improve cash
flow and to offset the increased operating expenses created by the expiration of a fifteen-year property tax
abatement which ended in 2011; and
Whereas, CCAA has stated that the
refinancing will result in additional
loan proceeds which will pay for eligible costs beyond repayment of the
current first mortgage and related
financing costs; and
Whereas, in addition the FHAinsured loan, CCAA also has a Urban
Development Action Grant (“UDAG”)
loan in the amount of $3,017,951 due
September 2036 and a Small Business
Revolving Loan (“SBRL”) in the
amount of $400,000 due July 1, 2036 on
the project; and
Whereas, CCAA’s successful refinancing of the first mortgage at a
lower rate and the prepayment of the
SBRL loan will increase the likelihood for the project to generate surplus cash sufficient to make pay-

ments on the UDAG loan prior to its
September 2036 due date; and
Whereas, the SBRL loan, with a current principal balance of $400,000,
plus accrued interest of $180,000 as of
September 2012, equals a total balance of $580,000 which is not due until
July 1, 2036, unless surplus cash is
sufficient to make the payment; and
Whereas, CCAA has requested that
the City accept a discounted prepayment to pay off its $400,000 SBRL and
accrued interest, at its net present
value of $330,454, which is determined
by discounting by a rate of two and
four tenths percent (2.4%) annually
the principal payment due July 1,
2036; and
Whereas, CCAA also requests subordination of its UDAG Loan with the
City to the new HUD-insured first
mortgage; and
Whereas, this ordinance allows the
Department of Economic Development o use the lump sum repayment
for other City programs or projects in
need of financial assistance; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the immediate preservation of the
public peace, safety, property and
welfare, in that its enactment is a necessary prerequisite to providing
immediate assistance to create and
job
opportunities
and
preserve
advance and promote commercial and

porarily
placing

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
REPRINT
Ord. No. 798-11.
By Council Members Miller, Kelley,
Cleveland, Zone, Cimperman, Keane
Sweeney
(by
departmental
and
request).
An ordinance to provide for the consideration of Complete and Green
Street elements in all construction
projects within the public right-ofway.
Whereas, Complete and Green
Streets address the livability and
environmental needs of our community with multipurpose streets that better accommodate walkers, cyclists,
and public transportation while
reducing the environmental impact of
our transportation infrastructure by
incorporating green infrastructure
strategies to reduce waste, storm
water run-off and energy consumption; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland is
committed to the creation of a network of Complete and Green Streets
that will improve the economic, environmental and social well-being of
citizens; and
Whereas, Cleveland’s network of
Complete and Green Streets will provide safe and desirable travel for
users of all ages and abilities and
accommodate pedestrians, cyclists,
motorists and transit while also incorporating best management practices
in green infrastructure; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland recognizes the need to provide a Complete and Green Streets policy to
assist in the management of stormwater runoff and provide environmental
benefit; and
Whereas, other jurisdictions and
agencies nationwide have adopted
Complete and Green Streets legislation in furtherance of these guiding
policies; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Capital Projects is authorized to
implement and enforce policies and
guidelines related to Complete and
Green Streets in all construction projects within the public right of way.
Construction projects include new
construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, resurfacing, and streetscape
enhancements.
Section 2. That Complete Street elements are based on guidelines contained in the following documents or
organization policies: the Cleveland
Bikeway Master Plan, the Americans
with Disabilities Act, Engineering
and
Construction
Specifications,
Cleveland Public Power Streetlight
Guidelines, Traffic Engineering Signal guidelines, the Highway Capacity
Manual, the Streetscape Design
Guidelines Handbook, the Greater
Cleveland RTA Transit Waiting
Environment Manual, the Citywide
Plan, and other guidelines that may
be developed. These guidelines shall
be followed on all new construction,

reconstruction, rehabilitation, resurfacing, and streetscape enhancements with the exception of maintenance projects.
Section 3. That Green Street elements are based on guidelines contained in the following documents or
organization
policies:
Cleveland
Water Pollution Control guidelines,
Engineering and Construction Specifications, Cleveland Public Power
Streetlight Guidelines, Traffic Engineering
Signal
Guidelines,
the
Streetscape Design Guidelines Handbook, the Northeast Ohio Regional
Sewer District stormwater plans, the
Ohio Department of Transportation
and Ohio Environmental Protection
Agency Best Management Practices
for Green Streets, and other guidelines that may be developed.
Section 4. That Green infrastructure or Complete Streets elements on
resurfacing projects and other roadway maintenance projects conducted
by the City of Cleveland shall be limited to minimal impact improvements
that do not affect sub base, curbs and
sidewalks or other elements outside
the scope of a project of maintenance
resurfacing. Elements that may be
included are paint re-striping, sharrows, signage for cyclists or pedestrians and the use of recycled asphalt.
Section 5. That the Director of Capital Projects shall be authorized to
consult an advisory committee to
include representatives of all effected
City Departments, Northeast Ohio
Regional Sewer District, Greater
Cleveland Regional Transit Authority, and the Northeast Ohio Areawide
Coordinating Agency to review the
improvement and any requests for
exemptions from the Complete and
Green Streets guidelines and, upon
consultation with other City Departments, approve exemptions where
appropriate. The Director of Capital
Projects shall provide notice of all
exemption requests to the City Council member or members whose ward
or wards include a project seeking an
exemption.

Section 6. That exemptions to be
considered include, but are not limited to, the following items:
(a) areas where bicyclists and
pedestrians are prohibited by law,
provided that alternative facilities or
accommodations
for
pedestrians/cyclists are provided
within the same transportation corridor;
(b) financial hardship to the project sponsor. Financial hardship
exists when compliance with Complete and Green policies and guidelines consititutes a minimum of twenty (20) per cent of the total project
cost, but in no event more than one
million dollars;
(c) severe topographic or natural
resource constraints;
(d) existing structures do not allow
for implementation of Complete and
Green Street elements;
(e) inclusion of Complete and
Green Street elements could result in
threats to the safety and welfare of
pedestrians, cyclists, or motorists; or
(f) public transit enhancements
when the street is not on a public transit route.
Section
7.
That
all
projects
approved under the Complete and
Green Streets policy include provisions for ongoing maintenance of the
improvements. A life cycle cost analysis may be used to determine the feasibility of the improvements. Alternative maintenance arrangements may
be utilized to reduce the costs to the
City for ongoing maintenance, such
as maintenance agreements with
adjacent property owners.
Section 8. That the Director of Capital Projects shall provide an annual
progress report to Council on the
implementation of the Complete and
Green Streets Policy.
Section 9. That this ordinance shall
be effective January 1, 2012.
Section 10. That this ordinance
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Passed September 19, 2011.
Effective October 19, 2011.
