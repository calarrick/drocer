Resolution No. 229-12.
By Director Cox.
Whereas, under Section 131.08 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976 (C.O.), Board of Control Resolution No. 161-91, adopted
on March 27, 1991, as amended by
Resolution No. 36-99, adopted April
1, 1999, Resolution No. 196-02, adopted April 10, 2002, and Resolution No.
113-06, adopted April 5, 2006, establishes rents charged for certain special events; and
Whereas,
under
Section
131.15
C.O., Board of Control Resolution No.
117-03, adopted February 26, 2003, as

May 30, 2012
amended by Resolutions No. 407-05,
adopted August 3, 2005, and No. 59305, adopted October 19, 2005, establishes the rental rates to be charged
for the Public Auditorium; and
Whereas, the United States Marine
Corps (“Marine Corps”) through its
contracting agent, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command (“NAVFAC”), is planning to conduct a
large event in Cleveland from June
10, 2012 through June 17, 2012
(“Marine Week”) necessitating the
closure of more than 0.5 miles of
City streets and using City-owned
property, including Public Square,
Parcel
B,
Voinovich
Park,
and
Burke Lakefront Airport, for the use
of which Section 131.08 C.O. requires
a Special Event Concession Agreement; and,
Whereas,
under
Section
131.08
C.O., the Board of Control may consider without limitation the following
considerations
entitling
the
Marines to an abatement of the
rents established under Board of
Control Res. No. 161-91, as amended,
to conduct Marine Week: (1) the
economic impact of the event on the
Greater Cleveland economy; (2) the
extent to which the special event
will preserve the City’s recreational
use Immunity; and (3) the percentage of the special event gross revenues which will accrue to an organization qualifying under Section
501 (c)(3) of the Internal Revenue
Code; and,
Whereas,
the
City
anticipates
Marine Week will have a significant
economic impact on the local economy as reflected in sales, parking
occupancy, and transient occupancy
taxes paid by the 100,000 people
expected to attend the closing weekend events alone; and,
Whereas, because Marine Week is
free and open to the public it will
preserve the recreational use immunity granted to the City as a
landowner under Section 1533.181 of
the Revised Code, and neither the
Marine Corps nor the Department of
the Navy will derive any gross revenues from conduct of the event;
and,
Whereas,
notwithstanding
that

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Ord. No. 12-12.
By Council Members Pruitt, Zone,
Polensek, Brady, Conwell, Brancatelli and Cummins.
An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting
new Section 603.092, relating to tethering animals.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio 1976 are
supplemented by enacting new Section 603.092 to read as follows:
603.092 Tethering Animals
(a) No person shall tether an animal in any of the following circumstances:
(1) For more than 6 hours total in a
24-hour period and not more than 2
consecutive hours with no less than a
one-hour period between tetherings;
(2) Between the hours of 10:00 p.m.
and 6:00 a.m.;

862

May 30, 2012
(3) If a heat or cold advisory has
been issued by a local or state authority or the National Weather Service;
(4) If a severe weather warning
has been issued by a local or state
authority or the National Weather
Service;
(5) If the tether is less than 20 feet
in length;
(6) If the tether allows the animal
to touch the fence or cross the property line or cross onto public property;
(7) If the tether is attached by
means of a pinch-type, prong-type, or
choke-type collar or if the collar is
unsafe or is not properly fitted;
(8) If the tether may cause injury
or entanglement;
(9) If the animal is not provided
with its needs as identified in division
(b) of Section 603.091;
(10) If the tether is made of a material that is unsuitable for the animal’s
size and weight or that causes any
unnecessary discomfort to the animal;
(11) If no owner or occupant is present at the premises.
(b) As used in this section, “tether”
means a rope, chain, cord, dog run or
pulley, or similar restraint for holding an animal in place, allowing a
radius in which it can move about.
(c) Whoever violates this section is
guilty of a minor misdemeanor on the
first offense, a misdemeanor of the
fourth degree on the second offense,
and a misdemeanor of the first degree
on the third or any subsequent
offense. Notwithstanding the foregoing penalties, if an animal becomes
sick or injured as a result of a violation of this section, then whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree.”
Section 2. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure
and, provided it receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take
effect and be in force immediately
upon its passage and approval by the
Mayor; otherwise it shall take effect
and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.
Passed May 21, 2012.
Effective May 25, 2012.

Ord. No. 208-12.
By Council Members Conwell,
Mitchell and Sweeney (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance to amend
Section 413.031 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as
amended by Ordinance No. 281-09,
passed March 9, 2009, relating to the
use of automated cameras to impose
civil penalties upon red light and
speeding violators.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 413.031 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended by
Ordinance No. 281-09, passed March
9, 2009, is amended to read as follows:
Section 413.031 Use of Automated
Cameras to Impose Civil Penalties
upon Red Light and Speeding Violators

May 30, 2012
(a) Civil Enforcement System
Established. The City of Cleveland
hereby adopts a civil enforcement
system for red light and speeding
offenders photographed by means of
an ”automated traffic enforcement
camera system” as defined in division
(p). This civil enforcement system
imposes monetary liability on the
”owner” of a vehicle as defined in division (p) for failure of an operator to
stop at a traffic signal displaying a
steady red light indication or for the
failure of an operator to comply with
a speed limitation.
(b) Red Light Offense – Liability
Imposed. The owner of a vehicle shall
be liable for the penalty imposed
under this section if the vehicle crosses a marked stop line or the intersection plane at a system location when
the traffic signal for that vehicle’s
direction is emitting a steady red
light.
(c) Speeding Offense – Liability
Imposed. The owner of a vehicle shall
be liable for the penalty imposed
under this section if the vehicle is
operated at a speed in excess of the
limitations set forth in Section 433.03.
(d) Liability Does Not Constitute a
Conviction. The imposition of liability under this section shall not be
deemed a conviction for any purpose
and shall not be made part of the operating record of any person on whom
the liability is imposed.
(e) Other Offenses and Penalties
Not Abrogated. Nothing in this section shall be construed as altering or
limiting Sections 433.03 or 413.03 of
these Codified Ordinances, the criminal penalties imposed by those sections, or the ability of a police officer
to enforce those sections against any
offender observed by the officer violating either of those sections. Nothing in this section shall be construed
to limit the liability of an operator of
a vehicle for any violation of division
(b) or (c) of this section.
(f) Selection of Camera Sites. The
selection of the sites where automated cameras are placed and the
enforcement of this ordinance shall
be made on the basis of sound professional traffic engineering and law
enforcement judgments. Automated
cameras shall not be placed at any
site where the speed restrictions or
the timing of the traffic signal fail to
conform to sound professional traffic
engineering principles.
(g) Locations. The following are
the locations for the Automated Traffic Enforcement Camera System:
Locations

The Director of Public Safety shall
cause the general public to be notified
by means of a press release issued at
least thirty days before any given
camera is made fully-operational and
is used to issue tickets to offenders.
Before a given camera issues actual
tickets, there shall be a period of at
least two weeks, which may run concurrently with the 30-day publicnotice period, during which only
”warning” notices shall be issued.
At each site of a red light or fixed
speed camera, the Director of Public
Works shall cause signs to be posted
to
apprise
ordinarily
observant
motorists that they are approaching
an area where an automated camera
is monitoring for red light or speed
violators. Mobile speed units shall be
plainly marked vehicles.
(h) Notices of Liability. Any ticket
for an automated red light or speeding system violation under this section shall:
(1) Be reviewed by a Cleveland
police officer;
(2) Be forwarded by first-class mail
or personal service to the vehicle’s
registered owner’s address as given
on the state’s motor vehicle registration, and
(3) Clearly state the manner in
which the violation may be appealed.
(i) Penalties. Any violation of division (b) or division (c) of this section
shall be deemed a noncriminal violation for which a civil penalty shall be
assessed and for which no points
authorized by RC 4507.021 (”Point system for license suspension”) shall be
assigned to the owner or driver of the
vehicle.
(j) Ticket Evaluation, Public Service, and Appeals. The program shall
include a fair and sound ticket-evaluation process that includes review by
the vendor and a police officer, a
strong customer-service commitment,
and an appeals process that accords
due process to the ticket respondent
and that conforms to the requirements of the Ohio Revised Code.
(k) Appeals. A notice of appeal
shall be filed with the Hearing Officer within twenty-one (21) days from
the date listed on the ticket. The failure to give notice of appeal or pay the
civil penalty within this time period
shall constitute a waiver of the right
to contest the ticket and shall be considered an admission.
Appeals shall be heard by the Parking Violations Bureau through an
administrative process established by
the Clerk of the Cleveland Municipal
Court. At hearings, the strict rules of
evidence applicable to courts of law
shall not apply. The contents of the
ticket shall constitute a prima facie

863

11
evidence of the facts it contains. Liability may be found by the hearing
examiner based upon a preponderance of the evidence. If a finding of
liability is appealed, the record of the
case shall include the order of the
Parking Violations Bureau, the Ticket, other evidence submitted by the
respondent or the City of Cleveland,
and a transcript or record of the hearing, in a written or electronic form
acceptable to the court to which the
case is appealed.
Liability shall not be found where
the evidence shows that the automated camera captured an event is not an
offense, including each of the following events and such others as may be
established by rules and regulations
issued by the Director of Public Safety under the authority of division (n)
of this section:
(1) The motorist stops in time to
avoid violating a red light indication;
(2) The motorist proceeds through
a red light indication as part of funeral procession;
(3) The motorist is operating a
City-owned emergency vehicle with
its emergency lights activated and
proceeds through a red light indication or exceeds the posted speed limitation;
(4) The motorist is directed by a
police officer on the scene contrary to
the traffic signal indication.
Liability shall also be excused if a
vehicle is observed committing an
offense where the vehicle was stolen
prior to the offense and the owner has
filed a police report.
The Director of Public Safety, in
coordination with the Parking Violations Bureau, shall establish a
process by which a vehicle owner who
was not the driver at the time of the
alleged offense may, by affidavit,
name the person who the owner
believes was driving the vehicle at
the time. Upon receipt of such an affidavit timely submitted to the Parking
Violations Bureau, the Bureau shall
suspend further action against the
owner of the vehicle and instead
direct notices and collection efforts to
the person identified in the affidavit.
If the person named in the affidavit,
when notified, denies being the driver
or denies liability, then the Parking
Violations Bureau shall resume the
notice and collection process against
the vehicle owner, the same as if no
affidavit had been submitted, and if
the violation is found to have been
committed by a preponderance of evidence, the owner shall be liable for
any penalties imposed for the offense.
A decision in favor of the City of
Cleveland may be enforced by means
of a civil action or any other means
provided by the Ohio Revised Code.
(l) Evidence of Operation. It is
prima facie evidence that the person
registered as the owner of the vehicle
with the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles, or with any other State vehicle
registration office, or in the case of a
leased or rented vehicle. the ”lessee”
as defined in division (p), was operating the vehicle at the time of the
offenses set out in divisions (b) and
(c) of this section.
(m) Program Oversight. The Director of Public Safety shall oversee the
program authorized by this section.
The Director of Public Works shall
oversee the installation and maintenance of all automated cameras. An
encroachment permit shall be authorized in the legislation in which locations are selected.

any dog, or owner or person in charge
of the premises upon which a dog is

charge shall be in addition to any
other repayments that may be owed
under this chapter.
(e) Payment of charges for redeeming a dog or cat which was impounded
because it was found in violation of
Section 603.02 shall not exempt the
owner of the dog or cat from prosecution under that section.

May 30, 2012
(f) Any fee established under this
section may be waived by the Director
of Public Safety if the owner of the
impounded animal is determined by
