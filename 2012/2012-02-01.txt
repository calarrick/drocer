FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTION REFERRED
Res. No. 124-12.
By Council Members Polensek, J.
Johnson, Mitchell, Brancatelli, Reed,
Conwell and Brady.
An emergency resolution urging
the Administration’s Department of
Public Works to study and implement
a fee structure for charging nonCleveland residents for use of the City
of Cleveland recreation centers,
including Collinwood Recreation Center.
Whereas, the current practice of the
Department of Public Works is an
open-door policy that allows any person to use the City of Cleveland’s
recreation centers and facilities free
of charge, even if they are not a resident of Cleveland; and
Whereas, a prime example of this
practice is at Collinwood Recreation
Center, where out of 6,541 recreation
users registered, 1,056 are not City of
Cleveland residents; and
Whereas, at Collinwood Recreation
Center these over 1000 attendees are
mostly from the surrounding suburbs
of Euclid, South Euclid, East Cleveland, and Bratenahl; and
Whereas, these additional suburban attendees can cause crowded conditions and difficulty for Cleveland
residents to take advantage of programs and classes; and
Whereas, some suburban Mayors
have expressed concern that Cleveland’s free admission is taking away
from registration at their suburban
facilities or YMCAs that charge a fee
for use; and
Whereas, establishing a fee structure to charge non-residents of Cleveland would provide a much needed
revenue stream to augment programs
and equipment; and
Whereas, in the interim, Council

urges the Public Works Department
to give priority registration to Cleveland residents for programs and
classes; and
Whereas, the Friends of Collinwood
Recreation Center Council supports
the implementation of a fee structure
to charge non-Cleveland residents for
their use of the Collinwood Recreation Center and all Cleveland recreation centers; and
Whereas, Council’s Public Parks,
Recreation and Properties Committee
is encouraged to hold a hearing to
consider this issue; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Administration’s Department of
Public Works to study and implement
a fee structure for charging nonCleveland residents for use of the City
of Cleveland recreation centers,
including Collinwood Recreation Center.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit a copy
of this resolution to Michael Cox,
Director of Public Works.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from
