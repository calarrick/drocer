paper products, for the various divisions of City government, for a period
of two years, with one option to renew
for an additional year, exercisable by
the Director of Finance.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Finance is authorized to make one
or more written requirement contracts under the Charter and the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, for the requirements for
a period of two years, with one
option to renew for an additional
year, exercisable by the Director of
Finance, for the necessary items of
industrial paper products in the
approximate amount as purchased
during the preceding term, purchased by the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies on a unit basis
for the various divisions of City government. Bids shall be taken in a
manner that permits an award to be
made for all items as a single contract, or by separate contract for
each or any combination of the
items as the Board of Control determines. Alternate bids for a period
less than the specified term may be
taken if desired by the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies
until provision is made for the
requirements for the entire term.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into one or more contracts with a term of two years
instead of one year when there is a
financial advantage to the City. For
purposes of this ordinance, a financial advantage shall be determined
by the Director of Finance by comparing the bids received for both
terms.
Section 2. That the costs of the contract or contracts shall be charged
against the proper appropriation
accounts and the Director of Finance
shall certify the amount of any purchase under the contract, each of
which purchases shall be made on
order of the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies under a delivery
order against the contract or contracts certified by the Director of
Finance. (RQN 1505, RL 2012-21)
Section 3. That under Section 108(b)
of the Charter, the purchases authorized by this ordinance may be made
through cooperative arrangements
with other governmental agencies.
The Director of Finance may sign all
documents that are necessary to
make the purchases, and may enter
into one or more contracts with the
vendors selected through that cooperative process.
Section 4. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure
and, provided it receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take

effect and be in force immediately
upon its passage and approval by the

By Council Members Brady, Cimperman, Polensek and J. Johnson.
An emergency resolution declaring
the month of April “Autism Awareness Month” and supporting STEPS
Center for Excellence in Autism and
their Art Show in the rotunda of
Cleveland City Hall.
Whereas, the fifth annual World
Autism Awareness Day, April 2,
2012, will kick-off the month of
April as Autism Awareness Month;
and
Whereas, more than 50 students
from the STEPS Center for Excellence in Autism will showcase their
artistic endeavors at a special art
exhibition in the rotunda of Cleveland City Hall on World Autism
Day, April 2, 2012; and
Whereas, following the art exhibition from 4:30 to 6:30, the student
artists will be recognized during the
7:00 Cleveland City Council meeting;
and
Whereas, the STEPS student artwork will remain on display in
Cleveland City Hall’s rotunda during the month of April; and
Whereas,
Cleveland
landmarks,
the Terminal Tower, the Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, and
the Browns Stadium, will light up in
blue in honor of World Autism Day
beginning at midnight on April 2nd;
and
Whereas, other notable structures
and sites around the globe will be

lit including Niagara Falls, the Sydney Opera House, Madison Square
Garden, the Hungarian Parliament
Building
and
the
Christ
the
Redeemer Statue in Brazil; and
Whereas, diagnoses of autism and
other pervasive developmental disorders are increasing exponentially
on a global scale; and
Whereas, the Center for Disease
Control
reported
recently
that
approximately 1 out of every 88 children are diagnosed with Autism
Spectrum Disorder; and
Whereas, there are several educational programs available, such as
Applied Behavior Analysis, Applied
Verbal Analysis, Occupational Therapy, and Social Skills Therapy; and
Whereas, the arts offer avenues of
communication not otherwise afforded to people on the autism spectrum;
and
Whereas, STEPS Center for Excellence in Autism employs interestsbased
educational
opportunities,
incorporating the arts into everyday
education; and
Whereas,
William
Stillman,
Autism
Spectrum
Self-Advocate,
Author, and Consultant describes
autism in his book, From the Autism
Answer Book (Sourcebooks, 2007) as
follows: “Autism is a unique way of
being and a natural variation on the
human
experience.
Those
with
autism are often inherently gentle
and exquisitely sensitive. They may
perceive the world through a multifaceted, multi-sensory prism more
interesting and complicated than
those considered typical. Physiologically, autism is a common neuro-

433

logical miscommunication between
brain and body that results in vocal
and physical blips, misfires, and disconnects. This does NOT affect one’s
intelligence any more than it does
someone recovering from a stroke or
compromised
by
cerebral
palsy.
You’ve
experienced
autistic-like
symptoms if you’ve ever awakened
in the middle of the night to the
realization that your arm is “asleep”
and your brain cannot will your
deadened limb to budge. What if the
same nighttime paralysis arbitrarily
shifted to any of your body parts or
lodged in your voice box and precluded you from talking? People
with autism describe a similar challenge to assimilate with a physical
body that feels like cement, causing
speech and motor limitations.”
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby declares the month of April
“Autism Awareness Month” and supports STEPS Center for Excellence
in Autism and their Art Show in the

Section 2. That the Clerk of Council

maintenance of newspaper dispensing devices; and to supplement the
codified ordinances by enacting new
Section 680.051 relating to exceptions
to newspaper dispensing devices

Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 680.05 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended by
Ordinance
No.
1375-02,
passed
November 25, 2002, is amended to
read as follows:
Section 680.05 Criteria for Installation, Placement and Maintenance of

placed or maintained:
(1) in such manner as to rest, in
whole or in part, in, on or over any
portion of a roadway;
(2) in One-Family, Two-Family or

underlying a public bus stop which
has no shelter, a newspaper dispensing device or devices may be placed
within two feet (2') of that edge of
the concrete pad which is perpendicular to the curb edge of the roadway
and furthest forward in the direction
of traffic on the street (the “leading
edge”). In the event that a bus company installs a concrete pad at a public
bus stop where there is no shelter and
subsequently makes application to
the City to install a shelter upon that
pad, any permit which has been
issued for a newspaper dispensing
device which is located upon that pad
and which will not comply with the

division (a)(2)B. of this section after
installation of the shelter shall terminate upon notice from the City that
the City has issued to the bus company a permit to erect a shelter;
B. where there is a concrete pad
underlying a shelter at a public bus
stop, a newspaper dispensing device
or devices may be placed within two
feet (2') of the leading edge of the
concrete pad, provided that such
placement will result in a clear space
of five feet (5') along the entire
width of the pad between the shelter
and the newspaper dispensing device
or devices;
C. The requirement set forth in division (a)(12) of this section shall not
apply to any newspaper dispensing
device which is in compliance with
division (a)(2)A. or (a)(2)B. of this
section;
D. Notwithstanding the provisions
at the end of this division (a), a newspaper dispensing device which is in
compliance with division (a)(2)A. or
(a)(2)B. of this section may be placed

The City Record
more than thirty-six inches (36") from
the curb edge of the roadway;
(3) within five feet (5') of any
crosswalk; provided that in cases
where there is a handicapped ramp to
the street adjacent to a crosswalk, the
five feet (5') required by this division
shall be measured from the edge of
the handicapped ramp that is furthest
from the crosswalk;
(4) within five feet (5') of any fire
hydrant, fire call box or police call
box;
(5) within five feet (5') of any driveway;
(6) except in One-Family, TwoFamily, or Multi-Family Districts:
A. where there is no bus shelter at a
bus stop, within forty feet (40') back
of a sign identifying a particular bus
company or bus route number and
marking a designated bus stop;
B. where there is a bus shelter at a
bus stop, within five feet (5') forward
and forty feet (40') back of the end of
the shelter that is closest to the sign
identifying a particular bus company
or bus route number and marking a
designated bus stop;

traffic sign;
(8) within three feet (3') of any
public utility pole, provided further
that placement adjacent to a public
utility pole shall be limited to one side
of the pole;
(9) within that portion of the sidewalk parallel to an area designated
for handicapped parking, a taxi stand
or a commercial loading or unloading
zone;
(10) within the entire width of the
area that is included in the prolongation, projected to the curb or the edge
of the traversable roadway, or any
primary entrance of a building; provided that for purposes of this division, a “primary entrance” is a building entrance with more than one (1)
multi-leafed door;
(11) within three hundred feet
(300') of any other newspaper dispensing device on the same side of the
street in the same block which contains the same issue or edition of the
same newspaper periodical or other
publication;
(12) within three feet (3') of any
public area improved with lawn, flowers, shrubs, trees, tree wells or tree
grates;
(13) on a manhole cover, pull box or
any other area of access to underground utilities;
(14) on either side of East 6th Street
between Euclid Avenue and Superior
Avenue and on either side of East 9th
Street between Prospect Avenue and
Lakeside Avenue, where the continuous, undivided space for the passageway of pedestrians is reduced to less
than twelve feet (12'), and in all
other areas, where the continuous,
undivided space for the passageway
of pedestrians is reduced to less than
six feet (6'); and
(15) in a manner that unreasonably
blocks, obstructs or restricts the free
passage of pedestrians in the lawful
use of the sidewalk.
In the Central Business District,
except as noted below, newspaper dispensing devices shall not be permitted to be located alone and shall be
placed in a group of newspaper dispensing devices adjacent to each
other provided that no more than six
(6) newspaper dispensing devices are
adjacent to each other. For purposes
of this provision, “adjacent” means
flush against each other. If there is no

459

group of newspaper dispensing
devices within three hundred feet
(300') of a proposed location for a single newspaper dispensing device,
then that single device may stand
alone subject to all other location
restrictions. The prohibition on the
location of single newspaper dispensing devices also shall not apply if the
proposed single newspaper dispensing device is on the opposite side of
the street or on a different block from
the group. No group of newspaper dispensing devices shall be placed within fifty feet (50') of any other group
of newspaper dispensing devices or
single newspaper dispensing device.
If an owner proposes a location in the
Central Business District in which
that owners’ newspaper dispensing
device would be standing alone, the
Director shall notify that owner of the
nearest group of dispensing devices.
Outside of the Central Business District, newspaper dispensing devices
may be placed adjacent to each other
provided that no more than four (4)
newspaper dispensing devices are
adjacent to each other. For purposes
of this provision, “adjacent” means
flush against each other. No group of
newspaper dispensing devices shall
be placed within fifty feet (50') of
any other group of newspaper dispensing devices.
When a person requests the placement of a newspaper dispensing
device outside of the Central Business
District, the Director must send notice
of such request to the councilmember
of the ward in which the requested
newspaper dispensing box is to be
placed.

newspaper dispensing devices. Upon
removal of a newspaper dispensing
device, the owner of such device shall
be responsible for repairing any damage to the sidewalk caused by the
installation or placement of such
device. The extent of the repairs to
the sidewalk shall be determined by
the Director, provided that any such
determination may be appealed to
and reviewed by the Board of Zoning

(c)
Except as may be temporarily permitted under Section 680.051, all newspaper dispensing devices shall:
(1) not exceed fifty inches (50") in
height, twenty inches (20") in width
or twenty inches (20") in depth;
(2) be white in color and be of one
of the two designs which have been
approved and are on file with the City
Planning Commission, one of which
shall be a size which accommodates
full sheet publications (the “full sheet
device”) and one of which shall be a
size which accommodates tabloid
publications (the “tabloid device”);
(3) have a functioning coin return
mechanism if a fee is charged;
(4) have affixed in a readily visible
place a permit sticker and a notice

40
setting forth the title, address and
telephone number of a responsible
officer or agent of the owner to contact to report a malfunction of the
coin return mechanism;
(5) be maintained in a properly
functioning, clean, neat and attractive condition, free of rust;
(6) not be used for advertising,
signs or publicity purposes other than
for the display, sale or purchase of the
newspaper, periodical or publication
therein; and
(7) not be stacked one on top of
another.
(d) Identification Signs.
(1) The name of the publication
using either the full sheet device or
the tabloid device may be displayed
within an area that is fifteen inches
(15") in width and twelve inches
(12") in height on the rear of the
device. The letter size in this area
shall not be larger than four inches
(4"), the font shall be Univers and the
color shall be PMS 300 a.k.a. Blue
Scotchlite Ink 883, or its equivalent.
(2) On the front of the full sheet
device, the name of the publication
using the device may be displayed
within an area that is fifteen inches
(15") in width and twelve inches
(12") in height. On the front of a
tabloid device, the name of the publication using the device may be displayed within an area that is twelve

and eleven inches (11") in height. On
either the full sheet device or the
tabloid device, this area shall be

(3) The frontal area of any device
may be configured as a slip panel to
accommodate changeable advertising
related only to the publication or its
non-commercial contents.
(4) No publication may display its
name or any other materials on the
sides of the device.
(e) The City Planning Commission
shall create a special district for
newspaper dispensing devices on
Public Square because of the unique
pedestrian and vehicular traffic patterns thereon. The Commission’s resolution effecting the creation of such
district shall specify the design or
designs of newspaper dispensing
devices within the district and the
locations within the district upon
which newspaper dispensing devices
may be located, notwithstanding any
other provisions of this section to the
contrary. In determining the specific
locations of newspaper dispensing
devices within the district, the City
Planning Commission shall apply
standards that are no more restrictive, and may be less restrictive, than
the provisions of division (a) of this
section. The provisions of this section
shall apply to all newspaper dispensing devices on Public Square. For purposes of this division, “Public Square”
means the four (4) quadrants of Public Square and the sidewalks on either
side of the roadways that bound and
that intersect said quadrants.
(f) (1) Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in division
(a)(2)B., (a)(6)B., (c)(1), (c)(2) or
(c)(7) of this section, newspaper dispensing devices may be installed,
placed, and maintained directly adjacent to and flush against that side of
a public bus shelter which is perpendicular to the curb edge of the roadway and furthest forward in the direction of traffic on the street (the
“downstream side”); provided, however, that if more than one owner

The City Record
desires to install a device at any one
public bus shelter, only multiple-dispensing-device modular units may be
installed, placed, and maintained at
such location. No modular unit shall
be installed unless and until the City
Planning Commission has approved
the design thereof. Where more than
one newspaper dispensing device is
located in the vicinity of the downstream side of a public bus shelter as
of January 1, 1991, said devices may
be moved adjacent to the downstream
side of the shelter until such time as
the
City
Planning
Commission
approves the design of a modular unit
for that location. Owners installing
modular units shall be responsible for
their maintenance and shall purchase
such units on terms and conditions
upon which said owners mutually
agree. Newspaper dispensing devices
or modular units installed and maintained directly adjacent to the downstream side of public bus shelters
may be placed so that the front of the
device is perpendicular to or at an
angle to the roadway; so long as such
device or modular unit is placed adjacent to the downstream side of the
shelter.
(2) If a bus company presents to the
City Planning Commission a bus shelter design which incorporates newspaper dispensing devices or a modular frame therefor into the bus shelter, and if the City Planning Commission approves said design, the following shall not apply to any newspaper
dispensing device which is incorporated into any such bus shelter or
inserted into any such modular frame,
provided that the bus shelter is
installed pursuant to a permit duly
issued by the City:
A. the weight requirements contained in division (d)(2) of Section
680.03;
B. the distance requirements contained in divisions (a)(2)B., (a)(6)B.,
and (a)(12) of this section; and
C. the design requirements contained in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and
(c)(7) of this section.
(g) Subject to the provisions of the
following sentences in this division
and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary
contained
in
divisions
(a)(2)A. or (a)(2)B. of this section, if
a newspaper dispensing device is in
place on a concrete pad at a public bus
stop or public bus shelter in a One-,
Two-, or Multi-Family District as of
January 1, 1991, and if said device
would otherwise not be permitted to
remain at such location because the
concrete pad is of insufficient size to
accommodate the placement of such
device in accordance with the provisions of divisions (a)(2)A. or (a)(2)B.
of this section, said device may
remain at the location it occupied as
of January 1, 1991 until such time as
the concrete pad underlying such public stop or public bus shelter is extended by the bus company and the pad is
of sufficient size to accommodate the
placement of such device. Any newspaper dispensing device that is permitted to remain at a public bus stop
or public bus shelter as a result of the
provisions of this division shall be
removed by its owner if a public bus
company installs a shelter on the concrete pad underlying a public bus stop
or enlarges an existing shelter
unless:
(1) the bus company enlarges the
concrete pad underlying the public
bus stop or bus shelter sufficiently to
accommodate placement of the device

460

April 4, 2012
in accordance with division (a)(2)A.
or (a)(2)B. of this section; or
(2) the owner of the device extends
the bus company’s concrete pad sufficiently to accommodate placement of
the device in accordance with division (a)(2)A. or (a)(2)B. of this section. In the event that the owner
installs such an extension:
A. the owner shall be responsible
for maintaining the extension of the
concrete pad; and
B. if the owner removes the device,
the owner shall promptly:
1. remove the extension of the concrete pad and restore the property
underlying said extension to its condition prior to the installation of the
extension; or
2. transfer its interest in the extension of the concrete pad to another
owner on terms and conditions upon
which the two owners mutually
agree; or
3. transfer its interest in the extension of the concrete pad to the public
bus company on terms and conditions
upon which the owner and the public
bus company mutually agree; provided that the Directors of Capital Projects and City Planning may, in their
sole discretion, permit such concrete
pad to remain in place, absent a transfer of interest pursuant to paragraph
(2)B.2. or (2)B.3. of this division, upon
such terms and conditions as said
Directors mutually agree.
(h) Subject to the provisions of the
following sentences in this division
and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary
contained
in
divisions
(a)(6) or (a)(12) of this section, if a
newspaper dispensing device is in
place on a concrete pad at a public bus
stop or public bus shelter outside of
the Central Business District as of
January 1, 1991, and if such device
would otherwise not be permitted to
remain in the vicinity because a relocation of said device in order to comply with the distance requirements of
this section would result in the placement of said device at a prohibited
location, said device may remain at
the location it occupied as of January
1, 1991. Any newspaper dispensing
device that is permitted to remain at a
public bus stop or public bus shelter
as a result of the provisions of this
division shall be removed by its
owner if a public bus company
installs a shelter on the concrete pad
underlying a public bus stop or
enlarges an existing shelter unless:
(1) the bus company enlarges the
concrete pad underlying the public
bus stop or bus shelter sufficiently to
accommodate placement of the device
in accordance with division (a)(2)A.
or (a)(2)B. of this section; or

from the owner of a Newspaper Dis-

than six (6) months, to the appearance and/or identification of the
device that those divisions prescribe
if the Directors determine that the

purpose. The application shall be submitted no less than 30 days prior to
the first date on which a changed
Device would be displayed at its location and shall include, at least, for the
Device:
(1) The reason for the change(s) to
the Device for which approval is
requested;
(2) The specific location and identification of the Device and a copy of or
all information on the permit sticker
affixed to the Device;
(3) The first and last dates of the
continuous temporary period during
which the owner desires to display
the changed Device;

until the owner restores or replaces it
with a complying Device. The City
shall exercise reasonable care in
removing and storing a Device under
this division (b) but shall have no liability for the condition of the Device
or any damage to it in connection
with removal and storage.
