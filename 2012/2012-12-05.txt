ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 1365-12.
By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency resolution supporting the American Lung Association in
its campaign to protect the Clean Air
Act, urging the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency to fully employ
and enforce the Clean Air Act, and
opposing all attempts to weaken,
delay or otherwise prevent the EPA
from enforcing the Clean Air Act.
Whereas, polluted outdoor air is
now recognized as a public health
problem nationally, statewide and
locally; and
Whereas, numerous studies confirm deleterious health effects from
air pollution levels once deemed safe;
and
Whereas, air pollution exacerbates
chronic lung disease and asthma
resulting in increased numbers of
emergency room visits and hospitalization, and is also implicated in
heart disease, strokes and premature
deaths; and
Whereas, air pollution particularly
affects the most vulnerable citizens:
seniors, children and those with compromised health; and
Whereas, since 1970, the Clean Air
Act has protected the air we breathe
through a proven, comprehensive,
successful system of pollution control
that saves lives and creates economic
benefits exceeding its costs; and
Whereas, the Clean Air Act develops scientifically based standards for
Particulate Matter (soot), Ground
Level Ozone (smog), Mercury and Air
Toxics and Carbon Pollution to protect the public from their hazardous
effects; and
Whereas, healthy air will protect
the public health, save lives and
reduce health care costs; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,

1942

December 5, 2012
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports the American Lung
Association in its campaign to protect the Clean Air Act, urges the
U.S.
Environmental
Protection
Agency to fully employ and enforce
the Clean Air Act, and opposes all
attempts to weaken, delay or otherwise prevent the EPA from enforcing the Clean Air Act.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to forward copies
of this resolution along with the testimony handout contained in File No.
1365-12-A to Verna Riffe Biemel,
American Lung Association in Ohio,
Lisa Jackson, EPA Administrator and
all members of the United States Congress.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted November 26, 2012.
Effective November 28, 2012.

Res. No. 1681-12.
By Council Member Conwell.
An emergency resolution requesting that the State of Ohio legislature
consider increasing the penalty for
failing to stop for a stopped school
bus.
Whereas, under the law of the state
of Ohio, a driver of a motor vehicle
must stop at least ten feet from the
front or rear of a school bus that is
stopped in order to board or discharge
school children; and
Whereas, the penalty for violation
of this provision may be a fine of not
to exceed $500 dollars; the person to
whom a citation is issued cannot
waive the right to contest the citation,
but must appear in person in court to
answer the charge; and
Whereas, in addition, the court may
impose a class seven suspension of
the offender’s driver’s license; and
Whereas, in order for judges to be
better able to mete out punishments
that fit the violation, and because the
safety of our school children should
be our highest priority, this Council
asks the legislature to consider
increasing the penalty for failing to
stop for a stopped school bus to a first
degree misdemeanor so that the fine
may be one of up to $1,000 and that
there is the possibility of up to 6
months jail time; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby requests that the State of Ohio
legislature consider increasing the
penalty for failing to stop for a
stopped school bus.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit certified copies of this resolution to all
member of the legislature of the State
of Ohio.

does not involve service to customers
or clients on the premises.
(e) Use Regulations. All uses permitted in the underlying retail zoning
district shall be permitted in the PRO
District, except that the use of Pedestrian Retail Spaces, as defined in this
section, shall be further limited as follows.
(1) Prohibited Uses. For Pedestrian
Retail Spaces, as defined in this section, the following uses shall be prohibited:
A. Open sales lots, as defined in this
section;
B. Filling and service stations;

shall be permitted without the
requirement for conditional approval;
D. Any building-enclosed use that
does not have a public pedestrian
entrance from the Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage;
E. Any use with more than forty
(40) feet of frontage along the Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage; and
F. A building with an interior side
yard more than four (4) feet in width
and located within forty (40) feet of a
Pedestrian Retail Frontage.
(f) Criteria for Conditional Uses.
The City Planning Commission shall
approve a Conditional Use application if it determines that the application meets the following criteria:
(1) In the case of a proposed residential, institutional or non-retail
office use, one (1) or more of the following conditions apply:
A. The subject building space was
designed specifically for the type of
use proposed and, as such, occupancy
by an allowed use is an unreasonable
expectation;
B. Denial of the application for
occupancy by a conditional use would
result in a long-term vacancy of the
subject property, as demonstrated by
the applicant;
C. It has been determined that the
proposed use is needed in the immediate area and that suitable alternative
locations are unavailable.
(2) In the case of a proposed off
street parking or loading area or driveway, one (1) or both of the following conditions apply.
A. The size, shape or layout of the
subject property does not permit
placement of the parking, loading or
driveway in a more suitable location.
B. It has been demonstrated by the
applicant that placement of the parking, loading or driveway in an
allowed location would jeopardize
the continued occupancy of the subject property by uses suited to the
PRO District.
(3) In the case of a building
enclosed use that does not have an
entrance from the Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage, one (1) or both of the
following conditions apply:
A. The proposed use will occupy an
existing building that lacks such
pedestrian entrance, and the addition
of a conforming pedestrian entrance
is made infeasible by the configuration of the interior space or other factors related to the design and placement of the building.
B. Placement of the pedestrian
entrance in a location other than on
the Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage
will result in more suitable pedestrian access.
(4) In the case of a proposed use
with more than forty (40) feet of
frontage along the Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage, the subject space
was designed for use at such size and
the proposed use, in the determination of the City Planning Commission,
will not have adverse impacts on the
functioning of nearby pedestrian-oriented retail uses.
(5) In the case of an interior side
yard more than four (4) feet in width
and located within forty (40) feet of a
Pedestrian Retail Frontage, the subject building will be occupied by residential units which require the
greater side yard area to allow for
desirable levels of light and air.
(g) Maximum Setbacks. Notwithstanding the provisions of the underlying zoning district, properties in
PRO Districts shall conform to the fol-

The City Record
lowing regulations with respect to
maximum setbacks.
(1) Front Street Yard . No main
building on a lot abutting a Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage shall be set
back more than five (5) feet from the
Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage
unless the City Planning Commission
has approved establishment of a surface parking lot in such location as a
Conditional Use. Such building features as entrances and display windows may be set back up to an additional five (5) feet as long as these
features occupy no more than fifty
percent (50%) of the building’s total
frontage. These setback regulations
shall not apply to portions of buildings above the first-story level.
(2) Interior Side Yard. No portion of
an interior side yard located within
forty (40) feet of a Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage shall exceed four (4)
feet in width on the ground floor
level, unless the City Planning Commission has approved a driveway or a
residential side yard in such location
as a Conditional Use.
(3) Exceptions for Outdoor Cafes. A
building may be set back a maximum
of fifteen (15) feet from the Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage in order to
accommodate a permanent outdoor
café. If use of such café is discontinued for a period of two (2) years or
more, the setback area shall be landscaped or otherwise improved in
accordance with a plan approved by
the City Planning Commission.
(h) Window Areas. For any nonresidential building or storefront facing
a Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage,
not less than sixty percent (60%) of
the front facade between two and onehalf (2-1/2) and seven and one-half (71/2) feet in height shall be composed
of transparent windows or doors. In
addition, not more than twenty-five
percent (25%) of such window or door
area on a building or storefront shall
be covered with permanent signs.
(i) Parking. In recognition of the
expected greater use of public transit,
bicycles and walking by customers
and employees traveling to PRO Districts, the minimum number of parking spaces otherwise required by the
Zoning Code shall be reduced by thirty-three percent (33%) for retail business uses in the districts. The Board
of Zoning Appeals may further reduce
parking requirements where it has
been demonstrated that additional
parking is available in common or
shared parking facilities or in onstreet parking areas located within a
reasonable walking distance of the
use, given the nature of the use and
the district. The Board shall also consider factors as the number of bicycle
racks available in proximity to a use.
In making its determination, the
Board shall be guided by an up-todate analysis of parking supply and
demand and other relevant factors
submitted by or on behalf of the applicant. The City Planning Commission
shall maintain a file of all such parking analyses submitted for properties
in each PRO District.
(j) Signs in the Public Street Rightof-Way. An ordinance to map a PRO
District in a particular location may
include permission to place private
signs in the public street right-of-way
under the regulations of Chapter 512
of the Codified Ordinances. Such provision shall be included in the PRO
designation only if it is determined,
on the basis of a survey and analysis
conducted by the City Planning Com-

1949

43
mission, that the particular PRO District is characterized by a preponderance of restaurants and small independent stores for which signs placed
near the street curb would provide
useful information to pedestrians
seeking goods and services and
would enhance the pedestrian-oriented image of the district. Any PRO District designated for display of signs
in the street right-of-way shall be
shown on the Zoning Map as a “PROS” District, with “S” noting the presence of special sign provisions. No
sign permitted by these provisions
shall be displayed without design
approval of the sign’s structure and
permanent elements by the City Planning Commission, or where applicable, by the Landmarks Commission.
(k) Variances. The Board of Zoning Appeals may grant variances to
requirements of this section under the
applicable criteria stated in Chapter
329 of this code. In the case of an
appeal for a variance to permit a
drive-through business in a PRO District, the Board shall consider the following factors based, in part, on a
traffic study performed by the applicant:
(1) the anticipated volume of vehicular use of the proposed drivethrough facility, with higher volumes
considered to detract from the pedestrian character of the district;
(2) the anticipated proportion of
drive-through customer transactions
to all transactions at the business,
with over fifty percent (50%) of
drive-through transactions indicating
that the business is an inappropriate
use for a Pedestrian Retail District.
(3) the impact of the drive-through
facility on the pedestrian character of
the designated Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage;
(4) the impact on traffic safety and
pedestrian safety in the vicinity of
the drive-through business.
(l) Appeals. Appeals from the decision of the City Planning Commission
to approve or disapprove Conditional
Uses in Pedestrian Retail Spaces
shall be made to the Board of Zoning
Appeals.
Section 2. That existing Section
343.23 of the Codified Ordinances of
