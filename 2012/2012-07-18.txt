Ord. No. 919-12.
By Council Member Sweeney (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the issuance and sale of Senior
Lien Waterworks Revenue Bonds and
Subordinate Lien Waterworks Revenue Bonds of the city for the purpose
of paying costs of improvements to
the Waterworks System and refunding Outstanding Subordinate Notes of
the city issued for that purpose, those
revenue bonds to be in an aggregate
principal amount not to exceed
$155,000,000 with respect to obligations for improvements and in an
aggregate principal amount not to
exceed $56,000,000 with respect to
refunding Outstanding Subordinate
Notes; authorizing a Supplemental
Indenture to supplement the Amended
and Restated Trust Indenture securing Outstanding Senior Lien Waterworks Revenue Bonds of the city and
authorizing a Supplemental Indenture, a Trust Agreement or other
appropriate instrument for securing
Subordinate Lien Waterworks Revenue Bonds of the city; authorizing
and approving related matters; and
declaring an emergency.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
Ohio, a municipal corporation and
political subdivision in and of the
State of Ohio, is authorized under
Article XVIII of the Constitution of
the State and the Charter of the City,
among other things: (a) to own and
operate as a public utility waterworks system defined in the Indenture and referred to herein as the

1083

15
“Utility”; (b) to make, from time to
time, improvements to the Utility; (c)
to borrow money for the purpose of
paying costs of those improvements
and refunding outstanding obligations issued for that purpose; (d) to
issue debt obligations for those purposes secured by a pledge of and lien
on the Net Revenues of the Utility on
a parity with Bonds outstanding
under the Indenture, all as defined
and described below; and (e) to issue
debt obligations for those purposes
secured by a pledge of and lien on the
Net Revenues of the Utility on a basis
subordinate to the Bonds outstanding
under the Indenture; and
Whereas, pursuant to that authority and ordinances passed by this
Council, the City has issued Bonds
from time to time under the terms of
the Amended and Restated Trust
Indenture, effective as of October 5,
2001, as supplemented and amended
from time to time, between the City
and U.S. Bank National Association,
as trustee (the “Indenture”), which
Bonds are secured thereunder by a
pledge of and lien on the Net Revenues of the Utility, each as defined in
the Indenture; and Whereas, pursuant
to that authority and Ordinance No.
261-10, passed by this Council on May
20, 2010 (the “Subordinate Note Ordinance”), the City issued the Outstanding Subordinated Notes, defined in
Section 1 of this Ordinance, secured
by the Net Revenues of the Utility on
a basis subordinate to the Bonds, to
provide interim financing for certain
improvements to the Utility; and
Whereas, pursuant to Ordinance No.
1360-10 passed by this Council on
November  8, 2010 (the “Refunding
Ordinance”), this Council authorized
the City to issue Refunding Bonds in
one or more Series for the purpose of
refunding one or more Series of Outstanding Revenue Bonds, or designated portions thereof, and to issue Subordinated Refunding Notes in one or
more Series for the purpose of making
provision for payment of Outstanding
Subordinated Notes when due or upon
prior redemption, all as defined in the
Refunding Ordinance; and
Whereas, this Council has determined to authorize the issuance by
the City of additional Bonds under the
Indenture for the purpose of (i) paying costs of improvements to the Utility, and (ii) refunding Outstanding
Subordinated Notes, and has further
determined to authorize the issuance
of Subordinate Lien Bonds for those
same purposes and to provide for the
securing of Subordinate Lien Bonds
on a basis subordinate to the Bonds,
all as defined and provided in this
Ordinance; and
Whereas, this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of a
municipal department and providing
for the immediate preservation of
public peace, property, health or safety, in that authorizing the issuance
and sale of obligations to pay for
improvements to the Utility is
required
to
fund
contracts
for
improvements needed to provide for
the continued operation of the Utility
and thereby provide for the usual
daily operation of a municipal department, and in that authorizing the
issuance and sale of obligations to
refund the Outstanding Subordinated
Notes is necessary to enable the City
to fund the retirement of the Outstanding Subordinated Notes on a
timely basis and in a manner advan-

16
tageous to the City under current market conditions; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:

Lien Bonds are Bonds under the
Indenture.
“Certificate of Award” means one or

Section 2. Authorization of the 2012
Bonds. This Council finds and determines it is necessary and proper and
in the best interest of the City to issue
the 2012 Bonds for the purpose of paying costs of improvements to the Utility and refunding the Outstanding
Subordinated Notes. The 2012 Bonds
may be issued in one or more Series,
any or all of which may be 2012 Senior
Lien Bonds or 2012 Subordinate Lien
Bonds, and the use of the term
“Series” with reference to 2012 Subordinate Lien Bonds shall not imply or
be interpreted to mean that the referenced 2012 Subordinate Lien Bonds
are Bonds under the Indenture. The
principal amount of each Series of
2012 Bonds is to be the amount set
forth in the Certificate of Award
authorized in Section 3 and determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, to be necessary (i)
to pay costs of improvements to the
Utility and to pay interest on the 2012
Bonds issued for that purpose during
the construction of those improvements, (ii) to refund the Outstanding
Subordinated Notes, (iii) to fund any
deposit to the Debt Service Reserve
Fund required under the Indenture or
any special reserve fund for that
Series separate from the Debt Service
Reserve Fund (provided that funds
for deposit to any debt service reserve
fund or similar fund for 2012 Subordinate Lien Bonds shall not be derived
from proceeds of 2012 Senior Lien
Bonds), (iv) to pay costs of any Credit Support Instruments, (v) to pay any
amounts owed under Hedge Agreements, and (vi) to pay costs of issuing
the 2012 Bonds and refunding the Outstanding Subordinated Notes. The
aggregate principal amount of 2012
Bonds of all Series issued for the purpose of paying costs of improvements
and any related costs under clauses
(iii) through (vi) of the preceding
sentence shall not exceed $155,000,000
and the aggregate principal amount
of 2012 Bonds issued for the purpose
of refunding the Outstanding Subordinated Notes and any related costs
under clauses (iii) through (vi) of the
preceding sentence shall not exceed
$56,000,000. The proceeds from the
sale of each Series of 2012 Bonds shall
be allocated, deposited and applied as
provided in Section 4 of this Ordinance.
If the 2012 Bonds are issued in more
than one Series, the 2012 Bonds of
each Series shall satisfy the require-

1084

July 18, 2012
ments of this Ordinance, and each
Series shall bear a distinctive designation, indicating, among other
things, whether the 2012 Bonds of that
Series are 2012 Senior Lien Bonds or
2012 Subordinate Lien Bonds. Separate Series of 2012 Bonds may be
issued at the same or different times.
The 2012 Bonds of each Series shall be
designated as provided in the applicable Certificate of Award. A separate
Certificate of Award may be delivered for each Series. A separate Supplemental Indenture may be delivered for each Series of 2012 Senior
Lien Bonds, and a separate Subordinate Lien Bonds Security Agreement
may be delivered for each Series of
2012 Subordinate Lien Bonds.
In the event that the Director of
Finance, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, determines
that the City’s best interests will be
served by causing a Series of 2012
Bonds to be obligations bearing interest at variable interest rates, then the
Director of Finance is authorized to
so specify in the Certificate of Award
for that Series. If the Director of
Finance so determines, then the
method and procedure by which the
variable rate of interest to be borne
by the 2012 Bonds of that Series shall
be determined as provided in the
applicable Supplemental Indenture in
the case of 2012 Senior Lien Bonds or
in the applicable Subordinate Lien
Security Agreement in the case of
2012 Subordinate Lien Bonds, whether
by reference to a market index, by a
remarketing agent or otherwise; provided that no Series of 2012 Bonds
shall bear interest at a rate in excess
of sixteen percent (16%) per year.
Notwithstanding that limitation, a
Series of 2012 Bonds held by a
provider of a Credit Support Instrument may bear interest at a rate not
in excess of twenty-five percent
(25%) per year as provided in the
agreement with the provider of the
Credit Support Instrument. The Director of Finance may determine that the
terms of a variable rate Series of 2012
Bonds may or may not permit the
Holders to tender their variable rate
2012 Bonds for purchase by the City.
If the Director of Finance designates
any Series of 2012 Bonds as variable
rate 2012 Bonds, and if the Holders of
that Series of 2012 Bonds are to be
entitled to tender those 2012 Bonds for
purchase, then the Director of
Finance shall also designate in the
Certificate of Award for those variable rate 2012 Bonds, the tender agent
or agents and the remarketing agent
or agents, which designations shall
be based on the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
that the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed to
provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable. The Director of Finance is authorized to enter
into agreements in connection with
the delivery of the 2012 Bonds, and
from time to time thereafter so long
as the variable rate 2012 Bonds are
outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support Instruments, tender agents
(which may be the Trustee), remarketing agents (which may be any of
the Original Purchasers), purchasers
of tendered 2012 Bonds, and others as
may be determined by the Director of
Finance, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, to be neces-

July 18, 2012
sary or appropriate to provide for (i)
the method of determining the variable interest rates, (ii) the rights and
procedures for tender, (iii) liquidity
or credit support, (iv) repayment by
the City of any amounts drawn under
the Credit Support Instrument, (v)
the direct purchase of tendered 2012
Bonds, and (vi) other arrangements
in the best interests of the City. The
Director of Finance is further authorized to terminate any such agreements if the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the City’s best interests will be served
by such termination. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to enter
into agreements, from time to time so
long as the variable rate 2012 Bonds
are outstanding, supplementing or
amending the applicable Supplemental Indenture or Subordinate Lien
Bonds Security Agreement for a
Series of 2012 Bonds as provided in
Section 6. The Director of Finance is
authorized to pay any fees associated
with agreements entered into or terminated pursuant to this Section from
proceeds of 2012 Bonds, to the extent
permitted by the Indenture, and from
the Net Revenues of the Utility.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of any
Series of 2012 Bonds, and regardless
of whether that Series of 2012 Bonds
bears interest at variable or fixed
rates, is authorized to contract for a
Credit Support Instrument, and to pay
the costs of it from proceeds of the
2012 Bonds, if the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the Credit Support Instrument will
result in a savings in the cost of the
financing to the City.
Section 3. Award and Sale of 2012
Bonds. The Director of Finance shall
sign and deliver a Certificate of
Award for the 2012 Bonds. In the
event the 2012 Bonds are issued in
more than one Series, a separate Certificate of Award shall be signed and
delivered for each separately delivered Series. The sale of each Series of
2012 Bonds shall be awarded to the
Original Purchasers selected by the
Director of Finance, based on an evaluation of the qualifications of firms
that have proposed to underwrite the
2012 Bonds. The Original Purchasers
so selected shall be identified in the
Certificate of Award. The 2012 Bonds
shall be sold to the Original Purchasers pursuant to a Bond Purchase
Agreement; provided, however, that if
the Certificate of Award applicable to
any Series specifies that the 2012
Bonds of that Series are to be sold
through a private or direct placement,
rather than through an underwritten
public offering, then the Bond Purchase Agreement applicable to that
Series shall contain such provisions
as the officer signing the Bond Purchase Agreement on behalf of the
City determines are appropriate to
reflect that manner of sale and are
not inconsistent with the Indenture or
the Subordinate Lien Bonds Security
Agreement, as the case may be, or this
Ordinance and not substantially
adverse to the City. The Certificate of
Award for the 2012 Bonds of each
Series shall specify whether the 2012
Bonds of that Series are to be 2012
Senior Lien Bonds or 2012 Subordinate
Lien Bonds and shall set forth the
final terms of the applicable Series of
2012 Bonds determined by the Director of Finance, based on the written

The City Record
advice of a Financial Advisor and
consistent with this Ordinance and
the Indenture, including the following:
(a) the aggregate principal amount
of the 2012 Bonds issued, provided
that the aggregate principal amount
of all 2012 Bonds shall not exceed the
limits specified in Section 2, assuming
that the 2012 Bonds are to be initially
offered to the public at a price at least
equal to their aggregate principal
amount, but if any of the 2012 Bonds
are to be initially offered to the public
at an original issue discount, the maximum aggregate principal amount of
2012 Bonds shall be increased over
those specified maximum amounts by
an amount equal to the aggregate
original issue discount net of the
aggregate original issue premium;
(b) the date or dates of the 2012
Bonds;
(c) the purchase price to be paid to
the City by the Original Purchasers,
which amount shall be not less than:
(i) 97% of the amount determined by
subtracting from the aggregate principal amount of the 2012 Bonds any
aggregate original issue discount net
of any aggregate original issue premium with respect to the 2012 Bonds,
plus (ii) any accrued interest on the
2012 Bonds from their date to the date
of their delivery to the Original Purchasers;
(d) whether any 2012 Bonds are
subject to optional redemption prior
to maturity, the earliest optional
redemption date for those 2012 Bonds
subject to prior redemption, which
shall be not later than ten years from
the first interest payment date of the
applicable Series, and the applicable
redemption price, which shall be not
greater than 102% of the principal
amount redeemed;
(e) the dates on which and amounts
in which principal of the 2012 Bonds is
to be paid, which shall be not later
than forty (40) years from their
respective dates of issuance, with an
identification of whether the payment is due by stated maturity or by
mandatory sinking fund redemption
of 2012 Bonds of a particular maturity;
(f) the interest rates to be borne by
2012 Bonds bearing interest at a fixed
rate, the weighted average of which
shall not exceed six percent (6%) as
to 2012 Bonds of any Series, or by the
method by which the interest rate is
to be determined for 2012 Bonds bearing interest at variable rates, consistent with Section 2. The 2012 Bonds of
the same Series and same maturity
may bear interest at different interest
rates;
(g) any deposit required to be made
to the Debt Service Reserve Fund or a
special reserve fund with respect to
2012 Senior Lien Bonds and any debt
service reserve fund or comparable
fund for 2012 Subordinate Lien Bonds;
(h) the title and Series designation
for the 2012 Bonds; and
(i) whether any 2012 Bonds are to
be secured by or payable from any
Credit Support Instruments.
It is determined that the terms of
the 2012 Bonds as so determined within the limitations set forth in this
Ordinance and as so specified and set
forth in the Certificate of Award will
be in the best interest of the City and
consistent with all legal requirements.
Section 4. Application of Proceeds
of 2012 Bonds. The proceeds of the
sale of the 2012 Bonds shall be
deposited as provided in the applica-

1085

17

The City Record
Section 6. Authorization of Supplemental Indentures and Subordinate
Lien Bonds Security Agreements.
(a) Supplemental Indentures. In
order to secure the payment of the
principal of and any premium and
interest on the 2012 Senior Lien
Bonds, the Mayor, Director of Finance
and Director of Public Utilities, or
any two of them, are authorized and
directed, in the name and on behalf of
the City, to sign and deliver to the
Trustee, in trust for the Original Purchasers and subsequent holders of the
2012 Senior Lien Bonds, a Supplemental Indenture, approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, not inconsistent with this Ordinance, the Certificate of Award and
the Indenture and not substantially
adverse to the City as may be
approved by the officers signing the
same on behalf of the City. The determination by those officers that the
Supplemental Indenture is not substantially adverse to the City shall be
conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery of that Supplemental
Indenture by those officers. Subject to
the Indenture as theretofore amended, any Supplemental Indenture may
contain amendments to the Indenture,
as theretofore amended, or amend and
restate the Indenture, to permit the
City to obtain a Credit Support Instrument or to permit increased flexibility for the use of financial or credit
structures and techniques determined
by the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, to be in the best interests of
the City.
(b) Subordinate Lien Bonds Security Agreements. In order to secure the
payment of the principal of and any
premium and interest on the 2012 Subordinate Lien Bonds, the Mayor,
Director of Finance and Director of
Public Utilities, or any two of them,
are authorized and directed, in the
name and on behalf of the City, to
sign and deliver to the Trustee, in
trust for the Original Purchasers and
subsequent holders of the 2012 Subordinate Lien Bonds, the Subordinate
Lien Bonds Security Agreement,
approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, not inconsistent with this Ordinance, the Certificate of Award and the Indenture and
not substantially adverse to the City
as may be approved by the officers
signing the same on behalf of the
City. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Subordinate Lien
Bonds Security Agreement shall in all
respects conform to the requirements
of the Indenture for the application,
deposit and disbursement of Revenues and moneys on deposit in the
Pledged Funds for the benefit and
protection of the holders of Bonds and
shall in no manner violate or interfere
with the exercise of remedies or the
enforcement of rights by the holders
of Bonds or by the Trustee on their
behalf under the Indenture. The
determination by those officers that
the Subordinate Lien Bonds Security
Agreement
is
not
substantially
adverse to the City and that it otherwise conforms to the authorization in
this paragraph shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing and delivery
of that Subordinate Lien Bond Security Agreement by those officers. Nothing in this Ordinance shall be interpreted to require that the Subordinate
Lien Bonds Security Agreement not
take the form of a Supplemental
Indenture.

hereby established and ordered to be
maintained one or more separate
accounts (except when invested as
provided in the Indenture) within the
Rebate Fund held in the custody of
the Trustee under the Indenture or
within a rebate fund established for
comparable purpose under the Subordinate Lien Bonds Security Agreement. The Rebate Fund is not pledged
to the payment of debt service and is
free and clear of any pledge or lien
given under the Indenture as security
for the 2012 Senior Lien Bonds or the
Outstanding Bonds or given under the
Subordinate Lien Bonds Security
Agreement as security for the 2012
Subordinate Lien Bonds or other Subordinate Lien Bonds that may be
issued thereunder. Calculations of
excess earnings that may be due and
payable to the federal government
pursuant to the Code and deposits to
those accounts of the Rebate Fund
shall be made as provided in the
applicable Supplemental Indenture or
the Subordinate Lien Bonds Security
Agreement.
Section 8. Remarketing. In the
event that the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that it
is advantageous to the City to convert
the interest on any variable rate 2012
Bonds to fixed interest rates for a
period of time or to maturity, or to
convert the interest on any 2012
Bonds to a different variable rate
period or mode, or to terminate or
take other actions with respect to any
Credit Support Instrument that will
require a tender and remarketing of
any 2012 Bonds under the Indenture
or the Subordinate Lien Bonds Security Agreement, as the case may be
(such conversion or other actions and
the tender and remarketing being collectively referred to in this Section as
“remarketing”), the City shall undertake the remarketing in accordance
therewith. In connection with any
remarketing of 2012 Bonds, the Director of Finance is authorized to take
such actions that she determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, will facilitate the
remarketing of the 2012 Bonds or otherwise be in the best interests of the
City, including without limitation,
obtaining one or more Credit Support
Instruments, terminating any Credit
Support Instrument, and entering into
agreements with one or more purchasers for their direct purchase of
the remarketed 2012 Bonds in lieu of a
public offering of the 2012 Bonds by a
remarketing agent. In the event the
Director of Finance determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that it is necessary to supplement or amend the Supplemental Indenture or Subordinate
Lien Bonds Security Agreement
applicable to a Series of 2012 Bonds to
be remarketed in order to address current market conditions or to permit
the use of or to terminate a Credit Support Instrument or otherwise obtain
financing arrangements advantageous to the City, the Mayor, the
Director of Finance and the Director
of Public Utilities, or any two of them,
are authorized to sign and deliver an
amendment of that Supplemental
Indenture or Subordinate Lien Bonds
Security Agreement, or an amended
and restated Supplemental Indenture
or Subordinate Lien Bonds Security
Agreement, approved as to form by
the Director of Law, subject to the

July 18, 2012
Indenture or the Subordinate Lien
Bonds Security Agreement as theretofore amended.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized to satisfy the Debt Service
Reserve Requirement or any special
reserve fund requirement for the
Series of 2012 Bonds to be remarketed,
by the deposit of a Credit Support
Instrument in lieu of cash, as permitted and more specifically provided in
the Indenture, and to apply cash
released from the Debt Service
Reserve Fund or such special reserve
fund to the payment of costs of remarketing or other purposes permitted by
applicable laws. To the extent the
costs of remarketing are not paid
from any cash released from the Debt
Service Reserve Fund or such special
reserve fund, those costs shall be paid
from funds of the Water Division,
which are appropriated for that purpose.
The Director of Finance and the
Director of Public Utilities are authorized to prepare one or more disclosure documents in connection with
any remarketing of 2012 Bonds under
the same terms and conditions as set
forth in Section 12 of this Ordinance
with respect to the issuance of 2012
Bonds. The Director of Finance, the
Director of Public Utilities or any
other officer of the City, as appropriate under the Charter, is authorized to
take such actions or cause to be taken
such actions as are necessary to maintain the applicable tax status of such
2012 Bonds and the covenants and
authorizations in Section 10 of this
Ordinance shall apply to such 2012
Bonds. The Mayor, the Director of
Finance, the Director of Public Utilities and other City officials, as appropriate under the Charter, are authorized to sign and deliver such instruments, certificates and documents as
are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions authorized
by this Section. The Director of
Finance, the Director of Public Utilities, the Director of Law and other
City officials, as appropriate under
the Charter, are authorized to make
the
necessary
arrangements
on
behalf of the City to establish the
date, location, procedure and conditions for the remarketing of any 2012
Bonds and to take all actions necessary to effect the remarketing of any
2012 Bonds under the terms of this
Ordinance and the Indenture. The
Clerk of Council or other appropriate
official of the City shall furnish the
Trustee a true transcript of proceedings certified by the Clerk or other
official, of all proceedings had with
reference to the remarketing of any
2012 Bonds along with such information for the records as is necessary to
determine the validity of the remarketing.
Section 9. Interest Hedge Agreements. This Council finds that by
engaging in interest hedge transactions with respect to the 2012 Bonds,
from time to time, the City can, in
effect, convert interest on all or a portion of the 2012 Bonds from a fixed
rate to a variable rate, or from a variable rate to a fixed rate, and thereby
may reduce its cost of borrowing by
optimizing the relative amounts of
fixed and variable rate obligations
and minimizing the risk of variations
in its debt service costs. To permit the
City to have the flexibility to undertake interest rate swap, swaption,
rate cap, rate collar and other hedging transactions, from time to time,

The City Record
and to establish the procedures for
approving those transactions, this
Council authorizes the execution and
delivery of one or more hedge agreements (each, a “Hedge Agreement”)
and any related agreements necessary for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by each
Hedge Agreement.
Upon the written recommendation
of a Financial Advisor to the Director
of Finance that an interest rate hedge
transaction be undertaken by the
City, the Director of Finance may
authorize one or more interest rate
hedge transactions in accordance
with the applicable Hedge Agreement; provided that (a) the maximum
aggregate notional amount of interest rate hedge transactions outstanding at any one time, net of offsetting
interest rate hedge transactions,
shall not exceed such amount as will
result in a lowering of the ratings
assigned to the Bonds by the rating
agencies, as is evidenced by written
correspondence from the rating agencies or policies published in writing
by the rating, and (b) the term of each
interest rate swap transaction shall
not exceed 30 years. The approval of
each interest rate hedge transaction
by the Director of Finance shall be
conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery of the applicable
Hedge Agreement by the Director of
Finance.
The Director of Finance shall negotiate the terms of each Hedge Agreement with a counterparty that satisfies any criteria that the City may
apply to such agreements or counterparties from time to time. The City
shall receive a written opinion of a
Financial Advisor that the payments
to be made by the counterparty to the
City, or by the City to the counterparty, shall be fair value for the Hedge
Agreement, considering, among other
things, the credit of the City and the
counterparty and the terms and conditions of the Hedge Agreement. The
Director of Finance shall determine
the terms and conditions of the Hedge
Agreement, including without limitation, the rates to be paid by the counterparty to the City and by the City to
the counterparty under the Hedge
Agreement, the time or times and procedures for the exercise by the counterparty or the City, as the case may
be, of any option under the Hedge
Agreement, and whether the obligations of the City under the Hedge
Agreement shall be secured by a Credit Support Instrument. The approval
of each interest rate hedge transaction by the Director of Finance shall
be conclusively evidenced by the
signing and delivery of the applicable
Hedge Agreement by the Director of
Finance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to terminate any Hedge Agreements in whole or in part or any Credit Support Instrument securing a
Hedge Agreement if the Director of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
that the City’s best interests will be
served by such termination. The
Director of Finance is further authorized to enter into amendments or
modifications of a Hedge Agreement
or any Credit Support Instrument
securing a Hedge Agreement determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the City’s best
interests will be served by such
amendment or modification.

The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from the Net Revenues of the Utility
and may be payable also from other
funds permitted by law to be used for
the purpose, as identified by the
Director of Finance in the Hedge
Agreement. Those payments may be
secured by a pledge of Net Revenues,
to the extent permitted by the Indenture, all as determined by the Director
of Finance and set forth in the Hedge
Agreement. The City’s payment obligations under each Hedge Agreement
related to Subordinate Lien Bonds
shall be payable only as provided in
the Subordinate Lien Bonds Security
Agreement. The obligation of the City
to make payments under any Hedge
Agreement does not and shall not represent or constitute a general obligation, debt, bonded indebtedness or a
pledge of the faith and credit of the
City or the State of Ohio. Nothing
gives any party to any Hedge Agreement the right to have excises, ad valorem or other taxes levied by the City
or the State of Ohio for the payment of
any amounts due under any Hedge
Agreement.
Section 10. Covenants of the City.
The City, by issuance of the 2012
Bonds, covenants and agrees with the
Holders of the 2012 Bonds, that:
(a) The City will use the proceeds
of the 2012 Bonds for the purposes
specified in Section 2 of this Ordinance.
(b) The Clerk, or other appropriate
officer of the City, will furnish to the
Original Purchasers and to the
Trustee a true transcript of proceedings, certified by the Clerk or other
officer, of all proceedings had with
reference to the issuance of the 2012
Bonds, together with information
from the City’s records as is necessary to determine the regularity and
validity of the issuance of the 2012
Bonds.
(c) The City will, at any and all
times, cause to be done all such further acts and things and cause to be
signed and delivered all further
instruments as may be necessary to
carry out the purpose of the 2012
Bonds and this Ordinance or as may
be required by Section 13, Article
XVIII of the Constitution of Ohio or
the Charter of the City or the Indenture or the applicable Supplemental
Indenture or the Subordinate Lien
Bonds Security Agreement and will
comply with all requirements of law
applicable to the Utility and the operation thereof.
(d) The City will observe and perform all its agreements and obligations provided for in the 2012 Bonds,
this Ordinance, the Indenture, each
Supplemental Indenture and the Subordinate Lien Bonds Security Agreement. All of the obligations under this
Ordinance and the Indenture, each
Supplemental Indenture and the Subordinate Lien Bonds Security Agreement are hereby established as duties
specifically enjoined by law and
resulting from an office, trust or station upon the City within the meaning
of Section 2731.01, Ohio Revised Code.
(e) The City will use, and will
restrict the use and investment of, the
proceeds of the 2012 Bonds in such
manner and to such extent as may be
necessary so that (a) the 2012 Bonds
will not (i) constitute private activity
bonds, arbitrage bonds or hedge
bonds under Sections 141, 148 or 149 of
the Code or (ii) be treated other than
as bonds to which Section 103(a) of

20
the Code applies, and (b) the interest
thereon will not be treated as an item
of tax preference under Section 57 of
the Code.
(f) The City covenants that (a) it
will take or cause to be taken such
actions that may be required of it for
the interest on the 2012 Bonds to be
and to remain excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will not take or authorize to
be taken any actions that would
adversely affect that exclusion, and
(c) it, or persons acting for it, will,
among other acts of compliance, (i)
apply the proceeds of the 2012 Bonds
to the governmental purpose of the
borrowing, (ii) restrict the yield on
investment property acquired with
those proceeds, (iii) make timely
rebate payments to the federal government, (iv) maintain books and
records and make calculations and
reports, and (v) refrain from certain
uses of proceeds, and, as applicable,
of property financed with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the
extent necessary to assure such
exclusion of that interest under the
Code.
Each covenant made in this section
with respect to the 2012 Bonds is also
made with respect to all issues for
which any portion of the debt service
is paid from proceeds of the 2012
Bonds (and, if different, the original
issue and any refunding issues in a
series of refundings), to the extent
such compliance is necessary to
assure exclusion of interest on the
2012 Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes, and the
Director of Finance, or any other officer having responsibility with respect
to the 2012 Bonds, is authorized to
take such actions with respect to
those issues as they are authorized in
this section to take with respect to the
2012 Bonds.
The Mayor, the Director of Finance
or any other officer of the City, as
appropriate under the Charter, is
authorized (a) to make or effect any
election,
selection,
designation,
choice, consent, approval or waiver on
behalf of the City with respect to the
2012 Bonds as the City is permitted or
required to make or give under the
federal income tax laws, including,
without limitation, any of the elections available under Section 148 of
the Code, for the purpose of assuring,
enhancing or protecting the favorable
tax treatment or status of the 2012
Bonds or interest thereon or assisting
compliance with requirements for
that purpose, reducing the burden or
expense of compliance, reducing the
rebate amount or payments or penalties, or making payments of special
amounts in lieu of making computations to determine, or paying, excess
earnings as rebate, or obviating those
amount or payments, as determined
by that officer, (b) to take any and all
other actions, make or obtain calculations, make payments, and make or
give reports, covenants and certifications of and on behalf of the City, as
may be appropriate to assure the
exclusion of interest from gross
income and the intended tax status of
the 2012 Bonds, and (c) to give one or
more appropriate certificates of the
City, for inclusion in the transcript of
proceedings for the 2012 Bonds, setting forth the reasonable expectations of the City regarding the
amount and use of all the proceeds of
the 2012 Bonds, the facts, circumstances and estimates on which they
are based, and other facts and circumstances relevant to the tax treatment
or status of the 2012 Bonds and interest thereon.

11.
Ratings;
Credit
Enhancement. If, in the judgment of
the Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
the filing of an application for a rating on one or more Series of 2012
Bonds by one or more nationally recognized rating agencies is in the best
interests of the City, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare and
submit those applications and to provide to each such agency such information as may be required for the purpose. The Director of Finance is
authorized to contract for one or more
Credit Support Instruments for any
Series of 2012 Bonds or designated
portions thereof if the Director determines, based on the written advice of
a Financial Advisor, that the Credit
Support Instruments will result in
debt service savings to the City, or
will stabilize interest rates on those
2012 Bonds or will minimize the risk
of increased interest expense on those
2012 Bonds. The Director of Finance
is further authorized to terminate any
such contract if the Director of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
that the City’s best interests will be
served by such termination. The cost
of obtaining each rating and the cost
of obtaining or terminating each
Credit Support Instrument, except to
the extent paid by the Original Purchasers in accordance with the Bond
Purchase Agreement, shall be paid
from the proceeds of 2012 Bonds or
funds of the Water Division, which
are appropriated for that purpose.
Section 12. Official Statements; Continuing Disclosure. The Mayor, the
Director of Finance, the Director of
Public Utilities, the Commissioner of
Water, or other City officials, as
appropriate under the Charter, each is
authorized, on behalf of the City and
in their official capacities, to (i) prepare or cause to be prepared, and
make or authorize modifications,
completions or changes of or supplements to, disclosure documents in the
form of a preliminary official statement relating to the issuance of 2012

April 30, 2012, regarding the amendment and extension of the franchise
with Cleveland Thermal, LLC for the
transmission and supply of steam and
water for heating, cooling and power
purposes.
Whereas, the Charter of the City of
Cleveland authorizes this Council by
ordinance to grant a non-exclusive
franchise to any person, firm or corporation to construct, install, maintain and operate a utility in, under,
over, along, across and upon any of
the streets and public grounds of the
City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, on April 30, 2012, this
Council passed Ordinance No. 550-12
which authorized the amendment and
extension of the franchise to Cleveland Thermal, LLC for the transmission and supply of steam and water
for heating, cooling and power purposes; and
Whereas, it was the intention of
this Council and Cleveland Thermal,
LLC, to extend the franchise for the
maximum period of 25 years allowed
by law, but the final date of the franchise permitted by law was not
known until final passage and
approval of Ordinance No. 550-12; and
Whereas, it is necessary and in the
best interests of the City to amend
Ordinance No. 550-12 by correcting the
date through which the franchise was
granted; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 1 of Ordinance No. 550-12, passed April 30,
2012, is amended to read as follows:
Section 1. That under Chapter 35 of
the Charter of the City of Cleveland
and Section 1 of the franchise granted
by Ordinance No. 1519-04, passed October 25, 2004 (the “Franchise Ordinance”), this Council approves the
extension of the franchise agreement
to June 1, 2037, and the amendments
thereto regarding certain administrative matters as set forth therein.
Section 2. That existing Section 1 of
Ordinance No. 550-12, passed April 30,
2012, is repealed.
Section 3. That Section 2 of Ordinance No. 550-12, passed April 30, 2012,
is amended to read as follows:
Section 2. That the franchise agreement granted to Cleveland Thermal
Holdings, LLC, as successor to CT
Acquisitions I Inc., by the Franchise
Ordinance described in Section 1 is
amended, and the entirety of the franchise agreement as contained in the
Franchise Ordinance as amended by
this ordinance is as follows:
Section 1. Grant of Franchise.
Under the Charter of the City of
Cleveland (“City”), and subject to the
terms and conditions set forth in this
franchise, Cleveland Thermal, LLC
(“Grantee”), is granted a non-exclusive franchise, until June 1, 2037,
unless sooner terminated as provide
in this franchise, to construct, install,
maintain and operate a system for the
transmission and distribution of
steam and water for heating, cooling
and power purposes (the “Steam System”) in the area of the City identified
in the map contained in File No. 151904-A and incorporated by reference

The City Record
and as expanded or extended within
the boundaries of the City (the “Service Area”) in, under, over, along,
across and upon the streets and public
grounds (including, but not limited
to, the streets, lanes, alleys, avenues,
easements and other public thoroughfares and public rights of way of the
City in the Service Area) in that Service Area, with the full and necessary
privileges for the use of the streets
and public grounds in the Service
Area for the purpose of digging a
trench or trenches, and constructing,
installing, maintaining and operating
pipes and conduits for steam and
water lines, together with the right to
maintain such pipes and conduits, for
the purpose of transmitting steam
and water for heating, cooling and
power purposes (“Steam Service”),
and to construct, install and maintain
all necessary insulators, valves, safety appliances, connections, manholes
and other appurtenances necessary or
appropriate to the operation of the

plants of Grantee and the existing
and future transmission and distribution system extending to the property
line of each Customer (as such term is
defined in Section 5A hereof), except
where otherwise defined by agreement between Grantee and a particular Customer; provided, however, that
nothing herein shall be construed to
require Grantee to maintain existing
steam generation and heating or cooling water plants so long as Grantee
can provide sufficient capacity,
through leases, power purchase
agreements or other means, to meet
Customers’ reasonably anticipated
requirements. The grant of this franchise does not establish priority or
lack of priority for use of the streets
and public grounds to Grantee over
other present or future permit holders
or franchises, or over the City’s own
use. Any extension or expansion of
the Steam System shall be subject to
all of the obligations and reserved
rights in favor of the City set forth in
this franchise, and shall be subject to
all of the conditions of this franchise.
The products and services to be provided or performed by the Grantee
hereunder may be provided or performed by the Grantee, acting itself,
or through an affiliate of Grantee,
and the term “Grantee” includes the
Grantee and any affiliate as the context permits.
As used herein, an
“affiliate” of Grantee means Cleveland Thermal Generation, LLC, Cleveland Thermal Steam Distribution,
LLC, Cleveland Thermal Chilled
Water Distribution, LLC or any other
person or entity directly or indirectly
controlling, controlled by or under
common control with another person
or entity.
Section 1A. Payments.

appropriate affected City agency or
office. When any streets and public
grounds are entered upon by the
Grantee, or facilities removed by the
Grantee, the Grantee shall at its cost
restore the same to their original condition. Grantee shall clear all streets
and public grounds of obstructions or
anything that might constitute a nuisance or prevent such streets and public grounds from being open and in
repair, if such obstruction or nuisance
was caused by the Grantee or related
to the operation of the Steam System.
If the Grantee fails to complete such
work within a reasonable period of
time, the appropriate officer of the
City may, in writing, notify the
Grantee that the City will complete
such work if not completed by the
Grantee as soon as practicable as
determined by the City after receipt
of notice by Grantee. Any work not
completed as determined by the City’s
officer may be completed by the City
and the actual out-of-pocket cost of
such work shall be charged to the
Grantee.
Upon the doing of such
work, the City shall furnish the

and Grantee shall pay the bills within

across or upon all streets and public

Steam System. In the construction,
installation, maintenance or repair of
its properties, the Grantee shall comply with all laws and regulations
existing at the effective date of this
franchise or that may thereafter be
made by the City applicable to the
Grantee and the Grantee shall be
liable for damages caused by its failure or neglect to comply with such
laws and regulations and shall save

failure or neglect.

of
Mechanical
Engineers
(“ASME”).
The Grantee shall be
responsible to maintain, at its
expense, all mains and lines up to the
property line of the Customer’s facility, except where otherwise set forth
in an agreement between Grantee and
a particular Customer, and shall keep
such lines in sound operating condition and free of undue leakage.
B. Abandonment of Services. In the
event Grantee makes an application
to the Public Utilities Commission of
Ohio (“PUCO”), to abandon service to
any part or all of its Service Area,
Grantee shall send a copy of any such
application to each of its then existing Customers.
C. Existing Rates. All valid contracts or agreements establishing
rates, charges or billing arrangements
between
Customers
and
Grantee (including, but not limited to,
agreements combining billings for
one or more premises owned or operated by a Customer) in effect as of the
effective date of this ordinance, shall
remain in effect until the expiration
of the contract or agreement as set
forth in such contract or agreement

allowed or required by any Court or
arbitration panel, or as agreed by
Customer and Grantee. All tariff and
contract rates for Steam Service in

may be provided by law. During the
term of this franchise, Grantee shall,
upon the request of the City or Council, provide such data and information
as the City reasonably requires to
review the rates, charges, terms and

repair material leaks in the Steam
System. Grantee shall also promptly
repair any pavement, tree lawn, curb
or other portion of the street or public
ground which is damaged by Grantee
or due to defects in or leaks in or emanating from the Steam System.
If
there is any dispute between Grantee
and a Customer as to whether the
Grantee or Customer is responsible to
repair damage in the streets or public
grounds caused by Grantee or due to
defects or leaks in the Steam System,
Grantee shall promptly make any necessary repairs pending resolution of
such dispute. The cost of such repairs
may be part of any such resolution,
and may be charged to the Customer
if it is determined that the repairs
were the responsibility of the Customer. The Grantee acknowledges its
obligation to operate and maintain
the Steam System so that it is not in
such condition as to be a hazard to the
health, safety or welfare of the public,
and acknowledges the right of the
City to reasonably require the
Grantee to make necessary repairs or
improvements to abate said condition.
Grantee shall promptly comply with
an order of the Director of the appropriate department of the City having
custody and control of the particular
property or the responsibility to

shall give consideration to the availability of certain specialty items of
equipment for the Steam System that
are not readily available from minority and female vendors.
Grantee shall adhere to the standards set forth in division (a) of Section 187.04 of the Codified Ordinances
of the City, as presently in effect with
respect
to
nondiscrimination
in

efforts to improve the percentage of
minority and female employment in
the various occupations involved in
the performance of the Grantee’s business. With respect to any construction of the improvement and expansion of the Steam System comprising
real property, Grantee shall comply
with the requirements of Chapter 188
of the Codified Ordinances of the City.
Section 6. Transfers and Assignments.
The franchise granted to the
Grantee herein shall not be transferable either directly or indirectly
except with the consent of Council,
provided, however , that the grant of a
mortgage on or security interest in or
assignment of real or personal property comprising the Steam System,
including but not limited to Grantee’s
right to receive payments from Customers (including the City)
with
respect to the Steam System, as collateral security for financing of obligations of Grantee, shall not constitute
or be deemed to be a transfer for purposes of this Section 6; and provided,
further that nothing in any such mortgage, security interest or assignment
shall purport to transfer the franchise
granted herein except with the consent of Council.
Additionally,
Grantee shall not, without consent of
Council, either directly or indirectly,
consolidate, merge or in any other
way give or permit control of the management of its business to or by any
other heating, cooling or power company now operating or that may in
the future operate in the City, including any company which would by
such action by Grantee first enter into
the business of providing heating,
cooling or power, nor shall Grantee
assign or transfer so much of the
assets of the Steam System so as to
render Grantee unable to continue
providing
adequate
service
as
required herein. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this Section 6, the capital stock or all or substantially all of
the assets and business of Grantee
may, without the prior approval of
Council, be (i) transferred to any corporation or other entity which is affiliated with Grantee or (ii) consolidat-

common control with another person
or entity.
Section 7. Right of Purchase by the
City.
Under Section 183 of the Charter of
the City of Cleveland, there is
reserved to the City the right to terminate this franchise and to purchase
all of the property of the Grantee in
the streets and highways in the City
and elsewhere used in or useful for
the operation of the utility at a price
to be fixed in the manner provided in
the following sentence. If the City
and Grantee cannot agree on the price
to be paid by the City for such property, the value shall be determined by
three appraisers, one each selected by
the City and Grantee, and the other
selected by the two appraisers
appointed.
If the three appraisers
cannot agree upon a value for such
property, the average of the three separate appraisals of the appraisers
shall be the value of such property.
The standard to be used by the
appraisers shall be the fair market
value of such property as a going concern. Further, to the extent provided
in Section 184 of the Charter of the
City, the price to be paid by the City
for the property that may be acquired
by the City from the Grantee, by purchase, condemnation, or otherwise,
shall exclude all additional value of
the grant or renewal of this franchise.
Section 8. Renewal of Franchise.
Council may, by ordinance, renew
the franchise at the expiration of this
franchise upon terms conducive to the
public interest.
Section 9. Non-Exclusivity of Franchise.
No rights herein granted to the
Grantee
to
construct,
maintain,
install or operate the Steam System
shall be construed as exclusive or as
preventing the City from granting a
franchise or privilege to any other
person, firm or corporation.
Section 10. Permits.
The Director of Public Service and
other appropriate City officials are
hereby authorized to issue such permits to the Grantee and any of its construction contractors or subcontractors for construction, installation and
operation of the Steam System as may
be required by law without further
action of the Council. Permits shall
be issued upon Grantee’s compliance
with the applicable procedures for

with
the
requirements
of
law.

to the Steam System.

not including such documents which
solely relate to any other Steam System. Grantee shall not object to or
contest the right of the City to intervene in any proceeding initiated by
Grantee, the PUCO or a third party
concerning Grantee, any affiliate, or
the Steam System.
Section 12. Notices and Reports.
Grantee shall provide notice to a
designated representative of each
Customer of any work by Grantee on
the Steam System, or of any change in
its operation, which could materially

in case of admissions to wrestling
matches, prize fights or boxing, sparring or other pugilistic matches or

rate, the percentage equal to such
increase times all admissions charges
for all admissions during such Collection Year to the Gateway Arena for
Games, and plus (c) in the event that
the City increases the taxes payable
under this chapter from six percent
(6%) to a higher rate, the percentage
equal to such increase times all
admissions charges for all admissions during such Collection Year to
the Gateway Arena for any events
other than Games;
B. To release and pay to the City at

excess of the amount described in

interest and on such other terms and
in such form as are consistent with
Gateway’s obligations under the trust
indentures and related agreements
securing Gateway’s bonds and the
Arena Bonds and as the City’s Director of Finance and Director of Law
deem acceptable in the interests of
the City.
(5) Gateway shall make or cause to
be made such other assurances and
commitments as the City’s Director of
Finance and Director of Law deem
necessary, and appropriate to protect
the City’s entitlements under this
division (f) and provide copies of
such other assurances and commitments to the Clerk of the Council.
(g) (1) Except as otherwise provided in division (b), and notwithstanding anything else in this chapter to
the contrary, no tax shall be levied
under this chapter with respect to any
admission to live theater, live opera,
live ballet, or live exhibition of dance,
musical performance, or monologue
productions which are sponsored by
an institution, society or organization
that has received a determination
from the Internal Revenue Service
that the organization is exempt from
federal income tax under section
501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended; provided

The City Record
that the institution, society or organization actively participates in planning and conducting the event, is
responsible for the safety and success
of the event, is organized for the purpose of sponsoring live theater, live
opera, live ballet, or live exhibition of
dance, musical performance, or monologue productions and has among the
stated purposes in its charter the promotion of arts education in the communities which it serves, and will
receive at least twenty percent (20%)
of the net profits, if any, of the events
which the institution, society or organization sponsors and will bear the
risk of at least twenty percent (20%)
of the losses, if any, from the events
which the institution, society or organization sponsors.
(2) The exemption from tax provided in this subsection shall not be
allowed to any institution, society or
organization which does not control
the sale of admissions to the event for
which the exemption is requested.

subsection (g), the treasurer of the
institution, society or organization
shall file an itemized statement with
the Commissioner setting forth the
amount of money actually received by
such treasurer together with the
expenses of promoting and conducting such event. Such statement shall
be used as a basis of subsequent
requests for exemption from admissions tax in accordance with this subsection. If such statement demonstrates a failure to qualify in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection (g), no such exemption shall
thereafter be allowed to such institution, society or organization.

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 931-12.
By Mayor Jackson and Council
Members Polensek, J. Johnson, Zone,
Brady, Westbrook, K. Johnson and
Cimperman.
An emergency resolution urging
the State of Ohio to enter into discussions with the Commissioners of the
Cleveland Metroparks to allow Cleveland Metroparks to assume the lease
of the publicly owned land along
Lake Erie currently owned by various
governmental subdivisions, thereby
creating a real regional “Emerald
Necklace”.
Whereas, there is an estimated 650
acres of publicly owned property
along eight miles of Cleveland’s lakefront, including Edgewater Park,
Whiskey
Island,
Wendy
Park,
Voinovich Park, Northcoast Harbor,
East 55th Street Marina, Gordon Park,
Dike 14, Euclid Beach, Villa Angela
Beach, and Wildwood Park; and

1109

41
Whereas, these public parks and
recreation areas are owned and operated by several different public entities, including the State of Ohio, the
City of Cleveland, Cuyahoga County
and the Port Authority; and
Whereas, none of these government
entities has the available funds to
adequately manage, maintain and/or
expand their park and recreational
facilities; and
Whereas, for example, the Cleveland Lakefront State Park System
comprises a large part of the abovementioned lakefront land from Edgewater Park to Wildwood operated by
the State of Ohio; and
Whereas, for the past several years,
Ohio State government has decreased
funding for the state parks; currently
the extensive Cleveland Lakefront
State Park System is patrolled by
only one park ranger per shift and
grass cutting and basic maintenance
are at a bare minimum standards; and
Whereas, the Cleveland Metroparks
System successfully manages more
than 22,000 acres of parkland in
greater Cuyahoga County, dubbed the
“Emerald Necklace”; and
Whereas, this Council believes that
discussions of regionalism should
include discussions of an expansion
by the Cleveland Metroparks System
of this stretch of publicly owned land
bordering Lake Erie that is not
included in the present “Emerald
Necklace” and that is presently operated by these varying governmental
subdivisions; and
Whereas, the Cleveland Metroparks
System is committed solely to developing, managing and improving public parkland, greenspace and zoological facilities; and
Whereas, this Council believes that
the Cleveland Metroparks System is
the perfect government entity that
has proved itself capable of developing and maintaining this magnificent
stretch of publicly owned lakefront
land; and
Whereas, Cleveland Metroparks
should be allowed to acquire the lakefront parks that would once and for
all create a regional Emerald Necklace; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the State of Ohio to enter into discussions with the Commissioners of
the Cleveland Metroparks to allow
Cleveland Metroparks to assume the
lease of the publicly owned land
along Lake Erie currently owned by
various governmental subdivisions,
thereby creating a real regional
“Emerald Necklace”.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
resolution to The Honorable Judge
Anthony Russo, Probate Court of
Cuyahoga County, The Honorable
John Kasich, Governor, State of Ohio,
all
members
of
the
Cleveland
Metroparks Board of Commissioners,
all members of the Cuyahoga County
Council, Ed FitzGerald, Cuyahoga
County Executive, all members of the
Ohio Legislature, and members of the
Cleveland-Cuyahoga Port Authority.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all

42
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and

shall take effect and be in force from

Res. No. 931-12.
By Mayor Jackson and Council
Members Polensek, J. Johnson, Zone,
Brady, Westbrook, K. Johnson and
Cimperman.
An emergency resolution urging
the State of Ohio to enter into discussions with the Commissioners of the
Cleveland Metroparks to allow Cleveland Metroparks to assume the lease
of the publicly owned land along
Lake Erie currently owned by various
governmental subdivisions, thereby
creating a real regional “Emerald
Necklace”.
Whereas, there is an estimated 650
acres of publicly owned property
along eight miles of Cleveland’s lakefront, including Edgewater Park,
Whiskey
Island,
Wendy
Park,
Voinovich Park, Northcoast Harbor,
East 55th Street Marina, Gordon Park,
Dike 14, Euclid Beach, Villa Angela
Beach, and Wildwood Park; and
Whereas, these public parks and
recreation areas are owned and operated by several different public entities, including the State of Ohio, the
City of Cleveland, Cuyahoga County
and the Port Authority; and
Whereas, none of these government
entities has the available funds to
adequately manage, maintain and/or
expand their park and recreational
facilities; and
Whereas, for example, the Cleveland Lakefront State Park System
comprises a large part of the abovementioned lakefront land from Edgewater Park to Wildwood operated by
the State of Ohio; and

July 18, 2012
Whereas, for the past several years,
Ohio State government has decreased
funding for the state parks; currently
the extensive Cleveland Lakefront
State Park System is patrolled by
only one park ranger per shift and
grass cutting and basic maintenance
are at a bare minimum standards; and
Whereas, the Cleveland Metroparks
System successfully manages more
than 22,000 acres of parkland in
greater Cuyahoga County, dubbed the
“Emerald Necklace”; and
Whereas, this Council believes that
discussions of regionalism should
include discussions of an expansion
by the Cleveland Metroparks System
of this stretch of publicly owned land
bordering Lake Erie that is not
included in the present “Emerald
Necklace” and that is presently operated by these varying governmental
subdivisions; and
Whereas, the Cleveland Metroparks
System is committed solely to developing, managing and improving public parkland, greenspace and zoological facilities; and
Whereas, this Council believes that
the Cleveland Metroparks System is
the perfect government entity that
has proved itself capable of developing and maintaining this magnificent
stretch of publicly owned lakefront
land; and
Whereas, Cleveland Metroparks
should be allowed to acquire the lakefront parks that would once and for
all create a regional Emerald Necklace; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the State of Ohio to enter into discussions with the Commissioners of
the Cleveland Metroparks to allow
Cleveland Metroparks to assume the
lease of the publicly owned land
along Lake Erie currently owned by
various governmental subdivisions,
thereby creating a real regional
“Emerald Necklace”.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
resolution to The Honorable Judge
Anthony Russo, Probate Court of
Cuyahoga County, The Honorable
John Kasich, Governor, State of Ohio,
all
members
of
the
Cleveland
Metroparks Board of Commissioners,
all members of the Cuyahoga County
Council, Ed FitzGerald, Cuyahoga
County Executive, all members of the
Ohio Legislature, and members of the
Cleveland-Cuyahoga Port Authority.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.

Section 413.031 Use of Automated
Cameras to Impose Civil Penalties
upon Red Light and Speeding Violators
(a) Civil Enforcement System
Established. The City of Cleveland
hereby adopts a civil enforcement
system for red light and speeding
offenders photographed by means of
an “automated traffic enforcement
camera system” as defined in division
(p). This civil enforcement system
imposes monetary liability on the
“owner” of a vehicle as defined in division (p) for failure of an operator to
stop at a traffic signal displaying a
steady red light indication or for the
failure of an operator to comply with
a speed limitation.
(b) Red Light Offense – Liability
Imposed. The owner of a vehicle shall
be liable for the penalty imposed
under this section if the vehicle crosses a marked stop line or the intersection plane at a system location when

direction is emitting a steady red
light.

Imposed. The owner of a vehicle shall
be liable for the penalty imposed
under this section if the vehicle is
operated at a speed in excess of the
limitations set forth in Section 433.03.

deemed a conviction for any purpose

Not Abrogated. Nothing in this section shall be construed as altering or
limiting Sections 433.03 or 413.03 of
these Codified Ordinances, the criminal penalties imposed by those sections, or the ability of a police officer
to enforce those sections against any
offender observed by the officer violating either of those sections. Nothing in this section shall be construed
to limit the liability of an operator of
a vehicle for any violation of division
(b) or (c) of this section.

selection of the sites where automated cameras are placed and the
enforcement of this ordinance shall

The Director of Public Safety shall
cause the general public to be notified
by means of a press release issued at
least thirty days before any given
camera is made fully-operational and
is used to issue tickets to offenders.
Before a given camera issues actual
tickets, there shall be a period of at
least two weeks, which may run concurrently with the 30-day publicnotice period, during which only
“warning” notices shall be issued.
At each site of a red light or fixed
speed camera, the Director of Public
Works shall cause signs to be posted
to
apprise
ordinarily
observant
motorists that they are approaching
an area where an automated camera
is monitoring for red light or speed
violators. Mobile speed units shall be
plainly marked vehicles.

for an automated red light or speeding system violation under this section shall:

which the violation may be appealed.

the vendor and a police officer, a
strong customer-service commitment,

due process to the ticket respondent
and that conforms to the requirements of the Ohio Revised Code.
(k) Appeals. A notice of appeal
shall be filed with the Hearing Officer within twenty-one (21) days from
the date listed on the ticket. The failure to give notice of appeal or pay the
civil penalty within this time period
shall constitute a waiver of the right
to contest the ticket and shall be considered an admission.
Appeals shall be heard by the Parking Violations Bureau through an
administrative process established by
the Clerk of the Cleveland Municipal
Court. At hearings, the strict rules of
evidence applicable to courts of law
shall not apply. The contents of the
ticket shall constitute a prima facie
evidence of the facts it contains. Liability may be found by the hearing
examiner based upon a preponderance of the evidence. If a finding of
liability is appealed, the record of the
case shall include the order of the
Parking Violations Bureau, the Ticket, other evidence submitted by the
respondent or the City of Cleveland,
and a transcript or record of the hearing, in a written or electronic form
acceptable to the court to which the
case is appealed.
Liability shall not be found where
the evidence shows that the automated camera captured an event that is
not an offense, including each of the
following events and such others as
may be established by rules and regulations issued by the Director of Public Safety under the authority of division (n) of this section:
(1) The motorist stops in time to
avoid violating a red light indication;
(2) The motorist proceeds through
a red light indication as part of funeral procession;

City-owned emergency vehicle with
its emergency lights activated and
proceeds through a red light indication or exceeds the posted speed limitation;

police officer on the scene contrary to
the traffic signal indication.
Liability shall also be excused if a
vehicle is observed committing an
offense where the vehicle was stolen
prior to the offense and the owner has
filed a police report.
The Director of Public Safety, in
coordination with the Parking Violations Bureau, shall establish a
process by which a vehicle owner who
was not the driver at the time of the
alleged offense may, by affidavit,
name the person who the owner
believes was driving the vehicle at
the time. Upon receipt of such an affidavit timely submitted to the Parking
Violations Bureau, the Bureau shall
suspend further action against the
owner of the vehicle and instead
direct notices and collection efforts to
the person identified in the affidavit.
If the person named in the affidavit,
when notified, denies being the driver
or denies liability, then the Parking
Violations Bureau shall resume the
notice and collection process against
the vehicle owner, the same as if no
affidavit had been submitted, and if

1147

79
the violation is found to have been
committed by a preponderance of evidence, the owner shall be liable for
any penalties imposed for the offense.

Cleveland may be enforced by means
of a civil action or any other means
provided by the Ohio Revised Code.
