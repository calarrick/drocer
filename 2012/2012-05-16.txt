For each purchase of Reserved

Land directly from the City to a
nominee of Developer which was not
an affiliate of Developer (an “Independent
Purchaser”),
Developer
shall make available for review by
the appraiser(s) and the City such
documentation
as
is
reasonably
required to determine the full value
of all consideration paid by each
Independent Purchaser for Reserved

covenant for the benefit of such
Independent Purchaser which prohibits disclosure to the appraiser(s)

consideration) to obtain such waiver. From and after the date of the
Second Amendment of the Master

Independent
Purchaser

required to determine the full value
of all consideration paid by such
Independent Purchaser for Reserved
Land.

CITY OF CLEVELAND CIVIL
SERVICE COMMISSION
____________

SCHEDULE OF THE BOARD
OF ZONING APPEALS
TUESDAY, MAY 29, 2012

Whereas, this Civil Service Commission has determined that it is
necessary to amend the Rules of the
Civil Service Commission to include
a provision regarding qualifications
for the promotional examination for
the position of Fire Chief; and
Whereas,
under
Ohio
Revised
Code 124.45 promotions shall be by
successive ranks as provided in sections 124.46 to 124.49 of the Revised
Code and requires that when a
vacancy occurs in a promoted rank,
other than the promoted rank immediately above the rank of regular
fire fighter, no person shall be eligible to take the examination unless
the
person
has
served
twelve
months in the rank from which the
promotion is to be made, provided
that, in those cases when there are
less than two persons in that next
lower rank who have served twelve
months in that rank and who are
willing to take the examination, the
twelve-month service requirement
shall not apply; and
Whereas, it is the intention of this
Civil Service Commission to directly
conflict and supersede that rule for
the City of Cleveland under our
home rule authority to specifically
allow Battalion Chiefs as well as
Assistant Chiefs to be eligible to
take the promotional examination
for the position of Fire Chief.

the Civil Service Commission that

other provisions of the Rules of the

Service
Commission
not
expressly amended by this Resolution shall remain unchanged and in
full force and effect.
