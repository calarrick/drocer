underlying a shelter at a public bus
stop, a newspaper dispensing device
or devices may be placed within two
feet (2') of the leading edge of the
concrete pad, provided that such
placement will result in a clear space
of five feet (5') along the entire
width of the pad between the shelter
and the newspaper dispensing device
or devices;
C. The requirement set forth in division (a)(12) of this section shall not
apply to any newspaper dispensing

at the end of this division (a), a newspaper dispensing device which is in
compliance with division (a)(2)A. or

more than thirty-six inches (36") from
the curb edge of the roadway;
(3) within five feet (5') of any

shall be measured from the edge of
the handicapped ramp that is furthest
from the crosswalk;
(4) within five feet (5') of any fire
hydrant, fire call box or police call
box;

primary entrance of a building; provided that for purposes of this division, a “primary entrance” is a building entrance with more than one (1)
multi-leafed door;

(11) within three hundred feet
(300') of any other newspaper dispensing device on the same side of the

Lakeside Avenue, where the continuous, undivided space for the passageway of pedestrians is reduced to less
than twelve feet (12'), and in all
other areas, where the continuous,
undivided space for the passageway
of pedestrians is reduced to less than

placed in a group of newspaper dispensing devices adjacent to each
other provided that no more than six

proposed single newspaper dispensing device is on the opposite side of
the street or on a different block from
the group. No group of newspaper dispensing devices shall be placed within fifty feet (50') of any other group
of newspaper dispensing devices or
single newspaper dispensing device.

nearest group of dispensing devices.
Outside of the Central Business District, newspaper dispensing devices
may be placed adjacent to each other

newspaper dispensing devices are
adjacent to each other. For purposes
of this provision, “adjacent” means
flush against each other. No group of
newspaper dispensing devices shall
be placed within fifty feet (50') of
any other group of newspaper dispensing devices.
When a person requests the placement of a newspaper dispensing
device outside of the Central Business
District, the Director must send notice
of such request to the councilmember
of the ward in which the requested
newspaper dispensing box is to be
placed.
Newspaper
dispensing
devices
shall be placed parallel to a curb,
shall face away from the roadway
and shall be placed no less than twenty-four inches (24”) and no further
than thirty-six inches (36”) from the
curb edge of the roadway.

a public bus shelter which is perpendicular to the curb edge of the roadway and furthest forward in the direction of traffic on the street (the
“downstream side”); provided, however, that if more than one owner
desires to install a device at any one
public bus shelter, only multiple-dispensing-device modular units may be
installed, placed, and maintained at
such location. No modular unit shall
be installed unless and until the City
Planning Commission has approved
the design thereof. Where more than
one newspaper dispensing device is
located in the vicinity of the downstream side of a public bus shelter as
of January 1, 1991, said devices may
be moved adjacent to the downstream
side of the shelter until such time as
the
City
Planning
Commission
approves the design of a modular unit
for that location. Owners installing
modular units shall be responsible for
their maintenance and shall purchase
such units on terms and conditions
upon which said owners mutually
agree. Newspaper dispensing devices
or modular units installed and maintained directly adjacent to the downstream side of public bus shelters
may be placed so that the front of the
device is perpendicular to or at an
angle to the roadway; so long as such
device or modular unit is placed adjacent to the downstream side of the
shelter.
(2) If a bus company presents to the
City Planning Commission a bus shelter design which incorporates newspaper dispensing devices or a modular frame therefor into the bus shelter, and if the City Planning Commission approves said design, the following shall not apply to any newspaper
dispensing device which is incorporated into any such bus shelter or
inserted into any such modular frame,
provided that the bus shelter is
installed pursuant to a permit duly
issued by the City:
A. the weight requirements contained in division (d)(2) of Section
680.03;
B. the distance requirements contained in divisions (a)(2)B., (a)(6)B.,
and (a)(12) of this section; and

C. the design requirements contained in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and
(c)(7) of this section.
(g) Subject to the provisions of the
following sentences in this division
and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary
contained
in
divisions
(a)(2)A. or (a)(2)B. of this section, if
a newspaper dispensing device is in
place on a concrete pad at a public bus
stop or public bus shelter in a One-,
Two-, or Multi-Family District as of
January 1, 1991, and if said device
would otherwise not be permitted to
remain at such location because the
concrete pad is of insufficient size to
accommodate the placement of such
device in accordance with the provisions of divisions (a)(2)A. or (a)(2)B.
of this section, said device may
remain at the location it occupied as
of January 1, 1991 until such time as
the concrete pad underlying such public stop or public bus shelter is extended by the bus company and the pad is
of sufficient size to accommodate the
placement of such device. Any newspaper dispensing device that is permitted to remain at a public bus stop
or public bus shelter as a result of the
provisions of this division shall be
removed by its owner if a public bus
company installs a shelter on the concrete pad underlying a public bus stop
or enlarges an existing shelter
unless:
(1) the bus company enlarges the
concrete pad underlying the public
bus stop or bus shelter sufficiently to
accommodate placement of the device
in accordance with division (a)(2)A.
or (a)(2)B. of this section; or
(2) the owner of the device extends
the bus company’s concrete pad sufficiently to accommodate placement of
the device in accordance with division (a)(2)A. or (a)(2)B. of this section. In the event that the owner
installs such an extension:
A. the owner shall be responsible
for maintaining the extension of the
concrete pad; and
B. if the owner removes the device,
the owner shall promptly:
1. remove the extension of the concrete pad and restore the property
underlying said extension to its condition prior to the installation of the
extension; or
2. transfer its interest in the extension of the concrete pad to another
owner on terms and conditions upon
which the two owners mutually
agree; or
3. transfer its interest in the extension of the concrete pad to the public
bus company on terms and conditions
upon which the owner and the public
bus company mutually agree; provided that the Directors of Capital Projects and City Planning may, in their
sole discretion, permit such concrete
pad to remain in place, absent a transfer of interest pursuant to paragraph
(2)B.2. or (2)B.3. of this division, upon
such terms and conditions as said
Directors mutually agree.
(h) Subject to the provisions of the
following sentences in this division
and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary
contained
in
divisions
(a)(6) or (a)(12) of this section, if a
newspaper dispensing device is in
place on a concrete pad at a public bus
stop or public bus shelter outside of
the Central Business District as of
January 1, 1991, and if such device
would otherwise not be permitted to
remain in the vicinity because a relocation of said device in order to com-

The City Record
ply with the distance requirements of
this section would result in the placement of said device at a prohibited
location, said device may remain at
the location it occupied as of January
1, 1991. Any newspaper dispensing
device that is permitted to remain at a
public bus stop or public bus shelter
as a result of the provisions of this
division shall be removed by its

enlarges an existing shelter unless:
(1) the bus company enlarges the
concrete pad underlying the public
bus stop or bus shelter sufficiently to
accommodate placement of the device
in accordance with division (a)(2)A.
or (a)(2)B. of this section; or
(2) the owner of the device extends
the bus company’s concrete pad sufficiently to accommodate placement of
the device in accordance with division (a)(2)A. or (a)(2)B. of this section. In the event that the owner
installs such an extension:
A. the owner shall be responsible
for maintaining the extension of the
concrete pad; and
B. if the owner removes the device,
the owner shall promptly:
1. remove the extension of the concrete pad and restore the property
underlying said extension to its condition prior to the installation of the
extension; or
2. transfer its interest in the extension of the concrete pad to another
owner on terms and conditions upon
which the two owners mutually
agree; or
3. transfer its interest in the extension of the concrete pad to the public
bus company on terms and conditions
upon which the owner and the public
bus company mutually agree;
provided that the Directors of Capital Projects and City Planning may,
in their sole discretion, permit such
concrete pad to remain in place,
absent a transfer of interest pursuant
to paragraph (2)B.2. or (2)B.3. of this
division, upon such terms and conditions as said Directors mutually
agree.
(i) Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in division
(a)(6)A. or (a)(8) of this section, any
newspaper dispensing device that is
in place at a public bus stop and at
least six inches (6") forward of a bus
company sign which is located on a
utility pole as of January 1, 1991, but
that would not be permitted to remain
at such location because of the
requirements of division (a)(8) of
this section, may remain at such location until such time as the bus sign is
moved so as to allow sufficient space
for the newspaper dispensing device
to be located forward of the sign without violating any provision of this
section; and, other than on Euclid
Avenue, any newspaper dispensing
device that is in place more than eight
feet (8') back of a bus company sign
at a public bus stop as of January 1,
1991 may remain at such location
until such time as the bus sign is

approve, based upon an application
from the owner of a Newspaper Dispensing Device (“Device”), a change,

device that those divisions prescribe
if the Directors determine that the
proposed change will serve a civic
purpose. The application shall be submitted no less than 30 days prior to
the first date on which a changed
Device would be displayed at its location and shall include, at least, for the
Device:

appearance and/or identification that
complies with Section 680.05. If the
owner fails to do so, the City may
remove and store the Device in the
City’s custody, at the owner’s sole liability and costs fixed by the Commissioner of Assessments and Licenses,
until the owner restores or replaces it
with a complying Device. The City

removing and storing a Device under
this division (b) but shall have no liability for the condition of the Device
or any damage to it in connection
with removal and storage.

City and in Cuyahoga County have
received superior consumer protection services provided through the
County government; and
Whereas, in the past year, the services provided by the County have
deteriorated and low-income residents are not receiving adequate
money management, financial counseling and other consumer services
they need and deserve; and
Whereas, this Council receives
daily complaints from constituents
regarding ineffective and inefficient
services from the consumer protection arm of Cuyahoga County; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that the current inadequate consumer services leaves an entire population of both the City and the
County underserved; and
Whereas, this Council believes it
is important for the Cuyahoga County Executive and County Council to
seek proposals at the appropriate
time in order to contract with an
entity that will provide improved
consumer protection services to lowconsumers
in
Cuyahoga
income
County and the City of Cleveland;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby calls upon the County Council
and County Executive to re-evaluate
the consumer protection services
they currently provide and urges
them to expand such services to better meet the needs of the residents
of Cuyahoga County.

is directed to transmit copies of this
resolution to Ed Fitzgerald, Cuyahoga County Executive and each
member of the Cuyahoga County
Council.

measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed

The City Record
An emergency resolution supporting and encouraging the rights of janitors to a livable wage, health insurance, job security, safe working conditions and union contract and commending the Service Employees International Union, Local 1, for its untiring efforts to fight for rights, respect
and better conditions for these workers and urging owners and managers
of local office buildings to recognize
the hard work of those in their buildings represented by Local 1.
Whereas, this Council is concerned about the increasing disparity in our City between the wealthy
and the poor; and
Whereas, the existence of too
many low-wage jobs means that too
many people are stuck in a cycle of
poverty, which in turn threatens the
viability of our neighborhoods; and
Whereas, these problems threaten
to divide our society and undermine
the prosperity and well-being of all
of us; and
Whereas, many of the working
poor are in the service sector, the
fastest growing portion of our economy; and
Whereas, the members of the Service Employees International Union
(SEIU), Local 1, have dedicated
themselves
to
organizing
and
improving the lot of service sector
workers and janitors in Cleveland;
and
Whereas, a vast majority of janitors in office buildings in downtown
Cleveland are members of SEIU
Local 1 and have won a living wage
and health care through collective
bargaining; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 252-12.
By Council Member Miller.
An emergency resolution supporting certain amendments to U. S. Senate Bill 1813, the transportation
authorization legislation.
Whereas, U.S. Senate Bill 1813 (“S
1813”), is the 2 year surface transportation authorization bill funding
federal highway, transit and bridge
programs; and
Whereas, S 1813 as written, generally takes certain funding away
from local governments as well as
local governments’ ability to control
the allocation of money and gives
more authority to the states to allocate transportation funds; and
Whereas, certain amendments to S
1813 seek to restore local funding
and local authority over the allocation of transportation funds; and
Whereas, as written, S 1813 would
shift more authority to states to control the allocation and programming
of transportation dollars into a
newly created Transportation Mobility Program (“TMP”) and end several
locally
targeted
programs,
thereby reducing the overall funding directed to local governments;
the
Begich
amendment
would

March 28, 2012
restore the local share of funding
under the TMP program contained
in S 1813; and
Whereas, S 1813 would collapse
federal bridge programs into a larger program for states to spend on
transportation
programs
and
all
eliminates a 15 percent set-aside for
off-system bridges which funds local
bridges; the Casey-Blunt amendment
would provide full funding for the
15 percent set-aside to fund local offsystem bridges; and
Whereas, current law provides
that areas over 50,000 in population
are designated as a metropolitan
planning organization (“MPO”) and
have regional planning responsibilities and decision making authority
over transportation and other projects in their region.   S 1813 would
change that threshold to 200,000 in
population and set up new criteria
for remaining as an MPO; the Shaheen amendment would grandfather
in existing MPOs; and   
Whereas, S 1813 creates a new
program called “Additional Activities” that includes a broad range of
eligible projects such as Main Street
revitalizations, local street safety
improvements, and Safe Routes to
Schools, among many others; the
Cardin-Cochran amendment would
turn that Additional Activities program into a competitive grant program for local governments, giving
local elected leaders more control
over how to spend the funds; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports certain amendments to U.S.
Senate Bill 1813, the transportation
authorization legislation.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
resolution to the appropriate persons
at the National League of Cities and
to Senators Sherrod Brown and Rob
Portman.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.

Res. No. 259-12.
By Mayor Jackson and Council
Member Zone.
An emergency resolution urging
local area municipalities, public and
private businesses and individuals
to support “Earth Hour 2012” by
turning off their lights for one hour,
from 8:30 pm to 9:30 pm on Saturday,
March 31, 2012.
Whereas, on March 31, 2012, the
world
will
once
again
observe
“Earth Hour” when hundreds of millions of people, organizations, corporations and governments around
the world will come together to
make a bold statement about their
concern for climate change by turning off their lights for one hour

The City Record
between the 8:30 pm and 9:30 pm;
and
Whereas, in the United States, participants will turn off their lights,
sending a clear message that we
want to “turn out the lights” on
dirty air, dangerous dependency on
foreign
oil
and
costly
climate
change
impacts,
and
make
the
switch to cleaner air, a strong economic future and a more secure
nation; and
Whereas, since its inception five
years ago, Earth Hour has become
a global phenomenon; and
Whereas, more than 5,200 cities
and towns in 135 countries worldwide switched off their lights for
Earth Hour 2011, sending a powerful message for action on climate
change; also in 2011, members went
Beyond the Hour to commit to lasting action for the planet; and
Whereas, as in years past, during
Earth Hour 2012, iconic buildings
and landmarks from Asia Pacific to
Europe and Africa to the Americas
will be switched off; people across
the world from all walks of life will
turn off their lights and come
together in celebration and contemplation of the one thing we all have
in common – our planet; and
Whereas, in past years, landmarks
from around the world went dark

including:
the
for
Empire State Building; the Brooklyn
Bridge;
Broadway

Beijing’s Bird Nest and Water Cube;
Symphony of Lights in Hong Kong;
and Sydney’s Opera House; and
Whereas,
all
Northeast
Ohio
municipalities, businesses and citizens should pledge to participate in
this year’s Earth Hour; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
local area municipalities, public and
private businesses and individuals
to support “Earth Hour 2012” by
turning off their lights for one hour,
from 8:30 pm until 9:30 pm on Saturday March 31, 2012.

is hereby directed to transmit copies
of this resolution to Joe Roman, President and Chief Executive Officer,
Greater
Cleveland
Partnership;
Joseph Marinucci, President & CEO of
Downtown Cleveland Alliance; and
Cuyahoga County Executive Ed
Fitzgerald.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it

Section 573.01 Harbor Boundaries
Defined
The Harbor shall consist of that
portion of the Cuyahoga River from

404

March 28, 2012
the Newburg and South Shore Railroad Bridge to the east and west pier
lights on the south shore of Lake Erie,
the Old River Channel from Channel

within
the

the federal breakwater at approximately East 72nd Street, and the lake
approach to the Cuyahoga River from
Lake Erie between the east and west
pierhead lights on the federal breakwater and the mouth of the river at
the south shore of Lake Erie. A map
showing the boundaries of the Harbor
as described in this section is contained in File No. 1606-11-A.
Section 573.02 Removal of Obstructions in Harbor; Notice; Enforcement
(a) The existence of obstructions in
the Harbor that cause or potentially
cause interference with the use and
enjoyment of the Harbor constitute a
public nuisance which may affect or
endanger the health, safety and welfare of the public. The Director of
Port Control, or the Director’s
designee, shall investigate and take
appropriate measures to cause the
abatement of any nuisance found to
exist with obstructions in the Harbor.
(b) No person shall fail or refuse to
comply with an order issued by the
Director of Port Control, or the Director’s designee, as provided in this section.
(c) Whenever the Director of Port
Control, or the Director’s designee,
determines that there exits an
obstruction within the limits of the
Harbor constituting a nuisance to be
removed, the Director, or the Director’s designee, shall cause written
notice to be served by certified mail
on the owner of the lot or land bounding or abutting the Harbor where the
obstruction is located, or the owner’s
agent, ordering the removal of the
obstruction. The notice shall describe
the obstruction, provide the date by
which the obstruction is to be
removed, and contain such additional
information as the Director, or the
Director’s designee, deems necessary.
The notice shall be addressed to the
owner, or the owner’s agent, at their
last known address or to the address
to which tax bills are sent, or by a
combination of the foregoing methods. If it appears by the return of the
certified mail notice that the owner or
owner’s agent, cannot be found,
notice shall be served by publication
of the notice once in a newspaper of
general circulation in the City.
(d) If the obstruction is not
removed by the owner or the owner’s
agent within the time period specified
in the notice, the Director of Port Control, or the Director’s designee, may
have the obstruction removed at the
expense of the owner, and, if the
owner does not pay the cost of the
removal, refer the cost of the removal
to the County to be assessed against
the property and thereby made a lien
upon it and collected as other taxes.
Section 573.03 Retaining Works in
the Harbor
For the free, convenient and safe
navigation within the Harbor and in
order to provide against the subsidence, washing, falling or depositing
therein of earth or any other material
from the abutting land by reason of
