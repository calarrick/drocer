ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 1507-08.
By Council Members Conwell, Zone,
Sweeney, Brancatelli, Kelley, Cleveland, Johnson, Coats, Brady, Cimperman, Pierce Scott and Mitchell.
An emergency resolution encouraging the Jackson Administration to
research upgrading the current 9-1-1
emergency system to a “Next Generation 9-1-1 System” that includes
new technology such as text messaging, video and picture images.
Whereas, the current 9-1-1 system
in the United States is based on
decades-old technology that cannot
handle the text, data, images and
video that are increasingly common
today; and
Whereas, the limitations of the
current 9-1-1 system mean that each
introduction of a new access technology, for example, wireless phones,
or expansion of system functions,
requires significant engineering and
system modifications; and
Whereas, the nation’s current 9-1-1
system is “an analog technology in
an overwhelmingly digital world”; and

1937

15
Whereas, the U.S Department of
Transportation believes that a fundamental reexamination of the technological approach to 9-1-1 is essential as the nation’s public safety
emergency service networks struggle to accommodate the challenges
of wireless communications and digital services; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby encourages the Jackson Administration to research upgrading the
current 9-1-1 emergency system to a
“Next Generation 9-1-1 System” that
includes new technology such as
text messaging, video and picture
images.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted September 29, 2008.

By Council Member Cleveland.
An emergency resolution objecting to the transfer of liquor license
of a C1 Liquor Permit to 2167 East
55th Street.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Department of Liquor
Control of an application for the

AYAD, Inc., 2167 East 55th Street,
Cleveland, Ohio 44103, Permanent
Number 00239900015; and
Whereas, the granting of this application for a liquor permit to this
high crime area, which is already
saturated with other liquor outlets,
is contrary to the best interests of
the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public

16
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

all the members elected to Council,

This Council finds and determines
it is necessary and proper and in the
best interest of the City to issue the
Refunding Bonds in one or more
Series for the purpose of refunding
(i) one or more Series of Outstanding Revenue Bonds, or designated
portions thereof, to obtain aggregate net present value debt service
savings of not less than three percent (3%), or (ii) one or more Series
of Outstanding Revenue Bonds, or
designated portions thereof, that are
short-term or variable-rate obligations and that the Director of
Finance has determined, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, are subjecting the City to
undesirably high rates of interest or
undesirable fluctuations in rates of
interest that can economically be
avoided
or
mitigated
through
refunding. The principal amount of
each Series of Refunding Bonds is
to be the amount set forth in the
Certificate of Award authorized in
Section 3 and determined by the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, to be necessary (i) to refund the
Refunded Bonds to be refunded by
that Series, (ii) to fund any deposit
to the Debt Service Reserve Fund
required under the Indenture or any
special reserve fund for that Series
separate from the Debt Service
Reserve Fund, (iv) to pay costs of
any Credit Support Instruments, (v)
to pay amounts owed under Hedge
Agreements, and (vi) to pay costs
of issuing the Refunding Bonds and
refunding the Refunded Bonds. The
proceeds from the sale of each
Series of Refunding Bonds shall be
allocated, deposited and applied as
provided in Section 4.
The Refunding Bonds may be
issued in one or more separate
Series, each bearing a distinctive
designation, provided that the Refunding Bonds of each Series satisfy the requirements of this Ordinance. Separate Series of Refunding
Bonds may be issued at the same or
different
times.
The
Refunding
Bonds of each Series shall be designated as provided in the applicable Certificate of Award and shall
include in the designation reference
to the calendar year in which the

The City Record
applicable Series is issued. A separate Certificate of Award and a separate Supplemental Indenture shall
be delivered for each Series.
In the event that the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, determines that the City’s best interests
will be served by causing a Series
of Refunding Bonds to be obligations bearing interest at variable
interest rates, then the Director of
Finance is authorized so to specify
in the Certificate of Award for that
Series. If the Director of Finance so
determines, then the method and
procedure by which the variable
rate of interest to be borne by the
Refunding Bonds of that Series
shall be determined as provided in
the applicable Supplemental Indenture, whether by reference to a market index, by a remarketing agent
or otherwise; provided that no variable rate Refunding Bonds may
bear interest at a rate in excess of
twenty-five percent (25%) per year
(including any Refunding Bonds
held by a provider of a Credit Support Instrument). The Director of
Finance may determine that the
terms of a variable rate Series of
Refunding Bonds may or may not
permit the holders to tender their
variable rate Refunding Bonds for
purchase by the City. If the Director of Finance designates any Series
of Refunding Bonds as variable rate
Refunding Bonds, and if the holders
of that Series of Refunding Bonds
are to be entitled to tender those
Refunding Bonds for purchase, then
the Director of Finance shall also
designate
in
the
Certificate
of
Award
for
those
variable
rate
Refunding Bonds (and may designate others, from time to time, in
substitution therefor) the provider
or providers for any Credit Support
Instrument, the tender agent or
agents and the remarketing agent
or agents, which designations shall
be based on the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the parties so designated
possess the requisite resources and
experience to provide the services
required of them and that the terms
on which the designated parties
have agreed to provide such services are fair and commercially reasonable. The Director of Finance is
authorized to enter into agreements
in connection with the delivery of
each Series of Refunding Bonds, and
from time to time thereafter so long
as the Refunding Bonds of that
Series
are
outstanding,
with
providers of Credit Support Instruments, tender agents (which may be
the Trustee), remarketing agents
(which may be any of the Original
Purchasers) and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
necessary or appropriate to provide
for the method of determining the
variable interest rates, permitting
holders the right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support
for the payment of variable rate
Refunding Bonds upon tender for
purchase or redemption, and providing for the repayment by the City
of any amounts drawn under the

1943

21
Credit Support Instrument consistently
with
the
Indenture.
The
Director of Finance is further authorized to terminate any such agreements if the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor that
the City’s best interests will be
served by such termination. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
pay any fees associated with agreements entered into or terminated
pursuant to this Section from proceeds of Refunding Bonds, to the
extent permitted by the Indenture,
and from the Net Revenues of the
Utility.
Section 3.
Award and Sale of
Refunding Bonds.
The Director of Finance shall sign
and deliver a Certificate of Award
for the Refunding Bonds. In the
event the Refunding Bonds are
issued in more than one Series, a
separate Certificate of Award shall
be signed and delivered for each
separately delivered Series. The sale
of each Series of the Refunding
Bonds shall be awarded to the Original Purchasers selected by the
Director of Finance and identified
in the Certificate of Award, following consultation with the Director of
Public Utilities and based on an
evaluation of the qualifications of
firms that have proposed to underwrite the Refunding Bonds. Each

of
Refunding
Bonds, consistent with this Ordinance and the Indenture:

aggregate
principal
amount of Refunding Bonds issued;
(b) the purchase price to be paid
to the City by the Original Purchasers, which amount shall be not
less than: (i) 97% of the amount
determined by adding to the aggregate principal amount of the Refunding Bonds any aggregate original issue premium and subtracting
from the amount any aggregate
original issue discount, plus (ii) any
accrued interest on the Refunding
Bonds from their date to the date of
their delivery to the Original Purchasers;
(c) whether any Refunding Bonds
are to be subject to optional redemption prior to maturity, and, if so, the
earliest optional redemption date for
those Refunding Bonds subject to

Series,
and
the
applicable
redemption price, which shall be not
greater than 102% of the principal
amount redeemed;
(d) the dates on which and
amounts in which principal of the
Refunding Bonds is to be paid,
which shall be not later than thirty
(30) years from their respective
dates of issuance, with an identification of whether the payment is
due by stated maturity or by mandatory sinking fund redemption of
Refunding Bonds of a particular
maturity;
(e) the interest rates to be borne
by Refunding Bonds bearing interest at a fixed rate, the weighted
average of which shall not exceed
eight percent (8%) as to Refunding
Bonds of any Series, and the method

22
by which the interest rate is to be
determined for Refunding Bonds
bearing interest at variable rates,
consistent with Section 2;
(f) the particular Outstanding
Revenue Bonds or portions thereof
to be Refunded Bonds, and the date
or dates on which the Refunded
Bonds shall be called for redemption
or otherwise retired, which shall
comply with Section 149(d) of the
Code and other applicable federal
tax laws;
(g) the title and Series designation for the Refunding Bonds;
(h) the amount, if any, and source
of any money to be deposited in the
Debt Service Reserve Fund in order
to cause the balance therein to
equal the Debt Service Reserve
Requirement, if and to the extent
required by the applicable Supplemental Indenture, and any determination as to whether there shall be
a special reserve fund for the
Refunding Bonds of any Series, separate from the Debt Service Reserve
Fund, and any determination as to
whether a Credit Support Instrument shall be provided in lieu of
cash in the Debt Service Reserve
Fund or such special reserve fund;
(i) the Paying Agent; and
(j) whether any Refunding Bonds
are to be secured by or payable from
any Credit Support Instruments.
It is determined that the terms of
the Refunding Bonds as so determined within the limitations set
forth in this Ordinance and as so
specified and set forth in the Certificate of Award will be in the best
interest of the City and consistent
with all legal requirements.
The Director of Finance may
enter into a Bond Purchase Agreement with the Original Purchasers
of each Series of Refunding Bonds
setting forth the conditions for
delivery of the Refunding Bonds
that are consistent with this Ordinance, the Certificate of Award, and
the Indenture and that are determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, to be customary
for water revenue bonds issued by
governmental
entities,
including,
without limitation, representations
as to the accuracy and completeness
of information contained in the Official Statement of the City described
in Section 12.
Section 4. Application of Proceeds

Provision shall be made in the
Supplemental Indentures for the
application of any amounts held in
the funds and accounts established

required for the security of Outstanding Revenue Bonds as a result
of the Refunded Bonds’ no longer
being Outstanding, or any amounts
that otherwise are in excess of the
required balances. Provisions may
be made in the Supplemental Indentures for the creation of separate

Trustee, in trust for the Original
Purchasers and subsequent holders
of each Series of the Refunding
Bonds, a Supplemental Indenture,
approved as to form by the Director
of Law, not inconsistent with this
Ordinance, the Certificate of Award

October 8, 2008
and the Indenture and not substantially adverse to the City as may be
approved by the officers signing the
same on behalf of the City. The
determination by those officers that
a Supplemental Indenture is not substantially adverse to the City shall
be conclusively evidenced by the
signing and delivery of that Supplemental Indenture by those officers. Subject to the Original Indenture as theretofore amended, any
Supplemental Indenture may contain
amendments to the Original Indenture, as theretofore amended, or
amend and restate the Original
Indenture, to permit the City to
obtain a Credit Support Instrument
or to permit increased flexibility for
the use of financial or credit structures and techniques determined by
the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, to be in the best interests
of the City.
In order to cause the proceeds of
each Series of Refunding Bonds and
any funds of the City deposited in
an Escrow Fund to be invested as
permitted under Section 9.02 of the
Indenture so that the Refunded
Bonds are deemed paid and discharged, and in order to cause the
amount to be deposited to be dedicated and applied to the payment of
the principal of and interest and
any redemption premium on the
Refunded Bonds as and when due,
to and including the applicable
redemption date, the Director of
Finance is authorized to sign and
deliver one or more Escrow Agreements between the City and the
Trustee as Escrow Agent, approved
as to form by the Director of Law,
providing for the establishment of
each Escrow Fund as a trust fund
in the custody of the Trustee and
for the investment, dedication and
application of the moneys deposited
in the accounts therein and further
providing for the payment of the
fees and expenses of the Trustee for
the performance of its duties as
Escrow Agent. Each Escrow Agreement shall provide for the redemption of the Refunded Bonds identified in the applicable Certificate of
Award to be called for redemption
prior to maturity and shall provide
irrevocable instruction to the Trustee to effect such redemption in
accordance with the Indenture. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
take such other actions as may be
necessary or appropriate to accomplish the refunding of Refunded
Bonds, including without limitation,
the retention of an independent public accounting firm to verify that
the securities to be in an Escrow
Fund are of such maturities or
redemption dates and interest payment dates, and bear such interest,
as will be sufficient, together with
any cash in an Escrow Fund, for the
payment of debt service on the
Refunded Bond to which the Escrow
Fund relates and to make any determinations required for the interest
on the Refunding Bonds to be
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes.
Section 7. Rebate Fund.
There is established and ordered
to be maintained a separate account
for each Series of Refunding Bonds
within the Rebate Fund held in the

The City Record
custody of the Trustee under the
Indenture. The Rebate Fund is not
pledged to the payment of debt service and is free and clear of any
pledge or lien given under the
Indenture as security for the Refunding Bonds or the Outstanding
Revenue Bonds. Calculations of excess earnings that may be due and
payable to the federal government
pursuant to the Code and deposits to
those accounts of the Rebate Fund
shall be made as provided in the
applicable Supplemental Indenture.
Section 8. Remarketing.
In the event that the Director of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is advantageous to the
City to convert the interest on any
Outstanding
Revenue
Bonds
or
Refunding Bonds to fixed interest
rates for a period of time or to maturity, or to convert the interest on
any Outstanding Revenue Bonds or
Refunding Bonds to a different variable rate period or mode, or to terminate or take other actions with
respect to any existing Credit Support Instrument that will require a
tender and remarketing of any Outstanding Revenue Bonds or Refunding Bonds under the Indenture
(such conversion or other actions
and the tender and remarketing
being collectively referred to in this
Section as “remarketing”), the City
shall undertake the remarketing in
accordance with the Indenture. In
connection with any remarketing of
Bonds, the Director of Finance is
authorized to obtain one or more
Credit Support Instruments if the
Director determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the Credit Support Instrument will facilitate the remarketing
of the Bonds. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to terminate any Credit Support Instrument in connection with any remarketing of Bonds if the Director
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the City’s best interests will be
served by such termination. In the
event the Director of Finance determines, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, that it is
necessary to supplement or amend
the Supplemental Indenture applicable to a Series of Bonds to be remarketed in order to address current
market conditions or to permit the
use of or to terminate a Credit Support Instrument or otherwise obtain
financing
arrangements
advantageous to the City, the Mayor,
the Director of Finance and the
Director of Public Utilities, or any
two of them, are authorized to sign
and deliver an amendment of that
Supplemental
Indenture,
or
an
amended and restated Supplemental
Indenture, approved as to form by
the Director of Law, subject to the
Original Indenture as theretofore
amended. The Director of Finance is
further authorized to satisfy the
Debt Service Reserve Requirement
or any special reserve fund requirement for the Series of Bonds to be
remarketed, by the deposit of a
Credit Support Instrument in lieu of
cash, as permitted and more specifically provided in the Indenture, and
to apply cash released from the
Debt Service Reserve Fund or such

1945

23
special reserve fund to the payment
of costs of remarketing. To the
extent the costs of remarketing are
not paid from any cash released
from the Debt Service Reserve Fund
or such special reserve fund, those
costs shall be paid from funds of the
Water Division, which are appropriated for that purpose. The Director
of Finance and the Director of Public Utilities are authorized to prepare one or more disclosure documents in connection with any remarketing of Bonds under the same
terms and conditions as set forth in
Section 12 of this Ordinance with
respect to the issuance of Refunding
Bonds. The Director of Finance, the
Director of Public Utilities or any
other officer of the City having
responsibility for the remarketing of
Bonds is authorized to take such
actions or cause to be taken such
actions as are necessary to maintain
the status of such Bonds as TaxExempt
Obligations,
and
the
covenants and authorizations in Section 10 of this Ordinance shall apply
to such Bonds. The Director of
Finance, the Director of Public Utilities and other City officials are
authorized to sign and deliver such
instruments, certificates and documents as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions
authorized by this Section. The
Director of Finance, the Director of
Public Utilities, the Director of Law
and other City officials, as appropriate, are authorized to make the
necessary arrangements on behalf
of the City to establish the date,
location, procedure and conditions
for the remarketing of any Bonds
and to take all actions necessary to
effect the remarketing of any Bonds
under the terms of this Ordinance
and the Indenture. The Clerk of
Council or other appropriate official
of the City shall furnish the Trustee
a true transcript of proceedings certified by the Clerk or other official,
of all proceedings had with reference to the remarketing of any
Bonds along with such information
for the records as is necessary to
determine the validity of the remarketing.
Section 9. Authorization of Hedging Arrangements.
This Council finds that by engaging in interest rate hedging arrangements with respect to Bonds
the City may reduce its cost of borrowing by optimizing the relative
amounts of its fixed and variable
rate obligations or minimizing the
risk of variations in its debt service
costs or obtaining savings by confirming rates of interest on Bonds
in advance of their issuance. To permit the City to have the flexibility
to undertake with respect to Bonds
interest rate swap, swaption, rate
cap, rate collar and other hedging
transactions, from time to time, and
to
establish
the
procedures
for
approving those transactions, this
Council authorizes the signing and
delivery of one or more agreements,
including amendments or supplements to existing agreements (each,
a “Hedge Agreement”), and any
related agreements necessary for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by each Hedge
Agreement. The authorizations in
this Section are supplemental to and

24
not in derogation of any authority
provided by any other ordinance of
this Council concerning hedging
arrangements.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is to the financial advantage of the City and in the City’s
best
interests
that
a
hedging
arrangement be undertaken by the
City with respect to any Bonds
issued or to be issued under the
Indenture, the Director of Finance
may authorize one or more interest
rate hedge transactions in accordance with the applicable Hedge
Agreement; provided that (a) the
counterparty shall be rated at the
time of signing the Hedge Agreement not lower than A+ or A1 by
at least one rating agency or its
obligations under the Hedge Agreement shall be guaranteed or insured
by an entity rated at the time of
signing the Hedge Agreement not
lower than A+ or A1 by at least one
rating agency, and (b) the term of
each hedge transaction shall not
exceed the final maturity of the
Bonds to which the hedge relates.
The Director of Finance shall
negotiate the terms of each Hedge
Agreement with a counterparty satisfying the credit criteria in this
Ordinance. The City shall receive a
written opinion of a Financial Advisor that the payments to be made
by the counterparty to the City, or
by the City to the counterparty,
shall be fair value for the Hedge
Agreement, considering, among other
things, the credit of the counterparty and the terms and conditions of
the Hedge Agreement. The Director
of Finance shall determine the
terms and conditions of the Hedge
Agreement, including without limitation, the rates to be paid by the
counterparty to the City and by the
City to the counterparty under the
Hedge Agreement, the time or times
and procedures for the exercise by
the counterparty or the City, as the
case may be, of any option under
the Hedge Agreement, and whether
the obligations of the City under the
Hedge Agreement shall be secured
by a Credit Support Instrument. The
approval of each interest rate hedge
transaction
by
the
Director
of
Finance shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery
of the applicable Hedge Agreement
by the Director of Finance. The
Director of Finance is further authorized to terminate any Hedge Agreements or any Credit Support Instrument securing a Hedge Agreement
if the Director of Finance determines, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, that the
City’s best interests will be served
by such termination.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from the Net Revenues of the Utility and may be payable also from
other funds permitted by law to be
used for the purpose, as identified
by the Director of Finance in the
Hedge Agreement. Those payments
may be secured by a pledge of Net
Revenues, to the extent permitted
by the Indenture, all as determined
by the Director of Finance and set
forth in the Hedge Agreement. The
obligation of the City to make pay-

The City Record
ments under any Hedge Agreement

(b) The Clerk, or other appropriate officer of the City, will furnish
to the Original Purchasers and to
the Trustee a true transcript of proceedings, certified by the Clerk or

as is necessary to determine the regularity and validity of the issuance
of the Refunding Bonds.
(c) The City will, at any and all
times, cause to be done all such further acts and things and cause to be
signed and delivered all further
instruments as may be necessary to
carry out the purpose of the Refunding Bonds and this Ordinance or as
may be required by Section 13, Article XVIII of the Constitution of Ohio
or the Charter of the City or the
Indenture or the applicable Supplemental Indenture and will comply
with all requirements of law applicable to the Waterworks System and
the operation thereof.
(d) The City will observe and perform all its agreements and obligations provided for in the Refunding
Bonds, this Ordinance, the Indenture
and each Supplemental Indenture.
All of the obligations under this
Ordinance and the Indenture and
each Supplemental Indenture are
hereby established as duties specifically enjoined by law and resulting
from an office, trust or station upon
the City within the meaning of Section 2731.01, Ohio Revised Code.
(e) The City will use, and will
restrict the use and investment of,
the
proceeds
of
the
Refunding
Bonds in such manner and to such
extent as may be necessary so that
(a) the Refunding Bonds will not
(i) constitute private activity bonds,
arbitrage bonds or hedge bonds
under Sections 141, 148 or 149 of the
Code or (ii) be treated other than as
bonds to which Section 103(a) of the
Code applies, and (b) the interest
thereon will not be treated as an
item of tax preference under Section
57 of the Code.
(f) The City covenants that (a) it
will take or cause to be taken such
actions that may be required of it
for the interest on the Refunding
Bonds to be and to remain excluded
from
gross
income
for
federal
income tax purposes, (b) it will not
take or authorize to be taken any
actions that would adversely affect
that exclusion, and (c) it, or persons
acting for it, will, among other acts
of compliance, (i) apply the pro-

1946

October 8, 2008
ceeds of the Refunding Bonds to the
governmental purpose of the borrowing, (ii) restrict the yield on
investment property acquired with
those proceeds, (iii) make timely
rebate payments to the federal government, (iv) maintain books and
records and make calculations and
reports, and (v) refrain from certain
uses of proceeds, and, as applicable,
of property financed with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the
extent necessary to assure such
exclusion of that interest under the
Code.
Each covenant made in this section with respect to the Refunding
Bonds is also made with respect to
all issues for which any portion of
the debt service is paid from proceeds of the Refunding Bonds (and,
if different, the original issue and
any refunding issues in a Series of
refundings), to the extent such compliance is necessary to assure exclusion of interest on the Refunding
Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes, and the
Director of Finance, or any other
officer having responsibility with
respect to the Refunding Bonds, is
authorized to take such actions with
respect to those issues as they are
authorized in this section to take
with
respect
to
the
Refunding
Bonds.
The
Mayor,
the
Director
of
Finance or any other appropriate
officer of the City is authorized (a)
to make or effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent,
approval or waiver on behalf of the
City with respect to the Refunding
Bonds as the City is permitted or
required to make or give under the
federal income tax laws, including,
without limitation, any of the elections available under Section 148 of
the Code, for the purpose of assuring, enhancing or protecting the
favorable tax treatment or status of
the Refunding Bonds or interest
thereon
or
assisting
compliance
with requirements for that purpose,
reducing the burden or expense of
compliance,
reducing
the
rebate
amount or payments or penalties, or
making
payments
of
special
amounts in lieu of making computations to determine, or paying,
excess earnings as rebate, or obviating those amount or payments, as
determined by that officer, (b) to
take any and all other actions, make
or obtain calculations, make payments, and make or give reports,
covenants and certifications of and
on behalf of the City, as may be
appropriate to assure the exclusion
of interest from gross income and
the intended tax status of the
Refunding Bonds, and (c) to give
one or more appropriate certificates
of the City, for inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Refunding Bonds, setting forth the reasonable expectations of the City regarding the amount and use of all the
proceeds of the Refunding Bonds,
the facts, circumstances and estimates on which they are based, and
other facts and circumstances relevant to the tax treatment or status
of the Refunding Bonds and interest
thereon.
If the Director of Finance determines, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, and so spec-

October 8, 2008
ifies in the Certificate of Award
that the best interests of the City
would be served by issuing a Series
of Refunding Bonds the interest on
which would not be excluded from

If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, based on the written

best interests of the City, the Director of Finance is authorized to prepare and submit those applications
and to provide to each such agency
such information as may be required
for the purpose. The Director of
Finance is authorized to contract for
one or more Credit Support Instruments for any Series of Outstanding
Revenue Bonds or Refunding Bonds
if the Director determines, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, that the Credit Support
Instruments will result in debt service savings to the City, or will stabilize interest rates on those Bonds
or
will
minimize
the
risk
of
increased interest expense on those
Bonds. The Director of Finance is
further authorized to terminate any
such contract if the Director of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the City’s best interests
will be served by such termination.
The cost of obtaining each rating
and the cost of obtaining or terminating each Credit Support Instrument, except to the extent paid by
the Original Purchasers in accordance
with
the
Bond
Purchase
Agreement, shall be paid from the
proceeds of Refunding Bonds or

Director of Finance and the Director of Public Utilities are authorized
to prepare, or cause to be prepared,

are subject to the lien of the pledge
under the Indenture without any
physical delivery of the Net Revenues or further act, and the lien of
such pledge is valid and binding
against all parties having claims of
any kind against the City (irrespective of whether such parties

all purposes of Chapter 1309, Ohio
Revised Code) without the necessity for separation of delivery of the
Net Revenues or for the filing or
recording of the Indenture or any
other resolution or instrument by
which such pledge is created or any
