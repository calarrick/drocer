three months.
Whereas, the Director of Finance
desires to establish a Parking Tax
Amnesty Program for Operators of
Parking Facilities required to collect and remit parking taxes under
Chapter 196 of the Codified Ordinances;
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Finance is authorized to establish a
Parking
Tax
Amnesty
Program
(“Amnesty Program”) for the Operators of Parking Facilities (“Operators”) required to collect and remit
parking taxes under Chapter 196 of
the Codified Ordinances.
Section 2. That an Operator determined to be eligible for the Amnesty
Program is subject to the following:
(a) waiver of all penalties, and
interest on penalties owed for failure to collect and/or remit Parking
Taxes under the Parking Tax Chapter; and
(b) waiver of all penalties, and
interest on penalties owed for delinquent remittance of Parking Taxes
owed under the provisions of the
Parking Tax Chapter without the
need to make the findings required
under Section 196.04; and
(c) Subject to the limitations set
forth in division (e) of Section 5 of
this ordinance, waiver of all interest owed for Parking Taxes owed
under the provisions of the Parking
Tax Chapter.
Section 3. That, no proceeding to
suspend or revoke a license under
Section 196.07 of the Parking Tax
Chapter shall be initiated for an
Operator’s failure to collect or remit
parking taxes for which the Commissioner has granted amnesty and
no civil or criminal action shall be
brought against an Operator, for
any tax period for which the Com-

missioner grants amnesty, based
upon the nonreporting, under-reporting, failure to remit Parking Tax
and Parking Tax liabilities or the
nonpayment of or failure to remit
any taxes owed under the provisions
of the Parking Tax Chapter.
Section 4. That, the Parking Tax
Amnesty Program shall not apply to
Operators that do not voluntarily
and in good faith contact the Commissioner during the Amnesty Application Period to voluntarily submit
to an audit. Any amnesty granted
under this ordinance shall be revoked where any Operator submits
an application based upon fraud.
Upon a determination of a fraudulent application, the Commissioner
shall assess all unpaid taxes, penalties, and interest due.
Section 5. Liabilities Subject to
Amnesty Program. The Parking Tax
Amnesty Program shall apply to the
remittance of penalties, interest on
penalties, and interest for unpaid
Parking Tax liabilities for the tax
periods ending on or before 30 days
prior to the effective date of this
ordinance, with the following exceptions:
(a) Penalties or interest owed as
a result of any audit deficiency
determination that has become final
prior to the commencement of the
Amnesty Application Period.
(b) Penalties or interest, which
are included in any civil tax collection litigation commenced by the
Commissioner prior to the commencement of or during the Amnesty Application Period.
(c) Penalties and interest owed
that have been assessed by a notice
of deficiency prior to the commencement of the Amnesty Application Period are not eligible for inclusion in the Parking Tax Amnesty
Program.
(d) Parking taxes owed are not
subject to amnesty.
(e) Interest on Parking Taxes
owed are not subject to amnesty
unless the Operator pays all Parking Taxes owed in total, at the time
of application.
No refund or credit shall be granted of any penalty paid by any person prior to the time the person submits an Amnesty Application pursuant to this ordinance.
Section 6. Amnesty Applications.
The provisions of this ordinance
shall apply to any person who is
responsible for the collection and
remittance of Parking Taxes under
the Parking Tax Chapter and who
files an application for amnesty
within
the
Amnesty
Application
Period designated by the Commissioner and who does both of the following:
(a) Files completed tax returns
for all periods for which he or she
has not previously filed a tax return
or files amended tax returns for all
periods for which he or she underreported taxes owed; and
(b) Pays in full all amounts owed
that are not subject to amnesty.
Notwithstanding the provisions of
this Section 6, if necessary to effectuate the purposes of this ordinance,
the Commissioner in his sole and
absolute discretion may extend the
period for payment of taxes and
interest due or enter into an installment payment agreement in lieu of
complete payment. Failure of the

2088

November 12, 2008
taxpayer to comply with the terms
of any extension granted or installment payment agreement entered
into under this section shall render
the waiver of any amount granted
under this ordinance null and void,
and the total amount of tax, interest and all penalties shall be immediately due and payable.
An amnesty application may be
granted upon verification by the
Commissioner that all requirements
for eligibility have been satisfied
and upon approval by the Director
of Law.
Section 7. Except as so provided
in this section, and in accordance
with relevant laws, any information
gained as a result of applications,
returns, investigations, hearings or
verifications required or authorized
by this ordinance shall be confidential and no person shall disclose
such information except as compelled by a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance
of that person’s official duties or the
official business of the City.
Section 8. Subsequent Refunds. If
any overpayment of tax under this
ordinance is refunded or credited,
the City shall have no liability for
or obligation to pay interest on that
overpayment.
Section 9. Authority of Commissioner. Upon the effective date of
this ordinance, the Commissioner
shall designate an Amnesty Application Period, which shall not exceed three months in duration, in
which Amnesty Applications shall
be accepted. The Commissioner shall
publish the designated Application
Period for the Parking Tax Amnesty Program established by this
ordinance in the City Record and
shall notify registered Operators
about the Parking Tax Amnesty Program. The Commissioner shall issue
all forms and instructions necessary
to implement this ordinance. The
Commissioner shall enforce the provisions of this ordinance and may
prescribe, adopt, and enforce rules
and regulations relating to the administration and enforcement of this
ordinance.
Section 10. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all

By Council Members Brancatelli,
Kelley, Cummins, Sweeney, Pierce
Scott, Keane, Santiago and Zone.
An emergency resolution supporting the proposal of CSU President
Michael Schwartz to change the
name of Cleveland State University
to The University of Cleveland.
Whereas, in his “State of the University” speech, President Michael
Schwartz proposed that the name
Cleveland
State
University
be
changed to The University of Cleveland; and
Whereas, there is a common misperception that Cleveland State University (“CSU”) is a community college, because both Cincinnati State
and Columbus State are community
colleges; and
Whereas, a name change would
reflect the changes in CSU’s physical appearance and improved academics; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports the proposal of CSU
President Michael Schwartz to change
the name of Cleveland State University to The University of Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to CSU
President Michael Schwartz and to
all members of the Ohio legislature.

An emergency resolution endorsing House Bill 502 and Senate Bill
305 of the 127th Ohio General Assembly that would amend the Ohio Revised Code to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.
Whereas, House Bill 502 sponsored
by State Representatives Dan Stewart (D - Franklin County) and Jon
Peterson (R - Delaware County) and
a companion bill, Senate Bill 305,
introduced by Senator Dale Miller
(D
–
Cuyahoga
County)
would
amend the Ohio Revised Code to prohibit discrimination on the basis of
sexual orientation; and

2111

27
Whereas, House Bill 502 and Senate Bill 305 have been introduced in
the 127th General Assembly by bipartisan cosponsors; and
Whereas, the most fundamental
and honored principles of our national heritage affirm that all persons have certain rights that cannot
be assigned, taken away, or compromised; and
Whereas, we know these inalienable rights include the right to life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness;
and
Whereas, life and liberty cannot
be enjoyed, nor happiness pursued,
if a person is identified, persecuted
or discriminated against on the
basis of his or her inherent nature;
and
Whereas, in concert with our national, cultural and political history
of confronting discriminating practices and prohibiting their continuance, now comes the time to forever ban discrimination on the basis
of sexual orientation or gender identification; and
Whereas, twenty states and fifteen Ohio cities have adopted laws
or policies which prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation; and
Whereas, the intentional exclusion
of persons denies the community the
perspectives
which
nurture
the
development of new ideas, principles, products and services; and
Whereas, job applicants and employees should only be evaluated on
the basis of their potential ability,
or actual performance, to fulfill the
duties of a job, and not on the basis
of sexual orientation or gender
identity which are not determinates
of a person’s ability or performance; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council endorses House Bill 502 and Senate
Bill 305 of the 127th Ohio General
Assembly that would amend the
Ohio Revised Code to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual
orientation.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
State Representatives Dan Stewart
and Jon Peterson, Senator Dale
Miller, The Lesbian Gay Bisexual
Transgender Community Center of
Greater Cleveland, Equality Ohio,
TransFamily, Cleveland Stonewall
Democrats, and Mayor Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency

An emergency resolution recognizing that on November 17, 2008
Cleveland will honor the 10th Annual Transgender Day of Remembrance,
and
further
recognizing
those individuals who are actively
involved in working hard toward
transgender equality in our society.
Whereas, this Council is extremely pleased to recognize that on Monday, November 17, 2008, Cleveland
will recognize and honor the 10th
Annual Transgender Day of Remembrance by both remembering the
deceased and celebrating the present and future; and
Whereas, the Transgender Day of
Remembrance was set aside to
memorialize those who were killed
due to anti-transgender hatred or
prejudice; and
Whereas, this event is held every
November in honor of Rita Hester,
whose murder on November 28th,
1998 kicked off the “Remembering
Our Dead” web project and a San
Francisco candlelight vigil in 1999;
Rita Hester’s murder — like most
anti-transgender murder cases —
has yet to be solved; and
Whereas, this event serves several purposes, including publicly
mourning and honoring the lives of
our brothers and sisters who might
otherwise be forgotten, raising public
awareness
of
hate
crimes
against transgender people, and
honoring those persons who actively work toward transgender equality; and
Whereas, in an effort to further
build and strengthen our communities and nation, we must move
beyond merely “tolerating” the transgender community, and instead value
them as our colleagues, neighbors,
sons, daughters, brothers, sisters,
friends and partners; and
Whereas,
that
Cleveland
City
Council is sincerely pleased to note
the 10th Annual Transgender Day of
Remembrance, and further recognizes those individuals who are
actively involved in working hard
toward transgender equality in our
society; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council recognizes that on Monday, November

By Council Members Polensek, Cummins, Keane, Zone, Santiago, Cimperman, Brady, Johnson, Westbrook,

An emergency resolution urging
the United States Congress to demand transparency and clarity in
the U.S Treasury’s implementation
of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, and to hold hearings to
investigate the pending buyout of
National City Bank by Pittsburgh’s
PNC Financial.
Whereas, the U.S. Congress recently passed the Emergency Economic
Stabilization Act (EESA) that was
to be used by the government to
“bailout” or financially support ailing United States banks:
Whereas, the $700 billion bailout
bill is so vague that virtually any
U.S. company could be eligible for
government help; and
Whereas, the current capital infusions will go only to U.S. banks,
however, the U.S. Treasury has confirmed that the law allows the
department to create other rescue
programs “open to a broader set of
financial institutions”; and
Whereas, as the EESA is written,
the “financial institutions” do not
have to be banks or financial entities;
theoretically,
any
company
could declare itself a financial institution and ask the Treasury for aid
if its rescue is deemed “necessary to
promote financial market stability”;
and
Whereas, it is incumbent upon the
Treasury to clarify the process it is
currently using to determine which
financial institutions qualify for the
capital purchase program under the
EESA; and
Whereas, many Ohio banks have
recently
received
financial
help
through the EESA, including Fifth

2112

November 12, 2008
Third Bancorp, KeyCorp and Huntington Bancshares; and
Whereas,
the
state
of
Ohio’s
largest bank, Cleveland’s National
City Bank, was forced into a buyout
to Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial
after the Treasury Department decided to withhold support from
National
City,
even
while
PNC
Financial used its financial support
received from the EESA to buyout
National City; and
Whereas,
National
City
Bank,
headquartered in Cleveland, has
been in existence in Cleveland since
the Civil War era; and
Whereas, this buyout could possibly cause thousands of National City
workers to lose their jobs; and
Whereas, it appears that the Treasury’s decision to assist in the sale
of National City is not an isolated
incident — there is evidence that
many banks participating in the
EESA capital purchase program
intend to use taxpayer dollars to
buy other banks; and
Whereas, there is some question
as to the U.S. comptroller’s role in
the PNC buyout of National City and
whether his previous ties to PNC
steered the buyout; and
Whereas, all of the above illustrates that, in order for financial
institutions, taxpayers, workers and
investors to understand the parameters of the EESA, and to have confidence in the Treasury’s actions,
Treasury must provide a clear explanation of its actions to date and
the factors shaping those actions;
and
Whereas, moving forward, Treasury must be clear as to how it is
determined which institutions are
receiving taxpayer-funded support,
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the United States Congress to demand transparency and clarity in
the U.S Treasury’s implementation
of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, and to hold hearings to
investigate the pending buyout of
National City Bank by Pittsburgh’s
PNC Financial.
