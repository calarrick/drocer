Ord. No. 168-08.
By Council Member Polensek.
An emergency ordinance designating the St. Joseph Christian Life
Center Retreat House and Accessory Buildings, also known as the
Cunningham Sanitarium, as a Cleveland Landmark.
Whereas, under Chapter 161 of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, the Cleveland Landmarks
Commission (the “Commission”), has
proposed to designate the St. Joseph
Christian Life Center Retreat House
and Accessory Buildings, also known
as the Cunningham Sanitarium, as a
landmark; and
Whereas, a public hearing under
division (b)(2) of Section 161.04
was held on November 8, 2007 to
discuss the proposed designation
of the St. Joseph Christian Life
Center Retreat House and Accessory Buildings, also known as the
Cunningham Sanitarium, as a landmark; and
Whereas, the Commission has recommended designation of the St.
Joseph Christian Life Center Retreat House and Accessory Buildings, also known as the Cunningham Sanitarium, as a landmark and
has set forth certain findings of fact
constituting the basis for its decision; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health, and safety in that the
immediate protection of the historic landmark is necessary to safeguard the special historical, community, or aesthetic interest or
value in the landmark; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the St. Joseph
Christian

and also known as the following
