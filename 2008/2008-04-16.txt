and
otherwise
improved,
through use of an ornamental base
or frame, a streamlined support
structure, or similar features effective in improving the appearance of
the site. At a minimum, evergreen
shrubs, at least three (3) feet in
height at the time of planting and
four (4) feet in height after two (2)

ing billboard, except that a panel or
sign face may be added to the back
of a billboard where previously
there had been no panel or sign
face.
(3) Location. The new or reconstructed billboard shall be placed in
precisely the same location as the
existing billboard unless the City
Planning

determines
that a different location on the same
parcel of land would be more effective in meeting the intent of the
sign regulations, as stated in Section 350.01.
(4) Sign Type. With respect to the
“sign types” defined in division (f)
of Section 350.03, the new or reconstructed billboard shall be the same
type as the existing billboard unless
the City Planning Commission determines that a different sign type
would be more compatible with the
subject property or nearby properties.
(5) Changeable Copy. The new or
reconstructed billboard may incorporate automatic changeable copy
only if such copy is limited to a single billboard panel or two back-toback billboard panels and only if
each such panel replaces two or
more billboard panels on a single
parcel of property or two or more
billboard panels on adjacent properties.
The
replacement
billboard
panel shall not be larger than any
of the billboard panels it is replacing. In the case of a sign utilizing
changeable
copy,
each
message
shall remain fixed for at least eight
(8) seconds.

black community.
Whereas, on Sunday March 30,
2008, Cleveland held its first-ever
Black Marriage Day celebration, one
of more than 200 taking place across

Whereas, the three hour celebration ended with nearly 40 couples

Whereas, Black Marriage Day

families by showcasing black couples in successful marriages despite

The City Record
the statistics: for instance, 2000 census figures show that 70% of all
black babies born in Cleveland are
born to unmarried parents; and
Whereas, it is critical for the

An emergency resolution urging
the U.S. Congress to support the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block
Grant program that was enacted as
part of the Energy Independence and

Whereas, the U.S. Congress has
enacted the Energy Independence
and Security Act of 2007 aimed at
moving the U.S. toward greater energy independence and security, increasing the production of clean

the
threat
to
climate
change, rising energy prices, and
the depletion of natural resources;
and
Whereas, sustainability is a defining issue of our time, representing
the broad notion that activities
should take into account implications for people and the environment so that our actions meet the
needs of the current generation
without compromising future generations; and
Whereas, our nation’s cities are
innovators in implementing energy
conservation and environmental protection programs to support their
communities and the national economy; and

April 16, 2008
Whereas, local governments recognize they have a central role to
play in effecting change, but need
the support and cooperation of the
federal government, by including
funds for the block grant program,
municipal leaders will be able to
expand their efforts to support
building and home energy conservation programs and improve energy efficiency; and
Whereas, the new law authorizes
$2 billion annually, Cleveland City
Council is urging the appropriation
of funding for the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant
program; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges

An emergency resolution urging
the U. S. Department of Housing and
Urban
Development
(“HUD”)
to
resume selling foreclosed houses to
communities, so that cities like
Cleveland can continue to purchase
and renovate or demolish the properties to get ride of blight.
Whereas, last week the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) decided to delay the sales of hundreds of foreclosed houses to communities because it claims it wants to review
the program; and
Whereas,
currently,
there
are
more foreclosed homes set to sell to
communities in Ohio and Michigan,
than in the program’s entire fiveyear history; and

April 16, 2008
Whereas, the HUD program is
designed to sell foreclosed properties for $1 each in order to give new
life to such properties on the market for more than 6 months; and
Whereas, most of these homes are
in disrepair with mortgages guaranteed by the Federal Housing
Administration, so the federal government gets the titles after the previous owners default; and
Whereas, by selling the houses for
$1 each to local governments, HUD
can
remove
the
slowest-moving
houses from its inventory, communities can then demolish the houses
or renovate them and sell them to
people to live in; and
Whereas, in recent months, Ohio
and Michigan began to use this program
aggressively,
through
the
Chapman Law Firm, which got the
right to manage and market all the
HUD-owned houses in these two
states; and
Whereas, the aggressive use of
the HUD program can be instrumental in helping counteract blight
left in Ohio and Michigan by the
nation’s foreclosure crises; and
Whereas, HUD recently refused to
extend its contract with The Chapman Law Firm and no new process
has been implemented to access
HUD-foreclosed properties; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the U. S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development
(“HUD”) to resume selling foreclosed houses to communities, so
that cities like Cleveland can continue to purchase and renovate or
demolish the properties to get rid of
blight.

Brown and George Voinovich, U.S.
Senators of Ohio, Ted Strickland,
Governor of Ohio, Peter Lawson
Jones, Tim Hagan, Jimmy Dimora,
Cuyahoga County Commissioners,
and Jorgelle Lawson, Director, Ohio

Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency

which prohibits Cleveland and other
Ohio municipalities, from regulating
the purchase or sale of scrap metal
by scrap metal dealers, directly in
conflict with a municipality’s Constitutional right to govern itself.
Whereas, the Ohio Senate has
passed S.B. 171, which purports to
establish uniform regulations on the
purchase or sale of scrap metal; and
Whereas, S.B. 171 was amended to
prohibit all municipal corporations
in Ohio from enacting or enforcing
its own regulations or ordinances
regulating scrap metal dealers and
the sale or purchase of scrap metal;
and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
has many vacant structures that are
vandalized for scrap metals, such as
copper and aluminum; and
Whereas, the Codified Ordinances
of the City of Cleveland provide for
the regulation of scrap metal dealers; and
Whereas, this Council anticipates
the need to enact stricter laws with
harsher penalties with respect to
sale and purchase of scrap metal;
and
Whereas, passage of S.B. 171 by
the Ohio House will deny the City
of Cleveland its right to enact and
enforce its own scrap metal regulations which are much better suited
to the very serious problem of sale
of stolen scrap metal in our city;
and
Whereas, the Ohio legislature has
found yet another way to deny the
City of Cleveland, and all other Ohio
municipalities, the right to local self
government; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby opposes S.B. 171, now in the Ohio
House, which prohibits Cleveland
and other Ohio municipalities, from
regulating the purchase or sale of
scrap metal by scrap metal dealers,
directly in conflict with a municipality’s Constitutional right to govern itself.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
all members of the Ohio legislature
and to Ohio Governor Ted Strickland.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,

charitable
or
educational
organization that is operated, supervised or controlled by or in connec-

40
tion with a religious organization,
from limiting the sale, rental or
occupancy of dwellings which it
owns or operates for other than commercial purposes to persons of the
same religion or from giving preference to those persons, unless membership in the religion is restricted
on account of race, color or national origin, nor shall anything in this
chapter prohibit a private club not
in fact open to the public, which as
an incident to its primary purpose
or purposes, provides lodging which
it owns or operates for other than a
commercial purpose, from limiting
the rental or occupancy of the lodgings to its members or from giving
preference to its members;
(b) require any person selling or

does not refuse to permit reasonable
modifications by a disabled person,
which are necessary for that person
to fully enjoy the premises in which

when the modifications are made at
the expense of the disabled person,
which permission may be reasonably based on the disabled person’s
promise, under division (m) of Section 665.03, to restore the interior of
the dwelling to the condition in
which it existed before permission
was granted for the modification,
nor shall this chapter be construed
to relieve any disabled person of
any obligation generally imposed on
all persons, regardless of disability,
in a written lease, rental agreement
or contract of purchase or sale, or
to forbid distinctions based on the
inability to fulfill the terms and conditions, including financial obligations, of the lease, agreement, or
contract, so long as the distinctions
are not based on the disability, or
on the landlord’s refusal to make
reasonable
modifications
in
the
lease, agreement or contract conditions for the purpose of denying a
disabled person equal opportunity to
the use and enjoyment of the
premises. Making the modifications
permitted under this division does
not relieve any person from the
applicability of division (o) of Section 665.03 or from the design and
construction requirements in 42 USC
Section 3604(f)(3)(C) for accessibility for physically disabled persons.
(ORC 4112.12(K), (N));
(c) prohibit the restriction of a
sale or rental of a property on the
basis
of
disability
when
the
property is authorized, approved,
financed or subsidized, in whole or
in part, for the benefit of disabled
persons by a unit of the local, state
or federal government, so long as
the restrictions do not discriminate
against an otherwise qualified disabled person;

physical damage to the property of

reasonable local, state or federal
restrictions regarding the maximum
number of occupants permitted to

persons;

The City Record
(g) hold a person personally
liable for monetary damages for discrimination on the basis of familial
status if such person reasonably
relied, in good faith, on the application of the exemption under 42
USC Section 3607(b)(1) relating to
housing for older persons; or
(h) prohibit a person engaged in
the
business
of
furnishing
appraisals of real property to take into
