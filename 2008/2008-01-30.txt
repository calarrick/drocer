including tree lawn restoration, for
the Division of Water, Department

Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Public Utilities is authorized to
make one or more written requirement contracts under the Charter
and the Codified Ordinances of

including tree lawn restoration, in
the approximate amount as purchased during the preceding term, to
be purchased by the Commissioner
of Purchases and Supplies on a unit
basis for the Division of Water,
Department of Public Utilities. Bids
shall be taken in a manner that permits an award to be made for all
items as a single contract, or by separate contract for each or any combination of the items as the Board
of Control determines. Alternate

by the Commissioner of Purchases
and Supplies until provision is made

providing the general terms and provisions for the issuance of unvoted
general obligations of the City, with
the specific terms of each series of
Bonds to be contained in ordinances
authorizing the issuance of Bonds in

with
the
provisions

timely basis to obtain debt service
savings and as a result, this Ordinance
constitutes
an
emergency
measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public, peace,
property, health and safety, and for

the usual daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. General obligation refunding bonds of the City
(“Refunding Bonds”) are authorized
to be issued for the purpose of
refunding one or more series of the
City’s outstanding general obligation bonds, or designated maturities
thereof, issued to provide funds to
pay costs of Projects 1 through 47
and identified in the Certificate of
Award authorized in Section 4 (“Refunded Bonds”), including the payment of any expenses relating to the
refunding of the Refunded Bonds
and the issuance of the Refunding
Bonds,
including
any
financing
costs within the meaning of Revised
Code Section 133.01(K), provided the
aggregate net present value debt
service savings resulting from the
refunding of the Refunded Bonds is
not less than three percent (3%).
The aggregate principal amount
of Refunding Bonds to be issued
shall be in an amount determined by
the Director of Finance and set
forth in the Certificate of Award as
the amount required to be issued,
taking into account any original
issue discount and/or original issue
premium on the sale of the Refunding Bonds, in order to refund the
Refunded
Bonds
and
pay
any
expenses relating to the refunding
of the Refunded Bonds and the
issuance of the Refunding Bonds.
The Refunding Bonds may be issued
in one or more separate series, each
bearing a distinctive designation,
provided that the Refunding Bonds
of each series satisfy the requirements of this Ordinance and the
aggregate net present value debt
service savings to the City resulting
from
each
series
of
Refunding
Bonds is not less than three per cent
(3%). Separate series of Refunding
Bonds may be issued at the same or
different
times.
The
Refunding
Bonds of each series shall be designated as provided in the applicable Certificate of Award. A separate
Certificate of Award may be delivered for each series.
Section 2.
Authority and Terms.
The
Refunding
Bonds

Article XVIII of the Constitution of
Ohio, Revised Code Chapter 133 and

Revised Code, the Charter of the
City, the General Bond Ordinance
and this Ordinance in the principal
amount and for the purpose stated
in Section 1. The Refunding Bonds
of each series shall be issued in one
lot as fully registered bonds in
denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof but in no case
as to a particular maturity date
exceeding
the
principal
amount
maturing on that date. The Refunding Bonds shall bear the designation
and be numbered as determined by
the Director of Finance.
The Refunding Bonds shall be
dated the date and shall bear interest at the rate or rates per year
specified
in
the
Certificate
of
Award, provided the weighted average of such rates (taking into
account the principal amount and
maturity of each Refunding Bond to

125

15
which a rate applies) shall not
exceed six percent (6%) per year.
Interest on the Refunding Bonds
shall be payable when due, or until
the principal amount is paid, semiannually on the first day of each of
two months specified in the Certificate of Award as the dates on which
interest on the Refunding Bonds
shall be payable (the “Interest Payment Dates”), beginning on the date
specified in the Certificate of Award
as the first Interest Payment Date.
The
Refunding
Bonds
shall
mature in the years and principal
amounts as shall be permitted by
law and determined by the Director
of Finance and specified in the Certificate of Award, based on the written advice of a Financial Advisor to
be in the best interests of the City
given market conditions at the time
the Refunding Bonds are sold and
the objectives of the plan of refunding to obtain aggregate net present
value debt service savings of not
less than three per cent (3%).
The Director of Finance also shall
determine and certify, on or prior to
the date of delivery of the Refunding Bonds to the Original Purchaser, that portion of the aggregate
principal amount of the Refunding
Bonds that is allocable to each Project, and the principal amount of
Refunding Bonds allocated to each
Project that shall be payable at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements (as defined below) on
the applicable principal payment
dates; provided, that (i) the aggregate
principal
amount
of
the
Refunding Bonds allocable to a Project shall be determined by the
Director of Finance on a pro rata
basis by reference to the respective
amount of funds that is required for
the
refunding
of
the
Refunded
Bonds that are allocable to that Project, taking into account any funds
other than the proceeds of the
Refunding Bonds that are available
and appropriated for that purpose,
and (ii) no portion of the aggregate
principal
amount
of
Refunding
Bonds allocated to a Project shall be
payable later than the maximum
maturity for that portion of the
Refunding Bonds as certified by the
Director of Finance.
The Refunding Bonds stated to
mature in any year may be issued
as term bonds (the “Term Refunding Bonds”), payable pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements as defined and
further described below. The Director of Finance shall determine in
the Certificate of Award whether
any of the Refunding Bonds shall be
issued as Term Refunding Bonds,
any dates (the “Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Refunding
Bonds shall be payable pursuant to
mandatory
sinking
fund
installments rather than at stated maturity and the amount of principal to be
paid on each Mandatory Redemption
Date (the “Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Refunding Bonds shall be
subject to redemption prior to stated maturity as follows:
(a) Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption. If any of the Refunding
Bonds are issued as Term Refund-

16
ing Bonds, the Term Refunding
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent,
currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of
and interest on any Term Refunding Bonds shall include amounts
sufficient to redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal
amount of Term Refunding Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided
below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Refunding Bonds in any aggregate
principal amount and to receive a
credit against the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption obligation) of the City for any Term
Refunding Bonds. That option shall
be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and corresponding mandatory redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Refunding
Bonds which prior thereto have been
redeemed (other than through the
operation of the Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements) or
purchased for cancellation and canceled by the Registrar, to the extent
not applied theretofore as a credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Refunding Bond so
delivered, or previously redeemed,
or purchased and canceled, shall be
credited by the Escrow Agent at 100
percent of the principal amount
thereof against the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption obligation). Any excess of that amount
over the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement shall be credited against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligations) in the order directed by
the Director of Finance.
(b)
Optional
Redemption.
The
Refunding Bonds may be subject to
redemption prior to maturity by and
at the option of the City, in whole
or in part on any date, in integral

The City Record
multiples of $5,000, on the optional
redemption dates and at the redemption prices (expressed as a percentage
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed) specified in the Certificate of Award, plus, in each case,
accrued interest to the redemption
date. The first optional redemption
date for a series of Refunding
Bonds shall not be later than ten
years from the first Interest Payment Date of that series of Refunding Bonds, and the highest redemption price shall not be greater than
102%
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed plus accrued interest to
the redemption date. Based on the
written advice of a financial advisor, the Director of Finance may
determine
in
the
Certificate
of
Award that it is in the best interests of the City for some or all of
the Refunding Bonds not to be
callable prior to their stated maturity.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Refunding
Bonds, or portions thereof, to be
redeemed optionally shall be selected by lot prior to the selection by
lot of the Refunding Bonds to be
redeemed on the same date by operation of the Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements of
paragraph
(a).
The
Refunding
Bonds shall be redeemed pursuant
to this paragraph only upon written
notice from the Director of Finance
to the Registrar. That notice shall
specify the redemption date and the
principal amount of each maturity
of Refunding Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar.
There shall be deposited with the
Registrar on or prior to the redemption date, funds sufficient to redeem
at the redemption price, all of the
redeemable Refunding Bonds for
which notice of redemption has been
given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Refunding Bonds are called for redemption
at one time, they shall be called in
the order of maturities directed by
the Director of Finance. If fewer
than all Refunding Bonds of a single maturity are to be redeemed, the
selection of Refunding Bonds to be
redeemed, or portions thereof in
amounts of $5,000 or any integral
multiple thereof, shall be made by
the Registrar by lot in a manner
determined by the Registrar. In the
case of a partial redemption of
Refunding
Bonds
by
lot
when
Refunding Bonds of denominations
greater than $5,000 are then outstanding, each $5,000 unit of principal thereof shall be treated as
though it were a separate Refunding Bond of the denomination of
$5,000. If it is determined that one
or more, but not all of the $5,000
units of principal amount represented by a Refunding Bond are to be
called for redemption, then upon
notice of redemption of a $5,000 unit
or units, the registered owner of
that Refunding Bond shall surrender the Refunding Bond to the Registrar (i) for payment of the re-

126

January 30, 2008
demption price of the $5,000 unit or
units called for redemption (including, without limitation, the interest
accrued
to
the
date
fixed
for
redemption and any premium), and
(ii) for issuance, without charge to
the registered owner thereof, of a
new Refunding Bond or Refunding
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Refunding Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Refunding Bonds shall identify (i)
by designation, letters, numbers or
other
distinguishing
marks,
the
Refunding Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii) the redemption price to be paid, (iii) the date
fixed for redemption, and (iv) the
place or places where the amounts
due upon redemption are payable.
The notice shall be given by the
Registrar on behalf of the City by
mailing a copy of the redemption
notice by first class mail, postage
prepaid, at least thirty (30) days
prior to the date fixed for redemption (or such period specified in the
Certificate of Award), to the registered owner of each Refunding Bond
subject to redemption in whole or in
part
at
the
registered
owner’s
address shown on the Register
maintained by the Registrar at the
close of business on the fifteenth
day preceding that mailing and to
any
municipal
Refunding
Bond
insurance company that has issued
a policy insuring some or all of the
Refunding Bonds. Failure to receive
notice by mail or any defect in that
notice regarding any Refunding
Bond, however, shall not affect the
validity of the proceedings for the
redemption of any Refunding Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Refunding Bonds. Notice having been
mailed in the manner provided in
the preceding paragraph, the Refunding Bonds and portions thereof
called
for
redemption
shall
become due and payable on the
redemption date, and, upon presentation and surrender at the place
or places specified in that notice,
shall be paid. If money for the
redemption of all of the Refunding
Bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, including interest accrued to the redemption date, is
held
by
the
Registrar
on
the
redemption date, and, if notice of
redemption has been deposited in
the mail, then from and after the
redemption date those Refunding
Bonds and portions thereof called
for redemption shall cease to bear
interest and no longer shall be considered to be outstanding. If that
money shall not be so available on
the redemption date, or that notice
shall not have been deposited in
the mail, those Refunding Bonds
and portions thereof shall continue
to bear interest, until they are
paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not
been called for redemption. All
money held by the Registrar for
the
redemption
of
particular
Refunding Bonds shall be held in
trust for the account of the registered owners and shall be paid to

January 30, 2008
them, respectively, upon presentation and surrender of those Refunding Bonds.
The debt charges on the Refunding Bonds shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of
America without deduction for the
services of the Registrar or Escrow
Agent as paying agent. Principal
shall be payable when due upon presentation
and
surrender
of
the
Refunding Bonds at the principal
corporate trust office of the Registrar. Interest on a Refunding Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Refunding Bond was registered, and
to that person’s address appearing,
on the Register (as defined in Section 3) at the close of business on
the date provided in the Registrar
Agreement authorized in Section 3
(the Record Date). Notwithstanding
any contrary provision in the General Bond Ordinance, so long as the
Refunding Bonds are held by a
Depository in a book entry system
(as described in Section 3), debt
charges on the Refunding Bonds
will be payable in lawful money of
the United States by wire transfer
to the Depository made by the
Escrow Agent on each Interest Payment Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance, except for the third paragraph of Section 13(a) (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 (pertaining generally to the periods during which the City is not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges
of
Refunding
Bonds
issued under the General Bond Ordinance), will apply to the Refunding
Bonds. Except for those provisions,
the General Bond Ordinance is
included as a part of this Ordinance
as fully as if restated in this Ordinance. Words and terms not otherwise defined in this Ordinance shall
have the same meaning as set forth
in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Refunding Bonds; Exchange and
Transfer of the Refunding Bonds;
Paying Agents. The Refunding Bonds
shall express upon their faces the
purpose for which they are issued
and that they are issued pursuant to
this Ordinance. Pursuant to Section
4 of the General Bond Ordinance,
each
Refunding
Bond
shall
be
authenticated by the manual signature of an authorized officer of the
Trustee (as defined therein). The
Refunding Bonds shall be signed by
the City’s Mayor and by the City’s
Director of Finance, and, consistent
with Revised Code Section 133.27
and notwithstanding Section 177.02
of the Codified Ordinances of the
City, either or both of those signatures may be a facsimile. The
Refunding Bonds shall bear the seal
of the City, which seal may be a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section 83
of the City’s Charter, the Director of
Law shall prepare the Refunding
Bonds and shall endorse thereon his
approval of the form and correctness
thereof by his manual or facsimile
signature.

The City Record
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating agent, bond registrar, transfer
agent and paying agent for the
Refunding Bonds (the “Registrar”);
provided that the Escrow Agent
shall also act as paying agent for
the Refunding Bonds so long as the
Refunding Bonds are held in a book
entry
system.
The
Director
of
Finance is authorized to sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, an agreement among the
City, the Registrar and the Escrow
Agent (the “Registrar Agreement”)
approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, containing
terms that are not inconsistent with
this Ordinance and not substantially adverse to the City and that are
approved by the Director of Finance
on behalf of the City, all of which
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Registrar Agreement by the Director of Finance.
Payment for the services rendered
and for reimbursement of expenses
incurred pursuant to the Registrar
Agreement shall be made from the
proceeds of the Refunding Bonds, to
the extent available, and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated for that purpose.
So long as any of the Refunding
Bonds remain outstanding, the City
will cause the Registrar to maintain
and keep at its principal corporate
trust office all books and records
necessary
for
the
registration,
exchange and transfer of Refunding
Bonds as provided in this Section
(the “Register”). Subject to the provisions of Section 5, the person in
whose name a Refunding Bond is
registered on the Register shall be
regarded as the absolute owner of
that Refunding Bond for all purposes of this ordinance. Payment of or
on account of the debt charges on
any Refunding Bond shall be made
only to or upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall be affected by any notice
to the contrary, but the registration
may be changed as provided in this
Section. All such payments shall be
valid and effectual to satisfy and
discharge the City’s liability upon
the Refunding Bond, including interest, to the extent of the amount or
amounts so paid.
Any Refunding Bond may be
exchanged for Refunding Bonds of
any authorized denomination upon
presentation and surrender at the
principal corporate trust office of
the
Registrar,
together
with
a
request for exchange signed by the
registered owner or by a person
legally empowered to do so in a
form satisfactory to the Registrar. A
Refunding Bond may be transferred
only on the Register upon presentation and surrender of the Refunding
Bond at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar together with
an assignment signed by the registered owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Refunding Bond or
Refunding Bonds of any authorized
denomination
or
denominations
requested by the owner equal in the
aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Refunding Bond

127

17
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Refunding Bonds only
after the new Refunding Bonds are
signed by the authorized officers of
the City. In all cases of Refunding
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall
authenticate
and
deliver
Refunding
Bonds
in
accordance
with the provisions of this ordinance. The exchange or transfer
shall be without charge to the
owner, except that the City and Registrar may make a charge sufficient
to reimburse them for any tax or
other governmental charge required
to be paid with respect to the
exchange or transfer. The City or
the Registrar may require that those
charges, if any, be paid before the
procedure is begun for the exchange
or transfer. All Refunding Bonds
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Refunding Bonds
surrendered upon that exchange or
transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Refunding Bonds may be issued in
book entry form in accordance with
the provisions of this Section. As
used in this Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Refunding
Bonds and the principal of and
interest on the Refunding Bonds
may be transferred only through a
book entry, and (ii) physical Refunding Bond certificates in fully
registered form are issued by the
City only to a Depository or its nominee as registered owner, with the
Refunding Bonds “immobilized” in
the custody of the Depository. The
book entry maintained by others
than the City is the record that identifies the owners of beneficial interests in those Refunding Bonds and
that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Refunding Bonds may be
issued to a Depository for use in a
book entry system and, if and as
long as a book entry system is utilized: (i) the Refunding Bonds may
be issued in the form of a single,

18
fully registered Refunding Bond
representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered
owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository; (ii) the beneficial owners in book entry form
shall have no right to receive
Refunding Bonds in the form of
physical securities or certificates;
(iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form shall be
shown by book entry on the system
maintained and operated by the
Depository and its Participants, and
transfers of the ownership of beneficial interests shall be made only
by book entry by the Depository and
its
Participants;
and
(iv)
the
Refunding Bonds as such shall not
be transferable or exchangeable,
except
for
transfer
to
another
Depository or to another nominee of
a Depository, without further action
by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Refunding Bonds for use in
a book entry system, the Director of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Refunding Bonds from the
Depository, and the Trustee and
Registrar shall authenticate and
deliver Refunding Bond certificates
in registered form to the assigns of
the Depository or its nominee, all at
the cost and expense (including any
costs of printing), if the event is not
the result of City action or inaction,
of those persons requesting such
issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Refunding Bonds, after determining
that the signing thereof will not
endanger the funds or securities of
the City and after the approval of
the form of any such agreement by
the Director of Law.
Section 4.
Sale of Refunding
Bonds. The Refunding Bonds shall
first be offered for purchase to the
Trustees of the Sinking Fund and,
if not purchased by them, shall be
offered to the Treasury Investment
Account for purchase and, if not purchased for that Account, shall be
sold to one or more firms that have
proposed to underwrite the Refunding Bonds and have been selected
by the Director of Finance based on
an evaluation of the qualifications
of those firms (collectively, the
“Original Purchaser”).
The Refunding Bonds shall be
awarded to the Original Purchaser
in the Certificate of Award which
shall specify the final terms of the
Refunding
Bonds
in
accordance
with law, the provisions of this Ordinance, the written advice of a financial advisor retained under authority of Section 20 and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Refunding Bonds, including: the

The City Record
principal amount of the Refunding
Bonds, the purchase price (which
shall be not less than 97% of the
principal amount of the Refunding
Bonds plus any accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate
or rates, the amounts and years in
which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements), the Interest Payment Dates and the date
of the Refunding Bonds (if different
from those set in Section 2), and any
other matters required in this Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. As appropriate under the
Charter, the Mayor, Director of
Finance, Director of Law, Clerk of
Council and other appropriate officers of the City are, and each of
them is, authorized to take such
actions as are necessary, appropriate and in the best interest of the
City to establish the terms and
requirements for delivery of the
Refunding Bonds and to make such
arrangements as are necessary with
the Original Purchaser in order to
establish the date, location, and procedure, and conditions for the delivery of the Refunding Bonds to the
Original
Purchaser,
to
give
all
appropriate notices and certificates,
to cause a true transcript of proceedings
with
reference
to
the
issuance of the Refunding Bonds to
be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and
other documents and instruments
and to take such actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Ordinance and to take all
steps necessary to effect the due
execution, authentication and delivery of the Refunding Bonds. The
Director of Finance is further authorized to sign and deliver on behalf
of the City a bond purchase agreement between the City and the Original Purchaser (the “Bond Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, setting forth the terms and
conditions on which the City agrees
to sell the Refunding Bonds and the
Original Purchaser agrees to buy
the Refunding Bonds, which shall
be consistent with this Ordinance,
not substantially adverse to the
City, and approved by the Director
of Finance and the Director of Law
on behalf of the City, all of which
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Bond Purchase
Agreement
by
the
Director
of
Finance. It is determined that the
terms of the Refunding Bonds, as
provided in this Ordinance and as
may be provided in or pursuant to
the Certificate of Award, are in the
best interest of the City and in compliance with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an Official
Statement is appropriate or necessary in connection with the original
issuance of the Refunding Bonds,
the Director of Finance is authorized to prepare or cause to be prepared on behalf of the City an Official Statement and any necessary
supplements and to authorize the
use and distribution of that Official
Statement and any supplements. The

128

January 30, 2008
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign on behalf of the City that Official Statement and any supplements.
The Director of Finance is authorized to sign and deliver, on behalf
of the City, such certificates in connection with the accuracy of the
Official Statement and any supplements as may, in the Director’s
judgment, be necessary or appropriate. The Director of Finance is also
authorized to determine and certify
on behalf of the City that such disclosure document is “deemed final”
by the City within the meaning of
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12 (the “SEC Rule”).
The Director of Finance is authorized to contract for services for the
production and distribution of preliminary and final official statements, including by printed and
electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Refunding Bonds, the City
agrees, in accordance with, and as
the only obligated person with
respect to the Refunding Bonds
under the SEC Rule, to provide or
cause to be provided such financial
information and operating data and
notices, in such manner, as may be
required for purposes of the SEC
Rule. In order to describe and specify certain terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare or
cause to be prepared, and to sign
and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of the City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate,
which shall constitute the continuing disclosure agreement made by
the City for the benefit of the holders and beneficial owners of the
Refunding
Bonds
in
accordance
with the SEC Rule. The performance
of that Agreement shall be subject
to the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to
establish procedures in order to
ensure compliance by the City with
its continuing disclosure agreement,
including the timely provision of
information and notices.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax.
For the purpose of providing the necessary
funds to pay the interest on the
Refunding Bonds promptly when
and as the same falls due, and also
to provide for the discharge of the
Refunding Bonds at maturity, there
shall be and is levied on all the taxable property in the City, in addition to all other taxes, a direct tax
annually during the period the Refunding Bonds are outstanding, in
an amount sufficient to provide for
the payment of that interest, when
and as the same shall fall due, and
also to discharge the principal of
the Refunding Bonds at maturity,
which tax shall not be less than the
interest
and
sinking
fund
tax
required by Section 11 of Article XII
of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is ordered
computed,
certified,
levied
and
extended upon the tax duplicate and

January 30, 2008
collected by the same officers, in the
same manner and at the same time
that taxes for general purposes for
each of those years are certified,
extended and collected. The tax
shall be placed before and in preference to all other items and for the
full amount thereof. The funds
derived from those tax levies shall
be placed in the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund as required by the
General Bond Ordinance and those
funds, together with the interest collected on them shall be irrevocably
pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds when and as the same
fall due; provided, however, that,
subject to the provisions of Section
8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in
each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the
Refunding Bonds and are appropriated for such purpose, the amount
of such tax shall be reduced by the
amount of such revenues so available and appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25(B)(1) and 5705.51 of
the Revised Code, and in accordance
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the
General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt
charges for the Refunding Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds;
Notice of Redemption of Refunding
Bonds.
Pursuant to Revised Code
Section 133.34, the General Bond
Ordinance and this Ordinance, the
proceeds of the Refunding Bonds to
be applied to the refunding of the
Refunded Bonds shall be deposited
in a separate bank account within
the Unvoted Refunding Bond and
Note Redemption Account of the
Sinking Fund held by The Huntington National Bank, Cleveland,
Ohio, as Escrow Agent, in accordance with Section 179.08 of the Codified Ordinances of the City and the
Escrow Agreement described below,
and shall be applied to the payment
of debt service charges on the
Refunding Bonds from and after the
date of issuance of the Refunding
Bonds to and including their respective maturity or prior redemption
dates. The amount to be deposited
in the Escrow Fund shall be determined by the Director of Finance in
the Certificate of Award and shall
be the amount necessary, together
with money in the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund available for the purpose, to provide for the refunding of
the Refunded Bonds. Any transfer to
the Escrow Fund of any money currently on deposit in the Unvoted
Tax-Supported Obligations Account
and determined by the Director of
Finance to be available for payment
of the Refunding Bonds, is authorized by this Ordinance.
Money deposited in the Escrow
Fund shall be (a) held in cash or
(b) invested in direct obligations of
the United States of America that
mature or are subject to redemption
by and at the option of the holder,

The City Record
in amounts sufficient, together with
any uninvested cash in the Escrow
Fund but without further investment or reinvestment, for the payment of the principal of, any redemption premium and interest on,
the Refunded Bonds as provided in
the Escrow Agreement. Pursuant to
the respective Ordinances authorizing the Refunded Bonds, Section
133.34 of the Revised Code and this
Ordinance, money deposited in the
Escrow Fund, and the investment
income thereon, are pledged to the
payment of the Refunded Bonds.
Pursuant to Revised Code Chapter
133 and this Ordinance, and notwithstanding Chapter 179 of the Codified
Ordinances, any accrued interest
received
from
the
sale
of
the
Refunding Bonds and any original
issue premium in excess of the
amount deposited with the Escrow
Agent under the Escrow Agreement
to accomplish the refunding of the
Refunded Bonds shall be deposited
in the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the Sinking Fund
to be applied to the payment of
interest on the Refunding Bonds.
The proceeds of the Refunding
Bonds to be applied to pay costs of
any credit enhancement facilities
shall be paid to the provider or
providers of those credit enhancement facilities. The proceeds of the
Refunding Bonds to be used to pay
costs of issuing the Refunding
Bonds and refunding the Refunding
Bonds shall be deposited with the
Registrar in a separate account
under
the
Registrar
Agreement
pending their application to the payment of such costs.
The Director of Finance is authorized to sign and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of the Issuer,
an agreement (the “Escrow Agreement”) between the City and the
Escrow Agent, providing for the
investment and holding in escrow of
the
proceeds
of
the
Refunding
Bonds to be applied to the refunding of the Refunded Bonds and for
the
application
of
the
moneys
derived from such investments, in
accordance with the General Bond
Ordinance and this Ordinance and
as otherwise directed by law. Notice
of the advance refunding of any of
the Refunded Bonds and any early
redemption of Refunded Bonds shall
be given in accordance with the
terms of the Refunded Bonds and as
further provided in the Escrow
Agreement. The Refunded Bonds
shall be retired at stated maturity
or redeemed prior to maturity as
provided in the Certificate of Award

Refunded Bonds and the Escrow
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Escrow Agreement
from money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose. The Director of
Finance shall obtain the services of
an independent accounting firm of
national reputation to provide a verification report as to the adequacy
of the escrow fund to pay the
Refunded Bonds on the dates set
forth in the Escrow Agreement. The
Director of Finance and other appro-

129

accordance with the General Bond
Ordinance and this Ordinance and

cause the Refunded Bonds to be
deemed paid and discharged.
If U.S. Treasury Securities State
and Local Government Series are to
be purchased for the Escrow Fund,
the Escrow Agent is authorized to
file, on behalf of the City, subscriptions for the purchase and issuance
of those Securities. If those Securities are not timely available for purchase, or if in the judgment of the
Director of Finance, an open-market
purchase of direct obligations of the
United States of America for the
Escrow Fund is in the best interest
of and financially advantageous to
the City, the Director of Finance
may purchase and deliver those
obligations, engage the services of
a bidding agent or similar entity for
the purpose of facilitating the bidding, purchase and delivery of such
obligations for, and any related
structuring of, the Escrow Fund,
execute such instruments as are
deemed necessary to engage such
services for such purpose, and provide further for the payment of the
cost of obtaining such services from
the
proceeds
of
the
Refunding
Bonds to the extent available and
otherwise from any other funds lawfully available and that are appropriated or shall be appropriated for
that purpose.

General Bond Ordinance and the
other covenants, terms and agreements provided hereunder and in the
General Bond Ordinance to secure
payment of the principal of and
interest on the Refunding Bonds,
the City hereby determines, declares, warrants and covenants that

and discharged all the outstanding
Refunding Bonds, or there shall
otherwise be paid to the holders of
the outstanding Refunding Bonds
all debt charges due or to become
due thereon, and provision shall
also be made for paying all other
sums payable hereunder, then and
in
that
event
this
Ordinance
(except for Section 8(b) hereof)
shall cease to be of further effect,
and the covenants, agreements and
other obligations of the City under
this Ordinance shall be discharged
and satisfied, and thereupon the

or sub-accounts, in trust for and
irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold
in special accounts or sub-accounts,
in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations
of the United States certified by an

without further investment or reinvestment of either the principal
amount thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held
in trust and committed, except as
hereinafter provided), as will be sufficient,
together
with
moneys
referred to in (i) above, for the payment, at their maturities or redemption dates, of all debt charges on the
Refunding Bonds to their date of

for the giving of such notice. Any
moneys held by the Escrow Agent
in accordance with the provisions of
this Section shall be invested by the
Escrow Agent in direct obligations
of the United States of America
maturing, or redeemable at the
option of the holder, at times and in
amounts sufficient to meet payment
of debt charges on the Refunding
Bonds, as directed by the Director
of Finance. Any income or interest
earned by, or increment to, the

to be in excess of the amount

Refunding Bonds authorized herein,
and nothing in this Ordinance shall
be deemed to alter or restrict such
full application of the General Bond
Ordinance, except for the exclusion
from application to the Refunding
Bonds of the provisions of the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) and the
third paragraph of Section 4 of the
General Bond Ordinance pursuant to
Section 2 of this Ordinance.
Section 10. Captions. The captions
or headings in this Ordinance are

of this Ordinance.
Section 11.
Federal Tax Covenants.
The City covenants that it
will use, and will restrict the use
and investment of, the proceeds of
the Refunding Bonds in such manner and to such extent as may be
necessary so that (a) the Refunding
Bonds will not (i) constitute private
activity bonds, arbitrage bonds or
hedge bonds under Sections 141, 148
or 149 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the Code) or
(ii) be treated other than as bonds
to which Section 103(a) of the Code
applies, and (b) the interest thereon will not be treated as an item of
tax preference under Section 57 of
the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the Refunding Bonds to be and to remain
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will
not take or authorize to be taken
any actions that would adversely
affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or
persons acting for it, will, among
other acts of compliance, (i) apply
the
proceeds
of
the
Refunding
Bonds to the governmental purpose
of the borrowing, (ii) restrict the
yield on investment property acquired with those proceeds, (iii)
make timely and adequate payments
to the federal government, (iv)
maintain books and records and
make calculations and reports, and
(v) refrain from certain uses of
those proceeds, and, as applicable,
of property financed with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the
extent necessary to assure such
exclusion of that interest under the
Code.
Each covenant made in this section with respect to the Refunding
Bonds is also made with respect to
all issues any portion of the debt
service on which is paid from proceeds of the Refunding Bonds (and,
if different, the original issue and
any refunding issues in a series of
refundings), to the extent such compliance is necessary to assure exclusion of interest on the Refunding
Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes, and the officers identified above are authorized
to take actions with respect to those
issues as they are authorized in this
section to take with respect to the
Refunding Bonds.
The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer of
the City having responsibility for
issuance of the Refunding Bonds is

130

January 30, 2008
hereby authorized (a) to make or
effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or
waiver on behalf of the City with
respect to the Refunding Bonds as
the City is permitted or required to
make or give under the federal
income tax laws, including, without
limitation thereto, any of the elections
provided
for

Section
148(f)(4)(C) of the Code or available under Section 148 of the Code,
for the purpose of assuring, enhancing or protecting favorable tax
treatment or status of the Refunding Bonds or interest thereon or
assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose, reducing the
burden or expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or
payments or penalties, or making
payments of special amounts in lieu
of making computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as
rebate, or obviating those amounts
or payments, as determined by that
officer, which action shall be in
writing and signed by the officer,
(b) to take any and all other
actions, make or obtain calculations,
make payments, and make or give
reports, covenants and certifications
of and on behalf of the City, as may
be appropriate to assure the exclusion of interest from gross income
and the intended tax status of the
Refunding Bonds, and (c) to give
one or more appropriate certificates
of the City, for inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Refunding Bonds, setting forth the reasonable expectations of the City regarding the amount and use of all the
proceeds of the Refunding Bonds,
the facts, circumstances and estimates on which they are based, and
other facts and circumstances relevant to the tax treatment of the
interest on and the tax status of the
Refunding Bonds.

Ord. No. 119-08.
By Council Member Sweeney (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the issuance and sale of bonds
in the maximum principal amount of
$6,750,000 for the purpose of providing funds to revitalize lands and
authorizing related matters.
Whereas, this Council desires to
issue bonds in an aggregate princi-

131

21
pal amount not to exceed Six Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($6,750,000) (the “Series 2008
Bonds”) to finance the costs of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1; and
Whereas, the Series 2008 Bonds
shall be payable from and secured
by income tax revenues of the City
remaining after deposits required
under the General Bond Ordinance
(as defined in Section 2) are made
to the escrow agent for the City’s
general obligation bonds; and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of this City, has certified to this Council that the estimated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be financed with
the proceeds of the Series 2008
Bonds is at least five (5) years, as
evidenced by the certificate contained in File No. 119-08-A; and
Whereas, the authorization for
issuance of the Series 2008 Bonds is
necessary to provide funds to pay
the
costs
of
certain
permanent
improvements described in Section 1
that are urgently needed for the
benefit of the City, and as a result,
this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the
immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety, and for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary to issue the Series 2008
Bonds in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed Six Million
Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($6,750,000) for the purpose of
providing funds for the demolition
of structures on publicly and privately owned lands in the City and
the clearance, remediation and clean
up of those lands to enable the environmentally safe and productive
development and use or reuse of
those lands, including planning and
assessment,
land
acquisition
or
assembly, and infrastructure, and to
pay all expenses incurred in connection with the issuance of the
securities, including all financing
costs within the meaning of Section
133.01(K) of the Revised Code and
such
other
costs
that
may
be
financed with the proceeds of securities as permitted by law.
Section 2. Authority, Security and
Source of Payment. The Series 2008
Bonds shall be issued pursuant to
the Ohio Constitution, Chapter 133 of
the Ohio Revised Code, the Charter
of the City, and this Ordinance for
the purpose stated in Section 1. The
Series 2008 Bonds shall be payable
from and secured by the income tax
revenues of the City on a basis subordinate to the security given to the
general obligation bonds of the City
under Ordinance No. 1749-80 passed
by the Council on October 8, 1980, as
amended by Ordinance No. 1112-83
passed by the Council on May 6,
1983,
and
Ordinance
No.
944-96,
passed by the Council on June 10,
1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so
amended and as the same may further be amended from time to time
in accordance with its provisions, is
referred to as the “General Bond
Ordinance”). The debt service on the

22
Series 2008 Bonds shall be payable
from income tax collections remaining after depositing with the escrow
agent under the General Bond Ordinance the amount required for the
payment of debt service on the
City’s
general
obligation
bonds
issued and outstanding, from time to
time, under the General Bond Ordinance. The Series 2008 Bonds shall
be issued and secured under the
terms of the Trust Indenture (the
“Indenture”) between the City and
U.S. Bank National Association, as
trustee (the “Trustee”) in substantially the form on file with the
Clerk of Council in the File No. referenced in the preambles of this
Ordinance, with such completions
and changes as may be consistent
with this Ordinance and the Certificate of Award identified in Section
4 and approved by the Director of
Finance as not being adverse to the
City, the Director’s signing and
delivery of the Indenture being conclusive evidence of that determination. The Indenture permits the
issuance of additional bonds, subject
to certain restrictions. Any additional issues of bonds, together with
the Series 2008 Bonds, are referred
to in this Ordinance and in the
Indenture as the “Bonds.”
Section 3.
Pledge and Covenant
to Maintain Income Tax. So long as
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City pledges the
municipal income taxes of the City
and grants a lien thereon, subordinate to the lien granted in the General Bond Ordinance as security for
the general obligation bonds of the
City issued and outstanding under
the General Bond Ordinance, to the
full extent required to meet debt
charges
payable
on
the
Bonds
issued and outstanding under the
Indenture and to pay any debt
charges on Parity Obligations (as
defined in the Indenture). The City
covenants to appropriate annually
sufficient amounts from the income
taxes for such purpose. The City further covenants that so long as any
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City shall not repeal
or amend, or suffer the repeal of,
any ordinance for the levy or collection of its income taxes in any
manner or to such extent that the
City would not be able to meet its
obligations to the holders of the
Bonds.
Section 4.
Terms of the Series
2008 Bonds. The Series 2008 Bonds
shall be issued in fully registered
form. The Series 2008 Bonds initially shall be delivered only in bookentry form, shall be registered in
the name of the Depository (as
defined in the Indenture) or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository, and shall not be transferable
or exchangeable (except for transfer to another Depository or its nominee) without further action by the
City pursuant to the provisions of
the Indenture and the First Supplement identified below. The Series
2008 Bonds shall be designated
“Revitalization Improvement Bonds,
Series 2008” and may contain such
further designation as provided in
the Certificate of Award identified
below. The Series 2008 Bonds shall

The City Record
be issued in one lot as fully registered Series 2008 Bonds in denominations of $5,000 or any whole multiple thereof. The Series 2008 Bonds
shall be numbered as determined by
the Director of Finance. The Series
2008 Bonds shall be signed by the
officials of the City and in the manner set forth in the Indenture.
The Series 2008 Bonds shall be
dated as of April 1, 2008, or such
other date, but in no event later
than December 31, 2009, specified in
the certificate of award providing
for the final terms of the Series 2008
Bonds and the sale of the Series
2008 Bonds in accordance with this
Ordinance
(the
“Certificate
of
Award”). The Series 2008 Bonds
shall be issued in the principal
amount specified in the Certificate
of Award, which shall not exceed
the amount stated in Section 1. The
Series 2008 Bonds shall bear interest
from their date until the principal
amount is paid at the rate or rates
per year specified in the Certificate
of Award, provided that the weighted average of such rates (taking
into account the principal amount
and maturity of each Bond to which
a rate applies) shall not exceed six
percent (6%) per year. Interest on
the Series 2008 Bonds shall be
payable semi-annually on the dates
specified in the Certificate of Award
(the “Interest Payment Dates”).
The
Series
2008
Bonds
shall
mature in the years and principal
amounts set forth in the Certificate
of Award, provided that (i) each
principal payment shall occur on an
Interest Payment Date, (ii) the first
principal payment on the Series 2008
Bonds shall be no later than December 15, 2010, and (iii) the final maturity date of the Series 2008 Bonds
shall be no later than December 15,
2030.
The Series 2008 Bonds stated to
mature in any year may be issued
as serial Series 2008 Bonds or as
term Series 2008 Bonds payable prior
to stated maturity pursuant to sinking fund redemption (the “Term
Bonds”). The Director of Finance
shall determine in the Certificate of
Award whether any of the Series
2008 Bonds shall be issued as Term
Bonds, any dates (the “Mandatory
Redemption Dates”) on which the
principal amount of the Term Bonds
shall be payable pursuant to mandatory
sinking
fund
installments
rather than at stated maturity and
the amount of principal to be paid
on
each
Mandatory
Redemption
Date (the “Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements”). If any
of the Series 2008 Bonds are issued
as Term Series 2008 Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be redeemed pursuant
to the Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements at a redemption price of 100 percent of the
principal amount redeemed, plus interest accrued to the redemption
date, on the Mandatory Redemption
Dates. The aggregate of the moneys
to be deposited with the Trustee for
payment of principal of and interest
on any Term Bonds shall include
amounts sufficient to redeem on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates the
principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the Mandatory Sinking Fund Re-

132

January 30, 2008
demption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided in
the Indenture and the First Supplement).
The Series 2008 Bonds may be subject to redemption prior to maturity
by and at the option of the City, in
whole or in part on any date, in
whole multiples of $5,000, on the
optional redemption dates and at the
redemption prices (expressed as a
percentage of the principal amount
redeemed) specified in the Certificate of Award, plus, in each case,
accrued interest to the redemption
date. The first optional redemption
date, if any, shall not be later than
ten years from the first Interest
Payment Date, and the highest
redemption
price
shall
not
be
greater than 102% of the principal
amount redeemed plus accrued interest to the redemption date. Based on
the written advice of a financial
advisor, the Director of Finance may
determine
in
the
Certificate
of
Award that it is in the best interests of the City for some or all of
the Series 2008 Bonds not to be
callable prior to their stated maturity.
If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the City
may have the option to purchase
any Bond which is redeemable by
optional redemption at a purchase
price not less than the redemption
price that would be payable if that
Bond
were
called
for
optional
redemption on the date of the proposed purchase. That election shall
be exercised as provided in the First
Supplement.
If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the Series
2008 Bonds may be secured by a
Debt Service Reserve Fund to be
held by the Trustee under the Indenture. The principal amount of the
Series 2008 Bonds may include provision for funding the Debt Service
Reserve Fund from the proceeds of
the Bonds, subject to compliance
with applicable federal tax laws.
Section 5.
Sale of Series 2008
Bonds. The Series 2008 Bonds shall
first be offered for purchase to the
Trustees of the Sinking Fund and,
if not purchased by them, shall be
offered to the Treasury Investment
Account for purchase and, if not purchased for that Account, shall be
sold to one or more firms that have
proposed to underwrite the Series
2008 Bonds and have been selected
by the Director of Finance based on
an evaluation of the qualifications
of those firms (collectively, the

appropriate officers of the City are,
and each of them is, authorized to
take such actions as are necessary,
appropriate and in the best interest
of the City to establish the terms

conditions on which the City agrees
to sell the Series 2008 Bonds and the
Original Purchaser agrees to buy

approved by the Director of Finance
on behalf of the City, all of which

Section 8. Bond Anticipation Notes.
For the purpose of raising money in
anticipation of the issuance of the
Series 2008 Bonds for the purpose
set forth in Section 1, notes of the
City may be issued in an aggregate
principal amount not to exceed Six
Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars
($6,750,000)
(the
“Notes”) upon the direction of the
Director of Finance to be set forth
in a certificate providing for the
final terms of the Notes and the sale
of the Notes and signed by the
Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate of Award”). The Notes, if
sold as fixed rate obligations, shall
bear interest at such rate, not
exceeding six percent (6%) per
year, and shall be payable on the
date or dates, as shall be determined
by the Director of Finance of the
City in the Note Certificate of
Award; shall be dated their date of
issuance; shall mature on the date
set forth in the Note Certificate of
Award; shall be subject to redemption by the City at any time prior
to maturity without penalty, unless
the Director of Finance, based on
the advice of a financial advisor,
determines that it is in the best
interest of the City in order to
enhance the marketability of the
Notes, that the Notes not be redeemable prior to maturity; shall be
designated “Revitalization Improve-

133

23
ment Bond Anticipation Notes” or as
otherwise provided in the Note Certificate of Award; shall be issued in
such numbers and denominations as
may be requested by the Note Purchaser (hereinafter defined); and
shall be issued in fully registered
form (which may be in a book entry
only system) in denominations of
$5,000 or whole multiples thereof.
The provisions of Sections 9.98 to
9.983 of the Revised Code shall
apply to the Notes and pursuant to
that authority and this Ordinance,
the Director of Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award,
based on the written advice of a
financial advisor, that the City’s
best interests will be served by
causing all or a portion of the Notes
to be obligations bearing interest at
variable rates, redeemable by the
City without penalty or premium on
interest adjustment dates. If the
Director of Finance so determines,
then the Director of Finance shall
specify in the Certificate of Award
the method and procedure by which
the variable rate of interest to be
borne by the variable rate Notes
shall be determined, whether by reference to a market index, by a
remarketing agent or otherwise; provided that the variable rate Notes
shall not bear interest at a rate in
excess of sixteen percent (16%) per
year. Notwithstanding that limitation, Notes held by a provider of a
Credit
Support
Instrument
(as
defined in Section 11) may bear
interest at a rate not in excess of
twenty-five percent (25%) per year
as provided in the agreement with
the provider of the Credit Support
Instrument. Holders of variable rate
Notes may be given the right to tender their variable rate Notes for purchase by the City at the times, on
the terms, and subject to the conditions set forth in the Certificate of
Award and any tender agreement;
provided that tender rights shall be
exercisable only at such times as a
Credit Support Instrument is in
place that provides for the payment
of the purchase price payable to the
tendering holder of a variable rate
Note. If the Director of Finance designates any Notes as variable rate
Notes, and if the holders of the variable rate Notes are to be entitled to
tender the variable rate Notes for
purchase,
then
the
Director
of
Finance shall also designate in the
Certificate of Award for those variable rate Notes the provider or
providers for any Credit Support
Instrument, the tender agent or
agents and the remarketing agent
or agents, which designations shall
be based on the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the parties so designated
possess the requisite resources and
experience to provide the services
required of them and that the terms
on which the designated parties
have agreed to provide such services are fair and commercially reasonable. The Director of Finance is
authorized to enter into agreements
in connection with the delivery of
the variable rate Notes, and from
time to time thereafter so long as
the variable rate Notes are outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support Instruments, tender agents

24
(which may be the Trustee), remarketing agents, and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a financial advisor, to be
necessary or appropriate to provide
for the method of determining the
variable interest rates, permitting
holders the right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support
for the payment of the variable rate
Notes upon tender for purchase or
redemption, and providing for the
repayment by the City of any
amounts drawn under the Credit
Support Instrument. The Trustee
shall be the authenticating agent,
registrar, transfer agent and paying
agent for the Notes. The Notes shall
be signed by the officials of the City
and in the manner set forth in the
Indenture. The Notes shall first be
offered for purchase to the Trustees
of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by them, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account
for purchase and, if not purchased
for that Account, shall be sold at not
less than par and accrued interest
to one or more firms that have proposed to underwrite the Notes and
have been selected by the Director
of Finance based on an evaluation
of the qualifications of those firms
(the “Note Purchaser”) in the principal amount set forth in a certificate of award to be executed by the
Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate of Award”). The proceeds of
such sale shall be paid into the
proper fund or funds set forth in the
Note Certificate of Award and used
for the purpose for which the Notes
are being issued under the provisions of this Ordinance.
Section 9. Official Statement; Continuing Disclosure. If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a
disclosure document (each, an “Official Statement”) is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
sale of the Notes or the Series 2008
Bonds, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare or cause to be
prepared on behalf of the City an
Official Statement with respect to
the Notes or the Series 2008 Bonds,
as the case may be, and any necessary supplements and to authorize
the use and distribution of each
Official Statement and any supplements. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign on behalf of the
City and in her official capacity
each Official Statement and any
supplements approved by her. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign and deliver on behalf of the
City and in her official capacity
such certificates in connection with
the accuracy of each Official Statement and any supplements as may,
in her judgment, be necessary or appropriate. The Director of Finance is
also authorized to determine and
certify on behalf of the City that
such disclosure document is “deemed final” by the City within the
meaning of Securities and Exchange
Commission Rule 15c2-12 the “SEC
Rule.”) The Director of Finance is
authorized to contract for services
for the production and distribution
of preliminary and final Official
Statements, including by printed
and electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time

The City Record
of the Notes or the Series 2008
Bonds, the City agrees, in accordance with, and as the only obligated person with respect to the
Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds
under the SEC Rule, to provide or
cause to be provided such financial
information and operating data and
notices, in such manner as may be
required for purposes of the SEC
Rule. In order to describe and specify certain terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Director of
Finance is authorized and directed
to prepare, or cause to be prepared,
and to sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the
continuing
disclosure
agreement
made by the City for the benefit of
the holders and beneficial owners of
the Notes or the Series 2008 Bonds,
as the case may be, in accordance
with the SEC Rule. The performance
of that agreement shall be subject
to the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to
establish procedures in order to
ensure compliance by the City with
its continuing disclosure agreement,
including the timely provision of
information and notices.
Section 10.
Federal Tax Covenants.
The City covenants that it
will use, and will restrict the use
and investment of, the proceeds of
the Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds
in such manner and to such extent
as may be necessary so that (a) the
Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds will
not (i) constitute private activity
bonds, arbitrage bonds or hedge
bonds under Sections 141, 148 or 149
of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the Code) or (ii)
be treated other than as bonds to
which Section 103(a) of the Code
applies, and (b) the interest thereon will not be treated as an item of
tax preference under Section 57 of
the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the Notes
and the Series 2008 Bonds to be and
to remain excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will not take or authorize to be taken any actions that
would adversely affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting
for it, will, among other acts of compliance, (i) apply the proceeds of
the Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds
to the governmental purpose of the
borrowing, (ii) restrict the yield on
investment property acquired with
those proceeds, (iii) make timely
and adequate payments to the federal
government,
(iv)
maintain
books and records and make calculations and reports, and (v) refrain
from certain uses of those proceeds,
and,
as
applicable,
of
property
financed with such proceeds, all in
such manner and to the extent necessary to assure such exclusion of
that interest under the Code.

Ord. No. 120-08.
By Council Member Sweeney (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the issuance and sale of bonds
in the maximum principal amount of
$29,550,000 for the purpose of providing facilities for the discharge of
governmental functions or for services otherwise benefiting public
safety, health and welfare and
authorizing related matters.
Whereas, this Council desires to
issue bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed TwentyNine Million Five Hundred Fifty
Thousand Dollars ($29,550,000) (the
“Series 2008 Bonds”) to finance the
costs of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1; and
Whereas, the Series 2008 Bonds
shall be payable from and secured
by income tax revenues of the City
remaining after deposits required
under the General Bond Ordinance
(as defined in Section 2) are made
to the escrow agent for the City’s

Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of this City, has certified to this Council that the esti-

135

25
mated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be financed with
the proceeds of the Series 2008
Bonds is at least five (5) years, as
evidenced by the certificate contained in File No. 120-08-A; and
Whereas, the authorization for
issuance of the Series 2008 Bonds is
necessary to provide funds to pay
the

that are urgently needed for the
benefit of the City, and as a result,
this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the
immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety, and for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary to issue the Series 2008
Bonds in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed Twenty-Nine
Million Five Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($29,550,000) for the
purpose of providing facilities for
the discharge of governmental functions or for services otherwise benefiting the public safety, health and
welfare, including constructing, reconstructing, rehabilitating, installing, renovating, enlarging and otherwise improving buildings, structures and other facilities in, of and
for City Hall, police stations, fire
stations, service stations, waste collection, transfer and disposal facilities, correctional facilities, health
facilities, centers and other facilities, the provision of necessary fixtures, furnishings, equipment, information technology hardware and
software,
utilities,
site
improvements and appurtenances, and the
acquisition of vehicles, and to pay
any capitalized interest and all
expenses
incurred
in
connection
with the issuance of the securities,
including all financing costs within
the meaning of Section 133.01(K) of
the Revised Code and such other
costs of the foregoing permanent
improvements that may be financed
with the proceeds of securities as
permitted by Section 133.15(B) of
the Ohio Revised Code and as otherwise permitted by law.
Section 2. Authority, Security and
Source of Payment. The Series 2008
Bonds shall be issued pursuant to
the Ohio Constitution, Chapter 133 of
the Ohio Revised Code, the Charter
of the City, and this Ordinance for
the purpose stated in Section 1. The
Series 2008 Bonds shall be payable
from and secured by the income tax
revenues of the City on a basis subordinate to the security given to the
general obligation bonds of the City
under Ordinance No. 1749-80 passed
by the Council on October 8, 1980, as
amended by Ordinance No. 1112-83
passed by the Council on May 6,
1983,
and
Ordinance
No.
944-96,
passed by the Council on June 10,
1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so
amended and as the same may further be amended from time to time
in accordance with its provisions, is
referred to as the “General Bond
Ordinance”). The debt service on the
Series 2008 Bonds shall be payable
from income tax collections remaining after depositing with the escrow
agent under the General Bond Ordinance the amount required for the
payment of debt service on the
City’s
general
obligation
bonds

26
issued and outstanding, from time to
time, under the General Bond Ordinance. The Series 2008 Bonds shall
be issued and secured under the
terms of the Trust Indenture (the
“Indenture”) between the City and
U.S. Bank National Association, as
trustee (the “Trustee”) in substantially the form on file with the
Clerk of Council in the File No. referenced in the preambles of this
Ordinance, with such completions
and changes as may be consistent
with this Ordinance and the Certificate of Award identified in Section
4 and approved by the Director of
Finance as not being adverse to the
City, the Director’s signing and
delivery of the Indenture being conclusive evidence of that determination. The Indenture permits the
issuance of additional bonds, subject
to certain restrictions. Any additional issues of bonds, together with
the Series 2008 Bonds, are referred
to in this Ordinance and in the
Indenture as the “Bonds.”
Section 3. Pledge and Covenant to
Maintain Income Tax.
So long as
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City pledges the
municipal income taxes of the City
and grants a lien thereon, subordinate to the lien granted in the General Bond Ordinance as security for
the general obligation bonds of the
City issued and outstanding under
the General Bond Ordinance, to the
full extent required to meet debt
charges payable on the Bonds issued
and outstanding under the Indenture
and to pay any debt charges on Parity Obligations (as defined in the
Indenture). The City covenants to appropriate annually sufficient amounts
from the income taxes for such purpose. The City further covenants
that so long as any Bonds are outstanding under the Indenture, the
City shall not repeal or amend, or
suffer the repeal of, any ordinance
for the levy or collection of its
income taxes in any manner or to
such extent that the City would not
be able to meet its obligations to the
holders of the Bonds.

for the final terms of the Series 2008
Bonds and the sale of the Series
2008 Bonds in accordance with this
Ordinance
(the
“Certificate
of
Award”). The Series 2008 Bonds
shall be issued in the principal
amount specified in the Certificate
of Award, which shall not exceed
the amount stated in Section 1. The
Series 2008 Bonds shall bear interest
from their date until the principal
amount is paid at the rate or rates
per year specified in the Certificate
of Award, provided that the weighted average of such rates (taking
into account the principal amount
and maturity of each Bond to which
a rate applies) shall not exceed six
percent (6%) per year. Interest on
the Series 2008 Bonds shall be
payable semi-annually on the dates
specified in the Certificate of Award
(the “Interest Payment Dates”).
The
Series
2008
Bonds
shall
mature in the years and principal
amounts set forth in the Certificate
of Award, provided that (i) each
principal payment shall occur on an
Interest Payment Date, (ii) the first
principal payment on the Series 2008
Bonds shall be no later than December 15, 2010, and (iii) the final maturity date of the Series 2008 Bonds
shall be no later than December 15,
2030.
The Series 2008 Bonds stated to
mature in any year may be issued
as serial Series 2008 Bonds or as
term Series 2008 Bonds payable prior
to stated maturity pursuant to sinking fund redemption (the “Term
Bonds”). The Director of Finance
shall determine in the Certificate of
Award whether any of the Series
2008 Bonds shall be issued as Term
Bonds, any dates (the “Mandatory
Redemption Dates”) on which the
principal amount of the Term Bonds
shall be payable pursuant to mandatory
sinking
fund
installments
rather than at stated maturity and
the amount of principal to be paid
on
each
Mandatory
Redemption
Date (the “Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
If any of the Series 2008 Bonds are
issued as Term Series 2008 Bonds,
the Term Bonds shall be redeemed
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements at a
redemption price of 100 percent of
the principal amount redeemed, plus
interest accrued to the redemption
date, on the Mandatory Redemption
Dates. The aggregate of the moneys
to be deposited with the Trustee for
payment of principal of and interest
on any Term Bonds shall include
amounts sufficient to redeem on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates the
principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided in
the Indenture and the First Supplement).
The Series 2008 Bonds may be subject to redemption prior to maturity
by and at the option of the City, in
whole or in part on any date, in
whole multiples of $5,000, on the
optional redemption dates and at the
redemption prices (expressed as a
percentage of the principal amount
redeemed) specified in the Certificate of Award, plus, in each case,
accrued interest to the redemption

136

January 30, 2008
date. The first optional redemption
date, if any, shall not be later than
ten years from the first Interest
Payment Date, and the highest
redemption
price
shall
not
be
greater than 102% of the principal
amount redeemed plus accrued interest to the redemption date. Based on
the written advice of a financial
advisor, the Director of Finance may
determine
in
the
Certificate
of
Award that it is in the best interests of the City for some or all of
the Series 2008 Bonds not to be
callable prior to their stated maturity.
If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the City
may have the option to purchase
any Bond which is redeemable by
optional redemption at a purchase
price not less than the redemption
price that would be payable if that
Bond
were
called
for
optional
redemption on the date of the proposed purchase. That election shall
be exercised as provided in the First
Supplement.
If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the Series
2008 Bonds may be secured by a
Debt Service Reserve Fund to be
held by the Trustee under the Indenture. The principal amount of the
Series 2008 Bonds may include provision for funding the Debt Service
Reserve Fund from the proceeds of
the Bonds, subject to compliance
with applicable federal tax laws.

Original Purchaser agrees to buy
the Series 2008 Bonds on terms consistent with this Ordinance and the
Indenture, that are not substantially adverse to the City and that are
approved by the Director of Finance
on behalf of the City, all of which
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Bond Purchase
Agreement or amendments to the
Bond Purchase Agreement by the
Director of Finance. It is determined
that the terms of the Series 2008

Section 8.
Bond Anticipation
Notes.
For the purpose of raising
money
in
anticipation
of
the
issuance of the Series 2008 Bonds for
the purpose set forth in Section 1,
notes of the City may be issued in
an aggregate principal amount not
to exceed Twenty Nine Million Five
Hundred Fifty Dollars ($29,550,000)
(the “Notes”) upon the direction of
the Director of Finance to be set
forth in a certificate providing for
the final terms of the Notes and the
sale of the Notes and signed by the
Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate of Award”). The Notes, if
sold as fixed rate obligations, shall
bear interest at such rate, not
exceeding six percent (6%) per
year, and shall be payable on the
date or dates, as shall be determined
by the Director of Finance of the
City in the Note Certificate of
Award; shall be dated their date of
issuance; shall mature on the date
set forth in the Note Certificate of
Award; shall be subject to redemption by the City at any time prior
to maturity without penalty, unless
the Director of Finance, based on
the advice of a financial advisor,
determines that it is in the best
interest of the City in order to
enhance the marketability of the
Notes,
that
the
Notes
not
be
redeemable prior to maturity; shall
be
designated
“Public
Facilities
Improvement
Bond
Anticipation
Notes” or as otherwise provided in
the Note Certificate of Award; shall
be issued in such numbers and
denominations as may be requested
by the Note Purchaser (hereinafter
defined); and shall be issued in
fully registered form (which may be
in a book entry only system) in
denominations of $5,000 or whole
multiples thereof. The provisions of
Sections 9.98 to 9.983 of the Revised
Code shall apply to the Notes and
pursuant to that authority and this
Ordinance, the Director of Finance
may determine in the Certificate of
Award, based on the written advice
of a financial advisor, that the
City’s best interests will be served
by causing all or a portion of the
Notes to be obligations bearing
interest
at
variable
rates,
redeemable by the City without penalty or premium on interest adjustment dates. If the Director of
Finance so determines, then the

137

27
Director of Finance shall specify in
the Certificate of Award the method
and procedure by which the variable
rate of interest to be borne by the
variable rate Notes shall be determined, whether by reference to a
market index, by a remarketing
agent or otherwise; provided that
the variable rate Notes shall not
bear interest at a rate in excess of
sixteen percent (16%) per year. Notwithstanding that limitation, Notes
held by a provider of a Credit Support Instrument (as defined in Section 11) may bear interest at a rate
not in excess of twenty-five percent
(25%) per year as provided in the
agreement with the provider of the
Credit Support Instrument. Holders
of variable rate Notes may be given
the right to tender their variable
rate Notes for purchase by the City
at the times, on the terms, and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Certificate of Award and any tender
agreement; provided that tender
rights shall be exercisable only at
such times as a Credit Support
Instrument is in place that provides
for the payment of the purchase
price payable to the tendering holder of a variable rate Note. If the
Director of Finance designates any
Notes as variable rate Notes, and if
the holders of the variable rate
Notes are to be entitled to tender the
variable rate Notes for purchase,
then the Director of Finance shall
also designate in the Certificate of
Award for those variable rate Notes
the provider or providers for any
Credit Support Instrument, the tender agent or agents and the remarketing agent or agents, which designations shall be based on the
determination of the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed
to provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable. The Director of Finance is authorized to enter
into agreements in connection with
the delivery of the variable rate
Notes, and from time to time thereafter so long as the variable rate
Notes are outstanding, with providers of Credit Support Instruments, tender agents (which may be
the Trustee), remarketing agents,
and others as may be determined by
the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a financial
advisor, to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the method of
determining the variable interest
rates, permitting holders the right
of tender, providing for liquidity or
credit support for the payment of
the variable rate Notes upon tender
for purchase or redemption, and providing for the repayment by the
City of any amounts drawn under
the Credit Support Instrument. The
Trustee shall be the authenticating
agent, registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Notes. The
Notes shall be signed by the officials of the City and in the manner
set forth in the Indenture. The Notes
shall first be offered for purchase to
the Trustees of the Sinking Fund
and, if not purchased by them, shall
be offered to the Treasury Investment Account for purchase and, if
not purchased for that Account,
shall be sold at not less than par

28
and accrued interest to one or more
firms that have proposed to underwrite the Notes and have been
selected by the Director of Finance
based on an evaluation of the qualifications of those firms (the “Note
Purchaser”) in the principal amount
set forth in a certificate of award to
be executed by the Director of
Finance (the “Note Certificate of
Award”). The proceeds of such sale
shall be paid into the proper fund
or funds set forth in the Note Certificate of Award and used for the
purpose for which the Notes are
being issued under the provisions of
this Ordinance.
Section 9. Official Statement; Continuing Disclosure. If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a
disclosure document (each, an “Official Statement”) is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
sale of the Notes or the Series 2008
Bonds, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare or cause to be
prepared on behalf of the City an
Official Statement with respect to
the Notes or the Series 2008 Bonds,
as the case may be, and any necessary supplements and to authorize
the use and distribution of each
Official Statement and any supplements. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign on behalf of the
City and in her official capacity
each Official Statement and any supplements approved by her. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign and deliver on behalf of the
City and in her official capacity
such certificates in connection with
the accuracy of each Official Statement and any supplements as may,
in her judgment, be necessary or
appropriate. The Director of Finance
is also authorized to determine and
certify on behalf of the City that
such disclosure document is “deemed
final” by the City within the meaning of Securities and Exchange
Commission Rule 15c2-12 the “SEC
Rule.”) The Director of Finance is
authorized to contract for services
for the production and distribution
of preliminary and final Official
Statements, including by printed
and electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Notes or the Series 2008
Bonds, the City agrees, in accordance with, and as the only obligated person with respect to the
Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds
under the SEC Rule, to provide or
cause to be provided such financial
information and operating data and
notices, in such manner as may be
required for purposes of the SEC
Rule. In order to describe and specify certain terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Director of
Finance is authorized and directed
to prepare, or cause to be prepared,
and to sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the
continuing
disclosure
agreement
made by the City for the benefit of
the holders and beneficial owners of
the Notes or the Series 2008 Bonds,
as the case may be, in accordance
with the SEC Rule. The performance
of that agreement shall be subject
to the availability of funds and their

The City Record
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to
establish procedures in order to
ensure compliance by the City with
its continuing disclosure agreement,
including the timely provision of
information and notices.
Section 10.
Federal Tax Covenants.
The City covenants that it
will use, and will restrict the use
and investment of, the proceeds of
the Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds
in such manner and to such extent
as may be necessary so that (a) the
Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds will
not (i) constitute private activity
bonds, arbitrage bonds or hedge
bonds under Sections 141, 148 or 149
of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the Code) or (ii)
be treated other than as bonds to
which Section 103(a) of the Code
applies, and (b) the interest thereon will not be treated as an item of
tax preference under Section 57 of
the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be
taken such actions that may be
required of it for the interest on the
Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds to
be and to remain excluded from
gross income for federal income tax
purposes, (b) it will not take or
authorize to be taken any actions
that would adversely affect that
exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting for it, will, among other acts of
compliance, (i) apply the proceeds
of the Notes and the Series 2008
Bonds to the governmental purpose
of the borrowing, (ii) restrict the
yield on investment property acquired with those proceeds, (iii)
make timely and adequate payments to the federal government,
(iv) maintain books and records
and make calculations and reports,
and (v) refrain from certain uses
of those proceeds, and, as applicable, of property financed with such
proceeds, all in such manner and to
the extent necessary to assure such
exclusion of that interest under the
Code.
The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer of
the City having responsibility for
issuance of the Notes and the Series
2008 Bonds, is hereby authorized (a)
to make or effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent,
approval, or waiver on behalf of the
City with respect to the Notes and
the Series 2008 Bonds as the City is
permitted or required to make or
give under the federal income tax
laws, including, without limitation
thereto, any of the elections provided for in Section 148(f)(4)(C) of the
Code or available under Section 148
of the Code, for the purpose of
assuring, enhancing or protecting
favorable tax treatment or status of
the Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds
or interest thereon or assisting compliance with requirements for that
purpose, reducing the burden or
expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or payments
or penalties, or making payments of
special amounts in lieu of making
computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as rebate, or
obviating those amounts or payments, as determined by that officer,
which action shall be in writing and
signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or

138

January 30, 2008
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf
of the City, as may be appropriate
to assure the exclusion of interest
from gross income and the intended
tax status of the Notes and the
Series 2008 Bonds, and (c) to give
one or more appropriate certificates
of the City, for inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Notes
and the Series 2008 Bonds, setting
forth the reasonable expectations of
the City regarding the amount and
use of all the proceeds of the Notes
and the Series 2008 Bonds, the facts,
circumstances
and

on
which they are based, and other
facts and circumstances relevant to
the tax treatment of the interest on
and the tax status of the Notes and
the Series 2008 Bonds.

Credit Facilities and
Ratings. If the Director of Finance
determines it to be in the best interests of the City, based on the written advice of a financial advisor, the
Director of Finance may obtain an
insurance policy, letter of credit,
standby bond purchase agreement
or other credit enhancement instrument as further security for the payment when due of the principal of
and interest on all or any portion of
the Series 2008 Bonds or Notes (a
“Credit Support Instrument”). The
Director of Finance may request a
rating on the Series 2008 Bonds or
Notes from one or more nationally
recognized rating organizations, and
do any and all things and take any
and all actions required to secure a
Credit Support Instrument and/or a
rating or ratings on the Series 2008
Bonds or Notes. The Director of
Finance may enter into one or more
agreements
for
Credit
Support
Instruments containing terms not
materially inconsistent with this
Ordinance or the Indenture. The
expenditure of the amounts necessary to secure Credit Support Instruments or obtain those ratings is
authorized and approved, and the
Director of Finance is authorized to
provide for the payment of any such
amounts from the proceeds of the
Series 2008 Bonds or Notes to the
extent available and otherwise from
any other funds lawfully available
that are appropriated or shall be
appropriated for that purpose.

of
Finance. The Director of Finance
may rely on the written advice of

Section 2. Authority, Security and
Source of Payment. The Series 2008
Bonds shall be issued pursuant to
the Ohio Constitution, Chapter 133 of
the Ohio Revised Code, the Charter
of the City, and this Ordinance for
the purpose stated in Section 1. The
Series 2008 Bonds shall be payable
from and secured by the income tax
revenues of the City on a basis subordinate to the security given to the
general obligation bonds of the City
under Ordinance No. 1749-80 passed
by the Council on October 8, 1980, as
amended by Ordinance No. 1112-83
passed by the Council on May 6,
1983,
and
Ordinance
No.
944-96,
passed by the Council on June 10,
1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so
amended and as the same may further be amended from time to time
in accordance with its provisions, is
referred to as the “General Bond
Ordinance”). The debt service on the
Series 2008 Bonds shall be payable
from income tax collections remaining after depositing with the escrow
agent under the General Bond Ordinance the amount required for the
payment of debt service on the
City’s
general
obligation
bonds
issued and outstanding, from time to
time, under the General Bond Ordinance. The Series 2008 Bonds shall
be issued and secured under the
terms of the Trust Indenture (the
“Indenture”) between the City and
U.S. Bank National Association, as
trustee (the “Trustee”) in substantially the form on file with the
Clerk of Council in the File No. referenced in the preambles of this
Ordinance, with such completions
and changes as may be consistent
with this Ordinance and the Certificate of Award identified in Section
4 and approved by the Director of
Finance as not being adverse to the
City, the Director’s signing and
delivery of the Indenture being conclusive evidence of that determination. The Indenture permits the
issuance of additional bonds, subject
to certain restrictions. Any additional issues of bonds, together with
the Series 2008 Bonds, are referred
to in this Ordinance and in the
Indenture as the “Bonds.”
Section 3.
Pledge and Covenant
to Maintain Income Tax. So long as
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City pledges the
municipal income taxes of the City

30
and grants a lien thereon, subordinate to the lien granted in the General Bond Ordinance as security for
the general obligation bonds of the
City issued and outstanding under
the General Bond Ordinance, to the
full extent required to meet debt
charges
payable
on
the
Bonds
issued and outstanding under the
Indenture and to pay any debt
charges on Parity Obligations (as
defined in the Indenture). The City
covenants to appropriate annually
sufficient amounts from the income
taxes for such purpose.
The City
further covenants that so long as
any Bonds are outstanding under
the Indenture, the City shall not
repeal or amend, or suffer the repeal
of, any ordinance for the levy or collection of its income taxes in any
manner or to such extent that the
City would not be able to meet its
obligations to the holders of the
Bonds.
Section 4.
Terms of the Series
2008 Bonds. The Series 2008 Bonds
shall be issued in fully registered
form. The Series 2008 Bonds initially shall be delivered only in bookentry form, shall be registered in
the name of the Depository (as
defined in the Indenture) or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository, and shall not be transferable
or exchangeable (except for transfer to another Depository or its nominee) without further action by the
City pursuant to the provisions of
the Indenture and the First Supplement identified below. The Series
2008 Bonds shall be designated
“Bridges
and
Roadways
Improvement Bonds, Series 2008” and
may contain such further designation as provided in the Certificate of
Award identified below. The Series
2008 Bonds shall be issued in one lot
as fully registered Series 2008 Bonds
in denominations of $5,000 or any
whole multiple thereof. The Series
2008 Bonds shall be numbered as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance. The Series 2008 Bonds
shall be signed by the officials of
the City and in the manner set forth
in the Indenture.
The Series 2008 Bonds shall be
dated as of April 1, 2008, or such
other date, but in no event later
than December 31, 2009, specified in
the certificate of award providing
for the final terms of the Series 2008
Bonds and the sale of the Series
2008 Bonds in accordance with this
Ordinance
(the
“Certificate
of
Award”). The Series 2008 Bonds
shall be issued in the principal
amount specified in the Certificate
of Award, which shall not exceed
the amount stated in Section 1. The
Series 2008 Bonds shall bear interest
from their date until the principal
amount is paid at the rate or rates
per year specified in the Certificate
of Award, provided that the weighted average of such rates (taking
into account the principal amount
and maturity of each Bond to which
a rate applies) shall not exceed six
percent (6%) per year. Interest on
the Series 2008 Bonds shall be
payable semi-annually on the dates
specified in the Certificate of Award
(the “Interest Payment Dates”).
The
Series
2008
Bonds
shall
mature in the years and principal
amounts set forth in the Certificate
of Award, provided that (i) each
principal payment shall occur on an

The City Record
Interest Payment Date, (ii) the first
principal payment on the Series 2008
Bonds shall be no later than December 15, 2010, and (iii) the final maturity date of the Series 2008 Bonds
shall be no later than December 15,
2030.
The Series 2008 Bonds stated to
mature in any year may be issued
as serial Series 2008 Bonds or as
term Series 2008 Bonds payable prior
to stated maturity pursuant to sinking fund redemption (the “Term
Bonds”). The Director of Finance
shall determine in the Certificate of
Award whether any of the Series
2008 Bonds shall be issued as Term
Bonds, any dates (the “Mandatory
Redemption Dates”) on which the
principal amount of the Term Bonds
shall be payable pursuant to mandatory
sinking
fund
installments
rather than at stated maturity and
the amount of principal to be paid
on
each
Mandatory
Redemption
Date (the “Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements”). If any
of the Series 2008 Bonds are issued
as Term Series 2008 Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be redeemed pursuant
to the Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements
at
a
redemption price of 100 percent of
the principal amount redeemed, plus
interest accrued to the redemption
date, on the Mandatory Redemption
Dates. The aggregate of the moneys
to be deposited with the Trustee for
payment of principal of and interest
on any Term Bonds shall include
amounts sufficient to redeem on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates the
principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided in
the Indenture and the First Supplement).
The Series 2008 Bonds may be subject to redemption prior to maturity
by and at the option of the City, in
whole or in part on any date, in
whole multiples of $5,000, on the
optional redemption dates and at the
redemption prices (expressed as a
percentage of the principal amount
redeemed) specified in the Certificate of Award, plus, in each case,
accrued interest to the redemption
date. The first optional redemption
date, if any, shall not be later than
ten years from the first Interest
Payment Date, and the highest
redemption
price
shall
not
be
greater than 102% of the principal
amount redeemed plus accrued interest to the redemption date. Based on
the written advice of a financial
advisor, the Director of Finance may
determine
in
the
Certificate
of
Award that it is in the best interests of the City for some or all of
the Series 2008 Bonds not to be
callable prior to their stated maturity.
If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the City
may have the option to purchase
any Bond which is redeemable by
optional redemption at a purchase
price not less than the redemption
price that would be payable if that
Bond
were
called
for
optional
redemption on the date of the proposed purchase. That election shall
be exercised as provided in the First
Supplement.
If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the Series
2008 Bonds may be secured by a

140

January 30, 2008
Debt Service Reserve Fund to be
held by the Trustee under the Indenture. The principal amount of the
Series 2008 Bonds may include provision for funding the Debt Service
Reserve Fund from the proceeds of
the Bonds, subject to compliance
with applicable federal tax laws.
Section 5.

if not purchased by them, shall be

Director of Finance is authorized to
sign and deliver on behalf of the
City a bond purchase agreement
between the City and the Original

(the
“Bond

and correctness by the Director of
Law, setting forth the terms and
conditions on which the City agrees

January 30, 2008
to sell the Series 2008 Bonds and the
Original Purchaser agrees to buy
the Series 2008 Bonds on terms consistent with this Ordinance and the
Indenture, that are not substantially adverse to the City and that are
approved by the Director of Finance
on behalf of the City, all of which
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Bond Purchase
Agreement or amendments to the
Bond Purchase Agreement by the
Director of Finance. It is determined
that the terms of the Series 2008
Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance
and as may be provided in or pursuant to the Certificate of Award,
the Indenture and the First Supplement, are in the best interest of the
City and in compliance with all
legal requirements.

Director of Finance as not substantially adverse to the City. The First

form and correctness by the Director of Law. The determination by
the Director of Finance that the provisions of the First Supplement are
not substantially adverse to the City

the Charter, the Mayor, the Director
of Finance, the Director of Law, the
Clerk of Council and other appropriate officers of the City are, and
each of them is, authorized to sign,

Section 8.
Bond Anticipation
Notes.
For the purpose of raising
money
in
anticipation
of
the

The City Record
issuance of the Series 2008 Bonds for
the purpose set forth in Section 1,
notes of the City may be issued in
an aggregate principal amount not
to exceed Twenty Million Three
Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
($20,350,000) (the “Notes”) upon the
direction of the Director of Finance
to be set forth in a certificate providing for the final terms of the
Notes and the sale of the Notes and
signed by the Director of Finance
(the “Note Certificate of Award”).
The Notes, if sold as fixed rate
obligations, shall bear interest at
such rate, not exceeding six percent
(6%) per year, and shall be payable
on the date or dates, as shall be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance of the City in the Note Certificate of Award; shall be dated
their date of issuance; shall mature
on the date set forth in the Note Certificate of Award; shall be subject
to redemption by the City at any
time
prior
to
maturity
without
penalty,
unless
the
Director
of
Finance, based on the advice of a
financial advisor, determines that it
is in the best interest of the City in
order to enhance the marketability
of the Notes, that the Notes not be
redeemable prior to maturity; shall
be designated “Bridges and Roadways Improvement Bond Anticipation Notes” or as otherwise provided
in the Note Certificate of Award;
shall be issued in such numbers and
denominations as may be requested
by the Note Purchaser (hereinafter
defined); and shall be issued in
fully registered form (which may be
in a book entry only system) in
denominations of $5,000 or whole
multiples thereof. The provisions of
Sections 9.98 to 9.983 of the Revised
Code shall apply to the Notes and
pursuant to that authority and this
Ordinance, the Director of Finance
may determine in the Certificate of
Award, based on the written advice
of a financial advisor, that the
City’s best interests will be served
by causing all or a portion of the
Notes to be obligations bearing interest at variable rates, redeemable
by the City without penalty or premium on interest adjustment dates.
If the Director of Finance so determines, then the Director of Finance
shall specify in the Certificate of
Award the method and procedure by
which the variable rate of interest
to be borne by the variable rate
Notes shall be determined, whether
by reference to a market index, by
a remarketing agent or otherwise;
provided that the variable rate
Notes shall not bear interest at a
rate in excess of sixteen percent
(16%) per year. Notwithstanding
that limitation, Notes held by a
provider of a Credit Support Instrument (as defined in Section 11) may
bear interest at a rate not in excess
of twenty-five percent (25%) per
year as provided in the agreement
with the provider of the Credit Support Instrument. Holders of variable
rate Notes may be given the right
to tender their variable rate Notes
for purchase by the City at the
times, on the terms, and subject to
the conditions set forth in the Certificate of Award and any tender
agreement; provided that tender
rights shall be exercisable only at
such times as a Credit Support
Instrument is in place that provides
for the payment of the purchase
price payable to the tendering hold-

141

31
er of a variable rate Note. If the
Director of Finance designates any
Notes as variable rate Notes, and if
the holders of the variable rate
Notes are to be entitled to tender the
variable rate Notes for purchase,
then the Director of Finance shall
also designate in the Certificate of
Award for those variable rate Notes
the provider or providers for any
Credit Support Instrument, the tender agent or agents and the remarketing agent or agents, which designations shall be based on the
determination of the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed
to provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable. The Director of Finance is authorized to enter
into agreements in connection with
the delivery of the variable rate
Notes, and from time to time thereafter so long as the variable rate
Notes
are
outstanding,
with
providers of Credit Support Instruments, tender agents (which may be
the Trustee), remarketing agents,
and others as may be determined by
the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a financial
advisor, to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the method of
determining the variable interest
rates, permitting holders the right
of tender, providing for liquidity or
credit support for the payment of
the variable rate Notes upon tender
for purchase or redemption, and providing for the repayment by the
City of any amounts drawn under
the Credit Support Instrument. The
Trustee shall be the authenticating
agent, registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Notes. The
Notes shall be signed by the officials of the City and in the manner
set forth in the Indenture. The Notes
shall first be offered for purchase to
the Trustees of the Sinking Fund
and, if not purchased by them, shall
be offered to the Treasury Investment Account for purchase and, if
not purchased for that Account,
shall be sold at not less than par
and accrued interest to one or more
firms that have proposed to underwrite the Notes and have been
selected by the Director of Finance
based on an evaluation of the qualifications of those firms (the “Note
Purchaser”) in the principal amount
set forth in a certificate of award to
be executed by the Director of
Finance (the “Note Certificate of
Award”). The proceeds of such sale
shall be paid into the proper fund
or funds set forth in the Note Certificate of Award and used for the
purpose for which the Notes are
being issued under the provisions of
this Ordinance.
Section 9. Official Statement; Continuing Disclosure. If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a
disclosure document (each, an “Official Statement”) is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
sale of the Notes or the Series 2008
Bonds, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare or cause to be
prepared on behalf of the City an
Official Statement with respect to
the Notes or the Series 2008 Bonds,
as the case may be, and any necessary supplements and to authorize

32
the use and distribution of each
Official Statement and any supplements. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign on behalf of the
City and in her official capacity
each Official Statement and any supplements approved by her. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign and deliver on behalf of the
City and in her official capacity
such certificates in connection with
the accuracy of each Official Statement and any supplements as may,
in her judgment, be necessary or
appropriate. The Director of Finance
is also authorized to determine and
certify on behalf of the City that
such disclosure document is “deemed
final” by the City within the meaning of Securities and Exchange
Commission Rule 15c2-12 the “SEC
Rule.”) The Director of Finance is
authorized to contract for services
for the production and distribution
of preliminary and final Official
Statements, including by printed
and electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Notes or the Series 2008
Bonds, the City agrees, in accordance with, and as the only obligated person with respect to the
Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds
under the SEC Rule, to provide or
cause to be provided such financial
information and operating data and
notices, in such manner as may be
required for purposes of the SEC
Rule. In order to describe and specify certain terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Director of
Finance is authorized and directed
to prepare, or cause to be prepared,
and to sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the
continuing
disclosure
agreement
made by the City for the benefit of
the holders and beneficial owners of
the Notes or the Series 2008 Bonds,
as the case may be, in accordance
with the SEC Rule. The performance
of that agreement shall be subject
to the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to
establish procedures in order to
ensure compliance by the City with
its continuing disclosure agreement,
including the timely provision of
information and notices.
Section 10.
Federal Tax Covenants.
The City covenants that it
will use, and will restrict the use
and investment of, the proceeds of
the Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds
in such manner and to such extent
as may be necessary so that (a) the
Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds will
not (i) constitute private activity
bonds, arbitrage bonds or hedge
bonds under Sections 141, 148 or 149
of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the Code) or (ii)
be treated other than as bonds to
which Section 103(a) of the Code
applies, and (b) the interest thereon will not be treated as an item of
tax preference under Section 57 of
the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required

The City Record
of it for the interest on the Notes
and the Series 2008 Bonds to be and
to remain excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will not take or authorize to be taken any actions that
would adversely affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting
for it, will, among other acts of compliance, (i) apply the proceeds of
the Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds
to the governmental purpose of the
borrowing, (ii) restrict the yield on
investment property acquired with
those proceeds, (iii) make timely
and adequate payments to the federal
government,
(iv)
maintain
books and records and make calculations and reports, and (v) refrain
from certain uses of those proceeds,
and,
as
applicable,
of
property
financed with such proceeds, all in
such manner and to the extent necessary to assure such exclusion of
that interest under the Code.
The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer of
the City having responsibility for
issuance of the Notes and the Series
2008 Bonds, is hereby authorized (a)
to make or effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent,
approval, or waiver on behalf of the
City with respect to the Notes and
the Series 2008 Bonds as the City is
permitted or required to make or
give under the federal income tax
laws, including, without limitation
thereto, any of the elections provided for in Section 148(f)(4)(C) of the
Code or available under Section 148
of the Code, for the purpose of
assuring, enhancing or protecting
favorable tax treatment or status of
the Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds
or interest thereon or assisting compliance with requirements for that
purpose, reducing the burden or
expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or payments
or penalties, or making payments of
special amounts in lieu of making
computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as rebate, or
obviating those amounts or payments, as determined by that officer,
which action shall be in writing and
signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf
of the City, as may be appropriate
to assure the exclusion of interest
from gross income and the intended
tax status of the Notes and the
Series 2008 Bonds, and (c) to give
one or more appropriate certificates
of the City, for inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Notes
and the Series 2008 Bonds, setting
forth the reasonable expectations of
the City regarding the amount and
use of all the proceeds of the Notes
and the Series 2008 Bonds, the facts,
circumstances
and
estimates
on
which they are based, and other
facts and circumstances relevant to
the tax treatment of the interest on
and the tax status of the Notes and
the Series 2008 Bonds.
Section 11.
Credit Facilities and
Ratings. If the Director of Finance
determines it to be in the best interests of the City, based on the written advice of a financial advisor, the

recognized rating organizations, and
do any and all things and take any
and all actions required to secure a
Credit Support Instrument and/or a
rating or ratings on the Series 2008
Bonds or Notes. The Director of
Finance may enter into one or more
agreements
for
Credit
Support

materially inconsistent with this
Ordinance or the Indenture. The

to
secure
Credit
Support

Director of Finance is authorized to
provide for the payment of any such
amounts from the proceeds of the
Series 2008 Bonds or Notes to the

any other funds lawfully available
that are appropriated or shall be
appropriated for that purpose.

Whereas, this Council desires to
issue bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed Two Million Four Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($2,450,000) (the “Series 2008
Bonds”) to finance the costs of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1; and
Whereas, the Series 2008 Bonds
shall be payable from and secured
by income tax revenues of the City
remaining after deposits required
under the General Bond Ordinance
(as defined in Section 2) are made

Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of this City, has certified to this Council that the estimated life or usefulness of the

Whereas, the authorization for

that are urgently needed for the
benefit of the City, and as a result,
this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the
immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety, and for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary to issue the Series 2008
Bonds in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed Two Million
Four Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($2,450,000) for the purpose of
providing
funds
for
improving
municipal cemetery facilities, buildings, structures and grounds by constructing, reconstructing, installing,
enlarging, renovating, and rehabilitating
buildings,
structures
and
grounds, including clearing, grading
and excavating land, reconstructing,
installing, renovating, and rehabilitating septic system, drainage and
sewer facilities, installing access
roadways including any necessary
bridges and culverts, installing utility lines, laying out and numbering
burial plots, and planting and landscaping, together with all necessary
and incidental appurtenances and
the acquisition of any required real
estate and interests in real estate,
and to pay any capitalized interest
and all expenses incurred in connection with the issuance of the
securities, including all financing
costs within the meaning of Section
133.01(K) of the Revised Code and
such other costs of the foregoing
permanent improvements that may
be financed with the proceeds of
securities as permitted by Section
133.15(B) of the Ohio Revised Code
and as otherwise permitted by law.
Section 2. Authority, Security and
Source of Payment. The Series 2008
Bonds shall be issued pursuant to
the Ohio Constitution, Chapter 133 of
the Ohio Revised Code, the Charter
of the City, and this Ordinance for
the purpose stated in Section 1. The
Series 2008 Bonds shall be payable
from and secured by the income tax
revenues of the City on a basis subordinate to the security given to the
general obligation bonds of the City
under Ordinance No. 1749-80 passed

143

33
by the Council on October 8, 1980, as
amended by Ordinance No. 1112-83
passed by the Council on May 6,
1983,
and
Ordinance
No.
944-96,
passed by the Council on June 10,
1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so
amended and as the same may further be amended from time to time
in accordance with its provisions, is
referred to as the “General Bond
Ordinance”). The debt service on the
Series 2008 Bonds shall be payable
from income tax collections remaining after depositing with the escrow
agent under the General Bond Ordinance the amount required for the
payment of debt service on the
City’s
general
obligation
bonds
issued and outstanding, from time to
time, under the General Bond Ordinance. The Series 2008 Bonds shall
be issued and secured under the
terms of the Trust Indenture (the
“Indenture”) between the City and
U.S. Bank National Association, as
trustee (the “Trustee”) in substantially the form on file with the
Clerk of Council in the File No. referenced in the preambles of this
Ordinance, with such completions
and changes as may be consistent
with this Ordinance and the Certificate of Award identified in Section
4 and approved by the Director of
Finance as not being adverse to the
City, the Director’s signing and
delivery of the Indenture being conclusive evidence of that determination. The Indenture permits the
issuance of additional bonds, subject
to certain restrictions. Any additional issues of bonds, together with
the Series 2008 Bonds, are referred
to in this Ordinance and in the
Indenture as the “Bonds.”
Section 3.
Pledge and Covenant
to Maintain Income Tax. So long as
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City pledges the
municipal income taxes of the City
and grants a lien thereon, subordinate to the lien granted in the General Bond Ordinance as security for
the general obligation bonds of the
City issued and outstanding under
the General Bond Ordinance, to the
full extent required to meet debt
charges
payable
on
the
Bonds
issued and outstanding under the
Indenture and to pay any debt
charges on Parity Obligations (as
defined in the Indenture). The City
covenants to appropriate annually
sufficient amounts from the income
taxes for such purpose.
The City
further covenants that so long as
any Bonds are outstanding under
the Indenture, the City shall not
repeal or amend, or suffer the repeal
of, any ordinance for the levy or collection of its income taxes in any
manner or to such extent that the
City would not be able to meet its
obligations to the holders of the
Bonds.
Section 4.
Terms of the Series
2008 Bonds. The Series 2008 Bonds
shall be issued in fully registered
form. The Series 2008 Bonds initially shall be delivered only in bookentry form, shall be registered in
the name of the Depository (as
defined in the Indenture) or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository, and shall not be transferable
or exchangeable (except for transfer to another Depository or its nominee) without further action by the
City pursuant to the provisions of
the Indenture and the First Supple-

34
ment identified below. The Series
2008 Bonds shall be designated
“Cemeteries
Improvement
Bonds,
Series 2008” and may contain such
further designation as provided in
the Certificate of Award identified
below. The Series 2008 Bonds shall
be issued in one lot as fully registered Series 2008 Bonds in denominations of $5,000 or any whole multiple thereof. The Series 2008 Bonds
shall be numbered as determined by
the Director of Finance. The Series
2008 Bonds shall be signed by the
officials of the City and in the manner set forth in the Indenture.
The Series 2008 Bonds shall be
dated as of April 1, 2008, or such
other date, but in no event later
than December 31, 2009, specified in
the certificate of award providing
for the final terms of the Series 2008
Bonds and the sale of the Series
2008 Bonds in accordance with this
Ordinance
(the
“Certificate
of
Award”). The Series 2008 Bonds
shall be issued in the principal
amount specified in the Certificate
of Award, which shall not exceed
the amount stated in Section 1. The
Series 2008 Bonds shall bear interest
from their date until the principal
amount is paid at the rate or rates
per year specified in the Certificate
of Award, provided that the weighted average of such rates (taking
into account the principal amount
and maturity of each Bond to which
a rate applies) shall not exceed six
percent (6%) per year. Interest on
the Series 2008 Bonds shall be
payable semi-annually on the dates
specified in the Certificate of Award
(the “Interest Payment Dates”).
The
Series
2008
Bonds
shall
mature in the years and principal
amounts set forth in the Certificate
of Award, provided that (i) each
principal payment shall occur on an
Interest Payment Date, (ii) the first
principal payment on the Series 2008
Bonds shall be no later than December 15, 2010, and (iii) the final maturity date of the Series 2008 Bonds
shall be no later than December 15,
2030.
The Series 2008 Bonds stated to
mature in any year may be issued
as serial Series 2008 Bonds or as
term Series 2008 Bonds payable prior
to stated maturity pursuant to sinking fund redemption (the “Term
Bonds”). The Director of Finance
shall determine in the Certificate of
Award whether any of the Series
2008 Bonds shall be issued as Term
Bonds, any dates (the “Mandatory
Redemption Dates”) on which the
principal amount of the Term Bonds
shall be payable pursuant to mandatory
sinking
fund
installments
rather than at stated maturity and
the amount of principal to be paid
on
each
Mandatory
Redemption
Date (the “Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements”). If any
of the Series 2008 Bonds are issued
as Term Series 2008 Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be redeemed pursuant
to the Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements
at
a
redemption price of 100 percent of
the principal amount redeemed, plus
interest accrued to the redemption
date, on the Mandatory Redemption
Dates. The aggregate of the moneys
to be deposited with the Trustee for
payment of principal of and interest
on any Term Bonds shall include
amounts sufficient to redeem on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates the

The City Record
principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided in
the Indenture and the First Supplement).
The Series 2008 Bonds may be subject to redemption prior to maturity
by and at the option of the City, in
whole or in part on any date, in
whole multiples of $5,000, on the
optional redemption dates and at the
redemption prices (expressed as a
percentage of the principal amount
redeemed) specified in the Certificate of Award, plus, in each case,
accrued interest to the redemption
date. The first optional redemption
date, if any, shall not be later than
ten years from the first Interest
Payment Date, and the highest
redemption
price
shall
not
be
greater than 102% of the principal
amount redeemed plus accrued interest to the redemption date. Based on
the written advice of a financial
advisor, the Director of Finance may
determine
in
the
Certificate
of
Award that it is in the best interests of the City for some or all of
the Series 2008 Bonds not to be
callable prior to their stated maturity.
If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the City
may have the option to purchase
any Bond which is redeemable by
optional redemption at a purchase
price not less than the redemption
price that would be payable if that
Bond
were
called
for
optional
redemption on the date of the proposed purchase. That election shall
be exercised as provided in the First
Supplement.
If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the Series
2008 Bonds may be secured by a
Debt Service Reserve Fund to be
held by the Trustee under the Indenture. The principal amount of the
Series 2008 Bonds may include provision for funding the Debt Service
Reserve Fund from the proceeds of
the Bonds, subject to compliance
with applicable federal tax laws.

first be offered for purchase to the
Trustees of the Sinking Fund and,
if not purchased by them, shall be

2008 Bonds and have been selected

to be set forth in that Certificate. As

(the
“Bond

conditions on which the City agrees
to sell the Series 2008 Bonds and the
Original Purchaser agrees to buy
the Series 2008 Bonds on terms consistent with this Ordinance and the
Indenture, that are not substantially adverse to the City and that are
approved by the Director of Finance
on behalf of the City, all of which
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Bond Purchase
Agreement or amendments to the
Bond Purchase Agreement by the
Director of Finance. It is determined
that the terms of the Series 2008
Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance
and as may be provided in or pursuant to the Certificate of Award,

City and in compliance with all

Section 8.
Bond Anticipation
Notes.
For the purpose of raising
money
in
anticipation
of
the
issuance of the Series 2008 Bonds for
the purpose set forth in Section 1,
notes of the City may be issued in
an aggregate principal amount not
to exceed Two Million Four Hundred
Fifty
Thousand
Dollars
($2,450,000) (the “Notes”) upon the
direction of the Director of Finance
to be set forth in a certificate providing for the final terms of the
Notes and the sale of the Notes and
signed by the Director of Finance
(the “Note Certificate of Award”).
The Notes, if sold as fixed rate
obligations, shall bear interest at
such rate, not exceeding six percent
(6%) per year, and shall be payable
on the date or dates, as shall be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance of the City in the Note Certificate of Award; shall be dated
their date of issuance; shall mature
on the date set forth in the Note Certificate of Award; shall be subject
to redemption by the City at any
time
prior
to
maturity
without
penalty,
unless
the
Director
of
Finance, based on the advice of a
financial advisor, determines that it
is in the best interest of the City in
order to enhance the marketability
of the Notes, that the Notes not be
redeemable prior to maturity; shall
be designated “Cemeteries Improvement Bond Anticipation Notes” or as
otherwise provided in the Note Certificate of Award; shall be issued in
such numbers and denominations as
may be requested by the Note Purchaser (hereinafter defined); and
shall be issued in fully registered
form (which may be in a book entry

The City Record
only system) in denominations of
$5,000 or whole multiples thereof.
The provisions of Sections 9.98 to
9.983 of the Revised Code shall
apply to the Notes and pursuant to
that authority and this Ordinance,
the Director of Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award,
based on the written advice of a
financial advisor, that the City’s
best interests will be served by
causing all or a portion of the Notes
to be obligations bearing interest at
variable rates, redeemable by the
City without penalty or premium on
interest adjustment dates. If the
Director of Finance so determines,
then the Director of Finance shall
specify in the Certificate of Award
the method and procedure by which
the variable rate of interest to be
borne by the variable rate Notes
shall be determined, whether by reference to a market index, by a
remarketing agent or otherwise; provided that the variable rate Notes
shall not bear interest at a rate in
excess of sixteen percent (16%) per
year. Notwithstanding that limitation, Notes held by a provider of a
Credit
Support
Instrument
(as
defined in Section 11) may bear
interest at a rate not in excess of
twenty-five percent (25%) per year
as provided in the agreement with
the provider of the Credit Support
Instrument. Holders of variable rate
Notes may be given the right to tender their variable rate Notes for purchase by the City at the times, on
the terms, and subject to the conditions set forth in the Certificate of
Award and any tender agreement;
provided that tender rights shall be
exercisable only at such times as a
Credit Support Instrument is in
place that provides for the payment
of the purchase price payable to the
tendering holder of a variable rate
Note. If the Director of Finance designates any Notes as variable rate
Notes, and if the holders of the variable rate Notes are to be entitled to
tender the variable rate Notes for
purchase,
then
the
Director
of
Finance shall also designate in the
Certificate of Award for those variable rate Notes the provider or
providers for any Credit Support
Instrument, the tender agent or
agents and the remarketing agent
or agents, which designations shall
be based on the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the parties so designated
possess the requisite resources and
experience to provide the services
required of them and that the terms
on which the designated parties
have agreed to provide such services are fair and commercially reasonable. The Director of Finance is
authorized to enter into agreements
in connection with the delivery of
the variable rate Notes, and from
time to time thereafter so long as
the variable rate Notes are outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support Instruments, tender agents
(which may be the Trustee), remarketing agents, and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a financial advisor, to be
necessary or appropriate to provide
for the method of determining the
variable interest rates, permitting
holders the right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support
for the payment of the variable rate

145

35
Notes upon tender for purchase or
redemption, and providing for the
repayment by the City of any
amounts drawn under the Credit
Support Instrument. The Trustee
shall be the authenticating agent,
registrar, transfer agent and paying
agent for the Notes. The Notes shall
be signed by the officials of the City
and in the manner set forth in the
Indenture. The Notes shall first be
offered for purchase to the Trustees
of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by them, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account
for purchase and, if not purchased
for that Account, shall be sold at not
less than par and accrued interest
to one or more firms that have proposed to underwrite the Notes and
have been selected by the Director
of Finance based on an evaluation
of the qualifications of those firms
(the “Note Purchaser”) in the principal amount set forth in a certificate of award to be executed by the
Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate of Award”). The proceeds of
such sale shall be paid into the
proper fund or funds set forth in the
Note Certificate of Award and used
for the purpose for which the Notes
are being issued under the provisions of this Ordinance.
Section 9. Official Statement; Continuing Disclosure. If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a
disclosure document (each, an “Official Statement”) is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
sale of the Notes or the Series 2008
Bonds, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare or cause to be
prepared on behalf of the City an
Official Statement with respect to
the Notes or the Series 2008 Bonds,
as the case may be, and any necessary supplements and to authorize
the use and distribution of each
Official Statement and any supplements. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign on behalf of the
City and in her official capacity
each Official Statement and any supplements approved by her. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign and deliver on behalf of the
City and in her official capacity
such certificates in connection with
the accuracy of each Official Statement and any supplements as may,
in her judgment, be necessary or
appropriate. The Director of Finance
is also authorized to determine and
certify on behalf of the City that
such disclosure document is “deemed
final” by the City within the meaning of Securities and Exchange
Commission Rule 15c2-12 the “SEC
Rule.”) The Director of Finance is
authorized to contract for services
for the production and distribution
of preliminary and final Official
Statements, including by printed
and electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Notes or the Series 2008
Bonds, the City agrees, in accordance with, and as the only obligated person with respect to the
Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds
under the SEC Rule, to provide or
cause to be provided such financial
information and operating data and
notices, in such manner as may be
required for purposes of the SEC
Rule. In order to describe and specify certain terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to imple-

36
ment that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Director of
Finance is authorized and directed
to prepare, or cause to be prepared,
and to sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the
continuing
disclosure
agreement
made by the City for the benefit of
the holders and beneficial owners of
the Notes or the Series 2008 Bonds,
as the case may be, in accordance
with the SEC Rule. The performance
of that agreement shall be subject
to the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to
establish procedures in order to
ensure compliance by the City with
its continuing disclosure agreement,
including the timely provision of
information and notices.
Section 10.
Federal Tax Covenants.
The City covenants that it
will use, and will restrict the use
and investment of, the proceeds of
the Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds
in such manner and to such extent
as may be necessary so that (a) the
Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds will
not (i) constitute private activity
bonds, arbitrage bonds or hedge
bonds under Sections 141, 148 or 149
of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the Code) or (ii)
be treated other than as bonds to
which Section 103(a) of the Code
applies, and (b) the interest thereon will not be treated as an item of
tax preference under Section 57 of
the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the Notes
and the Series 2008 Bonds to be and
to remain excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will not take or authorize to be taken any actions that
would adversely affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting
for it, will, among other acts of compliance, (i) apply the proceeds of
the Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds
to the governmental purpose of the
borrowing, (ii) restrict the yield on
investment property acquired with
those proceeds, (iii) make timely
and adequate payments to the federal
government,

Severability.
Each
section and each part of each section of this Ordinance is declared to
be an independent section or part of
a section and, notwithstanding any
other evidence of legislative intent,
it is declared to be the controlling
legislative intent that if any such
section or part of a section or any
provision thereof, or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the
remaining sections or parts of sections and the application of such
provisions to any other person or
circumstance, other than those as to

to be the legislative intent that the
other provisions of this Ordinance

municipal department, and, provided
this Ordinance receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all members elected to Council, it shall take
effect and be in force immediately
upon its passage and approval by
the Mayor; otherwise it shall take

Ord. No. 123-08.
By Council Member Sweeney (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the issuance and sale of bonds
in the maximum principal amount of
$6,900,000 for the purpose of providing funds to improve municipal
parks and recreation facilities and
authorizing related matters.
Whereas, this Council desires to
issue bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed Six Million Nine Hundred Thousand Dollars
($6,900,000) (the “Series 2008 Bonds”)
to finance the costs of certain permanent improvements described in
Section 1; and
Whereas, the Series 2008 Bonds
shall be payable from and secured
by income tax revenues of the City
remaining after deposits required
under the General Bond Ordinance
(as defined in Section 2) are made
to the escrow agent for the City’s
general obligation bonds; and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of this City, has certified to this Council that the estimated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be financed with
the proceeds of the Series 2008
Bonds is at least five (5) years, as
evidenced by the certificate contained in File No. 123-08-A; and
Whereas, the authorization for
issuance of the Series 2008 Bonds is
necessary to provide funds to pay
the
costs
of
certain
permanent
improvements described in Section 1
that are urgently needed for the
benefit of the City, and as a result,
this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the
immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety, and for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

The City Record
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary to issue the Series 2008
Bonds in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed Six Million
Nine Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($6,900,000) for the purpose of
providing funds to improve municipal parks and recreation facilities
by constructing, reconstructing, rehabilitating, installing, renovating,
enlarging and otherwise improving
parks and recreation centers and
areas, pools, skating rinks, greenhouses, bicycle paths, playgrounds,
playfields, tracks, fields and related
buildings,
structures,
walkways,
pavement and facilities, and providing
necessary
water
systems,
drainage, lighting, signage, fixtures,
furnishings, equipment, safety modifications and site improvements,
together with all necessary and incidental appurtenances and the acquisition of any required real estate
and interests in real estate and the
demolition of any existing buildings,
structures,
walkways
and
facilities, and to pay any capitalized
interest and all expenses incurred in
connection with the issuance of the
securities, including all financing
costs within the meaning of Section
133.01(K) of the Revised Code and
such other costs of the foregoing
permanent improvements that may
be financed with the proceeds of
securities as permitted by Section
133.15(B) of the Ohio Revised Code
and as otherwise permitted by law.
Section 2. Authority, Security and
Source of Payment. The Series 2008
Bonds shall be issued pursuant to
the Ohio Constitution, Chapter 133 of
the Ohio Revised Code, the Charter
of the City, and this Ordinance for
the purpose stated in Section 1. The
Series 2008 Bonds shall be payable
from and secured by the income tax
revenues of the City on a basis subordinate to the security given to the
general obligation bonds of the City
under Ordinance No. 1749-80 passed
by the Council on October 8, 1980, as
amended by Ordinance No. 1112-83
passed by the Council on May 6,
1983,
and
Ordinance
No.
944-96,
passed by the Council on June 10,
1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so
amended and as the same may further be amended from time to time
in accordance with its provisions, is
referred to as the “General Bond
Ordinance”). The debt service on the
Series 2008 Bonds shall be payable
from income tax collections remaining after depositing with the escrow
agent under the General Bond Ordinance the amount required for the
payment of debt service on the
City’s
general
obligation
bonds
issued and outstanding, from time to
time, under the General Bond Ordinance. The Series 2008 Bonds shall
be issued and secured under the
terms of the Trust Indenture (the
“Indenture”) between the City and
U.S. Bank National Association, as
trustee (the “Trustee”) in substantially the form on file with the
Clerk of Council in the File No. referenced in the preambles of this
Ordinance, with such completions
and changes as may be consistent
with this Ordinance and the Certificate of Award identified in Section
4 and approved by the Director of
Finance as not being adverse to the
City, the Director’s signing and
delivery of the Indenture being conclusive evidence of that determination. The Indenture permits the

147

37
issuance of additional bonds, subject
to certain restrictions. Any additional issues of bonds, together with
the Series 2008 Bonds, are referred
to in this Ordinance and in the
Indenture as the “Bonds.”
Section 3.
Pledge and Covenant
to Maintain Income Tax. So long as
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City pledges the
municipal income taxes of the City
and grants a lien thereon, subordinate to the lien granted in the General Bond Ordinance as security for
the general obligation bonds of the
City issued and outstanding under
the General Bond Ordinance, to the
full extent required to meet debt
charges
payable
on
the
Bonds
issued and outstanding under the
Indenture and to pay any debt
charges on Parity Obligations (as
defined in the Indenture). The City
covenants to appropriate annually
sufficient amounts from the income
taxes for such purpose. The City further covenants that so long as any
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City shall not repeal
or amend, or suffer the repeal of,
any ordinance for the levy or collection of its income taxes in any
manner or to such extent that the
City would not be able to meet its
obligations to the holders of the
Bonds.
Section 4.
Terms of the Series
2008 Bonds. The Series 2008 Bonds
shall be issued in fully registered
form. The Series 2008 Bonds initially shall be delivered only in bookentry form, shall be registered in
the name of the Depository (as
defined in the Indenture) or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository, and shall not be transferable
or exchangeable (except for transfer to another Depository or its nominee) without further action by the
City pursuant to the provisions of
the Indenture and the First Supplement identified below. The Series
2008 Bonds shall be designated
“Parks and Recreation Facilities
Improvement Bonds, Series 2008”
and may contain such further designation as provided in the Certificate of Award identified below. The
Series 2008 Bonds shall be issued in
one lot as fully registered Series
2008 Bonds in denominations of
$5,000 or any whole multiple thereof. The Series 2008 Bonds shall be
numbered as determined by the
Director of Finance. The Series 2008
Bonds shall be signed by the officials of the City and in the manner
set forth in the Indenture.
The Series 2008 Bonds shall be
dated as of April 1, 2008, or such
other date, but in no event later
than December 31, 2009, specified in
the certificate of award providing
for the final terms of the Series 2008
Bonds and the sale of the Series
2008 Bonds in accordance with this
Ordinance
(the
“Certificate
of
Award”). The Series 2008 Bonds
shall be issued in the principal
amount specified in the Certificate
of Award, which shall not exceed
the amount stated in Section 1. The
Series 2008 Bonds shall bear interest
from their date until the principal
amount is paid at the rate or rates
per year specified in the Certificate
of Award, provided that the weighted average of such rates (taking
into account the principal amount
and maturity of each Bond to which

38
a rate applies) shall not exceed six
percent (6%) per year. Interest on
the Series 2008 Bonds shall be
payable semi-annually on the dates
specified in the Certificate of Award
(the “Interest Payment Dates”).
The
Series
2008
Bonds
shall
mature in the years and principal
amounts set forth in the Certificate
of Award, provided that (i) each
principal payment shall occur on an
Interest Payment Date, (ii) the first
principal payment on the Series 2008
Bonds shall be no later than December 15, 2010, and (iii) the final maturity date of the Series 2008 Bonds
shall be no later than December 15,
2030.
The Series 2008 Bonds stated to
mature in any year may be issued
as serial Series 2008 Bonds or as
term Series 2008 Bonds payable prior
to stated maturity pursuant to sinking fund redemption (the “Term
Bonds”). The Director of Finance
shall determine in the Certificate of
Award whether any of the Series
2008 Bonds shall be issued as Term
Bonds, any dates (the “Mandatory
Redemption Dates”) on which the
principal amount of the Term Bonds
shall be payable pursuant to mandatory
sinking
fund
installments
rather than at stated maturity and
the amount of principal to be paid
on
each
Mandatory
Redemption
Date (the “Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements”). If any
of the Series 2008 Bonds are issued
as Term Series 2008 Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be redeemed pursuant
to the Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements
at
a
redemption price of 100 percent of
the principal amount redeemed, plus
interest accrued to the redemption
date, on the Mandatory Redemption
Dates. The aggregate of the moneys
to be deposited with the Trustee for
payment of principal of and interest
on any Term Bonds shall include
amounts sufficient to redeem on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates the
principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided in
the Indenture and the First Supplement).
The Series 2008 Bonds may be subject to redemption prior to maturity
by and at the option of the City, in
whole or in part on any date, in
whole multiples of $5,000, on the
optional redemption dates and at the
redemption prices (expressed as a
percentage of the principal amount
redeemed) specified in the Certificate of Award, plus, in each case,
accrued interest to the redemption
date. The first optional redemption
date, if any, shall not be later than
ten years from the first Interest
Payment Date, and the highest
redemption
price
shall
not
be
greater than 102% of the principal
amount redeemed plus accrued interest to the redemption date. Based on
the written advice of a financial
advisor, the Director of Finance may
determine
in
the
Certificate
of
Award that it is in the best interests of the City for some or all of
the Series 2008 Bonds not to be
callable prior to their stated maturity.
If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the City
may have the option to purchase
any Bond which is redeemable by

The City Record
optional redemption at a purchase
price not less than the redemption
price that would be payable if that
Bond
were
called
for
optional
redemption on the date of the proposed purchase. That election shall
be exercised as provided in the First
Supplement.
If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the Series
2008 Bonds may be secured by a
Debt Service Reserve Fund to be
held by the Trustee under the Indenture. The principal amount of the
Series 2008 Bonds may include provision for funding the Debt Service
Reserve Fund from the proceeds of
the Bonds, subject to compliance
with applicable federal tax laws.
Section 5.
Sale of Series 2008
Bonds. The Series 2008 Bonds shall
first be offered for purchase to the
Trustees of the Sinking Fund and,
if not purchased by them, shall be

proposed to underwrite the Series
2008 Bonds and have been selected

an evaluation of the qualifications
of those firms (collectively, the
“Original Purchaser”).
The Series 2008 Bonds shall be
awarded to the Original Purchaser
in the Certificate of Award which

principal amount of the Series 2008
Bonds, the purchase price (which
shall be not less than 97% of the

years in which principal installments are payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements), any optional redemption
dates, the Interest Payment Dates
and the date of the Series 2008
Bonds (if different from those set
forth in Section 3) and any other
matters required in this Ordinance
to be set forth in that Certificate. As

appropriate and in the best interest
of the City to establish the terms

sign and deliver on behalf of the
City a bond purchase agreement
between the City and the Original
Purchaser
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, setting forth the terms and
conditions on which the City agrees
to sell the Series 2008 Bonds and the
Original Purchaser agrees to buy
the Series 2008 Bonds on terms consistent with this Ordinance and the
Indenture, that are not substantially adverse to the City and that are
approved by the Director of Finance
on behalf of the City, all of which
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Bond Purchase
Agreement or amendments to the
Bond Purchase Agreement by the
Director of Finance. It is determined
that the terms of the Series 2008
Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance
and as may be provided in or pursuant to the Certificate of Award,
the Indenture and the First Supplement, are in the best interest of the
City and in compliance with all
legal requirements.

of the proceeds of the Series 2008

Bonds, and other terms consistent
with this Ordinance and the Certificate of Award and approved by the
Director of Finance as not substantially adverse to the City. The First
Supplement shall be approved as to
form and correctness by the Director of Law. The determination by
the Director of Finance that the provisions of the First Supplement are
not substantially adverse to the City
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the Director’s signing of the First

the Charter, the Mayor, the Director
of Finance, the Director of Law, the

Section 8.
Bond Anticipation
Notes.
For the purpose of raising
money
in
anticipation
of
the
issuance of the Series 2008 Bonds for
the purpose set forth in Section 1,
notes of the City may be issued in
an aggregate principal amount not
to exceed Six Million Nine Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($6,900,000) (the
“Notes”) upon the direction of the
Director of Finance to be set forth
in a certificate providing for the
final terms of the Notes and the sale
of the Notes and signed by the
Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate of Award”). The Notes, if
sold as fixed rate obligations, shall
bear interest at such rate, not
exceeding six percent (6%) per
year, and shall be payable on the
date or dates, as shall be determined
by the Director of Finance of the
City in the Note Certificate of
Award; shall be dated their date of
issuance; shall mature on the date
set forth in the Note Certificate of
Award; shall be subject to redemption by the City at any time prior
to maturity without penalty, unless
the Director of Finance, based on
the advice of a financial advisor,
determines that it is in the best
interest of the City in order to
enhance the marketability of the
Notes,
that
the
Notes
not
be
redeemable prior to maturity; shall
be designated “Parks and Recreation Facilities Improvement Bond
Anticipation Notes” or as otherwise
provided in the Note Certificate of
Award; shall be issued in such numbers and denominations as may be
requested by the Note Purchaser
(hereinafter defined); and shall be
issued in fully registered form
(which may be in a book entry only
system) in denominations of $5,000
or whole multiples thereof. The provisions of Sections 9.98 to 9.983 of
the Revised Code shall apply to the
Notes and pursuant to that authority and this Ordinance, the Director
of Finance may determine in the
Certificate of Award, based on the
written advice of a financial advisor, that the City’s best interests
will be served by causing all or a
portion of the Notes to be obligations bearing interest at variable
rates, redeemable by the City without penalty or premium on interest
adjustment dates. If the Director of
Finance so determines, then the
Director of Finance shall specify in
the Certificate of Award the method
and procedure by which the variable
rate of interest to be borne by the
variable rate Notes shall be determined, whether by reference to a
market index, by a remarketing
agent or otherwise; provided that
the variable rate Notes shall not
bear interest at a rate in excess of
sixteen percent (16%) per year.
Notwithstanding
that
limitation,
Notes held by a provider of a Credit Support Instrument (as defined in
Section 11) may bear interest at a
rate not in excess of twenty-five percent (25%) per year as provided in
the agreement with the provider of
the Credit Support Instrument. Holders of variable rate Notes may be

The City Record
given the right to tender their variable rate Notes for purchase by the
City at the times, on the terms, and
subject to the conditions set forth in
the Certificate of Award and any
tender agreement; provided that tender rights shall be exercisable only
at such times as a Credit Support
Instrument is in place that provides
for the payment of the purchase
price payable to the tendering holder of a variable rate Note. If the
Director of Finance designates any
Notes as variable rate Notes, and if
the holders of the variable rate
Notes are to be entitled to tender the
variable rate Notes for purchase,
then the Director of Finance shall
also designate in the Certificate of
Award for those variable rate Notes
the provider or providers for any
Credit Support Instrument, the tender agent or agents and the remarketing agent or agents, which designations shall be based on the
determination of the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed
to provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable. The Director of Finance is authorized to enter
into agreements in connection with
the delivery of the variable rate
Notes, and from time to time thereafter so long as the variable rate
Notes are outstanding, with providers of Credit Support Instruments, tender agents (which may be
the Trustee), remarketing agents,
and others as may be determined by
the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a financial
advisor, to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the method of
determining the variable interest
rates, permitting holders the right
of tender, providing for liquidity or
credit support for the payment of
the variable rate Notes upon tender
for purchase or redemption, and providing for the repayment by the
City of any amounts drawn under

give under the federal income tax
laws, including, without limitation
thereto, any of the elections provided for in Section 148(f)(4)(C) of the
Code or available under Section 148
of the Code, for the purpose of
assuring, enhancing or protecting
favorable tax treatment or status of
the Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds
or interest thereon or assisting compliance with requirements for that
purpose, reducing the burden or
expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or payments
or penalties, or making payments of
special amounts in lieu of making
computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as rebate, or
obviating those amounts or payments, as determined by that officer,
which action shall be in writing and
signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf
of the City, as may be appropriate

one or more appropriate certificates
of the City, for inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Notes
and the Series 2008 Bonds, setting

circumstances
and
estimates
on
which they are based, and other
facts and circumstances relevant to

and
Whereas, at least 10 million households get payday loans over the
course of a year, with the borrowers being mostly minority, female
and in the military; and
Whereas, there seems to be a correlation between not having the
means to pay your mortgage and
payday loan borrowing; and
Whereas, the current mortgage
and
foreclosure
crisis
in
Ohio
demonstrates to this Council that
giving loans to people who cannot
afford to pay them back not only
harms the borrowers but also has
consequences for entire communities; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports pending HB 333 that
seeks a 36% APR rate cap on payday and other small loans.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
Governor Strickland and all members the Ohio legislature.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Res. No. 128-08.
By Council Members Brancatelli,
Westbrook, Pierce Scott, Cimperman
and Cummins.
An emergency resolution urging
the U.S. Congress to support an economic stimulus bill with adequate
funding to include funding for demolition to those communities which
have been severely impacted by large
numbers of foreclosures in their
communities which have resulted in
permanent abandonment.
Whereas, the U. S. Congress is
now considering a comprehensive
economic stimulus bill; and
Whereas, part of the need for a
national economic stimulus bill is
based on the financial impact of the
foreclosure crisis and the slow down
of the housing market; and
Whereas, the large number of
foreclosed homes is resulting in
both the slow down of the housing
market and the decrease of market
value
of
those
occupied
homes
which are adjacent or near vacant
foreclosed properties; and
Whereas, in many communities
like Cleveland many of the vacant
foreclosed homes should be demolished; and
Whereas, vacant foreclosed properties often become a breeding
ground for crime and fires, and
require a disproportionate amount of
government maintenance, from securing
properties
against
criminal
activity to removal of garbage and
rodents to demolition, all at a cost
to taxpayers; and
Whereas, vacant properties reduce
city tax revenue in three ways: they
are often tax delinquent; their low
value means they generate little in
taxes; and they depress property
values across an entire neighborhood; and
Whereas, the citizens who live in
neighborhoods with many vacant
and abandoned properties have great
difficulty obtaining homeowner’s insurance, mortgages and loans for
home improvements; and
Whereas, vacant properties degrade and devalue the quality of
life for remaining residents, isolating and weakening the neighborhood, and increasing the likelihood
that property values will continue to
decline and further abandonment
will set in; and
Whereas, the foreclosure crisis is
due in part to lax regulation of
mortgage lending and predatory actions of certain lenders, it is incumbent that the Federal government
assist local government with the additional funding to reduce the impacts of vacant properties and provide local government the ability to
demolish large inventories of vacant
housing; and
Whereas, the vacant housing problem is growing, especially in vulnerable communities which have
been highly impacted by mortgage
foreclosures and weak housing markets; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
believes significant appropriations
for demolition should be included in
the economic stimulus bill; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
needs a minimum of $20,000,000, out
of such economic stimulus funding
for demolition; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,

The City Record
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the U.S. Congress to support an economic stimulus bill with
adequate funding to include funding
for demolition to those communities
which have been severely impacted

An emergency resolution urging
Congress and the President of the
United States to guarantee that
every child and pregnant woman in
America has comprehensive health
and mental health coverage; urging
Congress and the President to provide Early Head Start, child care
and preschool to every child ready
for school and to ensure that every
American child can read by the 4th
grade; further urging Congress and
the President to find ways to end
the cycle of poverty that disproportionately affects black and Hispanic
families and their children; urging
the Congress and the President to
invest in children by changing this
country’s policy and practice from
punishment and incarceration to prevention and early intervention; and
further urging the Congress and the
President to help decrease the number of children entering child welfare and juvenile and criminal justice systems.
Whereas, homicide is the leading
cause of death among black males
ages 15-24 and black males ages 1519 are almost four times as likely
as their white peers to die from a
firearm injury and six times as likely to be homicide victims; and

January 30, 2008
Whereas, a black child born in
2001 has a 1 in 3 chance of going to
prison in his lifetime and black
juveniles are four times as likely as
their white peers to be incarcerated;
and
Whereas,
today,
580,000
black
males are serving sentences in state

represent just 39% of the U.A. juvenile population, they represent 60%

Whereas, black babies are almost
four times as likely as white babies
to have their mothers die in childbirth and more than twice as likely
as white babies to be born at very
low birth weight and to die before
their first birthday; and
Whereas, a congressional study
found 15,000 children in juvenile
detention facilities, some as young
as 7 years old, solely because community mental health services were
unavailable; and
Whereas, studies have reported
that as many as 3/4 of incarcerated
youths have mental health disorders
and about 1 in 5 has a severe disorder; and
Whereas, racial disparity runs
through every major system impacting children’s life chances such as
health care, education, child poverty, family status and the juvenile/criminal justice system; and
