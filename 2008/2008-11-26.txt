term of one year or two years for the
necessary items of paper and cloth
wipers in the approximate amount as
purchased during the preceding term,
purchased by the Commissioner of

as the Board of Control determines.
Alternate bids for a period less than
the specified term may be taken if
desired by the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies until provision
is made for the requirements for the
entire term. The Director of Finance
is authorized to enter into one or
more contracts with a term of two

is a financial advantage to the City.
For purposes of this ordinance, a

terms.
Section 2. That the costs of the
contract
or

Section 4. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and

An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Senate and House of Representatives to support the passage
of H.B.602 and S.B 353, known as the
Land Reutilization Bills, which will
allow for the creation of Countywide land banks.
Whereas, Ohio has had one of the
highest foreclosure rates in the
country, with a loan default rate
more than three times the national
average; and
Whereas, vacant foreclosed properties often become a breeding
ground for crime and fires, and
require a disproportionate amount of
government maintenance, from securing properties against criminal activity, to removal of garbage and

The City Record
rodents, to demolition, all at a cost
to taxpayers; and
Whereas, vacant properties reduce
city tax revenue because such properties are often tax delinquent, their
low value means they generate little in taxes and they depress property values across an entire neighborhood; and
Whereas, the cost of living in a
neighborhood with many vacant and
abandoned properties makes obtaining homeowner’s insurance, mortgages and loans for home improvements more difficult; and
Whereas, vacant properties degrade and devalue the quality of
life for remaining residents, isolating and weakening the neighborhood, and increasing the likelihood
that property values will continue to
decline and further abandonment
will occur; and
Whereas, Cuyahoga County is projecting approximately 12,000 foreclosures in 2008, with Cleveland experiencing sixty percent of those foreclosures and of which, according to
a recent study by Case Western
Reserve
University’s
NEO-CANDO
Data
Center,
most
will
remain
vacant after a sheriffs sale; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has approximately 8,000 vacant and
abandoned homes an number that is
currently
beyond
the
financial
capacity of the City to mitigate; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
and Cuyahoga County continue to
encourage regional collaboration for
regional issues such as foreclosure;
and
Whereas, the mortgage foreclosure crisis has dramatically increased the amount of vacant, abandoned
and
distressed
properties,
which pose a unique and growing
problem in the City of Cleveland
and Cuyahoga County in maintaining residential and economic stability; and
Whereas, the development and
implementation of a county land
reutilization corporation can assist
cities in facilitating the reclamation,
rehabilitation and reutilization of
vacant, abandoned, tax-foreclosed or
other real property; and
Whereas, the structure of proposed H.B. 602 and S.B. 353 provide
multiple sources of funding and collaboration that will not rely on any
one entity too heavily and will provide the best, most effective and
responsible manner of addressing
this aspect of the mortgage foreclosure crisis plaguing our city, county, state and country; and
Whereas, it is incumbent upon the
Ohio Legislature to assist local governments with the tools and information
to
reduce
the
negative
impacts of foreclosed and vacant
properties and provide local government with the ability to land bank
property; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the Ohio Senate and House
of Representatives to support the
passage of H.B. 602 and S.B 353,

2209

known as the Land Reutilization
Bills, which will allow for the creation of County-wide land banks.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Governor Ted Strickland, Bill Harris,
Ohio Senate President, Ray Miller,
Ohio Senate Minority Leader, Senator David Goodman, Speaker of the
House Jon Husted, House Minority
Leader Joyce Beatty and James
Rokakis, Cuyahoga County Treasurer.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 1683-08.
By Council Members Polensek, Cummins, Keane, Zone, Santiago, Cimperman, Brady, Johnson, Westbrook,
Coats, White, Conwell, Mitchell and
Pruitt.
An emergency resolution urging
the United States Congress to demand transparency and clarity in
the U.S Treasury’s implementation
of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, and to hold hearings to
investigate the pending buyout of
National City Bank by Pittsburgh’s
PNC Financial.
Whereas, the U.S. Congress recently passed the Emergency Economic
Stabilization Act (EESA) that was
to be used by the government to
“bailout” or financially support ailing United States banks:
Whereas, the $700 billion bailout
bill is so vague that virtually any
U.S. company could be eligible for
government help; and

The City Record
Whereas, the current capital infusions will go only to U.S. banks,
however, the U.S. Treasury has confirmed that the law allows the
department to create other rescue
programs “open to a broader set of
financial institutions”; and
Whereas, as the EESA is written,
the “financial institutions” do not
have to be banks or financial entities;
theoretically,
any
company
could declare itself a financial institution and ask the Treasury for aid
if its rescue is deemed “necessary to
promote financial market stability”;
and
Whereas, it is incumbent upon the
Treasury to clarify the process it is
currently using to determine which
financial institutions qualify for the
capital purchase program under the
EESA; and
Whereas, many Ohio banks have
recently
received
financial
help
through the EESA, including Fifth
Third Bancorp, KeyCorp and Huntington Bancshares; and
Whereas,
the
state
of
Ohio’s
largest bank, Cleveland’s National
City Bank, was forced into a buyout
to Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial
after the Treasury Department decided to withhold support from
National
City,
even
while
PNC
Financial used its financial support
received from the EESA to buyout
National City; and
Whereas,
National
City
Bank,
headquartered in Cleveland, has
been in existence in Cleveland since
the Civil War era; and
Whereas, this buyout could possibly cause thousands of National City
workers to lose their jobs; and
Whereas, it appears that the Treasury’s decision to assist in the sale
of National City is not an isolated
incident — there is evidence that
many banks participating in the
EESA capital purchase program
intend to use taxpayer dollars to
buy other banks; and
Whereas, there is some question
as to the U.S. comptroller’s role in
the PNC buyout of National City and
whether his previous ties to PNC
steered the buyout; and
Whereas, all of the above illustrates that, in order for financial
institutions, taxpayers, workers and
investors to understand the parameters of the EESA, and to have confidence in the Treasury’s actions,
Treasury must provide a clear explanation of its actions to date and
the factors shaping those actions;
and
Whereas, moving forward, Treasury must be clear as to how it is
determined which institutions are
receiving taxpayer-funded support,
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the United States Congress to demand transparency and clarity in
the U.S Treasury’s implementation
of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, and to hold hearings to
investigate the pending buyout of
National City Bank by Pittsburgh’s
PNC Financial.
