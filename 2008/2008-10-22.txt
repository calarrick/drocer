An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Port Control to
enter into a Lease Agreement with
Champlain Enterprises, Inc., dba
CommutAir for the lease of hangar
and ramp space at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, for the
Department of Port Control, for a
period of two years, with two oneyear options to renew, the first of
which is exercisable through additional legislative authority.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Port Control is authorized to enter
into a Lease Agreement (“Lease”)

space has been determined to be not
needed for public use for the term
of the Lease. The Leased Premises
shall be used to operate an aircraft
hangar and aircraft maintenance
facility. The term of the Lease shall
be for a two-year term, with two
one-year options to renew. The first
of the one-year options to renew
may not be exercised without additional legislative authority. If such

additional legislative authority is
granted and the first of the one-year
options to renew is exercised, then
the second of the one-year options to
renew may be exercisable at the
option of the Director of Port Control, without the necessity of obtaining additional authority of this
Council. For use of the Leased
Premises, Lessee shall pay the City
an annual rent of $191,126.00 for the
hangar area portion of the Lease,
and $23,587.00 for the ramp area portion of the Lease. The rent shall be
paid in monthly installments due on
the first day of each month during

declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the

the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and

from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 1568-08.
By Council Members Cimperman,
White, Brady, Keane, Pierce Scott,
Westbrook, Polensek, Brancatelli,
Howse, Zone, Conwell, Sweeney,
Coats and Mitchell.
An emergency resolution strongly
urging all City of Cleveland residents to vote YES on State Issue 5
to preserve a rate cap on payday
lenders.
Whereas, payday loans are designed to trap people in a cycle of repeat
borrowing; and
Whereas, the interest on a typical payday loan is 391 percent
APR; and
Whereas, these high interest rates
aggravate Cleveland’s home mortgage foreclosure crisis; and
Whereas, Democratic state legislators joined with Republicans to
crack down on abusive lending by
passing House Bill 545, which caps
Ohio’s annual interest on payday
loans at 28 percent; and
Whereas,
Gov.
Ted
Strickland
signed House Bill 545 into law; and
Whereas,
the
national
payday
lobby is financing a referendum
that would undermine Ohio’s nationally acclaimed payday reform law
and allow lenders to continue charging rates commonly associated with
loan sharking; and
Whereas, this referendum would
appear on the Nov. 4 ballot as Issue
5; and
Whereas, a YES vote on Issue 5
will preserve Ohio’s 28 percent rate
cap and block lenders from charging 391 percent interest; and
Whereas, preserving the rate cap
will help Cleveland’s families, neighborhoods and businesses by allowing
borrowers to keep more of their
money by spending less on high
interest rates; and
Whereas, a YES vote on Issue 5
will extend the same loan protections to Cleveland families that the
federal government provides to military families.
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby strongly urges all City of Cleveland residents to vote YES on State
Issue 5 to preserve a rate cap on
payday lenders.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

By Council Members Cimperman

An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting
new
Section
347.17,
relating
to
check-cashing and pay-day lending
businesses.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure provid-

26
ing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
supplemented by enacting new Section 347.17 to read as follows:
Section 347.17 Check-Cashing and
Pay-Day Lending Businesses
(a) Purpose. The regulations of
this section are established to regulate the location of check-cashing
businesses for the purpose of protecting neighborhoods from negative secondary effects created by the
concentration or clustering of such
businesses. Furthermore, the regulations
are
established
to
guard
against market saturation which
may lead to increased rates as an
offset for lower business volume.
(b) Definition. “Check-cashing business” means a business that meets
the definition of a “check-cashing
business” in Section 1315.21 of the
Revised Code and includes checkcashing businesses licensed to make
loans
under
Sections
1315.35
to
1315.44 of the Revised Code, also
known as pay-day lenders. Generally, a check-cashing business is a
business, other than a bank or savings and loan or similar financial
institution, that cashes checks for a
fee as a principal business activity
and may or may not also make
loans as part of that business activity.
(c) Spacing. No check-cashing
business shall be established on a
lot or lots within 1,000 feet of another lot or lots containing an existing
check-cashing
business.
No
two
check-cashing businesses shall be
located in the same building or on
the same lot.
(d) Maximum Number. There shall
be no more than one check-cashing
business located within the City of
Cleveland for each 20,000 persons
residing in the City as recorded in
the most recent decennial U.S. Census. No additional check-cashing
businesses shall be established if
the current number of check-cashing
businesses exceeds the maximum
number permitted.
(e) Exception. This section shall
not apply to any check-cashing business as defined above currently in
operation prior to passage of this
section.
Section 2. That the report presented to the Finance Committee of
this Council at the public hearing on
this legislation and prepared by Policy Matters Ohio and Housing Research & Advocacy Center has been
placed in File No. 944-08-A.
Section 3. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
