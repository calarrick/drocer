relationships with a person of the
same sex or different sex; these couples live together, serve and participate together in the community,

institutions voluntarily permit their
employees, members, patrons and
other individuals with whom they
interact to include their partners as
beneficiaries of various policies,
including but not limited to, health
insurance coverage, hospital visitation rights, family recreational memberships, and authorization to pick
up children after school; and

relationships without affecting the
definition of marriage and without

status that intends to approximate
marriage; and

Schwartz proposed that the name
Cleveland
State
University
be
changed to The University of Cleveland; and

colleges; and
Whereas, a name change would
reflect the changes in CSU’s physical appearance and improved academics; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,

An emergency resolution endorsing House Bill 502 and Senate Bill
305 of the 127th Ohio General
Assembly that would amend the
Ohio Revised Code to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual
orientation.
Whereas, House Bill 502 sponsored
by State Representatives Dan Stewart (D - Franklin County) and Jon
Peterson (R - Delaware County) and
a companion bill, Senate Bill 305,
introduced by Senator Dale Miller
(D
–
Cuyahoga
County)
would
amend the Ohio Revised Code to prohibit discrimination on the basis of
sexual orientation; and
Whereas, House Bill 502 and Senate Bill 305 have been introduced in
the 127th General Assembly by bipartisan cosponsors; and
Whereas, the most fundamental
and honored principles of our national heritage affirm that all persons have certain rights that cannot
be assigned, taken away, or compromised; and
Whereas, we know these inalienable rights include the right to life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness;
and
Whereas, life and liberty cannot
be enjoyed, nor happiness pursued,
if a person is identified, persecuted
or discriminated against on the
basis of his or her inherent nature;
and
Whereas, in concert with our national, cultural and political history
of confronting discriminating practices and prohibiting their continuance, now comes the time to forever ban discrimination on the basis
of sexual orientation or gender identification; and
Whereas, twenty states and fifteen Ohio cities have adopted laws
or policies which prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation; and
Whereas, the intentional exclusion
of persons denies the community the
perspectives
which
nurture
the
development of new ideas, principles, products and services; and
Whereas, job applicants and employees should only be evaluated on
the basis of their potential ability,
or actual performance, to fulfill the
duties of a job, and not on the basis
of sexual orientation or gender

identity which are not determinates

Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,

the City of Cleveland:

By Council Members Cimperman,

An emergency resolution recognizing that on November 17, 2008
Cleveland will honor the 10th Annual Transgender Day of Remembrance,
and
further
recognizing
those individuals who are actively
involved in working hard toward
transgender equality in our society.
Whereas, this Council is extremely pleased to recognize that on Monday, November 17, 2008, Cleveland
will recognize and honor the 10th
Annual Transgender Day of Remembrance by both remembering
the deceased and celebrating the
present and future; and
Whereas, the Transgender Day of
Remembrance was set aside to
memorialize those who were killed
due to anti-transgender hatred or
prejudice; and
Whereas, this event is held every
November in honor of Rita Hester,
whose murder on November 28th,
1998 kicked off the “Remembering
Our Dead” web project and a San
Francisco candlelight vigil in 1999;
Rita Hester’s murder — like most
anti-transgender murder cases —
has yet to be solved; and
Whereas, this event serves several purposes, including publicly
mourning and honoring the lives of
our brothers and sisters who might
otherwise be forgotten, raising public
awareness
of
hate
crimes
against transgender people, and
honoring those persons who actively work toward transgender equality; and
Whereas, in an effort to further
build and strengthen our communities and nation, we must move
beyond merely “tolerating” the transgender community, and instead value
them as our colleagues, neighbors,

34
sons, daughters, brothers, sisters,
friends and partners; and
Whereas,
that
Cleveland
City
Council is sincerely pleased to note
the 10th Annual Transgender Day of
Remembrance, and further recognizes those individuals who are
actively involved in working hard
toward transgender equality in our
society; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council recognizes that on Monday, November
17, 2008, Cleveland will honor the
10th Annual Transgender Day of
Remembrance, and further recognizes those individuals who are
actively involved in working hard
toward transgender equality in our
society.

Ohio, Cleveland Stonewall Democrats, and Mayor Jackson.

the members elected to Council, it

An emergency resolution urging
the United States Congress to demand transparency and clarity in
the U.S Treasury’s implementation
of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, and to hold hearings to
investigate the pending buyout of
National City Bank by Pittsburgh’s
PNC Financial.
Whereas, the U.S. Congress recently passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA) that
was to be used by the government
to “bailout” or financially support
ailing United States banks:
Whereas, the $700 billion bailout
bill is so vague that virtually any
U.S. company could be eligible for
government help; and
Whereas, the current capital infusions will go only to U.S. banks,
however, the U.S. Treasury has confirmed that the law allows the
department to create other rescue
programs “open to a broader set of
financial institutions”; and
Whereas, as the EESA is written,
the “financial institutions” do not
have to be banks or financial entities; theoretically, any company could
declare itself a financial institution
and ask the Treasury for aid if its
rescue is deemed “necessary to promote financial market stability”; and
Whereas, it is incumbent upon the
Treasury to clarify the process it is

The City Record
currently using to determine which
financial institutions qualify for the
capital purchase program under the
EESA; and
Whereas, many Ohio banks have
recently
received
financial
help
through the EESA, including Fifth
Third Bancorp, KeyCorp and Huntington Bancshares; and
Whereas,
the
state
of
Ohio’s
largest bank, Cleveland’s National
City Bank, was forced into a buyout
to Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial
after the Treasury Department decided to withhold support from
National
City,
even
while
PNC
Financial used its financial support
received from the EESA to buyout
National City; and
Whereas,
National
City
Bank,
headquartered in Cleveland, has
been in existence in Cleveland since
the Civil War era; and
Whereas, this buyout could possibly cause thousands of National City
workers to lose their jobs; and
Whereas, it appears that the Treasury’s decision to assist in the sale
of National City is not an isolated
incident — there is evidence that
many banks participating in the
EESA capital purchase program
intend to use taxpayer dollars to
buy other banks; and
Whereas, there is some question
as to the U.S. comptroller’s role in
the PNC buyout of National City and
whether his previous ties to PNC
steered the buyout; and
Whereas, all of the above illustrates that, in order for financial
institutions, taxpayers, workers and
investors to understand the parameters of the EESA, and to have confidence in the Treasury’s actions,
Treasury must provide a clear explanation of its actions to date and
the factors shaping those actions;
and
Whereas, moving forward, Treasury must be clear as to how it is
determined which institutions are
receiving taxpayer-funded support,
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the United States Congress to demand transparency and clarity in
the U.S Treasury’s implementation
of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, and to hold hearings to
investigate the pending buyout of
National City Bank by Pittsburgh’s
PNC Financial.
