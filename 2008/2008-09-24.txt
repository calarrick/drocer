FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 1461-08.
By Mayor Jackson and Council
Members Sweeney, Pierce Scott and
Santiago.
An emergency resolution pledging
the Mayor and Council’s support of
the passage of Issue 5 on November
4, 2008, and urging the Cleveland
voters to support the issue relating
to payday lending.
Whereas, on November 4, 2008,
Issue 5 will be appearing on the ballot for consideration by Ohio voters
to limit the interest rate for short

term loans to 28% APR and change
short term lending laws; and
Whereas, payday loans are designed to trap people in a cycle of
repeat borrowing; and
Whereas, the interest on a typical
payday loan is 391% APR; and
Whereas, these high interest rates
aggravate Cleveland’s home mortgage foreclosure crisis; and
Whereas, Democratic state legislators joined with Republicans to
crack down on abuse lending by
passing House Bill 545, which caps
Ohio’s annual interest on payday
loans at 28%; and
Whereas, Governor Ted Strickland
signed House Bill 545 into law; and
Whereas,
the
national
payday
lobby is financing a referendum
that would undermine Ohio’s nationally acclaimed payday reform law
and allow lenders to continue charging rates commonly associated with
loan sharking; and
Whereas, this referendum would
appear on the November 4 ballot as
Issue 5; and
Whereas, a YES vote on Issue 5
will preserve Ohio’s 28% rate cap
and block lenders from charging
391% interest; and
Whereas, preserving the rate cap
will
help
Cleveland’s
families,
neighborhoods and businesses by
allowing borrowers to keep more of
their money by spending less on
high interest rates; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health,
or safety in that passage of Issue 5
will extend the same loan protections to Cleveland families that the
federal government provides to military families; now therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Mayor and
Council pledge their support of and
urge the voters of the City of Cleveland to support State Issue 5 at the
election to be held on November 4,
2008, relating to payday lending.
Section 2. That this resolution is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the

Whereas, the place for which the

to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
