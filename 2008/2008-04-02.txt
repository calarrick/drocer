outdoor leaf and wood composting
and a storage use on acreage located in split zoning between B1 Residence Industry and B3 General
Industry Districts on the east side
of East 185th Street at 1455 East
185th Street; contrary to Section
345.02(b) outdoor storage is proposed and all materials must be
stored on the inside of buildings;
and subject to Section 345.02(f),
entrance and exit to any premises
must be from a street designated as
a major thoroughfare on the general plan adopted by the city Planning
Commission, or if the premises does
not abut such street, then from any
street approved by the Board of zoning Appeals if it finds the probable
volume and type of traffic to such
premises will not change materially
the
existing
character
of
such
streets nor be detrimental to the
adjoining or adjacent residential
area; and under the provisions of
Section 347.05, no space for storage
of dust-producing material shall be
located less than 300 feet from a residence district, except where the
dust and odor will be effectively

yard storage use to be enclosed with
a minimum 7 foot high solid masonry wall or slightly solid, nontransparent, well maintained substantial
fence not closer than 50 feet to any
residence district. The proposed expansion of a nonconforming use requires the Board of Zoning Appeals
approval
as
stated
in
Section
359.01(a) and a previous variance
granted by the Board in Calendar
No. 05-330 required all grass clippings and other yard maintenance
