ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 1356-08.
By Council Members Santiago,
Cleveland, Sweeney, Zone, Kelley,
White, Brancatelli, Keane, Howse,
Mitchell, Turner, Brady, Coats, Cummins and Reed.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio State legislature to support
HB 196, that would provide an
income tax credit investment in
motion pictures produced in Ohio
and further urging swift passage of
such legislation.
Whereas, in May, 2007, State Representative Tom Patton introduced
legislation that would create up to
a 25% credit on money spent by
filmmakers who spend at least
$300,000 to make movies in Ohio; and
Whereas, currently, there is a $100
million dollar movie project that
Hollywood producers would like to
film in Cleveland, but will not be
able to unless state officials act
quickly to grant the producers tax
breaks; and
Whereas, producers of the film
“Torso” want to film part of the
movie in Cleveland, but a critical
piece of the movie’s budget involves
receiving tax breaks for a portion
of the money the studio spends to
make the movie; and
Whereas, because Ohio doesn’t
offer tax incentives to movie makers, the executives of this movie
will probably take the movie to
Michigan, which offers such tax
incentives; and
Whereas, losing the filming of
this movie to the state of Michigan
will take countless jobs away from
Ohioans, and cause the state to lose
money it could have made had the
film crew been on location here for
3 to 4 months; and
Whereas, H.B. 196 appears stalled
in the state legislature, currently
sitting in the House Ways and
Means Committee, awaiting a hearing; and
Whereas,
the
film’s
producers
need an answer by December in
order
to
begin
shooting
movie
scenes in January or February; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges

HB 196, that would provide an
income tax credit investment in
motion pictures produced in Ohio
and further urging swift passage of

immediately upon its adoption and

Fight”, with special guest speaker
Dr. Linda Bradley, was held in
Cleveland City Hall on September 4,
