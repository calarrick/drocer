Clean Ohio Fund for $201,250 for
work related to the Lake to Lakes
Bike Trail and the Doan Brook
Watershed.
Whereas, the Lake to Lakes Bike
Trail and Doan Brook Watershed
would create a continuous off-street
bike trail linking several Cleveland
neighborhoods; and
Whereas, this bike trail would
also serve as a linkage for the City
of Cleveland to the communities of
Cleveland Heights, Beachwood, and
Shaker Heights; and
Whereas, this link would also create a pedestrian connection to recreational amenities including the Dike
14
Nature
Preserve,
Rockefeller
Park and the Shaker Lakes; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has included the Lake to Lakes
Trail in its Bikeway Master Plan
and as such has provided first-phase

and
Whereas, ParkWorks, in partnership with the Doan Brook Watershed Partners are applying for a
Clean Ohio Grant to support engineering work related to building the

cooperation with the City of Cleveland and the Doan Brook Watershed

cost-estimates for day lighting portions of the Brook and building the
bike trail through the City of Cleveland’s Ambler Park; and
Whereas, this trail will support
recreation, transportation, and environmental improvements and benefits to the City of Cleveland residents and visitors;
Whereas, the rail corridor has
adapted itself to become an interceptor and collection basin for contaminated waters flowing toward
the Cuyahoga River, and will continue to serve this important function upon the trail’s completion,
helping to reduce storm water runoff throughout the Flats; and
Whereas, ParkWorks, working in
cooperation with the City of Cleveland, will determine the best entity
to hold both the fee title lands and
trail easements following acquisition and to provide maintenance for
the trail; and

Link Trail” on the West Bank of the
Flats and public access to Lake Erie
for residents of contiguous neighborhoods in the City of Cleveland.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has been a partner with ParkWorks
and other stakeholders in planning
the Lake Link Trail; and
Whereas, acquisition of the corridor is the first step toward transforming a piece of abandoned urban
infrastructure with a recreational
greenway and natural resource corridor connecting the Towpath Trail
and the future Canal Basin Park to
the Lake Erie shoreline at Whiskey
Island; and
Whereas, acquisition of the northern portion of the corridor for $1.3
million will leverage contribution of
an easement valued at $2.066 million
for a more southerly section to connect the trail with the planned
alignment of the Ohio and Erie Towpath Trail, satisfying the Clean
Ohio
Fund’s
requirement
for
a
match of local resources; and
Whereas, the Lake Link will provide a connector to the Towpath
Trail, connecting Lake Erie to a 100mile trail that leads to the Cuyahoga Valley National Park and
beyond, and will also run adjacent
to several civic and cultural landmarks including the West Side Market, Tower City and the lower Flats
district; and
Whereas, the Lake Link will provide significant green space, recreational opportunities and exposure
to nature for residents of adjacent
neighborhoods including the Flats,
Ohio City, Tremont, Downtown and
the nearly 1,200 residents of public
housing estates at Lakeview Terrace and Riverview; and
Whereas, the trail will support the
nearly $100 million investment that
has been made in new housing
development on the west bank of
the Flats; and
Whereas, the trail will increase
habitat protection and preserve natural features in a heavily urbanized
area, contributing to the quality of
life of City of Cleveland residents;
and
Whereas, the rail corridor has
adapted itself to become an interceptor and collection basin for contaminated waters flowing toward
the Cuyahoga River, and will con-

tinue to serve this important function upon the trail’s completion,
helping to reduce storm water runoff throughout the Flats; and
Whereas, ParkWorks, working in
cooperation with the City of Cleveland, will determine the best entity
to hold both the fee title lands and
trail easements following acquisition and to provide maintenance for
the trail; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports ParkWorks’ application to the
Clean Ohio Fund for $1.3 million to
acquire a portion of a former rail

Whereas, on March 10, 2003 Peter

Marshal for the Northern District of
Ohio; and
Whereas, Peter J. Elliott is the
youngest U.S. Marshal ever appointed in the Northern District of Ohio
since its formation in 1855; and
Whereas, in June, 2003, Elliott created the Northern Ohio Violent Fugitive Task Force which is comprised
of local police departments and the
U.S. Marshals Service, which has
had a tremendous impact in reducing crime in our communities, with
more than 15,000 violent fugitives
arrested; and
Whereas, in 2004, Elliott created a
“Fugitive Safe Surrender Program”
in Cuyahoga County, a new concept

including over 300 felons, to voluntarily surrender to a church; this
first of its kind program has now
been adopted nationally by the U.S.
Marshals Service; and
Whereas, Elliott brought the Gang
Resistance Education and Training
(G.R.E.A.T) program to the district
to prevent youth crime and gang
involvement while developing a positive relationship between youth and

of
Police Organizations, the only person selected from the State of Ohio

2310

for
this
prestigious
award; and
Whereas, in April, 2008, Elliott
was selected as one of the 50 Most
Influential People in Northern Ohio
by Cleveland Magazine; and
Whereas, Elliott has won numerous national awards for his work on
terrorism investigation, and many
other awards for his work as a law
enforcement officer, among them
being the “John T. Corrigan Award,
Law Enforcement Officer of the
Year” in 2004, the Ohio Governor’s

An emergency resolution supporting the 2009 Year of the River, promoting stewardship of our watershed and encouraging residents, institutions and businesses to become
partners in conservation, restoration
and protection of our natural resources.
Whereas, the Cuyahoga River is
at the center of the history, culture,
commerce, industry, recreation and
the environment of Northeast Ohio;
and
Whereas,
the
Cuyahoga
River
watershed and Lake Erie tributaries
within the Cuyahoga River Remedial Action Plan’s Area of Concern
include more than 800 square miles
of land in 6 counties and nearly 100
cities, villages and townships; and
Whereas,
the
Cuyahoga
River
watershed is nature’s version of
regionalism, providing a geological
and
hydrological
connection
between the cities of Cleveland and
Akron, the Cuyahoga Valley National Park and the rural, urban, agri-

December 10, 2008
cultural, suburban communities and
industrial assets of our region; and
Whereas, we recognize that the
health of our own streams determines the health of the Cuyahoga
River and Lake Erie, into which
they flow; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has sponsored test sites for Cuyahoga Habitat Underwater Baskets
(CHUBS) to lead the country in

environmental restoration can drive
economic development; and
Whereas, members of our community, along with the Cuyahoga River
RAP, the Friends of Big Creek,
Doan Brook Partnership, Flats Oxbow Association, Mill Creek Partners and the Cuyahoga Soil & Water
Conservation District, have worked
to restore the watershed to health;
and
Whereas, the fire that occurred on
the Cuyahoga River on June 22, 1969
sparked the creation of the Clean
Water Act and today’s environmental movement; and
Whereas, much work remains to
be accomplished in order that we
pass a healthy watershed to future
generations; and
Whereas, this Council will strive
to support conservation and stewardship of our streams and watershed, and encourage residents and
property owners to conserve natural
areas, especially wetlands, forests,
riparian zones and our natural
stormwater management infrastructure; and
Whereas, this Council will strive
to review and update our codes and
ordinances in light of current best
management practices, and promote
conservation-friendly land use and
building practices, especially strategies that reduce impervious surfaces, increase stormwater storage
and filtering, prevent soil erosion,
and reduce impacts from wastewater treatment systems; and
Whereas, this Council will collaborate with the communities that
share our watershed and the organizations that work to restore and
protect our natural resources, and
celebrate the progress we have
made in restoring our watershed;
and
Whereas, 2009 is the fortieth anniversary of that watershed event,
and communities throughout the region will commemorate this anniversary; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,

An emergency resolution urging
Congress to provide $5 billion for
the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant and for municipal energy conservation and environmental protection programs.
Whereas, the nation is facing
energy challenges, including escalating energy costs, and critical
choices about energy resources that
will affect the nation’s future economic well-being and security; and
Whereas, the Congress is crafting
an Economic Stimulus Package; and

2311

23
Whereas, many cities have implemented energy conservation and
environmental protection programs
and similar innovations to conserve
energy, protect natural resources
and support the economies of their
cities and the nation; and
Whereas,
Cleveland
and
other
cities have taken the lead in adopting energy-saving and environmentally-friendly
practices,
including
smart growth solutions, clean and
alternative energy options, green
building techniques, transportation
alternatives, recycling, and green
jobs, among others; and
Whereas, energy-saving and environmentally-friendly practices can
yield cost savings for municipalities, households, and businesses in
this time of budgetary constraints;
and
Whereas, in 2007 Congress passed
legislation
creating
the
Energy
Efficiency and Conservation Block
Grant (EECBG), which was modeled
after the successful Community Development Block Grant; and
Whereas, the EECBG was created
to provide grants to municipalities
to update energy-efficiency provisions in building codes, renovate old
buildings
using
energy-efficiency
technologies, adopt renewable-energy solutions, create incentives for
citizens to use transportation alternatives, and implement energy-saving campaigns; and
Whereas, the EECBG needs federal funding to provide grants to
municipalities and other governments; and
Whereas, the U.S. Conference of
Mayors has estimated that $5 billion
could effectively be used by cities
and towns to quickly implement
energy efficiency and conservation
measures and simultaneously stimulate the economy through job creation; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
Congress to provide $5 billion for
the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant and for municipal energy conservation and environmental protection programs.
Section 2. That the Clerk of
Council is directed to send copies of
this resolution to the Congressional
leadership
team,
President-Elect
Barack Obama, the Ohio Congressional Delegation, Ohio Governor
Ted Strickland, the National League
of Cities Energy, Environment and
Natural Resources Committee, the
U.S. Conference of Mayors, and
Mayor Frank G. Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

REPRINT
Res. No. 1793-08.
By Council Members Brancatelli,
Westbrook, Sweeney, Brady, Cimperman, Cleveland, Conwell, Cummins,
Dow, Johnson, Keane, Kelley, Mitchell,
Pierce Scott, Polensek, Pruitt, Reed,
Santiago, White and Zone.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Senate and House of Representatives to support the passage
of H.B.602 and S.B 353, known as the
Land Reutilization Bills, which will
allow for the creation of Countywide land banks.
Whereas, Ohio has had one of the
highest foreclosure rates in the
country, with a loan default rate
more than three times the national
average; and
Whereas, vacant foreclosed properties often become a breeding
ground for crime and fires, and
require a disproportionate amount of
government maintenance, from securing properties against criminal activity, to removal of garbage and
rodents, to demolition, all at a cost
to taxpayers; and
Whereas, vacant properties reduce
city tax revenue because such properties are often tax delinquent, their
low value means they generate little in taxes and they depress property values across an entire neighborhood; and
Whereas, the cost of living in a
neighborhood with many vacant and
abandoned properties makes obtaining homeowner’s insurance, mortgages and loans for home improvements more difficult; and
Whereas, vacant properties degrade and devalue the quality of
life for remaining residents, isolating and weakening the neighborhood, and increasing the likelihood
that property values will continue to
decline and further abandonment
will occur; and
Whereas, Cuyahoga County is projecting approximately 12,000 foreclosures in 2008, with Cleveland experiencing sixty percent of those foreclosures and of which, according to
a recent study by Case Western
Reserve
University’s
NEO-CANDO
Data
Center,
most
will
remain
vacant after a sheriffs sale; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has approximately 8,000 vacant and
abandoned homes an number that is
currently
beyond
the
financial
capacity of the City to mitigate; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
and Cuyahoga County continue to
encourage regional collaboration for
regional issues such as foreclosure;
and
Whereas, the mortgage foreclosure crisis has dramatically increased the amount of vacant, abandoned
and
distressed
properties,
which pose a unique and growing
problem in the City of Cleveland
and Cuyahoga County in maintaining residential and economic stability; and
Whereas, the development and
implementation of a county land
reutilization corporation can assist
cities in facilitating the reclamation,
rehabilitation and reutilization of
vacant, abandoned, tax-foreclosed or
other real property; and
Whereas, the structure of proposed H.B. 602 and S.B. 353 provide
multiple sources of funding and col-

2325

37
laboration that will not rely on any
one entity too heavily and will provide the best, most effective and
responsible manner of addressing
this aspect of the mortgage foreclosure crisis plaguing our city, county, state and country; and
Whereas, it is incumbent upon the
Ohio Legislature to assist local governments with the tools and information
to
reduce
the
negative
impacts of foreclosed and vacant
properties and provide local government with the ability to land bank
property; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the Ohio Senate and House
of Representatives to support the
passage of H.B. 602 and S.B 353,
known as the Land Reutilization
Bills, which will allow for the creation of County-wide land banks.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Governor Ted Strickland, Bill Harris,
Ohio Senate President, Ray Miller,
Ohio Senate Minority Leader, Senator David Goodman, Speaker of the
House Jon Husted, House Minority
Leader Joyce Beatty and James
Rokakis, Cuyahoga County Treasurer.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
