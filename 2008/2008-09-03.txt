in the emergency measure. An emergency measure is an ordinance or
resolution for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health, or safety, or providing for
the usual daily operation of a
Municipal department, in which the
emergency is set forth and defined
in a preamble. Ordinances appropriating money may be passed as emergency measures, but no measure
making a grant, renewal or extension of a franchise or other special
privilege, or regulating the rate to
be charged for its services by any
public utility, shall ever be so
passed.

be filed with the Clerk of the Council requesting that the ordinance, or
any
specified
part
thereof,
be
repealed or submitted to a vote of
the electors, it shall not become
operative until the steps indicated
herein have been taken. The petition shall be prepared and filed in
the manner and form prescribed in
the foregoing sections of this Charter for an initiative petition for an
ordinance.
§ 64
Referendum on Emergency
Measures
Ordinances passed as emergency
measures for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health, or safety and providing
for the refinancing of bonds, notes
or other securities of the City shall
not
be
subject
to
referendum.
Otherwise,
emergency
measures

like manner as other ordinances,
except that they shall go into
effect at the time indicated in the
ordinances. If, when submitted to a
vote of the electors of the City, an
emergency measure be not approved by a majority of those voting thereon, it shall be considered
repealed as regards any further
action thereunder; but the measure
so repealed shall be deemed sufficient authority for payment in
accordance with the ordinance, of
any expense incurred previous to
