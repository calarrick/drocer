application of res judicata would
create manifest injustice.

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 1863-08.
By Council Member Mitchell.
An emergency resolution supporting ParkWorks’ application to the
Clean Ohio Fund for $201,250 for
work related to the Lake to Lakes
Bike Trail and the Doan Brook
Watershed.
Whereas, the Lake to Lakes Bike
Trail and Doan Brook Watershed
would create a continuous off-street
bike trail linking several Cleveland
neighborhoods; and
Whereas, this bike trail would
also serve as a linkage for the City
of Cleveland to the communities of
Cleveland Heights, Beachwood, and
Shaker Heights; and
Whereas, this link would also create a pedestrian connection to recreational amenities including the Dike
14
Nature
Preserve,
Rockefeller
Park and the Shaker Lakes; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has included the Lake to Lakes
Trail in its Bikeway Master Plan
and as such has provided first-phase
construction funding as a portion of
its 2009 Capital Improvement Plan;
and
Whereas, ParkWorks, in partnership with the Doan Brook Watershed Partners are applying for a
Clean Ohio Grant to support engineering work related to building the
trail and restoring the adjacent
Doan Brook Watershed; and
Whereas, this trail will provide
increased recreational and transportation opportunities, contributing
to the quality of life of City of
Cleveland residents; and
Whereas, the day lighting and
diversion of water from the Doan
Brook will help reduce flooding in
several Cleveland neighborhoods; and
Whereas, ParkWorks, working in
cooperation with the City of Cleveland and the Doan Brook Watershed
Partners will develop a plan and
cost-estimates for day lighting portions of the Brook and building the
bike trail through the City of Cleveland’s Ambler Park; and
Whereas, this trail will support
recreation, transportation, and environmental improvements and benefits to the City of Cleveland residents and visitors;
Whereas, the rail corridor has
adapted itself to become an interceptor and collection basin for contaminated waters flowing toward
the Cuyahoga River, and will continue to serve this important function upon the trail’s completion,
helping to reduce storm water runoff throughout the Flats; and
Whereas, ParkWorks, working in
cooperation with the City of Cleveland, will determine the best entity
to hold both the fee title lands and
trail easements following acquisition and to provide maintenance for
the trail; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

2354

December 17, 2008
Section 1. That this Council supports ParkWorks’ application to the
Clean Ohio Fund for $201,250 for
work related to the Lake to Lakes
Bike Trail and the Doan Brook
Watershed.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
certified copy of this resolution to
ParkWorks.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Res. No. 1864-08.
By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency resolution supporting ParkWorks’ application to the
Clean Ohio Fund for $1.3 million to
acquire a portion of a former rail
right-of-way to provide a “Lake
Link Trail” on the West Bank of the
Flats and public access to Lake Erie
for residents of contiguous neighborhoods in the City of Cleveland.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has been a partner with ParkWorks
and other stakeholders in planning
the Lake Link Trail; and
Whereas, acquisition of the corridor is the first step toward transforming a piece of abandoned urban
infrastructure with a recreational
greenway and natural resource corridor connecting the Towpath Trail
and the future Canal Basin Park to
the Lake Erie shoreline at Whiskey
Island; and
Whereas, acquisition of the northern portion of the corridor for $1.3
million will leverage contribution of
an easement valued at $2.066 million
for a more southerly section to connect the trail with the planned
alignment of the Ohio and Erie Towpath Trail, satisfying the Clean
Ohio
Fund’s
requirement
for
a
match of local resources; and
Whereas, the Lake Link will provide a connector to the Towpath
Trail, connecting Lake Erie to a 100mile trail that leads to the Cuyahoga Valley National Park and
beyond, and will also run adjacent
to several civic and cultural landmarks including the West Side Market, Tower City and the lower Flats
district; and
Whereas, the Lake Link will provide significant green space, recreational opportunities and exposure
to nature for residents of adjacent
neighborhoods including the Flats,
Ohio City, Tremont, Downtown and
the nearly 1,200 residents of public
housing estates at Lakeview Terrace and Riverview; and
Whereas, the trail will support the
nearly $100 million investment that
has been made in new housing
development on the west bank of
the Flats; and
Whereas, the trail will increase
habitat protection and preserve natural features in a heavily urbanized

December 17, 2008
area, contributing to the quality of
life of City of Cleveland residents;
and
Whereas, the rail corridor has
adapted itself to become an interceptor and collection basin for contaminated waters flowing toward
the Cuyahoga River, and will continue to serve this important function upon the trail’s completion,
helping to reduce storm water runoff throughout the Flats; and
Whereas, ParkWorks, working in
cooperation with the City of Cleveland, will determine the best entity
to hold both the fee title lands and
trail easements following acquisition and to provide maintenance for
the trail; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports ParkWorks’ application to the
Clean Ohio Fund for $1.3 million to
acquire a portion of a former rail
right-of-way to provide a “Lake Link

Committee where it has been sitting
ever since; and
Whereas, if action is not taken

reducing crime in our communities,
with more than 15,000 violent fugitives arrested; and
Whereas, in 2004, Elliott created a
“Fugitive Safe Surrender Program”

The City Record

be accomplished in order that we
pass a healthy watershed to future

An emergency resolution urging
Congress to provide $5 billion for
the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant and for municipal energy conservation and environmental protection programs.
Whereas, the nation is facing
energy challenges, including escalating energy costs, and critical
choices about energy resources that
will affect the nation’s future economic well-being and security; and

energy, protect natural resources
and support the economies of their
cities and the nation; and

Cleveland
and
other
cities have taken the lead in adopting energy-saving and environmentally-friendly
practices,
including
smart growth solutions, clean and
alternative energy options, green
building techniques, transportation

Whereas, energy-saving and environmentally-friendly practices can
yield cost savings for municipalities, households, and businesses in

energy efficiency and conservation
measures and simultaneously stimulate the economy through job creation; and

Ord. No. 1745-08.
By Council Members Cimperman,
Zone, Santiago, Mitchell, Cummins,
Kelley, Westbrook, Brady and Brancatelli.
An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting
new Chapter 109, Sections 109.01
through 109.07, relating to domestic
partnership registry.
Whereas, all citizens are valued
in the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
seeks to promote economic development by attracting and retaining
new businesses and industries to
our community, and assisting businesses and universities in the recruitment of a talented and diverse
workforce; and
Whereas, many unmarried residents of Cleveland have formed lasting, committed, caring, and faithful
relationships with a person of the
same sex or different sex; these couples live together, serve and participate together in the community,
and rear children and care for family members together; and

Whereas, many public and private institutions voluntarily permit
their employees, members, patrons
and other individuals with whom
they interact to include their partners as beneficiaries of various
policies, including but not limited
to, health insurance coverage, hospital visitation rights, family recreational memberships, and authorization to pick up children after
school; and
Whereas, a registry for unmarried
couples maintained by the City
would remove the administrative
burden on hospitals, universities,
employers, and other businesses to
define and verify the existence of
these committed non-marital relationships; and
Whereas, a registry for these unmarried couples will acknowledge
the existence of their committed
relationships without affecting the
definition of marriage and without
creating or recognizing any legal
status that intends to approximate
marriage; and
Whereas, a registry for unmarried
couples will make those couples and

2379

their families feel welcome and valued in this City; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
supplemented
by
enacting
new
Chapter 109, Sections 109.01 through
109.07, to read as follows:
Chapter 109
Domestic Partnership Registry
Section 109.01 Definitions
As used in this Chapter:
(1) “Domestic partnership” refers
to the non-marital committed relationship of two adults of the same
or different sex, who share a common residence and affirm that they
share
responsibility
for
each
other’s common welfare, and have
signed and filed a Declaration of
Domestic
Partnership
with
the
city.

36
(2) “Share a common residence”
means that both domestic partners
share the same residence. It is not
necessary that both domestic partners have title to the property
where they reside or the legal right
to possess the common residence.
Two people may share a common
residence even if one or both have
additional residences. Domestic partners do not cease to share a common residence if one leaves the common residence but intends to return.
Nothing in this definition or chapter
shall affect or supersede any residency requirement set forth in Section 74 of the City’s Charter. Shared
common residence does not have the
same meaning as bona fide residence.
(3) Domestic partners will be
deemed to have an “committed” relationship and to “share responsibility
for one another’s common welfare”
if they execute a Declaration of
Domestic Partnership affirming that
such facts are true.
Section 109.02
Domestic Partnership Criteria
To establish a domestic partnership, both individuals must file a
Declaration of Domestic Partnership
with the City affirming that they
meet all of the following qualifications:

(2) Both individuals affirm that
they have an committed relationship
and share responsibility for each
other’s common welfare;
(3) Neither individual is married
to any other individual;
(4) Neither individual is part of
an existing domestic partnership
with any third party;
(5) Each individual is 18 years of
age or older; and
(6) The individuals are not related to one another by blood in a way
that
would
prevent
them
from
being married to one another in
this State.
Section 109.03 Filing
(A) Filing Location. Two individuals seeking to become domestic
partners must complete and file a
Declaration of Domestic Partnership
with the Division of Assessments
and Licenses.
(B) Filing Prohibition. No individual who has previously filed a
Declaration of Domestic Partnership in this City may file a new
Declaration of Domestic Partnership until a Notice of Termination
of Domestic Partnership has been
filed with the City. However, this
prohibition shall not apply if the
previous domestic partnership ended because one of the domestic
partners is deceased.
Section 109.04 Registration
(A) Registration Forms. The Commissioner
of
Assessments
and
Licenses shall develop “Declaration
of
Domestic
Partnership”
and
“Notice of Termination of Domestic

listed in Section 109.02 of this

Domestic Partnership in a registry
and return a copy of the declaration
form to the domestic partners at the
address provided as their common
residence.
(F)
Termination
Registration.
The city shall register the Notice of
Termination of Domestic Partnership pursuant to the requirements
set forth in Section 109.05 of this
Chapter.
Section 109.05 Termination
(A) Termination. A domestic partnership ends when:
(1) One of the domestic partners
dies; or
(2) A Notice of Termination of
Domestic Partnership has been filed
by one or both domestic partners
with the city.
(B) Notice of Termination. If the
facts affirmed in the Declaration of
Domestic Partnership cease to be
true, one or both parties to a domestic partnership shall file a Notice of
Termination of Domestic Partnership with the Division of Assessments and Licenses. Upon receipt,
the city shall return a copy of the
notice marked “filed” to each of the
partners, if jointly filed; or two
copies to the filing partner. Unless
the partners jointly file the notice,
the partner filing the notice shall,
within five days, send a copy of the
filed notice to the other partner’s
last known address. However, this
requirement shall not apply if the
termination is due to the death of
one of the domestic partners.
(C) Effective Termination Date.
Termination of a domestic partnership shall be effective upon filing of
the Notice of Termination of Domestic Partnership with the City by one

domestic partnership and whose
receipt of that benefit or enjoyment
of that right has not otherwise

domestic partnership has terminated. The City shall not be liable for
any injury to any third-party by
virtue of lack of notice of termination to the domestic partnership,
including any third-party which
has provided any benefits regarding the domestic partnership.
(E) Failure to Give Notice. Failure to provide notice to third parties as prescribed in this section
shall not delay or prevent the termination of the domestic partnership.
Section 109.06 Legal Effect
(A) Registering as domestic partners by two individuals who are
also married to one other, in this or
in another state, shall under no circumstances, be considered as evidence, knowledge, awareness, or an
admission that the partners are not
lawfully married and it shall not be
given any other legal effect, in this
or any other state, with regard to
whether the persons are lawfully
married.
(B) Nothing in this Chapter shall
be interpreted to alter or contravene
county, state or federal law.
(C) Nothing in this Chapter shall
be construed as recognizing or treating a Declaration of Domestic Partnership as a marriage or a legal status that intends to approximate the
design, qualities, significance or
effect of marriage.
Section 109.07 Severability
If any section, subsection, clause
or provision of this Chapter is held
invalid, the remainder shall not be
affected by such invalidity.
Section 2. That the Sections 109.04
