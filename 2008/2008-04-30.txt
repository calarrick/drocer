An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Senate to support and not
modify the “Great Lakes - St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources
Compact”.
Whereas, the Great Lakes comprise almost 20% of the world’s surface fresh water and 95% of North
America’s fresh surface water, and
supply drinking water to more than
40 million U.S. and Canadian residents; and
Whereas,
Lake
Erie
supplies
drinking water to nearly 3 million
Ohioans and supports local agriculture; a diversity of wildlife, including a world class fishery; maritime
trade; industry; and tourism; and
Whereas, Lake Erie is ailing from
a multitude of stressors, including
aquatic invasive species, toxic contamination of river and lake sediments, partially or inadequately
treated sewage discharges, pollution
from non-point sources, and coastal
habitat loss; and
Whereas, Lake Erie is the shallowest, warmest and most biologically productive, producing more
fish for human consumption than all
of the other four Great Lakes combined; and
Whereas, Lake Erie is incredibly
vulnerable to stressors as the smallest Great Lake both in surface area
and volume, with a drainage basin
totaling 30,140 square miles, and
encompassing
parts
of
Indiana,
Michigan, New York, Ohio, Ontario,
and Pennsylvania; and
Whereas, the health of Lake Erie
is essential to the quality of life and
economic vitality of communities
along its shores and in the surrounding basin, supporting tourism,
industrial, recreational, commercial,
and cultural activities; and
Whereas, over 140 scientists have
endorsed a paper, “Prescription for
Great Lakes Ecosystem Protection
and Restoration – Avoiding the Tipping Point of Irreversible Changes,”
which calls for urgent action in the
Great Lakes to avoid an ecosystem
breakdown; and
Whereas, there has been an unprecedented collaborative effort on
the part of 1,500 people representing federal, state, tribal and local
governments, research institutions
including universities, businesses,
agricultural organizations, non governmental entities and private citizens to develop an Action Plan to
Restore
and
Protect
the
Great
Lakes; and
Whereas, members of Congress
have introduced the Great Lakes
Collaboration Implementation Act,
which seeks approximately $20 billion over a five year period to fund
projects that implement the Action
Plan to Restore and Protect the
Great Lakes; and

16
Whereas, specifically, the Act will
provide funding to:
Prevent and control aquatic invasive species;
• Create and restore wetlands
and other fish and wildlife habitat;
• Reduce municipal sewage overflows;
• Clean up toxic sediments in
Great Lakes Areas of Concern, including the Cuyahoga River;
• Reduce mercury pollution;
• Otherwise implement the Action
Plan to Restore and Protect the
Great Lakes; and
Whereas, local governments need
financial
assistance
to
upgrade
wastewater treatment plants and
infrastructure, to reduce non-point
source pollution; and
Whereas, the Florida Everglades
and
other
nationally
significant
water resources have already benefited from significant federal investments in restoration and protection; and
Whereas, the Great Lakes are a
treasured natural resource in need
of substantial state and federal
financial assistance; and
Whereas, protection of the Great
Lakes is a challenge of utmost significance and scope to the people of
the City of Cleveland, the Northeast
Ohio region, the State of Ohio, and
all states and provinces that comprise the Great Lakes’ basin; and
Whereas, this monumental challenge includes working to safeguard
the quality of the waters in order to
protect these freshwater resources
from threats of out-of-basin water
diversions and to continue to enable
our use and enjoyment of this water
resource within the basin; and
Whereas, Canada and the United
States
created
the
International
Joint Commission through the 1909
Boundary Waters Treaty because
they recognized that the two countries need to cooperate in order to
manage these waters wisely and to
protect them for the benefit of current and future generations; and
Whereas, in June 2002, the Commission appointed the International
Water Uses Review Task Force to
assist it in carrying out a review of
the issue of water uses in the Great
Lakes basin and to prepare a report
on the topic; and
Whereas, the International Water
Uses Review Task Force finalized a
report to the International Joint
Commission, entitled “Protection of
Waters of the Great Lakes” that
encourages support for a more deliberative approach to finalizing the
Great Lakes Compact to establish
protection of waters of the Great
Lakes from diversion; and
Whereas, the Great Lakes Compact is an amendment to the Great
Lakes Charter of 1985, which is a
non-binding agreement signed by
the Governors of the eight states
and the Premiers of the two Canadian provinces that border the Great
Lakes; and
Whereas, the purpose of the Great
Lakes Compact is to forge a new
binding agreement to manage the
Great Lakes waters, develop a decision-making standard for a new or
increased water withdrawals, and
make further commitments to continue to improve the Great Lakes
water management system; and
Whereas, the state of Ohio must
continue its proud tradition of protecting Lake Erie and fulfill its

The City Record
commitment
to
protecting
and
restoring the Great Lakes by taking
substantial
steps
and,
whenever
practical, match federal funding to
implement the Great Lakes Collaboration Implementation Act; and
Whereas, the state of Ohio should
firmly establish its opposition to the
diversion of Great Lakes water for
the future protection of this important global resource that is vital to
strengthening the American and
Canadian economies and the vitality of the states and provinces along
the Great Lakes shores; and
Whereas, in their April 21, 2008
letter sent to the Ohio Senate Leadership, Senators George V. Voinovich and Sherrod Brown, and U.S.
House of Representatives, Ralph Regula, Marcy Kaptur, David Hobson,
Steven
C.
LaTourette,
Stephanie
Tubbs-Jones, Michael, Turner, Tim
Ryan, Betty Sutton, Zack Space and
Charles A. Wilson all expressed
their support of the Great Lakes St. Lawrence River Basin Water
Resources Compact, and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,

as one; and
Whereas, the Jewish Community
has always played an active roll in
the City’s civic, political, and business affairs and the City now, more
than ever, needs the assistance of
the Jewish Community to meet its
current challenges; and
Whereas, the physical presence of
the Jewish Community Federation
headquarters, in downtown Cleveland, symbolizes our historic relationship; and
Whereas, there is no great region
in the United States without a
strong and vibrant central business
district and the Jewish Community
Federation’s commitment to remain
in the City recognizes this importance, not only for the City of Cleveland’s prosperity, but to everyone,
including the Jewish Community’s;
and
Whereas, all major religious organizations, civic organizations, governmental, and the foundation community are located in downtown Cleveland; and
Whereas, The Jewish Community
Federation
of
Cleveland
should
remain in our City to facilitate this
historical cooperation, thereby benefiting Jewish Community Federation as well as its partner organizations; and
Whereas, The Jewish Community
Federation is an important part of
the fabric of the City, and its physical presence is evidence of this
commitment; and
