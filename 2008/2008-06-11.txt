or frame, a streamlined support
structure, or similar features effective in improving the appearance of
the site. At a minimum, evergreen
shrubs, at least three (3) feet in

new or reconstructed billboard shall
be no greater in size, height, number
of panels, or any panel dimension
than is the existing billboard, nor
shall the new or reconstructed billboard be less conforming to any zoning regulation than is the existing
billboard, except that a panel or sign
face may be added to the back of a
billboard where previously there had
been no panel or sign face.
(3) Location. The new or reconstructed billboard shall be placed in
precisely the same location as the
existing billboard unless the City
Planning
Commission
determines
that a different location on the same
parcel of land would be more effective in meeting the intent of the
sign regulations, as stated in Section 350.01.
(4) Sign Type. With respect to the
“sign types” defined in division (f)
of Section 350.03, the new or reconstructed billboard shall be the same
type as the existing billboard unless
the City Planning Commission determines that a different sign type
would be more compatible with the
subject property or nearby properties.
(5) Changeable Copy. The new or
reconstructed billboard may incorporate automatic changeable copy
only if such copy is limited to a single billboard panel or two back-toback billboard panels and only if
each such panel replaces two or
more billboard panels on the subject
property and only if the total area
of the panels removed is at least
twice as great as the total area of
the proposed panels. If the requirement for removal of billboard panels cannot be met fully on the subject property, additional billboard
panels may be removed, with the
approval of the City Planning Commission, if such panels are located
within one mile of the proposed
changeable
copy
panel.
If
the
required removal of billboard panels
cannot be met on the subject property, the total area of all billboard
panels removed shall be at least
three times as great as the total
area of the proposed panels. Each
message on a sign utilizing changeable copy shall remain fixed for the
period of time required by the Ohio

Ord. No. 961-08.
By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting
new Sections 698A.01 and 698A.99,
relating to outdoor sales of tickets
of admission to sporting and other
events and the establishment of
exclusion and permissive zones for
that activity and penalty; and to
amend Section 698.06 as enacted by
Ordinance No. 1290-A-43, passed October 22, 1945, relating to ticket brokers.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
supplemented by enacting new Sections 698A.01 and 698A.99 to read as
follows:
CHAPTER 698A
OUTDOOR SALES OF TICKETS
OF ADMISSION
TO SPORTING EVENTS
AND OTHER EVENTS
Section 698A.01 Outdoor Sales of
Tickets of Admission to Sporting
Events and Other Events Restricted; Penalty
(a) Findings. The activities of
vendors of tickets of admission to
sporting events and other events in
and near the Central Business District has caused inconvenience and
annoyance to persons on their way
to the events or patronizing restaurants and other businesses in the
vicinity of the events. At times,
pedestrians encounter a gauntlet of
ticket vendors employing aggressive
sales tactics, or witness sidewalk
turf disputes among ticket vendors
that sometimes escalate to physical
altercations. The time, place and
manner restrictions imposed by this
section are narrowly tailored to
respond to this matter of public and
governmental interest.
(b) Offense. No person who possesses a ticket or tickets of admission to a sporting event, theater,
show or other event shall, after first
being warned by a law enforcement
officer to desist, sell, hawk, peddle,
display for sale or solicit another to
purchase the ticket or tickets outdoors within the zone identified in
division (c) of this section, except
the parts of the zone designated as
permissive ticket sales areas, for a
period of six hours before or during
any event at the Cleveland State
University Convocation Center or
Gateway complex or the event to
which the ticket or tickets pertain.
(c) Ticket Zone Established. The
zone referred to in division (b) of
this section and the permissive ticket sales areas within the zone are
set forth by legal description contained in File No. 961-08-A. The
Director
of
Public
Safety
may,
through the issuance of a regulation, modify the boundaries or placement of the zone or permissive ticket sales areas as set forth in the file
if the Director determines that such
changes are needed to advance the
purposes of this legislation as stat-

10
ed in division (a). Any such regulation shall take effect fourteen
days after its publication in the City
Record.
The Director of Public Safety may
cause signs to be posted to apprise
persons of the existence of the zone
and permissive ticket sales areas
established by this section, but the
absence of signs or any deficiency
of signs shall not constitute a
defense to division (b) of this section provided that the offender, in
accordance with division (b), has
first been warned by a law enforcement officer to desist from the proscribed conduct.
Section 698A.99 Penalty
Whoever violates division (b) of
Section 698A.01 is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor on the first offense, a
misdemeanor of the fourth degree
on the second offense, and a misdemeanor of the second degree on the
third and any subsequent offense.
Section 2. That Section 698.06, as
enacted by Ordinance No. 1290-A-43,
passed October 22, 1945, is amended
to read as follows:
Section 698.06 Operating Regulations
The Commissioner of Assessments
and Licenses, and any person or persons designated by him, and every
police officer shall enforce the following regulations:
(a) There shall be conspicuously
posted and at all times displayed
prominently at the location licensed, a
price list showing the price charged
by the person, firm or corporation
owning, operating or controlling the
theater, place of amusement or
entertainment, or the place where
the public exhibition, game, contest
or performance for which a ticket is
being sold by such licensee, together with the price being charged by
such licensee for the resale of such
ticket so that all persons visiting
such place may readily see the
same. The licensee shall also on
request, furnish each purchaser of a
ticket with a receipt showing the
same information.
(b) No licensee shall pay to any
officer or employee of any theater
or place of amusement or entertainment or other place where public
exhibitions, games, contests or performances are held, or to any producer or manager or employee of
any theatrical or other exhibition or
theatrical company, any commission,
gratuity or bonus in connection with
the sale, delivery or payment of
tickets or in connection with the
business
being
done
by
such
licensee in tickets of admission to
such places.
Section 3. That existing Section
698.06, as enacted by Ordinance No.
1290-A-43, passed October 22, 1945, is
repealed.
Section 4. That the legal description contained in the legislative file
referenced in division (c) of Section
698A.01 shall be published in the
City Record along with the publication of the enacted version of this
ordinance.

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTION REFERRED
Res. No. 943-08.
By Mayor Jackson and Council
Member Zone.
An emergency resolution establishing an Advanced Energy Portfolio Standard and making certain
determinations required by the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act,
for the Division of Cleveland Public
Power, Department of Public Utilities.
Whereas, the Energy Policy Act
of 2005 amended the Public Utility
Regulatory Policies Act of 1978
(PURPA) to require the governing
bodies of electric utilities to consider adopting standards to encourage
fuel diversity and the greater efficiency of fossil fuel generators; and
Whereas, the development of an
Advanced Energy Portfolio Standard
(AEPS) promotes fuel diversity and
will enhance air quality and water
quality, improving the health and
welfare of City of Cleveland residents; and
Whereas, an AEPS will encourage
the development of alternative energy resources including cogeneration,
distributed generation, and fuel cells,
and renewable resources including
waste-to-energy generation, low-impact hydropower, wind power, biomass, solar power, landfill gas, solar
photovoltaic, and solar thermal resources; and
Whereas, the State of Ohio will
encourage and/or require the implementation of Advanced Energy Portfolio Standards; and
Whereas,
Cleveland’s
extensive
manufacturing base is ideally situated to provide the heavy equipment
and infrastructure necessary to support construction of advanced energy generation facilities, which will
encourage
economic
development
and job creation in the City; and
Whereas, Cleveland Public Power
desires to diversify its power resource portfolio to promote development
of
alternative
energy
resources, provide stable long-term
electric rates for customers, encourage local generation, reduce CPP’s
reliance on the regional transmission system, and contribute to economic development in Cleveland;
and
Whereas, the Public Utilities Committee of Cleveland City Council
conducted
public
hearings
on
November 29, 2007, December 6, 2007,
and January 16, 2008 to afford interested parties the opportunity to provide input and testimony regarding
the proposed adoption of the PURPA
standards; and
Whereas, an engineering analysis
performed by Sulzer Hickham Inc.
dated January 15, 2008 concluded
that improvement of the efficiency
of CPP’s three gas turbine generators
would
cost
$2,000,000
to
$3,000,000 per generator and would

1128

June 11, 2008
increase efficiency only by approximately 3.6%; and
Whereas, the three gas turbines
are run less than 1% of the time,
are used primarily for emergency
purposes, and are CPP’s most expensive power resource; and
Whereas, on the basis of the testimony, comments, and evidence contained in Council File No. 943-08-A,
this Council makes its determination
regarding
adoption
of
the
PURPA standards; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the City of Cleveland’s adoption of a fuel diversity standard
through the establishment of an
Advanced Energy Portfolio Standard
with the intention that CPP produce
and/or purchase 15% of CPP’s electric
energy
requirements
from
Advanced
Energy
Resources
by
2015, increasing to 20% by 2020, and
25% by 2025.
Section 2. That for the purposes of
this Resolution, “Advanced Energy
Resources” means generation produced by cogeneration, distributed
generation, fuel cells, waste-to-energy
generation,
low-impact
hydropower, wind power, biomass, solar
power, landfill gas, solar photovoltaic, and solar thermal resources.
Section 3. That adoption of a fossil fuel generation efficiency standard applicable to CPP’s three gas
turbines is not economical given the
high cost of upgrading the units and
the modest potential gain in efficiency.
Section 4. That this resolution is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Referred to Directors of Public
Utilities, Finance, Law; Committees
on Public Utilities, Finance.

An emergency resolution urging
the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas to initiate an emergency
foreclosure moratorium to stay all
active and newly filed foreclosure
cases involving occupied residences
and continue to work with Council
and community organizations to
implement a comprehensive program
that strengthens distressed neighborhoods, calling upon the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas
to
“fast
track”
the
foreclosure
process for abandoned residential
properties in the manner established
by Magistrate Stephen M. Bucha III
and offering to the Court specific
recommendations that will protect
the borrower and the lender, as well
as the community and the housing
market, as developed in part by way
of a hearing to be conducted by the
Community and Economic Development Committee.
Whereas, vacant foreclosed properties often become a breeding
ground for crime and fires, and
require a disproportionate amount of
government maintenance, for securing
properties
against
criminal
activity, removal of garbage and
rodents, including elimination of
blight through demolition, all at a
cost to taxpayers; and
Whereas, vacant properties reduce
city tax revenue in three ways: they
are often tax delinquent; their low
value means they generate little in
taxes; and they depress property
values across an entire neighborhood; and
Whereas, the citizens who live in
neighborhoods with many vacant
and
abandoned
properties
have
great difficulty obtaining homeowner’s insurance, mortgages and loans
for home improvements; and
Whereas,
vacant
properties
degrade and devalue the quality of
life for remaining residents, isolating and weakening the neighborhood, and increasing the likelihood
that property values will continue to
decline, further abandonment will
set in and a recent study by
CWRU/NEO-CANDO indicates that
in the City of Cleveland properties
lose 70% of their value following
foreclosure; and
Whereas, the Cuyahoga County
Court of Common Pleas is to be congratulated for recognizing the debil-

1152

June 11, 2008
itating impacts of the high number
of foreclosures in Cleveland’s neighborhoods: and
Whereas, the Court has recommended a systematic process under
it’s jurisdiction to achieve equitable
work-outs and to mitigate and to
reduce the number of home-owners
losing their homes through foreclosure by instituting a mediation program; and
Whereas, a moratorium on foreclosures
of
occupied
residences
would allow time to establish a system that would emphasis counseling
and mediation, with foreclosure as a
measure of last resort; and
Whereas, the Cuyahoga County
Court of Common Pleas is about to
establish a new process for additional outreach to those home-owners being foreclosed and to establish
a new process for pre-determining
mediation options to the effected
home-owner and a comprehensive
system would stabilize neighborhoods, reduce abandonment and protect both the borrowers and lenders;
and
Whereas, Cuyahoga County has
created a foreclosure counseling program that has thus far helped 2,251
homeowners avail foreclosure; and
Whereas, a study commissioned
by Cuyahoga County, conducted by
Cleveland
State
University,
has
found that HUD certified counselors
funded by the county have a 52%
success rate in adverting foreclosures; and
Whereas,
various
community
based organizations and Cleveland
City Council believe that the proposed Court mediation program will
operate best within a structured and
stable process and the Cleveland
City Council urge that the process
include expanded opportunities for
home-owner counseling and representation; and
Whereas, the Cleveland City Council urge that the process for outreach and notification be improved
which would also include identification of foreclosed landlord properties so that tenants are advised of
rights and resources; and
Whereas, the Cleveland City Council urges the Court to proceed with
all due hast to consider the concerns
of the Cleveland City Council and
other interested parties in establishing a foreclosure time out plan,
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the
Cuyahoga
County
Court
of
Common Pleas to initiate an emergency foreclosure moratorium to
stay all active and newly filed foreclosure cases involving occupied residences and continue to work with
Council and community organizations to implement a comprehensive
program that strengthens distressed
neighborhoods.
Section 2. That this Council calls
upon the Cuyahoga County Court of
Common Pleas to “fast track” the
foreclosure process for abandoned
residential properties in the manner
established by Magistrate Stephen
M. Bucha III.
Section 3. That this Council will
offer to the Court specific recommendations that will protect the borrower and the lender, as well as the
community and the housing market,
as developed in part by way of a

June 11, 2008
hearing to be conducted by the Community and Economic Development
Committee.
Section 4. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Eileen
Gallagher, Judge, Cuyahoga County
Court of Common Pleas, Stephen M.
Bucha III, Chief Magistrate,
Section 5. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency

An emergency resolution urging
the National Credit Union Administration, the Federal Reserve Board
and the Office of Thrift Supervision
to adopt the reforms proposed for
the Federal Trade Commission Act,
Truth in Savings Act, and Truth in
Lending Act to protect consumers
from unfair and abusive practices
by the credit card industry.
Whereas, many responsible consumers are being harmed by a growing number of fees, penalties and
interest charges attached to bill payments and credit card debts; and
Whereas, the home foreclosure crisis serves as a daily reminder of the
need for responsible federal regulation to protect citizens from unfair
or predatory business practices; and
Whereas, the proposal from the
National Credit Union Administration, the Federal Reserve Board and
the Office of Thrift Supervision will
help consumers in our community
avoid
excess
fees
and
unfair
charges that put their personal
financial stability in jeopardy; and
Whereas, the proposed regulations
will put an end to business practices
that only serve to increase the
amount of interest and fees that are
owed and trap more consumers in a
cycle of debt; and
Whereas, the proposed regulations
will help to provide responsible consumers with greater peace of mind
that the terms they agreed to when
they
opened
their
credit
card
accounts will not be changed unexpectedly or without their knowledge; and
Whereas, through the adoption of
these principles, the National Credit
Union Administration, the Federal
Reserve Board and the Office of
Thrift Supervision will help to protect our community’s quality of life
by preventing financial hardship
and lessening the demands on our
local social-service providers for
help; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

The City Record

An emergency resolution urging
the Jackson Administration to convene, along with the Council, to
study whether City workers, excluding safety forces, should go to a
four-day, 40-hour work week.
Whereas, U.S. oil and natural gas
production have peaked and are
now
in
decline,
ensuring
our
nation’s
continued
and
growing
dependence on oil and natural gas
imported from politically unstable
regions; and
Whereas, a growing body of energy industry experts believe that the
world has already arrived at, or will
soon arrive at, the peak of global
oil production, which will be followed by an inevitable decline in
available supply thereafter; and
Whereas, global demand for oil
and
natural
gas
continue
to
increase; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
and its citizens and businesses
depend on oil and natural gas for
their economic welfare and their
most critical activities, including
transportation and food supply; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland is
committed to sustainability and its
indicators of community well-being:
economic
vitality,
environmental
health and social equity; and
Whereas, reducing the work week
from 5 days to 4 days would reduce
the use of cars, thereby reducing the
emissions of carbon dioxide; and
Whereas, reducing the work week
from 5 days to 4 days would reduce
the energy used in city hall when
open and would reduce the fuel used
by city workers when on the job in
vehicles; and
Whereas, reducing the work week
from 5 days to 4 days would allow
employees to pay less for child care,
because they would need child care
only four days per week, not five;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Jackson Administration to convene, along with the Council, to

An emergency resolution calling
upon the Jackson Administration to
work with this Council and convene
a working group that will assess
Cleveland’s exposure to diminishing

36
supplies of oil and natural gas and
make recommendations to address
vulnerabilities.
Whereas, global reserves of oil
and natural gas are finite and sufficient substitutes are unlikely to be
available in the immediate future;
and
Whereas, U.S. oil and natural gas
production have peaked and are
now
in
decline,
ensuring
our
nation’s
continued
and
growing
dependence on oil and natural gas
imported from politically unstable
regions; and
Whereas, a growing body of energy industry experts believe that the
world has already arrived at, or will
soon arrive at, the peak of global
oil production, which will be followed by an inevitable decline in
available supply thereafter; and
Whereas, global demand for oil
and
natural
gas
continue
to
increase; and
Whereas, following the global
peaks of oil and natural gas production, the interaction of decreasing supply and increased demand
will cause the price of oil and natural gas to become more volatile;
and
Whereas,
the
United
States
Department of Energy’s National
Energy Technology Laboratory has
stated that, "The problems associated with world oil production peaking will not be temporary, and past
‘energy crisis’ experience will provide relatively little guidance. The
challenge of oil peaking deserves
immediate, serious attention, if risks
are to be fully understood and mitigation begun on a timely basis";
and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
and its citizens and businesses
depend on oil and natural gas for
their economic welfare and their
most critical activities, including
transportation and food supply; and
Whereas, a large majority of
money spent on fossil fuels leaves
Ohio and provides no local economic benefit, while many of the solutions to lessening dependence on
fossil fuels may result in local jobs
and substantial economic benefits;
and
Whereas, Cleveland residents and
businesses are not currently aware
of
the
full
implications
of
an
impending decline and will greatly
benefit from an objective source of
information on this topic; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
should work to adopt a Local Action
Plan On Global Warming, the success of which depends upon reducing carbon dioxide emissions from
burning fossil fuels; and
Whereas, the Cities of Portland,
Oregon; San Francisco and Oakland,
California; Austin, Texas; among
other cities have convened task
forces to examine the effect on
cities of diminishing supplies of oil
and natural gas; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland’s
working group should include members from the City’s the Office of
Sustainability, Departments of Public Utilities, Finance, Public Service,
City
Planning
and
Health
and
should seek technical assistance
from the Ohio Departments of Energy and Transportation and any
other applicable local, state and federal
entities;
further,
it
should
include
members
representing
a
broad range of community and business interests; and
Whereas, among other things this
working group should convene:

The City Record
1. To acquire and study current
and credible data and information
on the issues of peak oil and natural gas production and the related
economic and other societal consequences;
2. To seek community and business input on the impacts and proposed solutions;
3. To develop recommendations to
City Council in this calendar year
on strategies the City and its
Departments can take to mitigate
the impacts of declining energy supplies in areas including, but not limited to: transportation, business and
home energy use, water, food security, health care, communications,
land use planning, and wastewater
treatment; and
4. To propose methods of educating the public about this issue in
order to create positive behavior
change among businesses and residents that reduce dependence on fossil fuels.
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council calls

By Council Member Conwell.
An emergency resolution urging
the U.S. Congress to implement an
agricultural program that would
double food production in the United States and pay our farmers parity prices to carry this out, in order
to feed U.S. citizens and initiate a
program to help feed people in other
parts of the world.
Whereas, according to the Untied
Nations Food and Agricultural Organization, the world is now undergoing a food and fuel crisis of unparalleled proportions; and
Whereas, the managing Director
of the Asian Development Bank,
recently stated that one billion
Asians are a serious risk of starvation; and
Whereas, thirty-three nations that
are dependant on food imports,
including Somalia, Egypt, Niger and
others, are now engulfed in riots
and political turmoil because there
is less food imported to those
nations; and
Whereas, the policy of Free Trade,
as promoted by the World Trade
Organization, NAFTA, CAFTA and
other institutions, is responsible for
many nations, including the United
States, losing their ability to feed
their populations; and
Whereas, the conversions of much
acreage worldwide from corn and
food production to biofuels has
exacerbated this crisis, prompting
Jean Ziegler, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, to
indict the use of food for fuels as a
“crime against humanity”; and

57
Whereas, the world is now in the
grip of a hyperinflationary price spiral in food commodities and fuel,
which is disrupting the daily lives
of people throughout our nation and
cities; and
Whereas, in 1963, President John
F. Kennedy called upon the government of the United States to continue the good neighbor policy of President Franklin Roosevelt and launch
a Food for Peace program to help
starving nations around the world;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the U.S. Congress to implement an
agricultural program that would
double food production in the United States and pay our farmers parity prices to carry this out, in order

Health Act.
Whereas, U.S. Senator George Voinovich has introduced Senate Bill 2844,
which reauthorizes a strengthened
Beaches Environmental Assessment
and Coastal Health (BEACH) Act;
and
Whereas, the legislation increases
grants to states, including Ohio, for
development and implementation of
programs focused on remediation of
contamination sources; and
Whereas, Senate Bill 2844 also requires stronger beach water quality
testing and public notification standards so beachgoers are better
informed about the safety of their
beaches; and
Whereas, Senator Voinovich has
stated that “the Great Lakes are our
nation’s north coast and millions of
Americans
enjoy
their
beaches
every year”; and
Whereas, Senator Voinovich has
called this bill “a vital piece of a
comprehensive strategy that is absolutely necessary to save one of

58
our nation’s greatest natural resources”; and
Whereas, Senate Bill 2844 will help
beaches remain healthy and safe
and will protect them from the
harmful effects of pollution and
sewage contamination after flooding
or heavy rainfall; and
Whereas, this bill recognizes that
the Great Lakes have been receiving an inequitable amount of grant
funding due to the length of the
beach season; and
Whereas, this bill should provide
more flexibility to states to use
BEACH Act grants to investigate
and remediate contamination sources;
and
Whereas, this bill will required
the Environmental Protection Agency
to work with states to ensure they
use the latest science to sample and
test beach waters to protect the public’s health; the law also sets up
comprehensive monitoring and notification programs in order to provide up-to-date information on the
condition of all public beaches; and
Whereas, the bill doubles the
authorized grant funding to states
from $30 million to $60 million; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,

for Ord. No. 1112-07).
By Council Member Brady.
An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting
new Section 3103.091, relating to utility shut-off in vacant and unsafe
structures; and to amend Sections

recovery
and
penalty.
Whereas, this Council finds that
there has been a significant increase in vacant and unsafe properties in the City which are often the

The City Record
target of vandalism, theft and other
damage to property and is a public
nuisance. The nuisance is compounded when gas, electrical and
water service is left on due to the
danger from potential gas leaks,
accidental fire, and floods; and
Whereas, vacant and unsafe structures in which utility services have
not been disconnected are a safety
hazard that creates a serious risk of
harm to persons and property; and.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
supplemented by enacting new Section 3103.091 to read as follows:
Section 3103.091
Utility Shut-Off
in Vacant and Unsafe Structures
(a) Any structure determined by
the Director of Building and Housing to be vacant and unsafe as
defined in Section 3103.09 and for
which utility service, including gas,
electric and water, or other utility
as identified by the Director of
Building and Housing, has not been
shut-off poses an immediate risk of
harm from explosion, fire, or flooding and is therefore declared to be
a nuisance which shall be abated by
shut-off of all utility service.
(b) When notified by the Director
or his designee, no Utility shall fail
to shut-off its service to any vacant
and unsafe structure within forty
(40) business days of receipt of
written
notice.
Notice
shall
be
served on the Utility by certified
mail. It shall be the responsibility
of the Utility to designate a person
to receive the notice provided for in
this section. Beginning June 1, 2008,
and as often as necessary to ensure
that the City has current information, the Utility shall provide to the
Director the name, address and telephone number of the person designated to receive City notices.
(c) For purposes of this section:
(1) “Utility” means any company,
in the business of providing electrical, water, gas, telephone, cable, or
other utility service to a building or
structure.
(2) “Vacant” means that no person
actually and legally resides in any
part of the structure or that no person conducts a lawful business in
any part of the structure.
(3) “Shut-off” means to stop the
flow of gas, electricity, water or
other utility service from entering
the premises.
(d) In the event of any actual or
threatened violation of this chapter
or an emergency situation, the
Director of Law, in addition to other
remedies provided by law, may institute proper suit in equity or at law
to prevent or terminate such violation or remedy such situation.
(e) The Director shall promulgate
rules and regulations to enforce this
section.
Section 2. That Sections 3103.09
and 3103.99, as amended by Ordinance No. 903-06, passed May 22, 2006
and Ordinance No. 899-06, passed
August 9, 2006, are amended to read
as follows:

1176

June 11, 2008
Section 3103.09 Unsafe Structures
and Exterior Property Nuisances;
Violations and Remedial Notices;
Cost Recovery
(a) Legislative Findings.
Council of the City of Cleveland
finds that:
(1) Structures that are vacant and
open to entry at doors, windows or
other points accessible to the general public:
A. Attract children to enter;
B. Become harborage for vermin;
C. Serve as temporary abode for
derelicts, vagrants and criminals;
and
D. Are likely to be damaged by
vandals or set ablaze by arsonists.
(2) Unkept grounds surrounding
vacant, open structures invite the
dumping of garbage and rubbish;
(3) Thousands of structures in
this City are made of wood-frame
construction
that
is
more
combustible than other building types;
(4) Thousands of structures in
this City are situated on narrow lots
and in close proximity to one another, increasing the risk of conflagration and spread of insect and rodent
infestation;
(5) Population loss and economic
decline experienced by the City in
recent years has caused the incidence of vacant, open structures,
high grass, weeds, junk, debris, and
junk motor vehicles to increase significantly;
(6) Vacant, open structures often
become dilapidated because they are
not repaired by the owners or persons in control of the structures;
(7) Structures that are vacant and
open to entry, high grass, weeds,
junk, debris, and junk motor vehicles depress the market value of
surrounding properties;
(8) Vacant and unsafe structures
in which utility services have not
been shut-off create a serious risk
of explosion, accidental fire and
flood.
(9) The existence of certain hazardous conditions may require a
structure to be vacated; these conditions include but are not limited
to:
A. Danger of structural collapse;
B. Inadequate heat or use of dangerous heating mechanism;
C. Danger of fire; and
D. Lack of plumbing in safe working order.
(10) Structures that remain boarded for an extended period of time
contribute to blight, cause a decrease in neighboring property values, create targets for arson, and
lead to the cancellation of homeowners’ insurance for neighboring
property owners.
(11) The following conditions
provide
harborage
and
breeding
grounds for pests or otherwise create human-health problems:
A. Grass over 8 inches in height.
B. Noxious weeds including Russian, Canadian, or common thistle;
wild lettuce; wild mustard; wild
parsley; ragweed; milk weed; iron
weed; wild plants that can cause
skin reaction upon contact or produce or aggravate hay fever, asthma, allergic respiratory reaction, or
similar conditions; and all other noxious weeds.
C. Refuse, including but not limited to, trash, junk, garbage and

June 11, 2008
food waste, offal, animal wastes,
tires, and all other waste materials.
D. Stagnant surface water.
(12) As used in this Chapter
“junk” motor vehicle means a motor
vehicle that meets all of the following criteria:
A. Three model years’ old or older;
B. Apparently inoperable; and
C. Extensively damaged, including, but not limited to, any of the
following: missing wheels, tires,
engine, motor, or transmission. (R.C.
§505.173)
(b) Declaration of Nuisance.
(1) All buildings or structures
that are injurious to or a menace to
the public health, safety or welfare,
or are structurally unsafe, unsanitary or not provided with adequate
safe egress, or constitute a fire hazard, or are vacant and open to public entry, or are otherwise dangerous to human life or injurious to the
public, or in relation to existing use
constitute a hazard to the public
health, safety or welfare by reason
of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence or abandonment, are, severally, for the purposes of this Building Code, declared to
be “unsafe structures.” All unsafe
structures or conditions are declared
to be public nuisances. The public
nuisance shall be abated by correction of the violations to the minimum standards of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
applicable City rules and regulations, the Revised Code, and Ohio
Administrative Code, including the
Ohio Building Code, or by demolition.
(2) The condition described under
division (a) (8) of this section is
declared to be a nuisance because of
the risk of harm from explosion,
accidental fire or flooding and shall
be abated by shut-off of the services.
(3) The conditions listed in division (a) (11) of this section are
declared to be nuisances that shall
be removed, destroyed, or abated
from any property on which they
are found.
(4)
Junk
motor
vehicles
as
defined in division (a) (12) of this
section are declared to be nuisances
that shall be removed or abated
from any property on which they
are found. Junk motor vehicles are
declared to be a nuisance because:
A. They harbor rodents, vermin,
and other pests;
B. They contain toxic substances
and flammable liquids and fumes;
C. They attract children to enter;
D. They serve as temporary abode
for derelicts, vagrants and criminals;
E. They diminish neighboring
property values; and
F. They are likely to be damaged
by vandals or set ablaze by arsonists.
(c) Effective Boarding Pending
Rehabilitation.
(1) Permits. Pending the correction of the violations to the minimum standards of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
applicable City rules and regulations, the Revised Code, and the
Ohio Administrative Code, including
the Ohio Building Code, the owner
of a structure may secure the structure through effective boarding. In

The City Record
order to effectively board the structure, the owner of the structure
shall apply, within 3 days of receiving a notice of violation, to the
Department of Building and Housing for a permit to board. The
Department of Building and Housing shall review the condition of the
structure, determine if it can be
effectively boarded, and grant or
deny the owner’s permit to board,
setting forth special requirements, if
any, necessary for compliance with
minimum standards for effective
boarding. The owner shall effectively board the structure within 3
days of the issuance of a boarding
permit, or within any other time
limit that the Director deems appropriate. Structures that are boarded
without first obtaining a boarding
permit or structures that do not comply with the boarding permit shall
continue to be considered public nuisances subject to demolition. Within
thirty (30) days of the issuance of
a permit to board, the owner of the
structure shall apply for a rehabilitation permit under Section 3105.06
of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976. The Director may
grant an extension of time for
acquiring a rehabilitation permit on
the owner's written request and for
good cause shown. Failure of the
owner to obtain a rehabilitation permit after effective boarding will
result in the structure being deemed
a public nuisance, and scheduled for
demolition.
(2) Materials. The effective boarding of a structure shall include, but
not be limited to, doors, windows, or
other areas of the structure open to
ingress and egress and to weather
elements at any and all levels of the
structure. The openings shall be
secured by plywood, not less than
1/2" thick, or other material of
equal strength, cut and fit into the
openings. Openings in excess of
forty-eight inches wide shall be
framed with 2" x 4" lumber and
plywood, or equivalent material fastened twenty-four inches on center
onto frame. The plywood or equivalent material shall be fastened into
the openings by screw type nails or
lag screws.
(3) Maintenance. Upon effectively
boarding the structure, the owner
shall monitor and maintain the
structure
and
its
surrounding
premises in a safe, sanitary and
secured condition. Any portion of
the exterior structure that is deemed
to be potentially hazardous due to
deteriorated conditions, or to be
structurally
unsound,
shall
be
removed or treated in a manner so
as to eliminate the hazard. The exterior premises shall be maintained
free of high weeds, debris, junk
vehicles, and conditions that may
provide harborage for rodents. Failure of the owner to properly maintain the building in the above condition, will result in the structure
being deemed a public nuisance, and
scheduled for demolition.
(4) Rehabilitation. Rehabilitation
of the structure shall begin within
30 days of receiving a rehabilitation
permit under Section 3105.06 of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976 unless the time period is
extended with permission from the
Director. If rehabilitation of the

1177

59
effectively boarded structure does
not begin within this time period, or
if the rehabilitation permit is otherwise invalidated or revoked, then
the Director may declare that the
nuisance has not been abated and
schedule the structure for demolition.
(d) Examination and Condemnation.
(1) The Director is authorized to
examine or cause to be examined
every building or other structure
reported to be unsafe or damaged or
injurious to or a menace to the public, and shall make a written record
of the examination.
(2) The Director may designate as
a public nuisance those particular
structures or conditions found to be
unsafe under division (b) of this
section.
(3) The Director may also declare
that a nuisance structure which, due
to its advanced state of dilapidation,
substantial fire damage or structural infirmity, is an immediate hazard
to human life or health, may only
be abated by immediate repair and
rehabilitation to the minimum standards of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, applicable
City rules and regulations, the
Revised Code, and Ohio Administrative Code, including the Ohio Building Code, or by demolition.
(4) Whenever the Director finds a
vacant structure open to entry at
doors, windows or other points
accessible to the general public, he
may cause the structure to be
secured at those points of entry. The
Director shall be authorized at any
time to enter the premises to secure
the structure in order to lessen the
severity of the public nuisance. In
securing the structure, the Director
may call any department, division or
bureau of the City for whatever
assistance may be necessary, or
may, by private contract, secure
such structure and may notify Utilities to shut-off service to the property under Section 3103.091. This
securing shall not be deemed to constitute “effective boarding” under
division (b) of this section, and it
does not abate the nuisance condition of an unsafe structure, as
declared under division (d) (2) of
this section, unless so declared in
writing
by
the
Director.
Later
notice, issued under division (e) (1)
below, shall include the fact that
the Director has found it necessary
to take appropriate action to secure
the structure.
(e) Notice of Violation.
(1) Whenever the Director finds a
building, structure or a portion of
those to be unsafe and determines it
or the property on which it is located to be a public nuisance as
defined in this Chapter, he shall forward by certified mail to the owner,
agent or person in control of the
building, structure or portion and to
any mortgagee of record a written
notice
of
violation
stating
the
defects in the building or structure.
The notice of violation shall require
the owner within a stated time to
abate the nuisance condition of the
building or structure by correction
of the violations and defects to the
minimum standards of the Codified
Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
applicable City rules and regula-

60
tions, the Revised Code, and Ohio
Administrative Code, including the
Ohio Building Code, or by demolition and removal of the building,
structure, or a portion of those. The
notice also shall state that if the
nuisance is not abated within the
required time that the Director may
take appropriate action to repair,
remove, or otherwise abate the public nuisance and that the owner,
agent or person in control shall be
responsible for the costs. The handing of the violation notice to the
owner, agent or person in control of
the building, structure or a portion
of those shall be deemed actual
notice and is legal and valid service
and no other form of service is necessary.
(2) If the person to whom the
notice and order is addressed is not
found after a reasonable and diligent search, then the notice and
order shall be sent by certified mail
to his tax mailing address, if available, as indicated on the County tax
duplicate, and a copy of the notice
shall be posted in a conspicuous
place on the premises to which it
relates. The mailing and posting
shall be deemed legal service of the
notice.
(3) An owner, agent or person in
control of the structure or building,
a mortgagee of record, or a lien
holder of record who has received a
notice of violation or a notice to
make corrections to the minimum
standards of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
applicable City rules and regulations, the Revised Code, and Ohio
Administrative Code, including the
Ohio Building Code, or to demolish
and remove, as provided for in this
section, shall inform prospective
purchasers,
vendees,
grantees,
assignees, lessees, or land contractees of the notice of violation or
the notice to make corrections, or to
demolish and remove. No person
shall transfer to a vendee, grantee,
assignee, lessee, land contractee or
any other transferee any interest in
a building, structure or a portion of
those after receiving a notice of violation to make corrections, or to
demolish and remove the same,
without first providing the transferee with a copy of the notice.
(4) A. No person, agent, firm or
corporation shall sell, by land contract or otherwise, any interest in
any structure or building without
furnishing the buyer, prior to the
sale a copy of any outstanding
notice or order from the City, including any notice of violation or any
outstanding notice to make corrections to the minimum standards of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio 1976, applicable City rules
and regulations, the Revised Code,
including the Ohio Building Code, or
any outstanding notice to demolish
and remove.
No buyer or grantee, by land contract or otherwise, shall obtain any
interest in any structure or building
without obtaining from the seller,
prior
to
sale,
the
documents
described above.
B. No person, agent, firm or corporation acting in the capacity of an
escrow agent in any real estate
transaction involving the sale of a
structure or building situated in the

The City Record
City,
shall
disburse
any
funds
unless the provisions of this division
have been met.
C. Any buyer or grantee, by land
contract or otherwise, of a structure
or building, shall begin at the date
of transfer to comply with any
notice or order obtained or to be
obtained under this division and,
within ten days of the date of transfer, shall notify the Director, in writing, of the actions that will be taken
to comply. The Director may then
establish a reasonable time to comply.
(f) Vacating Buildings and Prohibiting Use. The Director may also
require in the notice issued under
division (e) (1) of this section that
the building, structure or a portion
of those be vacated, not be reoccupied, or used until the specified
repairs and improvements are completed, inspected, and approved by
the Director. The Director may
cause to be posted at each entrance
to the building or structure a notice
as follows: “THIS STRUCTURE IS
IN A DANGEROUS CONDITION AND
HAS BEEN CONDEMNED AND ITS
USE HAS BEEN PROHIBITED BY
THE DIRECTOR OF BUILDING
AND HOUSING.” The notice shall
remain posted until the required corrections are made or demolition is
completed. No person shall remove
the notice without written permission of the Director, nor shall any
person use or enter the building or
structure except for the purpose of
making the required corrections or
demolishing or effectively boarding
the building or structure, or securing the structure under division (d)
(4) of this section.
(g) Right to Appeal. The owner,
agent or person in control shall
have a right to appeal from the
notice and decision of the Director
as provided in this section and
appear before the Board of Building
Standards and Building Appeals at
a specified time and place to show
cause why he should not comply

June 11, 2008
(3) Rehabilitation Permits Not
Bar To Director's Action To Abate.
The securing of rehabilitation permits for the building or structure
shall not in and of itself bar the
Director from taking action to abate
the nuisance.
(4) Effective Boarding by Director. The Director may, with respect
to any condemned structure, also
take appropriate action to effectively board the structure, or to secure
it under division (d) (4) of this section. The Director shall specifically
state in writing his findings with
respect to the structure, and shall
determine whether to secure or to
effectively board, based on factors
which may include the following:
the distance of the structure from
neighboring structures, the type of
structure, the extent to which the
structure is secured, the likelihood
of vandalism or arson, the extent of
the deterioration, the economic likelihood of eventual rehabilitation of
the structure, or cost of securing or
effectively boarding the structure.
(5)
Failure
To
Comply
with
Notice. In case the owner, agent or
person in control fails, neglects or

repair or rehabilitate, or to demolish
and remove a public nuisance or
unsafe building, structure or a portion of those, or to remove or abate
any other condition that is defined
as a nuisance under this Chapter,
the Director may take appropriate
action to take repair or maintenance
measures or cause Utility services to
be shut-off under Section 3103.091 or
to otherwise abate the public nuisance. The Director shall specifically state in writing the findings with
respect to the structure, and shall
determine whether to perform repair
or maintenance based on factors
which may include the following:
the distance of the structure from
neighboring structures, the type of
structure, the extent of deterioration, the likelihood of vandalism or
arson, the economic likelihood of
eventual complete rehabilitation of
the structure, the cost of repair or
maintenance.
(6) Notice of Intent To Demolish.
Except as provided in division (1)
of this section, the Director shall
give written notice informing the
owner, agent, or person in control,
mortgagee of record and lien holders of record of the City’s intention
to demolish and remove the unsafe
building or structure at least 30
days before the intended action by
the City. The notice may be effective concurrently with the violation
notice. A condemned structure, once
effectively boarded by the owner
pending rehabilitation that later
becomes open to entry, may then be
demolished and removed, subject to
the Director giving written notice as
stated in divisions (e) (1) and (h)
of this section, upon a finding by
the Director that the structure can
no longer be effectively boarded.
(i) Junk Motor Vehicle Removal.

of the date of mailing and posting
of the notice as set forth above.
(j) Cases of Emergency. In cases
of emergency that, in the opinion of
the Director, involve immediate danger to human life or health, the
Director shall promptly cause the
building, structure or a portion of
those to be made safe or removed.
For this purpose he may at once
enter the structure or land on which
it stands, or any abutting land or
structure, with assistance and at the
cost as he deems necessary. He may
request the Director of Public Safety to enforce the orders he gives
that are necessary to cause the
building, structure or a portion of
those to be made safe or removed.
The Director of Public Safety has
the authority to enforce the orders.
He may order adjacent structures
and premises to be vacated, and protect the public by an appropriate
fence or other means as may be necessary, and for this purpose may
close a public or private way.

(1) Any and all expenses or costs
incurred under this section for the
removal, repair, alteration, securing

governmental entity or political subdivision and are funded by federal
money. In the case of a junk motor
vehicle, any and all expenses or
costs incurred under this section to
remove the vehicle shall be paid by
the person having the right of possession of the premises where the
vehicle is located.

made after the compliance date stated on a Notice of Violation of the
Building Code, the Housing Code, or
the Zoning Code or after a compliance date determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to determine
whether the violation has been
remedied and the violation has not
been remedied, or an additional permit is obtained for work previously
permitted and the original permit
has expired or was appropriately
voided, a fee of $100.00 shall be
charged for each inspection, except
that this fee shall not apply to onefamily and two-family owner-occupied dwelling structures.
(3) If within 30 days from the
date the Director of Building and
Housing
sends
a
statement
of
charges and costs incurred, the
owner fails to pay for the costs of
removal, repair, alteration, securing

The City Record
or boarding or of inspections of violations that have not been remedied,
or the person having possession
fails to pay for the cost of removing a junk vehicle, the Director may
certify the amount to the Commissioner of Assessments and Licenses,

The Commissioner of Assessments
and Licenses may make written
return to the County Auditor of the
action under this section with a
statement of the charges for services, the amount paid for the performing of labor and a proper
description of the premises. Certification to the County Auditor is for
