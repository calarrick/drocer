ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 126-08.
By Council Members Coats, Pierce
Scott, Zone, Brady, Santiago, Cleveland, Brancatelli, Keane, Conwell,
Westbrook, Cimperman and Cummins.
An emergency resolution supporting pending HB 333 that seeks a
36% APR rate cap on payday and
other small loans.
Whereas, in Ohio, the number of
lender locations jumped from 107 in
1996 to 1562 10 years later; and
Whereas, in Ohio payday lenders
are unregulated, ie. exempted from
Ohio’s usury cap; last year these
payday
lenders,
charging
391%
APR, took $318 million in interest
and fees from Ohio’s communities;
and
Whereas, at least 10 million households get payday loans over the
course of a year, with the borrowers being mostly minority, female
and in the military; and
Whereas, there seems to be a correlation between not having the
means to pay your mortgage and
payday loan borrowing; and
Whereas, the current mortgage
and
foreclosure
crisis
in
Ohio
demonstrates to this Council that
giving loans to people who cannot
afford to pay them back not only
harms the borrowers but also has
consequences for entire communities; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the

The City Record
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports pending HB 333 that
seeks a 36% APR rate cap on payday and other small loans.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
Governor Strickland and all members the Ohio legislature.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted January 28, 2008.
Effective January 30, 2008.

Res. No. 128-08.
By Council Members Brancatelli,
Westbrook, Pierce Scott, Cimperman
and Cummins.
An emergency resolution urging
the U.S. Congress to support an economic stimulus bill with adequate
funding to include funding for demolition to those communities which
have been severely impacted by large
numbers of foreclosures in their
communities which have resulted in
permanent abandonment.
Whereas, the U. S. Congress is
now considering a comprehensive
economic stimulus bill; and
Whereas, part of the need for a
national economic stimulus bill is
based on the financial impact of the
foreclosure crisis and the slow down
of the housing market; and
Whereas, the large number of
foreclosed homes is resulting in
both the slow down of the housing
market and the decrease of market
value
of
those
occupied
homes
which are adjacent or near vacant
foreclosed properties; and
Whereas, in many communities
like Cleveland many of the vacant
foreclosed homes should be demolished; and
Whereas, vacant foreclosed properties often become a breeding
ground for crime and fires, and
require a disproportionate amount of
government maintenance, from securing
properties
against
criminal
activity to removal of garbage and
rodents to demolition, all at a cost
to taxpayers; and
Whereas, vacant properties reduce
city tax revenue in three ways: they
are often tax delinquent; their low
value means they generate little in
taxes; and they depress property
values across an entire neighborhood; and
Whereas, the citizens who live in
neighborhoods with many vacant
and abandoned properties have great
difficulty obtaining homeowner’s insurance, mortgages and loans for
home improvements; and
Whereas, vacant properties degrade and devalue the quality of
life for remaining residents, isolat-

213

27
ing and weakening the neighborhood, and increasing the likelihood
that property values will continue to
decline and further abandonment
will set in; and
Whereas, the foreclosure crisis is
due in part to lax regulation of
mortgage lending and predatory actions of certain lenders, it is incumbent that the Federal government
assist local government with the additional funding to reduce the impacts of vacant properties and provide local government the ability to
demolish large inventories of vacant
housing; and
Whereas, the vacant housing problem is growing, especially in vulnerable communities which have
been highly impacted by mortgage
foreclosures and weak housing markets; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
believes significant appropriations
for demolition should be included in
the economic stimulus bill; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
needs a minimum of $20,000,000, out
of such economic stimulus funding
for demolition; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the U.S. Congress to support an economic stimulus bill with
adequate funding to include funding for demolition to those communities which have been severely
impacted by large numbers of foreclosures
in
their
communities
which have resulted in permanent
abandonment.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Sherrod
Brown, U.S. Senate, George Voinovich, U.S. Senate, Ted Strickland,
Governor of the State of Ohio, Frank
G. Jackson, Mayor, City of Cleveland,
James
Rokakis,
Cuyahoga
County Treasurer.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Whereas, a congressional study
found 15,000 children in juvenile
