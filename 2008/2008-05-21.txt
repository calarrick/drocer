An emergency resolution declaring
that the Clean Ohio Fund improves
the quality of life for Ohioans, supporting a renewal of the Clean Ohio
Fund bond package and encouraging Ohio voters to support the
renewal.
Whereas, the Clean Ohio Fund
was established to preserve green
space and farmland, improve outdoor
recreation,
and
revitalize
blighted neighborhoods by cleaning
up and redeveloping polluted properties; and
Whereas, Governor Ted Strickland
proposed renewing the Clean Ohio
Fund through a bi-partisan job stimulus package and this issue is
expected to appear on the November
2008 ballot; and
Whereas, a $400 million renewal
of the Clean Ohio Fund will meet
the growing demand for green space
conservation
projects,
brownfield
revitalization, recreational trail development, and farmland preservation; and
Whereas, the citizens of Ohio approved a $400 million Clean Ohio
bond package in 2000; and
Whereas, this Clean Ohio package
funded four competitive programs:
the Clean Ohio Green Space Conservation Program, the Clean Ohio
Agricultural
Easement
Purchase
Program, the Clean Ohio Trails
Fund, and the Clean Ohio Revitalization Fund; and
Whereas, these programs are valuable to the environment, economy,
and quality of life for the Cleveland
region; and
Whereas, to date, the Clean Ohio
Fund has funded over 700 projects
preserving more than 26,000 acres of
natural areas and 16,000 acres of
family farms, created more than 216
miles of recreational trails, and

Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Mayor of the
City of Cleveland and this Council
declare that the Clean Ohio Fund
improves the quality of life for
Ohioans
by
preserving
natural
areas
and
farmland,
protecting
streams, creating outdoor recreation opportunities, and revitalizing urban areas by returning contaminated properties to productive
use.
Section 2. That the Mayor of the
City of Cleveland and this Council
support a renewal of the Clean Ohio
Fund bond package and encourage
Ohio voters to support the renewal.

Res. No. 777-08.
By Council Members Westbrook,
Brancatelli and Cummins.
An emergency resolution congratulating the U.S. House of Representatives for the passage of H.R. 5818
and urging the U.S. Senate to support the passage of H.R 5818, cited
as the Neighborhood Stabilization
Act of 2008, which will authorize the
Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development
to
make
loans
to
States to acquire foreclosed housing
and to make grants to States for
related costs.
Whereas, vacant foreclosed properties often become a breeding
ground for crime and fires, and
require a disproportionate amount
of government maintenance, from
securing properties against criminal
activity to removal of garbage and
rodents to demolition, all at a cost
to taxpayers; and
Whereas, vacant properties reduce
city tax revenue in three ways: they
are often tax delinquent; their low
value means they generate little in
taxes; and they depress property
values across an entire neighborhood; and
Whereas, the citizens who live in
neighborhoods with many vacant
and
abandoned
properties
have
great difficulty obtaining homeowner’s insurance, mortgages and loans
for home improvements; and
Whereas, vacant properties degrade and devalue the quality of
life for remaining residents, isolating and weakening the neighborhood, and increasing the likelihood
that property values will continue to
decline and further abandonment
will set in; and
Whereas, H.R. 5818 will establish
a loan and grant program administered by the Department of Housing
and Development to help States purchase and rehabilitate owner-vacated foreclosed homes with the goal

24
of stabilizing and occupying them
as soon as possible, either through
resale or rental qualified families:
and
Whereas, H.R. 5818 will distribute
these loans and grants to areas with
the highest foreclosure levels; and
Whereas, H.R. 5818 will provide
incentives for States to use funds to
stabilize as many properties as possible; and
Whereas, H.R. 5818 will provide
housing for low- and moderateincome families, especially those
that have lost homes to foreclosure;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council congratulates the U.S. House of Representatives for the passage of H.R.
5818 and urges the U.S. Senate to
support the passage of H.R 5818,
cited as the Neighborhood Stabilization Act of 2008, which will authorize the Secretary of Housing and
Urban Development to make loans
to States to acquire foreclosed housing and to make grants to States for
related costs.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to George
W. Bush, President of the United
States, Nancy Pelosi, Speaker, U.S.
House of Representatives, Harry
Reid, Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,
George Voinovich, U.S. Senator from
Ohio, Sherrod Brown, U.S. Senator
from Ohio, Dennis Kucinich, Congressman, Ted Strickland, the Governor of the State of Ohio, and
James Rokakis, Cuyahoga County
Treasurer.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted May 12, 2008.
Effective May 15, 2008.

constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the

respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based on
other legal grounds as set forth in

Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to

Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
