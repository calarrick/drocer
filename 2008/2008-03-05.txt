Res. No. 298-08.
By Council Members Sweeney and
Zone.
An emergency resolution supporting the American Municipal Power
Generating Station (“AMPGS”) project based on thorough review of all
documentation, independent evaluation, testimony from consultants and
comments from community stakeholders; and resolving continued
support to Cleveland Public Power
in its effort to become one of the
most progressively operated public
utilities in the nation.
Whereas, this Council has considered the proposed participation by
Cleveland Public Power (“CPP”) in
the American Municipal Power Generating Station (“AMPGS”), to be
constructed in Meigs County, Ohio
by American Municipal Power —
Ohio (“AMP-Ohio”); and
Whereas, this project has been
considered by this Council and the
City
Administration
through
an
open and transparent public process
that solicited the participation of all
concerned stakeholders, appropriately
considered
the
sustainability

The City Record
interests of the City and CPP, the
need for CPP to continue to offer
competitive electric rates for the
City’s residents and businesses, and
the efforts and commitments of
AMP-Ohio to mitigate the impact of
the AMPGS project and fulfill its
role in environmental stewardship
on behalf of all its members including CPP; and
Whereas, on April 7, 2003, this
Council passed Ordinance No. 37503 authorizing CPP to participate
in a feasibility study by AMP-Ohio
to study the feasibility of constructing a base load generating
plant including studies to determine the optimal strategy for meeting or exceeding all environmental
requirements; and
Whereas, on June 4, 2007, this
Council passed Ordinance No. 484-07
authorizing CPP to participate in a
feasibility study by AMP-Ohio to
study the feasibility of constructing
multiple
hydroelectric
generating
plants on the Ohio River to add
renewable
energy
resources
for
AMP-Ohio’s members, including CPP;
and
Whereas, on June 17, 2007, AMPOhio completed the initial feasibility study of the AMPGS project,
which examined available technologies, fuel availabilities, generating
needs,
anticipated
environmental
regulations, economics, and other
factors; and
Whereas, on November 20, 2006,
this Council passed Ordinance No.
1716-06, authorizing CPP to employ
consultants to study the AMPGS project, as well as the AMP-Ohio hydroelectric project and other generation
projects; and
Whereas, CPP retained the engineering firm of Burns & Roe to
study the AMPGS project and, on
October 16, 2007, Burns & Roe
issued a final report supporting
CPP’s participation in the AMPGS
project; and
Whereas, on January 23, 2006, this
Council passed Ordinance No. 186805 authorizing CPP to retain a consultant to develop a 5-year Strategic
Business Plan to develop a strategic
plan to enhance CPP’s competitiveness, including a review of CPP’s
power supply strategy; and
Whereas, on March 28, 2007, CPP
presented
its
Strategic
Business
Plan to the Public Utilities Committee in a public hearing; and
Whereas, based on the recommendations in the Strategic Business
Plan, CPP developed a power supply
portfolio
diversification
strategy
based on the fuel source of generation, location of generation, environmental impacts, availability and
reliability, transmission access, and
cost; and
Whereas, to implement the recommendations
in
the
Strategic
Business Plan, CPP created internal special project teams in 2007 to
explore alternative and renewable
energy
sources
including
wind
power, landfill gas, pump storage,
and a municipal waste-to-energy
facility; and
Whereas,
the
Public
Utilities
Committee held a series of public

402

March 5, 2008
hearings in 2006 and 2007 (PURPA
I and II) during which the AMPGS
project was discussed, as well as
alternatives to this type of generation; and
Whereas,
the
Public
Utilities
Committee solicited written public
comments, conducted public hearings on November 30, 2006 and May
23, 2007, and conducted a public
workshop on April 18, 2007, addressing standards for Interconnection;
Net Metering; Time-Based Metering
and Communications; and
Whereas, the Public Utilities Committee has initiated review of the
PURPA standards for Fossil Fuel
Generation
Efficiency
and
Fuel
Source Diversity and has conducted
public hearings on November 29,
2007 and January 16, 2008, and a
public workshop on December 6,
2007, addressing these Standards;
and
Whereas, at the Public Utilities
Committee hearing on January 16,
2008, the Commissioner of CPP presented testimony on Fuel Diversity
and the use of coal, Integrated Gasification Combined-Cycle power plant
technology, and carbon storage, in
support for CPP’s participation in
the AMPGS project; and
Whereas, at the PURPA hearing
on December 6, 2007, CPP provided
information on Advanced Energy
Portfolio Standards (“AEPS”) and
the Public Utilities Committee received stakeholder testimony on
Fuel Diversity Standard and Fossil
Fuel Generation Efficiency Standard; and
Whereas, concurrent with Council’s proceedings to consider adopting the Fuel Source Diversity standard,
the
City
announced
the
planned adoption of an Advanced
Energy Portfolio Standard for CPP;
and
Whereas, an Advanced Energy
Portfolio Standard will encourage
development of alternative energy
sources such as cogeneration, distributed generation, and fuel cells,
and renewable energy resources
including waste-to-energy generation, low-impact hydropower, wind
power, biomass, solar power, landfill
gas, solar photovoltaic, and solar
thermal resources; and
Whereas, the City, in its attempt
to take a global lead in relying
more on renewable energy and energy efficiency has begun several initiatives,
projects
and
programs,
including:
• Researching the feasibility of
local wind capacity by conducting a
wind resource assessment;
• Installation of a solar thermal
system on a fire station and continued development of strategies to
install solar thermal energy systems
throughout the City;
• Development of Green building
policies for City funded projects and
municipal capital projects to reduce
the City’s energy consumption and
promote green building in Cleveland;
• Development of an Energy Efficiency & Conservation program for
CPP customers and City residents
helping residents and small busi-

March 5, 2008
nesses reduce their energy bills and
conserve energy;
• Exploring cogeneration opportunities throughout the City at existing district energy facilities and at
CPP’s commercial and industrial
customers; and
Whereas, it is imperative to develop a thorough understanding of
what CPP must do to be competitive
in the future, in an evolving regulatory climate; and
Whereas, the initiatives listed
above, and other initiatives in the
planning stage, will guarantee the
future of public power in Cleveland
and position CPP to advance Cleveland as a city that owns and runs
one of the most progressively operated public utilities in the nation;
and
Whereas, on October 10, 2007 and
October 24, 2007, Council’s Public
Utilities Committee held hearings
exclusively
about
the
proposed
AMPGS project in which the public
was given and took the opportunity
to comment regarding the AMPGS
project; and
Whereas, on October 29, 2007, this
Council passed Ordinance No. 165307, authorizing an agreement with
AMP-Ohio to authorize CPP to participate the AMPGS project; and
Whereas,
the
Public
Utilities
Committee amended Ordinance No.
1653-07 to include a provision requiring that the Director of Public
Utilities appear before the Utilities Committee and provide an
updated feasibility report on the
AMPGS project prior to March 1,
2008; and
Whereas, by this amendment,
Council refused to commit to the
project unless and until it learned
all information necessary to pursue
the best course of action for the
city of Cleveland and its citizens;
and
Whereas, during the public hearings on the AMPGS project, discussion was never limited with
regard to the larger energy or environmental issues; the public, community stakeholders, and representatives from AMP-Ohio and CPP
were provided a forum to address
their
respective
concerns
and
issues; and
Whereas, this Council has reviewed outstanding issues with the
public as well as with AMP-Ohio,
and has received AMP-Ohio’s firm
commitment regarding those issues
of most concern to Cleveland City
Council; and
Whereas, the AMP-Ohio Board has
agreed, by Resolution No. 08-02-2552,
to shut down the Gorsuch Generating Station contemporaneously with
the commercial operation of the
AMPGS;
Whereas, the City of St. Marys, a
member municipality of AMP-Ohio,
will close its coal-fired generating
plant, which load will be eventually met by the AMP-Ohio Generating
Station; and
Whereas, in recognition that carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are a
significant greenhouse gas leading
to global climate change, AMP-Ohio
anticipates that future regulations

The City Record
on CO2 emissions will be imposed on
coal-fired base load power plants;
and
Whereas, AMP-Ohio has partnered
with FirstEnergy to install a pilot
CO2 capture system at the FirstEnergy R.E. Burger generation station;
and
Whereas, AMP-Ohio has committed, by Resolution No. 08-02-2551, to
using Power Span technology in
the operation of AMPGS and to the
use of “supercritical” boilers, in
order to achieve maximum efficiency; and
Whereas, AMP-Ohio has committed, by Resolution No. 08-02-2550, to
support the City’s environmental initiatives; and
Whereas, as a consequence of closure of the Gorsuch and City of St.
Marys
generating
stations
and
replacement of market purchases
with capacity from the AMPGS, it is
expected that there will be a net
reduction in SO2 emissions of 112,162
tons per year, NOx emissions of
18,219 and particulate matter emissions of 3,626; and
Whereas, on February 7, 2008,
Ohio EPA issued a Final Permit to
Install for the proposed AMPGS; and
Whereas,
development
of
the
AMPGS project will serve to reduce
the overall emissions footprint of
AMP-Ohio and its members; and
Whereas, participation by CPP in
the AMPGS project will lower CPP’s
emissions footprint by replacing its
current supply of power from the
conventional
Gorsuch
Generating
Plant and other regional coal plants
with power from a cleaner source;
and
Whereas,
Council
engaged
an
independent consultant, ION Consulting
(“ION”),
to
provide
an
assessment of the data and reports
relative to the AMPGS project; and
Whereas, at the final hearing on
the project on February 22, 2008,
ION reported the results of their
independent assessment, and AMPOhio and CPP were given a chance
to respond; in addition there was yet
another opportunity for public comment; and
Whereas, ION found, among other
things, the following: the February
2007 Power Supply Plan (“PSP”)
developed a reasonably diversified
portfolio of supply alternatives to
meet CPP’s projected need; the
AMPGS project has been a generally well-managed development project and the expected outcome is an
asset that will provide net economic benefits to its owners; ION’s projections do not significantly differ
from R.W. Beck’s; CPP’s unique
competitive
market
environment
causes it to be vulnerable to the
risks associated with the AMPGS
project; thus, CPP must match its
capacity additions with existing
load requirements in a way that conforms with its risk tolerance; CPP

planning scenario; CPP and the City
have influenced AMP-Ohio to develop the AMPGS in an environmentally conscious and prudent manner;

Whereas, for the reasons set
forth in this Resolution, this Council has determined that CPP’s participation in the AMPGS project
will
promote
the

interests of the City and CPP, the
need for CPP to continue to offer
competitive electric rates for the
City’s residents and businesses,
and the efforts and commitments of
AMP-Ohio to mitigate the impact of
the AMPGS project and fulfill its
role in environmental stewardship
on behalf of all its members including CPP; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

all documentation, independent evaluation, testimony from consultants

peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,

Section 3. Authorization of Series
2008 Bonds. This Council finds and
determines it is necessary and proper and in the best interest of the
City to authorize the issuance of the
Series 2008 Bonds for the purpose of
paying Capital Costs. The Series
2008 Bonds may be issued in one or
more separate series. The principal
amount of each series of Series 2008
Bonds is to be the amount set forth
in the Series 2008 Certificate of
Award authorized in Section 6 and
shall be the amount determined by
the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, to be necessary (i) to pay
Capital Costs, (ii) to fund any
deposit to the Bond Service Reserve
Fund or the Renewal and Replacement
Fund
required

2008 Bonds of each series satisfy the
requirements of this Series 2008
Bond Legislation and the Indenture.
Separate series of Series 2008 Bonds
may be issued at the same or different times. The Series 2008 Bonds
of each series shall be designated as
provided in the applicable Certifi-

412

March 5, 2008
cate of Award (including replacing

Award and a separate Supplemental
Indenture may be delivered for each

Series 2008 Bonds and any required
deposit to the Bond Service Reserve
Fund attributable to the Series 2008
Bonds shall, in each case, be included in the costs funded from the proceeds of the Series 2008 Bonds. The
Series 2008 Bonds shall constitute
Bonds for all purposes of the Indenture.
This Council finds and determines
that the issuance of the Series 2008
Bonds to pay Capital Costs serves a
proper, public, municipal purpose by
preserving and enhancing the efficiency and economy with which
Cleveland Public Power provides
services to its users.
Section 4. Authorization of Hedging
Arrangements.
This
Council
finds that by engaging in interest
rate hedging arrangements from
time to time, the City may reduce
its cost of borrowing by optimizing
the relative amounts of fixed and
variable rate obligations and minimizing the risk of variations in its
debt service costs. Certain types of
hedging arrangements (referred to
in this Series 2008 Bond Legislation
as “swaptions”) may enable the City
to obtain savings prior to the
issuance of Series 2008 Bonds by
providing for an upfront payment to
the City by a financial institution or
other organization that is the counterparty to the hedge arrangement
in consideration of the City’s giving
the counterparty the option to make
effective at a future date an interest rate exchange transaction with
the City. To permit the City to have
the flexibility to undertake interest
rate swap, swaption, rate cap, rate
collar and other hedging transactions from time to time, and to
establish the procedures for approving those transactions, this Council
authorizes the signing and delivery
of one or more agreements (each, a
“Hedge Agreement”) and any related agreements necessary for the
consummation of the transactions
contemplated by each Hedge Agreement. The authorizations in this Section are supplemental to and not in
derogation of any authority provided by any other ordinance of this
Council
concerning
hedging
arrangements, and are all subject to
the requirements and restrictions of
the Indenture.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is to the financial advantage of the City and in the City’s
best
interests
that
a
hedging
arrangement be undertaken by the
City with respect to any Bonds
issued or to be issued under the
Indenture, the Director of Finance
may authorize one or more interest
rate hedge transactions in accordance with the applicable Hedge
Agreement; provided that (a) the
counterparty shall be rated at the
time of signing the Hedge Agreement not lower than A+ or A1 by
at least one rating agency or its
obligations under the Hedge Agreement shall be guaranteed or insured

March 5, 2008
by an entity rated at the time of
signing the Hedge Agreement not
lower than A+ or A1 by at least one
rating agency, and (b) the term of
each hedge transaction shall not
exceed the final maturity of the
Bonds to which the hedge relates or
(in the case of an option) will
relate. The requirements of this
paragraph are in addition to, and
not in place or in derogation of, any
other applicable requirements of the
Indenture.
The Director of Finance shall
negotiate the terms of each Hedge
Agreement with a counterparty satisfying the credit criteria in this
Series 2008 Bond Legislation and the
Indenture. The City shall receive a
written opinion of a Financial Advisor that the upfront payment or the
periodic payments, as the case may
be, to be made by the counterparty
to the City, or by the City to the
counterparty, shall be fair value for
the Hedge Agreement, given the
credit of the counterparty and the
terms and conditions of the Hedge
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall determine the terms and conditions of the Hedge Agreement,
including without limitation, the
time or times and procedures for the
exercise by the counterparty or the
City, as the case may be, of its
option under the Hedge Agreement,
whether the obligations of the City
under the Hedge Agreement shall be
secured by a Credit Support Instrument, and the rates to be paid by
the counterparty to the City and by
the City to the counterparty under
the Hedge Agreement in the event
of the exercise of the option. The approval of each interest rate hedge
transaction
by
the
Director
of
Finance shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery
of the applicable Hedge Agreement
by the Director of Finance.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from the Net Revenues and the
Pledged Funds as permitted by the
Indenture, and may be payable also
from other funds permitted by law
to be used for the purpose, as identified by the Director of Finance in
the Hedge Agreement. Those payments may be secured by a pledge
of
the
Net
Revenues
and
the
Pledged Funds to the extent permitted by the Indenture, all as determined by the Director of Finance
and set forth in the Hedge Agreement. The obligation of the City to
make payments under any Hedge
Agreement does not and shall not
represent or constitute a general
obligation, debt, bonded indebtedness or a pledge of the faith and
credit of the City or the State of
Ohio. Nothing gives any party to
any Hedge Agreement the right to
have excises, ad valorem or other
taxes levied by the City or the State
of Ohio for the payment of any
amounts due under any Hedge
Agreement.
Section 5.
Terms of Series 2008
Bonds. The Series 2008 Bonds shall
contain the terms provided in or
determined pursuant to, the Indenture, this Series 2008 Bond Legislation, the Series 2008 Certificate of
Award and the Eighth Supplemental
Indenture. Each series of Series 2008
Bonds may be secured by a separate

The City Record
Supplemental Indenture, or a single
Supplemental Indenture may secure
more than one series of Series 2008
Bonds, and the authorization in this
Series 2008 Bond Legislation for the
Eighth Supplemental Indenture shall
encompass the authorization for
those one or more Supplemental
Indentures, regardless of their designation.
(a) General. In the event that
the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, determines that the City’s
best interests will be served by
causing a series of Series 2008
Bonds to be Variable Rate Bonds,
then the Director of Finance is
authorized to so specify in the
Series 2008 Certificate of Award. If
the Director of Finance so determines, then the method and procedure by which the variable rate of
interest to be borne by the Series
2008 Bonds of that series shall be
determined
as
provided
in
the
Eighth
Supplemental
Indenture,
whether by auction, by reference to
a market index, by a remarketing
agent or otherwise, provided that no
series of variable rate Series 2008
Bonds shall bear interest at a rate
in excess of twenty-five percent
(25%) per year (including any
Series 2008 Bonds held by a provider
of a Credit Support Instrument). The
Director of Finance may determine
that the terms of a variable rate
series of Series 2008 Bonds may or
may not permit the holders to tender their variable rate Series 2008
Bonds for purchase by the City. If
the Director of Finance designates
any series of Series 2008 Bonds as
Variable Rate Bonds, and if the
Holders of that series of Series 2008
Bonds are to be entitled to tender
those Series 2008 Bonds for purchase, then the Director of Finance
shall also designate for those variable rate Series 2008 Bonds (and
may designate others, from time to
time, in substitution therefor) the
tender agent or agents and the
remarketing agent or agents, which
designations shall be based on the
determination of the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed
to provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable. The Director of Finance is authorized to enter
into agreements in connection with
the delivery of the Series 2008
Bonds, and from time to time thereafter so long as the Series 2008
Bonds
are
outstanding,
with
providers of Credit Support Instruments, tender agents (which may be
the Trustee), remarketing agents
(which may be any of the Original
Purchasers) and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the method of
determining the variable interest
rates, permitting holders the right
of tender and providing for payment
of the purchase price of, or debt service on, the variable rate Series 2008
Bonds. In the event the variable rate
Series 2008 Bonds are issued as auction rate obligations, the Director of

413

27
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements, from time to time, with
auction agents and others, or to
cause the Trustee to enter into those
agreements, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor that
the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed
to provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of
any series of Series 2008 Bonds, and
regardless of whether that series of
Series 2008 Bonds bears interest at
variable or fixed rates, is authorized
to contract for a Credit Support
Instrument, and to pay the costs of
it from proceeds of the Series 2008
Bonds, if the Director determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the Credit
Support Instrument will result in a
savings in the cost of the financing
to the City.
In the event that the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, determines that the City’s best interests
will be served by causing a series
of Series 2008 Bonds to be Capital
Appreciation Bonds, then the Director of Finance is authorized to so
specify in the Series 2008 Certificate
of Award. If the Director of Finance
so determines, then the authorizations and limitations in this Section
5 and Section 6 shall be interpreted
and applied in a manner that the
Director of Finance determines to be
consistent with the character of Capital Appreciation Bonds.
(b) Form; Exchange and Transfer. All Series 2008 Bonds shall be
issued in fully registered form. The
Series 2008 Bonds initially shall be
delivered only in book-entry form,
shall be registered in the name of
the Depository or its nominee, as
registered owner, and immobilized
in the custody of the Depository,
and shall not be transferable or
exchangeable (except for transfer to
another Depository or its nominee)
without further action by the City
pursuant to the provisions of the
Eighth Supplemental Indenture. No
Series
2008
Bonds
shall
be
exchanged for or transferable into a
coupon Revenue Bond or Bonds
except to the extent that the Indenture permits such exchanges or
transfers.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Series 2008 Bonds of any
series for use in a book entry system, the Director of Finance and the
Trustee may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance and the Trustee do not or
are unable to do so, the Director of
Finance and the Trustee, after making provision for notification of the
beneficial
owners
by
the
then
Depository and any other arrangements deemed necessary, shall permit withdrawal of the Series 2008
Bonds of any series from the Depository, and authenticate and deliver
registered Bond certificates to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense

28
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of action
or inaction of the City, of those persons requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into any agreements
determined by the Director to be
necessary in connection with the
book entry system for the Series
2008 Bonds, after determining that
those agreements will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
under the Indenture (as evidenced
by the Director’s signing of those
agreements).

their aggregate principal amount,
but if any of the Series 2008 Bonds
are to be initially offered to the public at an original Issue discount
(any such original discount being
hereinafter referred to as an “Original Issue Discount”), then the maximum aggregate principal amount of
Series 2008 Bonds hereby authorized
shall be increased over $80,000,000
by an amount equal to the product
from multiplying the Original Issue
Discount at which any Series 2008
Bonds are to be initially offered to
the public by the aggregate principal amount of the Series 2008 Bonds
to be so offered;
(b) the Purchase Price to be paid
to the City by the Original Purchaser, which amount shall be not
less than: (i) 97% of the amount
determined by adding to the aggregate principal amount of the Series
2008 Bonds any aggregate original
issue premium and subtracting from
that amount any aggregate original
issue discount, plus (ii) any accrued
interest on the Series 2008 Bonds
from their date to the date of their

(e) the Specified Interest Rates to
be borne by Series 2008 Bonds bearing interest at a fixed rate, the
weighted average of which shall not
exceed six percent (6%) as to Series
2008 Bonds of any series and the
method by which the interest rate is
to be determined for Series 2008
Bonds bearing interest at variable
rates, consistent with Section 6
(Series 2008 Bonds of the same
series and same maturity may bear
interest at different interest rates);
(f) the title and series designation
for the Series 2008 Bonds;
(g) the amount, if any, of proceeds of the sale of the Series 2008
Bonds to be deposited in the Bond
Service Reserve Fund in order to
cause the balance therein to equal
the Bond Reserve Requirement, if
and to the extent required by the
Eighth Supplemental Indenture, and
any determination as to whether
there shall be a special reserve fund
for the Series 2008 Bonds of any
series, separate from the common

Credit Facility from a Qualified
Credit Facility Provider or any
other instrument in lieu of a funded reserve fund, all as may be permitted by the Indenture;

responsibility for issuance of the
Tax-Exempt Bonds, is hereby authorized (a) to make or effect any election, selection, designation, choice,

any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf
of the City, as may be appropriate
to assure the exclusion of interest

adopted pursuant to Sections 3, 4
and 12 of Article XVIII of the Constitution of the State, and the City’s
Charter.
Section 3. Authorization of Series
2008 Refunding Bonds. This Council
finds and determines it is necessary
and proper and in the best interest
of the City to authorize the issuance
of the Series 2008 Refunding Bonds
for the purpose of refunding one or
more series of the Outstanding
Bonds,
or
designated
maturities
thereof, either (i) to obtain aggregate net present value debt service
savings of not less than three percent (3%), (ii) for the purpose of
restructuring the debt service on
Outstanding Bonds in connection
with the issuance of Bonds authorized under a separate Ordinance as
“Series 2008 Bonds” in a manner that
the Director of Finance determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, to serve the
City’s best interests, or (iii) for the
purpose of refunding outstanding
short-term
or
variable-rate
debt
obligations that the Director of
Finance has determined, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, are subjecting the City to
undesirably high rates of interest or
undesirable fluctuations in rates of
interest that can economically be
avoided or mitigated through refunding. The Series 2008 Refunding
Bonds may be issued in one or more
separate series so long as the aggregate net present value savings
achieved by the one or more series
issued for the purpose described in

The City Record
clause (i) of the preceding sentence
shall be not less than three percent
(3%), and so long as the one or
more series issued for the purpose
described in clause (ii) or (iii) of
the preceding sentence in the aggregate meet the requirements of that
clause (ii) or (iii). The principal
amount of each series of Series 2008
Refunding Bonds is to be the
amount set forth in the Series 2008
Refunding
Certificate
of
Award
authorized in Section 6 and shall be
the amount determined by the Director of Finance, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
necessary (i) to refund the Refunded Bonds, (ii) to fund any deposit
to the Bond Service Reserve Fund
or the Renewal and Replacement
Fund required under the Indenture,
(iv) to pay costs of any Credit Support Instruments, (v) to pay identified amounts owed under any Hedge
Agreements, and (vi) to pay costs
of issuing the Series 2008 Refunding
Bonds and refunding the Refunded
Bonds. The proceeds from the sale
of each series of Series 2008 Refunding
Bonds
shall
be
allocated,
deposited and applied as provided in
Section 7 of this Ordinance.
The Series 2008 Refunding Bonds
may be issued in one or more separate series, each bearing a distinctive designation, provided that the
Series 2008 Refunding Bonds of each
series satisfy the requirements of
this Series 2008 Refunding Bond
Legislation and the Indenture. Separate series of Series 2008 Refunding Bonds may be issued at the
same or different times. The Series
2008 Refunding Bonds of each series
shall be designated as provided in
the applicable Certificate of Award
(including replacing references to
2008 to the calendar year in which
the obligations are issued). A separate Certificate of Award and a separate Supplemental Indenture may
be delivered for each series. Costs
of issuance of the Series 2008
Refunding Bonds and any required
deposit to the Bond Service Reserve
Fund attributable to the Series 2008
Refunding Bonds shall, in each case,
be included in the costs funded from
the proceeds of the Series 2008
Refunding Bonds. The Series 2008
Refunding Bonds shall constitute
Bonds for all purposes of the Indenture.
This Council finds and determines
that the issuance of the Series 2008
Refunding Bonds to obtain debt service savings with respect to Outstanding Bonds serves a proper, public, municipal purpose by reducing
the cost at which Cleveland Public
Power can provide electric power.
Section 4. Authorization of Hedging
Arrangements.
This
Council
finds that by engaging in interest
rate hedging arrangements from
time to time, the City may reduce
its cost of borrowing by optimizing
the relative amounts of fixed and
variable rate obligations and minimizing the risk of variations in its
debt service costs. Certain types of
hedging arrangements (referred to
in this Series 2008 Refunding Bond
Legislation as “swaptions”) may
enable the City to obtain savings
prior to the issuance of Series 2008
Refunding Bonds by providing for
an upfront payment to the City by

418

March 5, 2008
a financial institution or other organization that is the counterparty to
the hedge arrangement in consideration of the City’s giving the counterparty the option to make effective at a future date an interest rate
exchange transaction with the City.
To permit the City to have the flexibility to undertake interest rate
swap, swaption, rate cap, rate collar
and other hedging transactions from
time to time, and to establish the
procedures
for
approving
those
transactions, this Council authorizes
the signing and delivery of one or
more agreements (each, a “Hedge
Agreement”) and any related agreements necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by each Hedge Agreement. The
authorizations in this Section are
supplemental to and not in derogation of any authority provided by
any other ordinance of this Council
concerning
hedging
arrangements,
and are all subject to the requirements and restrictions of the Indenture.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is to the financial advantage of the City and in the City’s
best
interests
that
a
hedging
arrangement be undertaken by the
City with respect to any Bonds
issued or to be issued under the
Indenture, the Director of Finance
may authorize one or more interest
rate hedge transactions in accordance with the applicable Hedge
Agreement; provided that (a) the
counterparty shall be rated at the
time of signing the Hedge Agreement not lower than A+ or A1 by
at least one rating agency or its
obligations under the Hedge Agreement shall be guaranteed or insured
by an entity rated at the time of
signing the Hedge Agreement not
lower than A+ or A1 by at least one
rating agency, and (b) the term of
each hedge transaction shall not
exceed the final maturity of the
Bonds to which the hedge relates or
(in the case of an option) will
relate. The requirements of this
paragraph are in addition to, and
not in place or in derogation of, any
other applicable requirements of the
Indenture.
The Director of Finance shall
negotiate the terms of each Hedge
Agreement with a counterparty satisfying the credit criteria in this
Series 2008 Refunding Bond Legislation and the Indenture. The City
shall receive a written opinion of a
Financial Advisor that the upfront
payment or the periodic payments,
as the case may be, to be made by
the counterparty to the City, or by
the City to the counterparty, shall
be fair value for the Hedge Agreement, given the credit of the counterparty and the terms and conditions of the Hedge Agreement. The
Director of Finance shall determine
the terms and conditions of the
Hedge Agreement, including without limitation, the time or times and
procedures for the exercise by the
counterparty or the City, as the case
may be, of its option under the
Hedge
Agreement,
whether
the
obligations of the City under the
Hedge Agreement shall be secured
by a Credit Support Instrument, and

March 5, 2008
the rates to be paid by the counterparty to the City and by the City to
the counterparty under the Hedge
Agreement in the event of the exercise of the option. The approval of
each interest rate hedge transaction
by the Director of Finance shall be
conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery of the applicable
Hedge Agreement by the Director of
Finance.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from the Net Revenues and the
Pledged Funds as permitted by the
Indenture, and may be payable also
from other funds permitted by law
to be used for the purpose, as identified by the Director of Finance in
the Hedge Agreement. Those payments may be secured by a pledge
of
the
Net
Revenues
and
the
Pledged Funds to the extent permitted by the Indenture, all as determined by the Director of Finance
and set forth in the Hedge Agreement. The obligation of the City to
make payments under any Hedge
Agreement does not and shall not
represent or constitute a general
obligation, debt, bonded indebtedness or a pledge of the faith and
credit of the City or the State of
Ohio. Nothing gives any party to
any Hedge Agreement the right to
have excises, ad valorem or other
taxes levied by the City or the State
of Ohio for the payment of any
amounts due under any Hedge
Agreement.
Section 5.
Terms of Series 2008
Refunding Bonds. The Series 2008
Refunding Bonds shall contain the
terms provided in or determined pursuant to, the Indenture, this Series
2008 Refunding Bond Legislation,
the Series 2008 Refunding Certificate of Award and the Ninth Supplemental Indenture. Each series of
Series 2008 Refunding Bonds may be
secured by a separate Supplemental
Indenture, or a single Supplemental
Indenture may secure more than one
series of Series 2008 Refunding
Bonds, and the authorization in this
Series 2008 Refunding Bond Legislation for the Ninth Supplemental
Indenture
shall
encompass
the
authorization for those one or more
Supplemental Indentures, regardless
of their designation.
(a)
General.
In the event that
the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, determines that the City’s
best interests will be served by
causing a series of Series 2008
Refunding Bonds to be Variable
Rate Bonds, then the Director of
Finance is authorized to so specify
in the Series 2008 Refunding Certificate of Award. If the Director of
Finance so determines, then the
method and procedure by which the
variable rate of interest to be borne
by the Series 2008 Refunding Bonds
of that series shall be determined as
provided in the Ninth Supplemental
Indenture, whether by auction, by
reference to a market index, by a
remarketing agent or otherwise,
provided that no series of variable
rate Series 2008 Refunding Bonds
shall bear interest at a rate in
excess of twenty-five percent (25%)
per year (including any Series 2008
Refunding Bonds held by a provider
of a Credit Support Instrument). The

The City Record
Director of Finance may determine
that the terms of a variable rate
series of Series 2008 Refunding
Bonds may or may not permit the
holders to tender their variable rate
Series 2008 Refunding Bonds for
purchase by the City. If the Director of Finance designates any series
of Series 2008 Refunding Bonds as
Variable Rate Bonds, and if the
Holders of that series of Series 2008
Refunding Bonds are to be entitled
to tender those Series 2008 Refunding Bonds for purchase, then the
Director of Finance shall also designate for those variable rate Series
2008 Refunding Bonds (and may
designate others, from time to time,
in substitution therefor) the tender
agent or agents and the remarketing agent or agents, which designations shall be based on the determination of the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the parties
so designated possess the requisite
resources and experience to provide
the services required of them and
that the terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide
such services are fair and commercially reasonable. The Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements in connection with the
delivery of the Series 2008 Refunding Bonds, and from time to
time thereafter so long as the Series
2008 Refunding Bonds are outstanding, with providers of Credit Support
Instruments, tender agents (which
may be the Trustee), remarketing
agents (which may be any of the
Original Purchasers) and others as
may be determined by the Director
of Finance to be necessary or
appropriate
to
provide
for
the
method of determining the variable
interest rates, permitting holders
the right of tender and providing for
payment of the purchase price of, or
debt service on, the variable rate
Series 2008 Refunding Bonds. In the
event the variable rate Series 2008
Refunding Bonds are issued as auction rate obligations, the Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements, from time to time, with
auction agents and others, or to
cause the Trustee to enter into those
agreements, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor that
the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed
to provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of
any series of Series 2008 Refunding
Bonds, and regardless of whether
that series of Series 2008 Refunding
Bonds bears interest at variable or
fixed rates, is authorized to contract
for a Credit Support Instrument, and
to pay the costs of it from proceeds
of the Series 2008 Refunding Bonds,
if the Director determines, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, that the Credit Support
Instrument will result in a savings
in the cost of the financing to the
City.
In the event that the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, determines that the City’s best interests

419

33
will be served by causing a series
of Series 2008 Refunding Bonds to
be Capital Appreciation Bonds, then
the Director of Finance is authorized to so specify in the Series 2008
Refunding Certificate of Award. If
the Director of Finance so determines, then the authorizations and
limitations in this Section 5 and Section 6 shall be interpreted and
applied in a manner that the Director of Finance determines to be consistent with the character of Capital
Appreciation Bonds.
(b) Form; Exchange and Transfer.
All Series 2008 Refunding
Bonds shall be issued in fully registered
form.
The
Series
2008
Refunding Bonds initially shall be
delivered only in book-entry form,
shall be registered in the name of
the Depository or its nominee, as
registered owner, and immobilized
in the custody of the Depository,
and shall not be transferable or
exchangeable (except for transfer to
another Depository or its nominee)
without further action by the City
pursuant to the provisions of the
Ninth Supplemental Indenture. No
Series 2008 Refunding Bonds shall
be exchanged for or transferable
into a coupon Revenue Bond or
Bonds except to the extent that the
Indenture permits such exchanges
or transfers.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Series 2008 Refunding Bonds
of any series for use in a book entry
system, the Director of Finance and
the Trustee may attempt to establish a securities depository/book
entry
relationship
with
another
qualified Depository. If the Director
of Finance and the Trustee do not
or are unable to do so, the Director
of Finance and the Trustee, after
making provision for notification of
the beneficial owners by the then
Depository and any other arrangements deemed necessary, shall permit withdrawal of the Series 2008
Refunding Bonds of any series from
the Depository, and authenticate
and deliver registered Bond certificates to the assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost
and expense (including any costs of
printing), if the event is not the
result of action or inaction of the
City, of those persons requesting
such issuance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into any agreements
determined by the Director to be
necessary in connection with the
book entry system for the Series
2008 Refunding Bonds, after determining that those agreements will
not endanger the funds or securities
of the City under the Indenture (as
evidenced by the Director’s signing
of those agreements).

for federal income tax purposes
(the “Tax-Exempt Bonds”), the City
covenants that it will use, and will
restrict the use and investment of,
the proceeds of the Tax-Exempt
Bonds in such manner and to such
extent as may be necessary so that
(a) the interest on the Tax-Exempt
Bonds will be excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, and (b) in the case of any
Tax-Exempt Bonds qualifying as
bonds, the interest on which is not
treated as an item of tax preference
under Section 57 of the Code (“NonAMT Bonds”), such Tax-Exempt
Bonds will be treated as Non-AMT
Bonds.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the TaxExempt Bonds to be and to remain
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will
not take or authorize to be taken
any actions that would adversely
affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or
persons acting for it, will, among
other acts of compliance, (i) apply
the proceeds of the Tax-Exempt
Bonds to the governmental purposes
of the borrowing, (ii) restrict the
yield on investment property, (iii)
make timely and adequate payments
to the federal government, (iv)
maintain books and records and
make calculations and reports, and
(v) refrain from certain uses of
those proceeds and, as applicable, of
property financed with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the
extent necessary to assure such
exclusion of that interest under the
Code.
The Director of Finance, or any
other officer of the City having
responsibility for issuance of the
Tax-Exempt Bonds, is hereby authorized (a) to make or effect any election, selection, designation, choice,
consent, approval, or waiver on
behalf of the City with respect to
the Tax-Exempt Bonds as the City
is permitted or required to make or
give under the federal income tax
laws, including, without limitation
thereto, any of the elections provided for in Section 148(f)(4)(C) of the

35
Code or available under Section 148
of the Code, for the purpose of
assuring, enhancing or protecting
the favorable tax treatment or status of the Tax-Exempt Bonds or
interest thereon or assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose,
reducing
the
burden
or
expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or payments
of penalties, or making payments of
special amounts in lieu of making
computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as rebate, or
obviating those amounts or payments, as determined by that officer,
which action shall be in writing and
signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf
of the City, as may be appropriate
to assure the exclusion of interest
from gross income and the intended
tax status of the Tax-Exempt Bonds,
and (c) to give one or more appropriate certificates of the City, for
inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Tax-Exempt Bonds,
setting forth the reasonable expectations of the City regarding the
amount and use of all the proceeds
of the Tax-Exempt Bonds, the facts,
circumstances
and
estimates
on
which they are based, and other
facts and circumstances relevant to
the tax treatment of the interest on
and the tax status of the TaxExempt Bonds.
Each covenant made in this Section 9 with respect to the TaxExempt Bonds is also made with
respect to all issues any portion of
the debt service on which is paid
from proceeds of the Tax-Exempt
Bonds (and, if different, the original
issue and any refunding issues in a
series of refundings), to the extent
such compliance is necessary to
assure exclusion of interest on the
Tax-Exempt
Bonds
from

income for federal income tax purposes, and the officers identified

with respect to those issues as they
are authorized in this Section to
take with respect to the TaxExempt Bonds.

pay
any
expenses relating to the refunding
of the Refunded Bonds and the
issuance of the Refunding Bonds.
The Refunding Bonds may be issued
in one or more separate series, each
bearing a distinctive designation,
provided that the Refunding Bonds
of each series satisfy the requirements of this Ordinance and the
aggregate net present value debt
service savings to the City resulting
from
each
series
of
Refunding
Bonds is not less than three per cent
(3%). Separate series of Refunding
Bonds may be issued at the same or
different
times.
The
Refunding
Bonds of each series shall be designated as provided in the applicable Certificate of Award. A separate
Certificate of Award may be delivered for each series.
Section 2.
Authority and Terms.
The
Refunding
Bonds
shall
be
issued pursuant to the provisions of
Article XVIII of the Constitution of
Ohio, Revised Code Chapter 133 and
other applicable provisions of the
Revised Code, the Charter of the
City, the General Bond Ordinance
and this Ordinance in the principal
amount and for the purpose stated
in Section 1. The Refunding Bonds
of each series shall be issued in one
lot as fully registered bonds in

42
denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof but in no case
as to a particular maturity date
exceeding
the
principal
amount
maturing on that date. The Refunding Bonds shall bear the designation
and be numbered as determined by
the Director of Finance.
The Refunding Bonds shall be
dated the date and shall bear interest at the rate or rates per year
specified
in
the
Certificate
of
Award, provided the weighted average of such rates (taking into
account the principal amount and
maturity of each Refunding Bond to
which a rate applies) shall not
exceed six percent (6%) per year.
Interest on the Refunding Bonds
shall be payable when due, or until
the principal amount is paid, semiannually on the first day of each of
two months specified in the Certificate of Award as the dates on which
interest on the Refunding Bonds
shall be payable (the “Interest Payment Dates”), beginning on the date
specified in the Certificate of Award
as the first Interest Payment Date.
The
Refunding
Bonds
shall
mature in the years and principal
amounts as shall be permitted by
law and determined by the Director
of Finance and specified in the Certificate of Award, based on the written advice of a Financial Advisor to
be in the best interests of the City
given market conditions at the time
the Refunding Bonds are sold and
the objectives of the plan of refunding to obtain aggregate net present
value debt service savings of not
less than three per cent (3%).
The Director of Finance also shall
determine and certify, on or prior to
the date of delivery of the Refunding Bonds to the Original Purchaser, that portion of the aggregate
principal amount of the Refunding
Bonds that is allocable to each Project, and the principal amount of
Refunding Bonds allocated to each
Project that shall be payable at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements (as defined below) on
the applicable principal payment
dates; provided, that (i) the aggregate
principal
amount
of
the
Refunding Bonds allocable to a Project shall be determined by the
Director of Finance on a pro rata
basis by reference to the respective
amount of funds that is required for
the
refunding
of
the
Refunded
Bonds that are allocable to that Project, taking into account any funds
other than the proceeds of the
Refunding Bonds that are available
and appropriated for that purpose,
and (ii) no portion of the aggregate
principal
amount
of
Refunding
Bonds allocated to a Project shall be
payable later than the maximum
maturity for that portion of the
Refunding Bonds as certified by the
Director of Finance.
The Refunding Bonds stated to
mature in any year may be issued
as term bonds (the “Term Refunding Bonds”), payable pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements as defined and
further described below. The Director of Finance shall determine in
the Certificate of Award whether
any of the Refunding Bonds shall be
issued as Term Refunding Bonds,
any dates (the “Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on which the principal

The City Record
amount of the Term Refunding
Bonds shall be payable pursuant to
mandatory
sinking
fund
installments rather than at stated maturity and the amount of principal to be
paid on each Mandatory Redemption
Date (the “Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Refunding Bonds shall be
subject to redemption prior to stated maturity as follows:
(a) Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption. If any of the Refunding
Bonds are issued as Term Refunding Bonds, the Term Refunding
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent,
currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of
and interest on any Term Refunding Bonds shall include amounts
sufficient to redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal
amount of Term Refunding Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided
below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Refunding Bonds in any aggregate
principal amount and to receive a
credit against the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption obligation) of the City for any Term
Refunding Bonds. That option shall
be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and corresponding mandatory redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Refunding
Bonds which prior thereto have been
redeemed (other than through the
operation of the Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements) or
purchased for cancellation and canceled by the Registrar, to the extent
not applied theretofore as a credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Refunding Bond so
delivered, or previously redeemed,
or purchased and canceled, shall be
credited by the Escrow Agent at 100
percent of the principal amount
thereof against the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption obligation). Any excess of that amount
over the then current Mandatory

428

March 5, 2008
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement shall be credited against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligations) in the order directed by
the Director of Finance.
(b) Optional Redemption. The Refunding Bonds may be subject to
redemption prior to maturity by and
at the option of the City, in whole
or in part on any date, in integral
multiples of $5,000, on the optional
redemption dates and at the redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of the principal amount
redeemed) specified in the Certificate of Award, plus, in each case,
accrued interest to the redemption
date. The first optional redemption
date for a series of Refunding
Bonds shall not be later than ten
years from the first Interest Payment Date of that series of Refunding Bonds, and the highest redemption price shall not be greater than
102%
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed plus accrued interest to
the redemption date. Based on the
written advice of a financial advisor, the Director of Finance may
determine
in
the
Certificate
of
Award that it is in the best interests of the City for some or all of
the Refunding Bonds not to be
callable prior to their stated maturity.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Refunding
Bonds, or portions thereof, to be
redeemed optionally shall be selected by lot prior to the selection by
lot of the Refunding Bonds to be
redeemed on the same date by operation of the Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements of
paragraph
(a).
The
Refunding
Bonds shall be redeemed pursuant
to this paragraph only upon written
notice from the Director of Finance
to the Registrar. That notice shall
specify the redemption date and the
principal amount of each maturity
of Refunding Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar.
There shall be deposited with the
Registrar on or prior to the redemption date, funds sufficient to redeem
at the redemption price, all of the
redeemable Refunding Bonds for
which notice of redemption has been
given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Refunding Bonds are called for redemption
at one time, they shall be called in
the order of maturities directed by
the Director of Finance. If fewer
than all Refunding Bonds of a single maturity are to be redeemed, the
selection of Refunding Bonds to be
redeemed, or portions thereof in
amounts of $5,000 or any integral
multiple thereof, shall be made by
the Registrar by lot in a manner
determined by the Registrar. In the
case of a partial redemption of
Refunding
Bonds
by
lot
when
Refunding Bonds of denominations
greater than $5,000 are then outstanding, each $5,000 unit of principal thereof shall be treated as
though it were a separate Refunding Bond of the denomination of

March 5, 2008
$5,000. If it is determined that one
or more, but not all of the $5,000
units of principal amount represented by a Refunding Bond are to be
called for redemption, then upon
notice of redemption of a $5,000 unit
or units, the registered owner of
that Refunding Bond shall surrender the Refunding Bond to the Registrar (i) for payment of the redemption price of the $5,000 unit or
units called for redemption (including, without limitation, the interest
accrued
to
the
date
fixed
for
redemption and any premium), and
(ii) for issuance, without charge to
the registered owner thereof, of a
new Refunding Bond or Refunding
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Refunding Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Refunding Bonds shall identify (i)
by designation, letters, numbers or
other distinguishing marks, the Refunding Bonds or portions thereof to
be redeemed, (ii) the redemption
price to be paid, (iii) the date fixed
for redemption, and (iv) the place
or places where the amounts due
upon redemption are payable. The
notice shall be given by the Registrar on behalf of the City by mailing a copy of the redemption notice
by first class mail, postage prepaid,
at least thirty (30) days prior to the
date fixed for redemption (or such
period specified in the Certificate of
Award), to the registered owner of
each Refunding Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Register maintained
by the Registrar at the close of business on the fifteenth day preceding
that mailing and to any municipal
Refunding Bond insurance company
that has issued a policy insuring
some or all of the Refunding Bonds.
Failure to receive notice by mail or
any defect in that notice regarding
any Refunding Bond, however, shall
not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any
Refunding Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Refunding Bonds. Notice having been
mailed in the manner provided in
the preceding paragraph, the Refunding Bonds and portions thereof
called for redemption shall become
due and payable on the redemption
date, and, upon presentation and
surrender at the place or places
specified in that notice, shall be
paid. If money for the redemption of
all of the Refunding Bonds and portions thereof to be redeemed, including interest accrued to the redemption date, is held by the Registrar
on the redemption date, and, if
notice
of
redemption
has
been
deposited in the mail, then from and
after the redemption date those
Refunding Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
that money shall not be so available
on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail, those Refunding
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they

The City Record
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held
by
the
Registrar
for
the
redemption of particular Refunding
Bonds shall be held in trust for the
account of the registered owners
and shall be paid to them, respectively, upon presentation and surrender of those Refunding Bonds.
The debt charges on the Refunding Bonds shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of
America without deduction for the
services of the Registrar or Escrow
Agent as paying agent. Principal
shall be payable when due upon presentation
and
surrender
of
the
Refunding Bonds at the principal
corporate trust office of the Registrar. Interest on a Refunding Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Refunding Bond was registered, and
to that person’s address appearing,
on the Register (as defined in Section 3) at the close of business on
the date provided in the Registrar
Agreement authorized in Section 3
(the Record Date). Notwithstanding
any contrary provision in the General Bond Ordinance, so long as the
Refunding Bonds are held by a
Depository in a book entry system
(as described in Section 3), debt
charges on the Refunding Bonds
will be payable in lawful money of
the United States by wire transfer
to the Depository made by the
Escrow Agent on each Interest Payment Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance, except for the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) (pertaining generally to an adjustment
of the interest rate in an event of
default) and the third paragraph of
Section 4 (pertaining generally to
the periods during which the City is
not required to make any transfers
or exchanges of Refunding Bonds
issued under the General Bond Ordinance), will apply to the Refunding
Bonds. Except for those provisions,
the General Bond Ordinance is
included as a part of this Ordinance
as fully as if restated in this Ordinance. Words and terms not otherwise defined in this Ordinance shall
have the same meaning as set forth
in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Refunding Bonds; Exchange and
Transfer of the Refunding Bonds;
Paying Agents. The Refunding Bonds
shall express upon their faces the
purpose for which they are issued
and that they are issued pursuant to
this Ordinance. Pursuant to Section
4 of the General Bond Ordinance,
each
Refunding
Bond
shall
be
authenticated by the manual signature of an authorized officer of the
Trustee (as defined therein). The
Refunding Bonds shall be signed by
the City’s Mayor and by the City’s
Director of Finance, and, consistent
with Revised Code Section 133.27
and notwithstanding Section 177.02
of the Codified Ordinances of the
City, either or both of those signatures may be a facsimile. The
Refunding Bonds shall bear the seal
of the City, which seal may be a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section 83
of the City’s Charter, the Director of
Law shall prepare the Refunding

429

43
Bonds and shall endorse thereon his
approval of the form and correctness
thereof by his manual or facsimile
signature.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating agent, bond registrar, transfer
agent and paying agent for the
Refunding Bonds (the “Registrar”);
provided that the Escrow Agent
shall also act as paying agent for
the Refunding Bonds so long as the
Refunding Bonds are held in a book
entry
system.
The
Director
of
Finance is authorized to sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, an agreement among the
City, the Registrar and the Escrow
Agent (the “Registrar Agreement”)
approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, containing
terms that are not inconsistent with
this Ordinance and not substantially adverse to the City and that are
approved by the Director of Finance
on behalf of the City, all of which
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Registrar Agreement by the Director of Finance.
Payment for the services rendered
and for reimbursement of expenses
incurred pursuant to the Registrar
Agreement shall be made from the
proceeds of the Refunding Bonds, to
the extent available, and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated for that purpose.
So long as any of the Refunding
Bonds remain outstanding, the City
will cause the Registrar to maintain
and keep at its principal corporate
trust office all books and records
necessary
for
the
registration,
exchange and transfer of Refunding
Bonds as provided in this Section
(the “Register”). Subject to the provisions of Section 5, the person in
whose name a Refunding Bond is
registered on the Register shall be
regarded as the absolute owner of
that Refunding Bond for all purposes of this ordinance. Payment of or
on account of the debt charges on
any Refunding Bond shall be made
only to or upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall be affected by any notice
to the contrary, but the registration
may be changed as provided in this
Section. All such payments shall be
valid and effectual to satisfy and
discharge the City’s liability upon
the Refunding Bond, including interest, to the extent of the amount or
amounts so paid.
Any Refunding Bond may be exchanged for Refunding Bonds of
any authorized denomination upon
presentation and surrender at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar, together with a request for exchange signed by the
registered owner or by a person
legally empowered to do so in a
form satisfactory to the Registrar. A
Refunding Bond may be transferred
only on the Register upon presentation and surrender of the Refunding
Bond at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar together with
an assignment signed by the registered owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Refunding Bond or
Refunding Bonds of any authorized
denomination
or
denominations
requested by the owner equal in the

44
aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Refunding Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Refunding Bonds only
after the new Refunding Bonds are
signed by the authorized officers of
the City. In all cases of Refunding
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall
authenticate
and
deliver
Refunding
Bonds
in
accordance
with the provisions of this ordinance. The exchange or transfer
shall be without charge to the
owner, except that the City and Registrar may make a charge sufficient
to reimburse them for any tax or
other governmental charge required
to be paid with respect to the
exchange or transfer. The City or
the Registrar may require that those
charges, if any, be paid before the
procedure is begun for the exchange
or transfer. All Refunding Bonds
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Refunding Bonds
surrendered upon that exchange or
transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Refunding Bonds may be issued in
book entry form in accordance with
the provisions of this Section. As
used in this Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Refunding
Bonds and the principal of and
interest on the Refunding Bonds
may be transferred only through a
book entry, and (ii) physical Refunding Bond certificates in fully
registered form are issued by the
City only to a Depository or its nominee as registered owner, with the
Refunding Bonds “immobilized” in
the custody of the Depository. The
book entry maintained by others
than the City is the record that identifies the owners of beneficial interests in those Refunding Bonds and
that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Refunding Bonds may be
issued to a Depository for use in a
book entry system and, if and as
long as a book entry system is utilized: (i) the Refunding Bonds may
be issued in the form of a single,

The City Record
fully registered Refunding Bond
representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered
owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository; (ii) the beneficial owners in book entry form
shall have no right to receive
Refunding Bonds in the form of
physical securities or certificates;
(iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form shall be
shown by book entry on the system
maintained and operated by the
Depository and its Participants, and
transfers of the ownership of beneficial interests shall be made only
by book entry by the Depository and
its
Participants;
and
(iv)
the
Refunding Bonds as such shall not
be transferable or exchangeable, except for transfer to another Depository or to another nominee of a
Depository, without further action
by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Refunding Bonds for use in
a book entry system, the Director of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Refunding Bonds from the
Depository, and the Trustee and
Registrar shall authenticate and
deliver Refunding Bond certificates
in registered form to the assigns of
the Depository or its nominee, all at
the cost and expense (including any
costs of printing), if the event is not
the result of City action or inaction,
of those persons requesting such
issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Refunding Bonds, after determining
that the signing thereof will not
endanger the funds or securities of
the City and after the approval of
the form of any such agreement by
the Director of Law.
Section 4.
Sale of Refunding
Bonds. The Refunding Bonds shall
first be offered for purchase to the
Trustees of the Sinking Fund and,
if not purchased by them, shall be
offered to the Treasury Investment
Account for purchase and, if not purchased for that Account, shall be
sold to one or more firms that have
proposed to underwrite the Refunding Bonds and have been selected
by the Director of Finance based on
an evaluation of the qualifications
of those firms (collectively, the
“Original Purchaser”).
The Refunding Bonds shall be
awarded to the Original Purchaser
in the Certificate of Award which
shall specify the final terms of the
Refunding
Bonds
in
accordance
with law, the provisions of this Ordinance, the written advice of a financial advisor retained under authority of Section 20 and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Refunding Bonds, including: the
principal amount of the Refunding
Bonds, the purchase price (which

430

March 5, 2008
shall be not less than 97% of the
principal amount of the Refunding
Bonds plus any accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate
or rates, the amounts and years in
which principal installments are
payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements), the Interest Payment Dates and the date
of the Refunding Bonds (if different
from those set in Section 2), and any
other matters required in this Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. As appropriate under the
Charter, the Mayor, Director of
Finance, Director of Law, Clerk of
Council and other appropriate officers of the City are, and each of
them is, authorized to take such
actions as are necessary, appropriate and in the best interest of the
City to establish the terms and
requirements for delivery of the
Refunding Bonds and to make such
arrangements as are necessary with
the Original Purchaser in order to
establish the date, location, and procedure, and conditions for the delivery of the Refunding Bonds to the
Original
Purchaser,
to
give
all
appropriate notices and certificates,
to cause a true transcript of proceedings
with
reference
to
the
issuance of the Refunding Bonds to
be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and
other documents and instruments
and to take such actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Ordinance and to take all
steps necessary to effect the due
execution, authentication and delivery of the Refunding Bonds. The
Director of Finance is further authorized to sign and deliver on behalf
of the City a bond purchase agreement between the City and the Original Purchaser (the “Bond Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, setting forth the terms and
conditions on which the City agrees
to sell the Refunding Bonds and the
Original Purchaser agrees to buy
the Refunding Bonds, which shall
be consistent with this Ordinance,
not substantially adverse to the
City, and approved by the Director
of Finance and the Director of Law
on behalf of the City, all of which
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Bond Purchase
Agreement
by
the
Director
of
Finance. It is determined that the
terms of the Refunding Bonds, as
provided in this Ordinance and as
may be provided in or pursuant to
the Certificate of Award, are in the
best interest of the City and in compliance with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an Official
Statement is appropriate or necessary in connection with the original
issuance of the Refunding Bonds,
the Director of Finance is authorized to prepare or cause to be prepared on behalf of the City an Official Statement and any necessary
supplements and to authorize the
use and distribution of that Official
Statement and any supplements. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign on behalf of the City that Official Statement and any supplements.
The Director of Finance is autho-

March 5, 2008
rized to sign and deliver, on behalf
of the City, such certificates in connection with the accuracy of the
Official Statement and any supplements as may, in the Director’s
judgment, be necessary or appropriate. The Director of Finance is
also authorized to determine and
certify on behalf of the City that
such disclosure document is “deemed
final” by the City within the meaning of Securities and Exchange
Commission Rule 15c2-12 (the “SEC
Rule”). The Director of Finance is
authorized to contract for services
for the production and distribution
of preliminary and final official
statements, including by printed and
electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Refunding Bonds, the City
agrees, in accordance with, and as
the only obligated person with
respect to the Refunding Bonds
under the SEC Rule, to provide or
cause to be provided such financial
information and operating data and
notices, in such manner, as may be
required for purposes of the SEC
Rule. In order to describe and specify certain terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare or
cause to be prepared, and to sign
and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of the City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate,
which shall constitute the continuing disclosure agreement made by
the City for the benefit of the holders and beneficial owners of the
Refunding
Bonds
in
accordance
with the SEC Rule. The performance
of that Agreement shall be subject
to the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to
establish procedures in order to
ensure compliance by the City with
its continuing disclosure agreement,
including the timely provision of
information and notices.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax.
For the purpose of providing the necessary
funds to pay the interest on the
Refunding Bonds promptly when
and as the same falls due, and also
to provide for the discharge of the
Refunding Bonds at maturity, there
shall be and is levied on all the taxable property in the City, in addition to all other taxes, a direct tax
annually during the period the Refunding Bonds are outstanding, in
an amount sufficient to provide for
the payment of that interest, when
and as the same shall fall due, and
also to discharge the principal of
the Refunding Bonds at maturity,
which tax shall not be less than the
interest
and
sinking
fund
tax
required by Section 11 of Article XII
of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is ordered
computed,
certified,
levied
and
extended upon the tax duplicate and
collected by the same officers, in the
same manner and at the same time
that taxes for general purposes for
each of those years are certified,
extended and collected. The tax
shall be placed before and in pref-

The City Record
erence to all other items and for the
full amount thereof. The funds
derived from those tax levies shall
be placed in the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund as required by the
General Bond Ordinance and those
funds, together with the interest collected on them shall be irrevocably
pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds when and as the same
fall due; provided, however, that,
subject to the provisions of Section
8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in
each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the
Refunding Bonds and are appropriated for such purpose, the amount
of such tax shall be reduced by the
amount of such revenues so available and appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25(B)(1) and 5705.51 of
the Revised Code, and in accordance
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the
General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt
charges for the Refunding Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds;

If U.S. Treasury Securities State
and Local Government Series are to
be purchased for the Escrow Fund,
the Escrow Agent is authorized to
file, on behalf of the City, subscriptions for the purchase and issuance
of those Securities. If those Securities are not timely available for purchase, or if in the judgment of the
Director of Finance, an open-market
purchase of direct obligations of the
United States of America for the
Escrow Fund is in the best interest
of and financially advantageous to
the City, the Director of Finance
may purchase and deliver those
obligations, engage the services of
a bidding agent or similar entity for
the purpose of facilitating the bidding, purchase and delivery of such
obligations for, and any related
structuring of, the Escrow Fund,
execute such instruments as are
deemed necessary to engage such
services for such purpose, and provide further for the payment of the
cost of obtaining such services from

of
the

Bonds to the extent available and
otherwise from any other funds lawfully available and that are appropriated or shall be appropriated for
that purpose.

The City covenants that it
will use, and will restrict the use
and investment of, the proceeds of
the Refunding Bonds in such manner and to such extent as may be
necessary so that (a) the Refunding
Bonds will not (i) constitute private
activity bonds, arbitrage bonds or
hedge bonds under Sections 141, 148

of 1986, as amended (the Code) or
(ii) be treated other than as bonds
to which Section 103(a) of the Code
applies, and (b) the interest thereon will not be treated as an item of
tax preference under Section 57 of
the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the Refunding Bonds to be and to remain
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will
not take or authorize to be taken
any actions that would adversely
affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or
persons acting for it, will, among
other acts of compliance, (i) apply
the
proceeds
of
the
Refunding
Bonds to the governmental purpose
of the borrowing, (ii) restrict the
yield on investment property acquired with those proceeds, (iii)
make timely and adequate payments
to the federal government, (iv)
maintain books and records and
make calculations and reports, and
(v) refrain from certain uses of
those proceeds, and, as applicable,

extent necessary to assure such
exclusion of that interest under the
Code.
Each covenant made in this section with respect to the Refunding
Bonds is also made with respect to
all issues any portion of the debt
service on which is paid from proceeds of the Refunding Bonds (and,
if different, the original issue and
any refunding issues in a series of
refundings), to the extent such compliance is necessary to assure exclusion of interest on the Refunding
Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes, and the officers identified above are authorized
to take actions with respect to those
issues as they are authorized in this
section to take with respect to the
Refunding Bonds.
The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer of
the City having responsibility for

or payments, as determined by that
officer, which action shall be in
writing and signed by the officer,
(b) to take any and all other
actions, make or obtain calculations,
make payments, and make or give
reports, covenants and certifications

this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the
immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety, and for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary to issue the Series 2008
Bonds in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed Six Million
Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($6,750,000) for the purpose of
providing funds for the demolition
of structures on publicly and privately owned lands in the City and
the clearance, remediation and clean
up of those lands to enable the environmentally safe and productive
development and use or reuse of
those lands, including planning and
assessment,
land
acquisition
or
assembly, and infrastructure, and to
pay all expenses incurred in connection with the issuance of the
securities, including all financing
costs within the meaning of Section
133.01(K) of the Revised Code and
such
other
costs
that
may
be
financed with the proceeds of securities as permitted by law.
Section 2. Authority, Security and
Source of Payment. The Series 2008
Bonds shall be issued pursuant to
the Ohio Constitution, Chapter 133 of
the Ohio Revised Code, the Charter
of the City, and this Ordinance for
the purpose stated in Section 1. The
Series 2008 Bonds shall be payable
from and secured by the income tax
revenues of the City on a basis subordinate to the security given to the
general obligation bonds of the City
under Ordinance No. 1749-80 passed
by the Council on October 8, 1980, as
amended by Ordinance No. 1112-83
passed by the Council on May 6,
1983,
and
Ordinance
No.
944-96,
passed by the Council on June 10,
1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so
amended and as the same may further be amended from time to time

referred to as the “General Bond
Ordinance”). The debt service on the
Series 2008 Bonds shall be payable
from income tax collections remaining after depositing with the escrow
agent under the General Bond Ordinance the amount required for the
payment of debt service on the
City’s
general
obligation
bonds
issued and outstanding, from time to
time, under the General Bond Ordinance. The Series 2008 Bonds shall
be issued and secured under the
terms of the Trust Indenture (the
“Indenture”) between the City and
U.S. Bank National Association, as
trustee (the “Trustee”) in substan-

The City Record
tially the form on file with the
Clerk of Council in the File No. referenced in the preambles of this
Ordinance, with such completions
and changes as may be consistent
with this Ordinance and the Certificate of Award identified in Section
4 and approved by the Director of
Finance as not being adverse to the
City, the Director’s signing and
delivery of the Indenture being conclusive evidence of that determination. The Indenture permits the
issuance of additional bonds, subject
to certain restrictions. Any additional issues of bonds, together with
the Series 2008 Bonds, are referred
to in this Ordinance and in the
Indenture as the “Bonds.”
Section 3.
Pledge and Covenant
to Maintain Income Tax. So long as
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City pledges the
municipal income taxes of the City
and grants a lien thereon, subordinate to the lien granted in the General Bond Ordinance as security for
the general obligation bonds of the
City issued and outstanding under
the General Bond Ordinance, to the
full extent required to meet debt
charges
payable
on
the
Bonds
issued and outstanding under the
Indenture and to pay any debt
charges on Parity Obligations (as
defined in the Indenture). The City
covenants to appropriate annually
sufficient amounts from the income
taxes for such purpose. The City further covenants that so long as any
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City shall not repeal
or amend, or suffer the repeal of,
any ordinance for the levy or collection of its income taxes in any
manner or to such extent that the
City would not be able to meet its
obligations to the holders of the
Bonds.
Section 4.

City pursuant to the provisions of
the Indenture and the First Supplement identified below. The Series

March 5, 2008
2008 Bonds in accordance with this
Ordinance
(the
“Certificate
of
Award”). The Series 2008 Bonds
shall be issued in the principal
amount specified in the Certificate
of Award, which shall not exceed
the amount stated in Section 1. The
Series 2008 Bonds shall bear interest
from their date until the principal
amount is paid at the rate or rates
per year specified in the Certificate
of Award, provided that the weighted average of such rates (taking
into account the principal amount
and maturity of each Bond to which
a rate applies) shall not exceed six
percent (6%) per year. Interest on
the Series 2008 Bonds shall be
payable semi-annually on the dates
specified in the Certificate of Award
(the “Interest Payment Dates”).
The
Series
2008
Bonds
shall
mature in the years and principal
amounts set forth in the Certificate
of Award, provided that (i) each
principal payment shall occur on an
Interest Payment Date, (ii) the first
principal payment on the Series 2008
Bonds shall be no later than December 15, 2010, and (iii) the final maturity date of the Series 2008 Bonds
shall be no later than December 15,
2030.
The Series 2008 Bonds stated to
mature in any year may be issued
as serial Series 2008 Bonds or as
term Series 2008 Bonds payable prior
to stated maturity pursuant to sinking fund redemption (the “Term
Bonds”). The Director of Finance
shall determine in the Certificate of
Award whether any of the Series
2008 Bonds shall be issued as Term
Bonds, any dates (the “Mandatory
Redemption Dates”) on which the
principal amount of the Term Bonds
shall be payable pursuant to mandatory
sinking
fund
installments
rather than at stated maturity and
the amount of principal to be paid
on
each
Mandatory
Redemption
Date (the “Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements”). If any
of the Series 2008 Bonds are issued
as Term Series 2008 Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be redeemed pursuant
to the Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements
at
a
redemption price of 100 percent of
the principal amount redeemed, plus
interest accrued to the redemption
date, on the Mandatory Redemption
Dates. The aggregate of the moneys
to be deposited with the Trustee for
payment of principal of and interest
on any Term Bonds shall include
amounts sufficient to redeem on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates the
principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided in
the Indenture and the First Supplement).
The Series 2008 Bonds may be subject to redemption prior to maturity
by and at the option of the City, in
whole or in part on any date, in
whole multiples of $5,000, on the
optional redemption dates and at the
redemption prices (expressed as a
percentage of the principal amount
redeemed) specified in the Certificate of Award, plus, in each case,
accrued interest to the redemption
date. The first optional redemption
date, if any, shall not be later than

March 5, 2008
ten years from the first Interest
Payment Date, and the highest
redemption
price
shall
not
be
greater than 102% of the principal
amount redeemed plus accrued interest to the redemption date. Based on
the written advice of a financial
advisor, the Director of Finance may
determine
in
the
Certificate
of
Award that it is in the best interests of the City for some or all of
the Series 2008 Bonds not to be
callable prior to their stated maturity.
If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the City
may have the option to purchase
any Bond which is redeemable by
optional redemption at a purchase
price not less than the redemption
price that would be payable if that
Bond
were
called
for
optional
redemption on the date of the proposed purchase. That election shall
be exercised as provided in the First
Supplement.
If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the Series
2008 Bonds may be secured by a
Debt Service Reserve Fund to be
held by the Trustee under the Indenture. The principal amount of the
Series 2008 Bonds may include provision for funding the Debt Service
Reserve Fund from the proceeds of
the Bonds, subject to compliance
with applicable federal tax laws.
Section 5.

Bonds. The Series 2008 Bonds shall
first be offered for purchase to the
Trustees of the Sinking Fund and,
if not purchased by them, shall be

(the

conditions on which the City agrees
to sell the Series 2008 Bonds and the
Original Purchaser agrees to buy
the Series 2008 Bonds on terms consistent with this Ordinance and the
Indenture, that are not substantially adverse to the City and that are
approved by the Director of Finance
on behalf of the City, all of which
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Bond Purchase

Bond Purchase Agreement by the
Director of Finance. It is determined

Section 8. Bond Anticipation Notes.
For the purpose of raising money in
anticipation of the issuance of the
Series 2008 Bonds for the purpose
set forth in Section 1, notes of the
City may be issued in an aggregate
principal amount not to exceed Six
Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars
($6,750,000)
(the
“Notes”) upon the direction of the
Director of Finance to be set forth
in a certificate providing for the
final terms of the Notes and the sale
of the Notes and signed by the
Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate of Award”). The Notes, if
sold as fixed rate obligations, shall
bear interest at such rate, not
exceeding six percent (6%) per
year, and shall be payable on the
date or dates, as shall be determined
by the Director of Finance of the
City in the Note Certificate of
Award; shall be dated their date of
issuance; shall mature on the date
set forth in the Note Certificate of
Award; shall be subject to redemption by the City at any time prior
to maturity without penalty, unless
the Director of Finance, based on
the advice of a financial advisor,
determines that it is in the best
interest of the City in order to
enhance the marketability of the
Notes, that the Notes not be redeemable prior to maturity; shall be
designated “Revitalization Improvement Bond Anticipation Notes” or as
otherwise provided in the Note Certificate of Award; shall be issued in
such numbers and denominations as
may be requested by the Note Purchaser (hereinafter defined); and
shall be issued in fully registered
form (which may be in a book entry
only system) in denominations of
$5,000 or whole multiples thereof.
The provisions of Sections 9.98 to
9.983 of the Revised Code shall
apply to the Notes and pursuant to
that authority and this Ordinance,
the Director of Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award,
based on the written advice of a
financial advisor, that the City’s
best interests will be served by

50
causing all or a portion of the Notes
to be obligations bearing interest at
variable rates, redeemable by the
City without penalty or premium on
interest adjustment dates. If the
Director of Finance so determines,
then the Director of Finance shall
specify in the Certificate of Award
the method and procedure by which
the variable rate of interest to be
borne by the variable rate Notes
shall be determined, whether by reference to a market index, by a
remarketing agent or otherwise; provided that the variable rate Notes
shall not bear interest at a rate in
excess of sixteen percent (16%) per
year. Notwithstanding that limitation, Notes held by a provider of a
Credit
Support
Instrument
(as
defined in Section 11) may bear
interest at a rate not in excess of
twenty-five percent (25%) per year
as provided in the agreement with
the provider of the Credit Support
Instrument. Holders of variable rate
Notes may be given the right to tender their variable rate Notes for purchase by the City at the times, on
the terms, and subject to the conditions set forth in the Certificate of
Award and any tender agreement;
provided that tender rights shall be
exercisable only at such times as a
Credit Support Instrument is in
place that provides for the payment
of the purchase price payable to the
tendering holder of a variable rate
Note. If the Director of Finance designates any Notes as variable rate
Notes, and if the holders of the variable rate Notes are to be entitled to
tender the variable rate Notes for
purchase,
then
the
Director
of
Finance shall also designate in the
Certificate of Award for those variable rate Notes the provider or
providers for any Credit Support
Instrument, the tender agent or
agents and the remarketing agent
or agents, which designations shall
be based on the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the parties so designated
possess the requisite resources and
experience to provide the services
required of them and that the terms
on which the designated parties
have agreed to provide such services are fair and commercially reasonable. The Director of Finance is
authorized to enter into agreements
in connection with the delivery of
the variable rate Notes, and from
time to time thereafter so long as
the variable rate Notes are outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support Instruments, tender agents
(which may be the Trustee), remarketing agents, and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a financial advisor, to be
necessary or appropriate to provide
for the method of determining the
variable interest rates, permitting
holders the right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support
for the payment of the variable rate
Notes upon tender for purchase or
redemption, and providing for the
repayment by the City of any
amounts drawn under the Credit
Support Instrument. The Trustee
shall be the authenticating agent,
registrar, transfer agent and paying
agent for the Notes. The Notes shall
be signed by the officials of the City
and in the manner set forth in the

The City Record
Indenture. The Notes shall first be
offered for purchase to the Trustees
of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by them, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account
for purchase and, if not purchased
for that Account, shall be sold at not
less than par and accrued interest
to one or more firms that have proposed to underwrite the Notes and
have been selected by the Director
of Finance based on an evaluation
of the qualifications of those firms
(the “Note Purchaser”) in the principal amount set forth in a certificate of award to be executed by the
Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate of Award”). The proceeds of
such sale shall be paid into the
proper fund or funds set forth in the
Note Certificate of Award and used
for the purpose for which the Notes
are being issued under the provisions of this Ordinance.
Section 9. Official Statement; Continuing Disclosure. If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a
disclosure document (each, an “Official Statement”) is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
sale of the Notes or the Series 2008
Bonds, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare or cause to be
prepared on behalf of the City an
Official Statement with respect to
the Notes or the Series 2008 Bonds,
as the case may be, and any necessary supplements and to authorize
the use and distribution of each
Official Statement and any supplements. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign on behalf of the
City and in her official capacity
each Official Statement and any supplements approved by her. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign and deliver on behalf of the
City and in her official capacity
such certificates in connection with
the accuracy of each Official Statement and any supplements as may,
in her judgment, be necessary or appropriate. The Director of Finance is
also authorized to determine and
certify on behalf of the City that
such disclosure document is “deemed final” by the City within the
meaning of Securities and Exchange
Commission Rule 15c2-12 the “SEC
Rule.”) The Director of Finance is
authorized to contract for services
for the production and distribution
of preliminary and final Official
Statements, including by printed
and electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Notes or the Series 2008
Bonds, the City agrees, in accordance with, and as the only obligated person with respect to the
Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds
under the SEC Rule, to provide or
cause to be provided such financial
information and operating data and
notices, in such manner as may be
required for purposes of the SEC
Rule. In order to describe and specify certain terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Director of
Finance is authorized and directed
to prepare, or cause to be prepared,
and to sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the

436

March 5, 2008
continuing
disclosure
agreement
made by the City for the benefit of
the holders and beneficial owners of
the Notes or the Series 2008 Bonds,
as the case may be, in accordance
with the SEC Rule. The performance
of that agreement shall be subject
to the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to
establish procedures in order to
ensure compliance by the City with
its continuing disclosure agreement,
including the timely provision of
information and notices.
Section 10.
Federal Tax Covenants.
The City covenants that it
will use, and will restrict the use
and investment of, the proceeds of
the Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds
in such manner and to such extent
as may be necessary so that (a) the
Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds will
not (i) constitute private activity
bonds, arbitrage bonds or hedge
bonds under Sections 141, 148 or 149
of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the Code) or (ii)
be treated other than as bonds to
which Section 103(a) of the Code
applies, and (b) the interest thereon will not be treated as an item of
tax preference under Section 57 of
the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the Notes
and the Series 2008 Bonds to be and
to remain excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will not take or authorize to be taken any actions that
would adversely affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting
for it, will, among other acts of compliance, (i) apply the proceeds of
the Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds
to the governmental purpose of the
borrowing, (ii) restrict the yield on
investment property acquired with
those proceeds, (iii) make timely
and adequate payments to the federal
government,
(iv)
maintain
books and records and make calculations and reports, and (v) refrain
from certain uses of those proceeds,
and,
as
applicable,
of
property
financed with such proceeds, all in
such manner and to the extent necessary to assure such exclusion of
that interest under the Code.
The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer of
the City having responsibility for
issuance of the Notes and the Series
2008 Bonds, is hereby authorized (a)
to make or effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent,
approval, or waiver on behalf of the
City with respect to the Notes and
the Series 2008 Bonds as the City is
permitted or required to make or
give under the federal income tax
laws, including, without limitation
thereto, any of the elections provided for in Section 148(f)(4)(C) of the
Code or available under Section 148
of the Code, for the purpose of
assuring, enhancing or protecting
favorable tax treatment or status of
the Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds
or interest thereon or assisting compliance with requirements for that
purpose, reducing the burden or
expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or payments

March 5, 2008
or penalties, or making payments of
special amounts in lieu of making
computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as rebate, or
obviating those amounts or payments, as determined by that officer,
which action shall be in writing and
signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf
of the City, as may be appropriate
to assure the exclusion of interest
from gross income and the intended
tax status of the Notes and the
Series 2008 Bonds, and (c) to give
one or more appropriate certificates
of the City, for inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Notes
and the Series 2008 Bonds, setting
forth the reasonable expectations of
the City regarding the amount and
use of all the proceeds of the Notes
and the Series 2008 Bonds, the facts,
circumstances
and
estimates
on
which they are based, and other
facts and circumstances relevant to
the tax treatment of the interest on
and the tax status of the Notes and
the Series 2008 Bonds.
Section 11.
Credit Facilities and
Ratings. If the Director of Finance
determines it to be in the best interests of the City, based on the written advice of a financial advisor, the
Director of Finance may obtain an
insurance policy, letter of credit,
standby bond purchase agreement
or other credit enhancement instrument as further security for the payment when due of the principal of
and interest on all or any portion of
the Series 2008 Bonds or Notes (a
“Credit Support Instrument”). The
Director of Finance may request a
rating on the Series 2008 Bonds or
Notes from one or more nationally
recognized rating organizations, and
do any and all things and take any
and all actions required to secure a
Credit Support Instrument and/or a
rating or ratings on the Series 2008
Bonds or Notes. The Director of
Finance may enter into one or more
agreements
for
Credit
Support
Instruments containing terms not
materially inconsistent with this
Ordinance or the Indenture. The
expenditure of the amounts necessary to secure Credit Support Instruments or obtain those ratings is
authorized and approved, and the
Director of Finance is authorized to
provide for the payment of any such
amounts from the proceeds of the
Series 2008 Bonds or Notes to the
extent available and otherwise from
any other funds lawfully available
that are appropriated or shall be
appropriated for that purpose.

The Director of Finance may obtain
the services of one or more financial
advisors, from time to time, to assist
the Director of Finance in making
any of the determinations required
by this Ordinance to be determined
by the Director of Finance. The
Director of Finance may rely on the
written advice of any financial advisor so retained. Any financial advisor employed under the authority of

Ord. No. 120-08.
By Council Member Sweeney (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the issuance and sale of bonds
in the maximum principal amount of
$29,550,000 for the purpose of providing facilities for the discharge of
governmental functions or for services otherwise benefiting public
safety, health and welfare and
authorizing related matters.
Whereas, this Council desires to
issue bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed TwentyNine Million Five Hundred Fifty
Thousand Dollars ($29,550,000) (the
“Series 2008 Bonds”) to finance the
costs of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1; and
Whereas, the Series 2008 Bonds
shall be payable from and secured
by income tax revenues of the City
remaining after deposits required
under the General Bond Ordinance
(as defined in Section 2) are made
to the escrow agent for the City’s
general obligation bonds; and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of this City, has certified to this Council that the estimated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be financed with
the proceeds of the Series 2008
Bonds is at least five (5) years, as
evidenced by the certificate contained in File No. 120-08-A; and
Whereas, the authorization for
issuance of the Series 2008 Bonds is
necessary to provide funds to pay

of
certain

that are urgently needed for the
benefit of the City, and as a result,
this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the
immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety, and for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

52
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary to issue the Series 2008
Bonds in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed Twenty-Nine
Million Five Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($29,550,000) for the
purpose of providing facilities for
the discharge of governmental functions or for services otherwise benefiting the public safety, health and
welfare, including constructing, reconstructing, rehabilitating, installing, renovating, enlarging and otherwise improving buildings, structures and other facilities in, of and
for City Hall, police stations, fire
stations, service stations, waste collection, transfer and disposal facilities, correctional facilities, health
facilities, centers and other facilities, the provision of necessary fixtures, furnishings, equipment, information technology hardware and
software,
utilities,
site
improvements and appurtenances, and the
acquisition of vehicles, and to pay
any capitalized interest and all
expenses
incurred
in
connection
with the issuance of the securities,
including all financing costs within
the meaning of Section 133.01(K) of
the Revised Code and such other
costs of the foregoing permanent
improvements that may be financed
with the proceeds of securities as
permitted by Section 133.15(B) of
the Ohio Revised Code and as otherwise permitted by law.
Section 2. Authority, Security and
Source of Payment. The Series 2008
Bonds shall be issued pursuant to
the Ohio Constitution, Chapter 133 of
the Ohio Revised Code, the Charter
of the City, and this Ordinance for
the purpose stated in Section 1. The
Series 2008 Bonds shall be payable
from and secured by the income tax
revenues of the City on a basis subordinate to the security given to the
general obligation bonds of the City
under Ordinance No. 1749-80 passed
by the Council on October 8, 1980, as
amended by Ordinance No. 1112-83
passed by the Council on May 6,
1983,
and
Ordinance
No.
944-96,
passed by the Council on June 10,
1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so
amended and as the same may further be amended from time to time
in accordance with its provisions, is
referred to as the “General Bond
Ordinance”). The debt service on the
Series 2008 Bonds shall be payable
from income tax collections remaining after depositing with the escrow
agent under the General Bond Ordinance the amount required for the
payment of debt service on the
City’s
general
obligation
bonds
issued and outstanding, from time to
time, under the General Bond Ordinance. The Series 2008 Bonds shall
be issued and secured under the
terms of the Trust Indenture (the
“Indenture”) between the City and
U.S. Bank National Association, as
trustee (the “Trustee”) in substantially the form on file with the
Clerk of Council in the File No. referenced in the preambles of this
Ordinance, with such completions
and changes as may be consistent
with this Ordinance and the Certificate of Award identified in Section
4 and approved by the Director of
Finance as not being adverse to the
City, the Director’s signing and
delivery of the Indenture being conclusive evidence of that determination. The Indenture permits the

The City Record
issuance of additional bonds, subject
to certain restrictions. Any additional issues of bonds, together with
the Series 2008 Bonds, are referred
to in this Ordinance and in the
Indenture as the “Bonds.”
Section 3.
Pledge and Covenant
to Maintain Income Tax. So long as
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City pledges the
municipal income taxes of the City
and grants a lien thereon, subordinate to the lien granted in the General Bond Ordinance as security for
the general obligation bonds of the

Facilities
Improvement
Bonds, Series 2008” and may contain
such further designation as provided in the Certificate of Award identified below. The Series 2008 Bonds
shall be issued in one lot as fully
registered Series 2008 Bonds in

whole multiple thereof. The Series
2008 Bonds shall be numbered as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance. The Series 2008 Bonds
shall be signed by the officials of
the City and in the manner set forth
in the Indenture.
The Series 2008 Bonds shall be

the certificate of award providing
for the final terms of the Series 2008
Bonds and the sale of the Series
2008 Bonds in accordance with this
Ordinance
(the
“Certificate
of
Award”). The Series 2008 Bonds
shall be issued in the principal
amount specified in the Certificate
of Award, which shall not exceed
the amount stated in Section 1. The
Series 2008 Bonds shall bear interest
from their date until the principal
amount is paid at the rate or rates
per year specified in the Certificate
of Award, provided that the weighted average of such rates (taking

438

March 5, 2008
into account the principal amount
and maturity of each Bond to which
a rate applies) shall not exceed six
percent (6%) per year. Interest on
the Series 2008 Bonds shall be
payable semi-annually on the dates
specified in the Certificate of Award
(the “Interest Payment Dates”).
The
Series
2008
Bonds
shall
mature in the years and principal
amounts set forth in the Certificate
of Award, provided that (i) each
principal payment shall occur on an
Interest Payment Date, (ii) the first
principal payment on the Series 2008
Bonds shall be no later than December 15, 2010, and (iii) the final maturity date of the Series 2008 Bonds
shall be no later than December 15,
2030.
The Series 2008 Bonds stated to
mature in any year may be issued
as serial Series 2008 Bonds or as
term Series 2008 Bonds payable prior
to stated maturity pursuant to sinking fund redemption (the “Term
Bonds”). The Director of Finance
shall determine in the Certificate of
Award whether any of the Series
2008 Bonds shall be issued as Term
Bonds, any dates (the “Mandatory
Redemption Dates”) on which the
principal amount of the Term Bonds
shall be payable pursuant to mandatory
sinking
fund
installments
rather than at stated maturity and
the amount of principal to be paid
on
each
Mandatory
Redemption
Date (the “Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
If any of the Series 2008 Bonds are
issued as Term Series 2008 Bonds,
the Term Bonds shall be redeemed
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements at a
redemption price of 100 percent of
the principal amount redeemed, plus
interest accrued to the redemption
date, on the Mandatory Redemption
Dates. The aggregate of the moneys
to be deposited with the Trustee for
payment of principal of and interest
on any Term Bonds shall include
amounts sufficient to redeem on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates the
principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided in
the Indenture and the First Supplement).
The Series 2008 Bonds may be subject to redemption prior to maturity
by and at the option of the City, in
whole or in part on any date, in
whole multiples of $5,000, on the
optional redemption dates and at the
redemption prices (expressed as a
percentage of the principal amount
redeemed) specified in the Certificate of Award, plus, in each case,
accrued interest to the redemption
date. The first optional redemption
date, if any, shall not be later than
ten years from the first Interest Payment Date, and the highest redemption price shall not be greater than
102%
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed plus accrued interest to the
redemption date. Based on the written advice of a financial advisor, the
Director of Finance may determine
in the Certificate of Award that it is
in the best interests of the City for
some or all of the Series 2008 Bonds
not to be callable prior to their stated maturity.

March 5, 2008
If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the City
may have the option to purchase
any Bond which is redeemable by
optional redemption at a purchase
price not less than the redemption
price that would be payable if that
Bond
were
called
for
optional
redemption on the date of the proposed purchase. That election shall
be exercised as provided in the First
Supplement.
If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the Series
2008 Bonds may be secured by a

Section 8.
Bond Anticipation
Notes.
For the purpose of raising
money
in
anticipation
of
the
issuance of the Series 2008 Bonds for
the purpose set forth in Section 1,
notes of the City may be issued in
an aggregate principal amount not
to exceed Twenty Nine Million Five
Hundred Fifty Dollars ($29,550,000)
(the “Notes”) upon the direction of
the Director of Finance to be set
forth in a certificate providing for
the final terms of the Notes and the
sale of the Notes and signed by the
Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate of Award”). The Notes, if
sold as fixed rate obligations, shall
bear interest at such rate, not
exceeding six percent (6%) per
year, and shall be payable on the
date or dates, as shall be determined
by the Director of Finance of the
City in the Note Certificate of
Award; shall be dated their date of
issuance; shall mature on the date
set forth in the Note Certificate of
Award; shall be subject to redemption by the City at any time prior
to maturity without penalty, unless
the Director of Finance, based on
the advice of a financial advisor,
determines that it is in the best
interest of the City in order to
enhance the marketability of the
Notes,
that
the
Notes
not
be
redeemable prior to maturity; shall
be designated “Public Facilities Improvement Bond Anticipation Notes”
or as otherwise provided in the Note
Certificate of Award; shall be issued
in such numbers and denominations
as may be requested by the Note
Purchaser
(hereinafter
defined);
and shall be issued in fully registered form (which may be in a book
entry only system) in denominations
of $5,000 or whole multiples thereof.
The provisions of Sections 9.98 to
9.983 of the Revised Code shall
apply to the Notes and pursuant to
that authority and this Ordinance,
the Director of Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award,
based on the written advice of a
financial advisor, that the City’s
best interests will be served by
causing all or a portion of the Notes
to be obligations bearing interest at
variable rates, redeemable by the
City without penalty or premium on
interest adjustment dates. If the
Director of Finance so determines,
then the Director of Finance shall
specify in the Certificate of Award
the method and procedure by which
the variable rate of interest to be
borne by the variable rate Notes
shall be determined, whether by reference to a market index, by a
remarketing agent or otherwise;
provided that the variable rate
Notes shall not bear interest at a
rate in excess of sixteen percent
(16%) per year. Notwithstanding
that limitation, Notes held by a
provider of a Credit Support Instru-

54
ment (as defined in Section 11) may
bear interest at a rate not in excess
of twenty-five percent (25%) per
year as provided in the agreement
with the provider of the Credit Support Instrument. Holders of variable
rate Notes may be given the right
to tender their variable rate Notes
for purchase by the City at the
times, on the terms, and subject to
the conditions set forth in the Certificate of Award and any tender
agreement; provided that tender
rights shall be exercisable only at
such times as a Credit Support
Instrument is in place that provides
for the payment of the purchase
price payable to the tendering holder of a variable rate Note. If the
Director of Finance designates any
Notes as variable rate Notes, and if
the holders of the variable rate
Notes are to be entitled to tender the
variable rate Notes for purchase,
then the Director of Finance shall
also designate in the Certificate of
Award for those variable rate Notes
the provider or providers for any
Credit Support Instrument, the tender agent or agents and the remarketing agent or agents, which designations shall be based on the
determination of the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed
to provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable. The Director of Finance is authorized to enter
into agreements in connection with
the delivery of the variable rate
Notes, and from time to time thereafter so long as the variable rate
Notes are outstanding, with providers of Credit Support Instruments, tender agents (which may be
the Trustee), remarketing agents,
and others as may be determined by
the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a financial
advisor, to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the method of
determining the variable interest
rates, permitting holders the right
of tender, providing for liquidity or
credit support for the payment of
the variable rate Notes upon tender
for purchase or redemption, and providing for the repayment by the
City of any amounts drawn under
the Credit Support Instrument. The
Trustee shall be the authenticating
agent, registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Notes. The
Notes shall be signed by the officials of the City and in the manner
set forth in the Indenture. The Notes
shall first be offered for purchase to
the Trustees of the Sinking Fund
and, if not purchased by them, shall
be offered to the Treasury Investment Account for purchase and, if
not purchased for that Account,
shall be sold at not less than par
and accrued interest to one or more
firms that have proposed to underwrite the Notes and have been
selected by the Director of Finance
based on an evaluation of the qualifications of those firms (the “Note
Purchaser”) in the principal amount
set forth in a certificate of award to
be executed by the Director of
Finance (the “Note Certificate of
Award”). The proceeds of such sale
shall be paid into the proper fund

The City Record
or funds set forth in the Note Certificate of Award and used for the
purpose for which the Notes are
being issued under the provisions of
this Ordinance.
Section 9. Official Statement; Continuing Disclosure. If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a
disclosure document (each, an “Official Statement”) is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
sale of the Notes or the Series 2008
Bonds, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare or cause to be
prepared on behalf of the City an
Official Statement with respect to
the Notes or the Series 2008 Bonds,
as the case may be, and any necessary supplements and to authorize
the use and distribution of each
Official Statement and any supplements. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign on behalf of the
City and in her official capacity
each Official Statement and any supplements approved by her. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign and deliver on behalf of the
City and in her official capacity
such
certificates
in
connection
with the accuracy of each Official
Statement and any supplements as
may, in her judgment, be necessary
or appropriate. The Director of
Finance is also authorized to determine and certify on behalf of the
City that such disclosure document
is “deemed final” by the City within the meaning of Securities and
Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12
the “SEC Rule.”) The Director of
Finance is authorized to contract for
services for the production and distribution of preliminary and final
Official Statements, including by
printed and electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Notes or the Series 2008
Bonds, the City agrees, in accordance with, and as the only obligated person with respect to the
Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds
under the SEC Rule, to provide or
cause to be provided such financial
information and operating data and
notices, in such manner as may be
required for purposes of the SEC
Rule. In order to describe and specify certain terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Director of
Finance is authorized and directed
to prepare, or cause to be prepared,
and to sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the
continuing
disclosure
agreement
made by the City for the benefit of
the holders and beneficial owners of
the Notes or the Series 2008 Bonds,
as the case may be, in accordance
with the SEC Rule. The performance
of that agreement shall be subject
to the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to
establish procedures in order to
ensure compliance by the City with
its continuing disclosure agreement,
including the timely provision of
information and notices.

Million Three Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars
($20,350,000)
(the
“Series 2008 Bonds”) to finance the
costs of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1; and
Whereas, the Series 2008 Bonds
shall be payable from and secured
by income tax revenues of the City
remaining after deposits required
under the General Bond Ordinance
(as defined in Section 2) are made
to the escrow agent for the City’s
general obligation bonds; and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of this City, has certified to this Council that the estimated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be financed with
the proceeds of the Series 2008
Bonds is at least five (5) years, as
evidenced by the certificate contained in File No. 121-08-A; and
Whereas, the authorization for
issuance of the Series 2008 Bonds is
necessary to provide funds to pay
the
costs
of
certain
permanent
improvements described in Section 1
that are urgently needed for the
benefit of the City, and as a result,
this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the
immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety, and for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary to issue the Series 2008
Bonds in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed Twenty Million Three Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($20,350,000) for the purpose
of providing funds to improve the
municipal street system and related
facilities, including streets, expressways, roadways, driveways, underground vaults, sidewalks and pedestrian walkways, by acquiring, constructing, reconstructing, opening,
extending, widening, grading, draining, paving, resurfacing, lighting
and curbing, removing or reconstructing underground vaults to preserve the public right of way;
installing gutters, sidewalks and
related
pedestrian
improvements;
constructing
and
improving
cul-

56
verts; constructing sanitary sewers
and water lines; resetting and constructing catch basins and other
storm drainage facilities; constructing, reconstructing, replacing, renovating and rehabilitating bridges;
acquiring any real estate and interests in real estate, including easements, necessary for such purpose;
and installing signs, signals, markings and other devices for traffic
control purposes, together with all
necessary and incidental appurtenances, and to pay any capitalized
interest and all expenses incurred in
connection with the issuance of the
securities, including all financing
costs within the meaning of Section
133.01(K) of the Revised Code and
such other costs of the foregoing
permanent improvements that may
be financed with the proceeds of
securities as permitted by Section
133.15(B) of the Ohio Revised Code
and as otherwise permitted by law.
Section 2. Authority, Security and
Source of Payment. The Series 2008
Bonds shall be issued pursuant to
the Ohio Constitution, Chapter 133 of
the Ohio Revised Code, the Charter
of the City, and this Ordinance for
the purpose stated in Section 1. The
Series 2008 Bonds shall be payable
from and secured by the income tax
revenues of the City on a basis subordinate to the security given to the
general obligation bonds of the City
under Ordinance No. 1749-80 passed
by the Council on October 8, 1980, as
amended by Ordinance No. 1112-83
passed by the Council on May 6,
1983,
and
Ordinance
No.
944-96,
passed by the Council on June 10,
1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so
amended and as the same may further be amended from time to time
in accordance with its provisions, is
referred to as the “General Bond
Ordinance”). The debt service on the
Series 2008 Bonds shall be payable
from income tax collections remaining after depositing with the escrow
agent under the General Bond Ordinance the amount required for the
payment of debt service on the
City’s
general
obligation
bonds
issued and outstanding, from time to
time, under the General Bond Ordinance. The Series 2008 Bonds shall
be issued and secured under the
terms of the Trust Indenture (the
“Indenture”) between the City and
U.S. Bank National Association, as
trustee (the “Trustee”) in substantially the form on file with the
Clerk of Council in the File No. referenced in the preambles of this
Ordinance, with such completions
and changes as may be consistent
with this Ordinance and the Certificate of Award identified in Section
4 and approved by the Director of
Finance as not being adverse to the
City, the Director’s signing and
delivery of the Indenture being conclusive evidence of that determination. The Indenture permits the
issuance of additional bonds, subject
to certain restrictions. Any additional issues of bonds, together with
the Series 2008 Bonds, are referred
to in this Ordinance and in the
Indenture as the “Bonds.”
Section 3.
Pledge and Covenant
to Maintain Income Tax. So long as
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City pledges the
municipal income taxes of the City
and grants a lien thereon, subordinate to the lien granted in the Gen-

The City Record
eral Bond Ordinance as security for
the general obligation bonds of the
City issued and outstanding under
the General Bond Ordinance, to the
full extent required to meet debt
charges
payable
on
the
Bonds
issued and outstanding under the
Indenture and to pay any debt
charges on Parity Obligations (as
defined in the Indenture). The City
covenants to appropriate annually
sufficient amounts from the income
taxes for such purpose. The City further covenants that so long as any
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City shall not repeal
or amend, or suffer the repeal of,
any ordinance for the levy or collection of its income taxes in any
manner or to such extent that the
City would not be able to meet its
obligations to the holders of the
Bonds.
Section 4.
Terms of the Series
2008 Bonds. The Series 2008 Bonds
shall be issued in fully registered
form. The Series 2008 Bonds initially shall be delivered only in bookentry form, shall be registered in
the name of the Depository (as
defined in the Indenture) or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository, and shall not be transferable
or exchangeable (except for transfer to another Depository or its nominee) without further action by the
City pursuant to the provisions of
the Indenture and the First Supplement identified below. The Series
2008 Bonds shall be designated
“Bridges
and
Roadways
Improvement Bonds, Series 2008” and
may contain such further designation as provided in the Certificate of
Award identified below. The Series
2008 Bonds shall be issued in one lot
as fully registered Series 2008 Bonds
in denominations of $5,000 or any
whole multiple thereof. The Series
2008 Bonds shall be numbered as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance. The Series 2008 Bonds
shall be signed by the officials of
the City and in the manner set forth
in the Indenture.
The Series 2008 Bonds shall be
dated as of April 1, 2008, or such
other date, but in no event later
than December 31, 2009, specified in
the certificate of award providing
for the final terms of the Series 2008
Bonds and the sale of the Series
2008 Bonds in accordance with this
Ordinance
(the
“Certificate
of
Award”). The Series 2008 Bonds
shall be issued in the principal
amount specified in the Certificate
of Award, which shall not exceed
the amount stated in Section 1. The
Series 2008 Bonds shall bear interest
from their date until the principal
amount is paid at the rate or rates
per year specified in the Certificate
of Award, provided that the weighted average of such rates (taking
into account the principal amount
and maturity of each Bond to which
a rate applies) shall not exceed six
percent (6%) per year. Interest on
the Series 2008 Bonds shall be
payable semi-annually on the dates
specified in the Certificate of Award
(the “Interest Payment Dates”).
The
Series
2008
Bonds
shall
mature in the years and principal
amounts set forth in the Certificate
of Award, provided that (i) each
principal payment shall occur on an
Interest Payment Date, (ii) the first

442

March 5, 2008
principal payment on the Series 2008
Bonds shall be no later than December 15, 2010, and (iii) the final maturity date of the Series 2008 Bonds
shall be no later than December 15,
2030.
The Series 2008 Bonds stated to
mature in any year may be issued
as serial Series 2008 Bonds or as
term Series 2008 Bonds payable
prior to stated maturity pursuant
to sinking fund redemption (the
“Term Bonds”). The Director of
Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award whether any of
the Series 2008 Bonds shall be issued
as Term Bonds, any dates (the
“Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on
which the principal amount of the
Term Bonds shall be payable pursuant to mandatory sinking fund
installments rather than at stated
maturity and the amount of principal to be paid on each Mandatory
Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements”). If any of the Series
2008 Bonds are issued as Term
Series 2008 Bonds, the Term Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to the
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements at a redemption
price of 100 percent of the principal
amount
redeemed,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date, on
the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to be
deposited with the Trustee for payment of principal of and interest on
any
Term
Bonds
shall
include
amounts sufficient to redeem on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates the
principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided in
the Indenture and the First Supplement).
The Series 2008 Bonds may be subject to redemption prior to maturity
by and at the option of the City, in
whole or in part on any date, in
whole multiples of $5,000, on the
optional redemption dates and at the
redemption prices (expressed as a
percentage of the principal amount
redeemed) specified in the Certificate of Award, plus, in each case,
accrued interest to the redemption
date. The first optional redemption
date, if any, shall not be later than
ten years from the first Interest
Payment Date, and the highest
redemption
price
shall
not
be
greater than 102% of the principal
amount redeemed plus accrued interest to the redemption date. Based on
the written advice of a financial
advisor, the Director of Finance may
determine
in
the
Certificate
of
Award that it is in the best interests of the City for some or all of
the Series 2008 Bonds not to be
callable prior to their stated maturity.
If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the City
may have the option to purchase
any Bond which is redeemable by
optional redemption at a purchase
price not less than the redemption
price that would be payable if that
Bond
were
called
for
optional
redemption on the date of the proposed purchase. That election shall
be exercised as provided in the First
Supplement.

March 5, 2008
If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the Series
2008 Bonds may be secured by a
Debt Service Reserve Fund to be
held by the Trustee under the Indenture. The principal amount of the
Series 2008 Bonds may include provision for funding the Debt Service
Reserve Fund from the proceeds of
the Bonds, subject to compliance
with applicable federal tax laws.
Section 5.
Sale of Series 2008
Bonds. The Series 2008 Bonds shall
first be offered for purchase to the
Trustees of the Sinking Fund and,
if not purchased by them, shall be
offered to the Treasury Investment
Account for purchase and, if not purchased for that Account, shall be

proposed to underwrite the Series
2008 Bonds and have been selected
by the Director of Finance based on
an evaluation of the qualifications
of those firms (collectively, the
“Original Purchaser”).
The Series 2008 Bonds shall be
awarded to the Original Purchaser
in the Certificate of Award which

Fund
Redemption
Requirements), any optional redemption

and the date of the Series 2008
Bonds (if different from those set
forth in Section 3) and any other
matters required in this Ordinance
to be set forth in that Certificate. As
appropriate under the Charter, the
Mayor, Director of Finance, Director
of Law, Clerk of Council and other
appropriate officers of the City are,
and each of them is, authorized to
take such actions as are necessary,
appropriate and in the best interest
of the City to establish the terms
and requirements for delivery of the
Series 2008 Bonds and to make such
arrangements as are necessary with
the Original Purchaser in order to

appropriate
to
consummate
the
transactions contemplated by this
Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Series 2008 Bonds. The Director of
Finance is authorized to sign and
deliver on behalf of the City a bond
purchase agreement between the
City and the Original Purchaser
(the “Bond Purchase Agreement”),

The City Record
approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, setting forth
the terms and conditions on which
the City agrees to sell the Series
2008 Bonds and the Original Purchaser agrees to buy the Series 2008
Bonds on terms consistent with this
Ordinance and the Indenture, that
are not substantially adverse to the
City and that are approved by the
Director of Finance on behalf of the
City, all of which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the Bond Purchase Agreement or
amendments to the Bond Purchase
Agreement
by
the
Director
of
Finance. It is determined that the
terms of the Series 2008 Bonds, as
provided in this Ordinance and as
may be provided in or pursuant to
the Certificate of Award, the Indenture and the First Supplement, are
in the best interest of the City and
in compliance with all legal requirements.

the Debt Service Fund, the amount,
if any, received by the City upon

date to the date of their delivery to
the Original Purchaser;(c) to the
Trustee, for deposit in the Debt Service Reserve Fund, any amount

the Project Fund, the balance of the
proceeds.

of the proceeds of the Series 2008
Bonds, defeasance of the Series 2008
Bonds, and other terms consistent
with this Ordinance and the Certificate of Award and approved by the
Director of Finance as not substantially adverse to the City. The First
Supplement shall be approved as to
form and correctness by the Director of Law. The determination by
the Director of Finance that the provisions of the First Supplement are
not substantially adverse to the City
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the Director’s signing of the First
Amendment. As appropriate under
the Charter, the Mayor, the Director
of Finance, the Director of Law, the
Clerk of Council and other appropriate officers of the City are, and
each of them is, authorized to sign,

Section 8.
Bond Anticipation
Notes.
For the purpose of raising
money in anticipation of the issuance of the Series 2008 Bonds for the
purpose set forth in Section 1, notes
of the City may be issued in an
aggregate principal amount not to
exceed Twenty Million Three Hundred
Fifty
Thousand
Dollars
($20,350,000) (the “Notes”) upon the
direction of the Director of Finance
to be set forth in a certificate providing for the final terms of the
Notes and the sale of the Notes and
signed by the Director of Finance
(the “Note Certificate of Award”).
The Notes, if sold as fixed rate
obligations, shall bear interest at
such rate, not exceeding six percent
(6%) per year, and shall be payable
on the date or dates, as shall be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance of the City in the Note Certificate of Award; shall be dated
their date of issuance; shall mature
on the date set forth in the Note Certificate of Award; shall be subject
to redemption by the City at any
time
prior
to
maturity
without
penalty,
unless
the
Director
of
Finance, based on the advice of a
financial advisor, determines that it
is in the best interest of the City in
order to enhance the marketability
of the Notes, that the Notes not be
redeemable prior to maturity; shall
be designated “Bridges and Roadways Improvement Bond Anticipation Notes” or as otherwise provided
in the Note Certificate of Award;
shall be issued in such numbers and
denominations as may be requested
by the Note Purchaser (hereinafter
defined); and shall be issued in
fully registered form (which may be
in a book entry only system) in
denominations of $5,000 or whole
multiples thereof. The provisions of
Sections 9.98 to 9.983 of the Revised
Code shall apply to the Notes and
pursuant to that authority and this
Ordinance, the Director of Finance
may determine in the Certificate of
Award, based on the written advice
of a financial advisor, that the
City’s best interests will be served
by causing all or a portion of the
Notes to be obligations bearing interest at variable rates, redeemable
by the City without penalty or premium on interest adjustment dates.
If the Director of Finance so determines, then the Director of Finance
shall specify in the Certificate of
Award the method and procedure by
which the variable rate of interest
to be borne by the variable rate
Notes shall be determined, whether
by reference to a market index, by
a remarketing agent or otherwise;
provided that the variable rate
Notes shall not bear interest at a
rate in excess of sixteen percent
(16%) per year. Notwithstanding
that limitation, Notes held by a
provider of a Credit Support Instrument (as defined in Section 11) may
bear interest at a rate not in excess
of twenty-five percent (25%) per
year as provided in the agreement
with the provider of the Credit Support Instrument. Holders of variable
rate Notes may be given the right
to tender their variable rate Notes
for purchase by the City at the
times, on the terms, and subject to
the conditions set forth in the Cer-

58
tificate of Award and any tender
agreement; provided that tender
rights shall be exercisable only at
such times as a Credit Support
Instrument is in place that provides
for the payment of the purchase
price payable to the tendering holder of a variable rate Note. If the
Director of Finance designates any
Notes as variable rate Notes, and if
the holders of the variable rate
Notes are to be entitled to tender the
variable rate Notes for purchase,
then the Director of Finance shall
also designate in the Certificate of
Award for those variable rate Notes
the provider or providers for any
Credit Support Instrument, the tender agent or agents and the remarketing agent or agents, which designations shall be based on the
determination of the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed
to provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable. The Director of Finance is authorized to enter
into agreements in connection with
the delivery of the variable rate
Notes, and from time to time thereafter so long as the variable rate
Notes
are
outstanding,
with
providers of Credit Support Instruments, tender agents (which may be
the Trustee), remarketing agents,
and others as may be determined by
the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a financial
advisor, to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the method of
determining the variable interest
rates, permitting holders the right
of tender, providing for liquidity or
credit support for the payment of
the variable rate Notes upon tender
for purchase or redemption, and providing for the repayment by the
City of any amounts drawn under
the Credit Support Instrument. The
Trustee shall be the authenticating
agent, registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Notes. The
Notes shall be signed by the officials of the City and in the manner
set forth in the Indenture. The Notes
shall first be offered for purchase to
the Trustees of the Sinking Fund
and, if not purchased by them, shall
be offered to the Treasury Investment Account for purchase and, if
not purchased for that Account,
shall be sold at not less than par
and accrued interest to one or more
firms that have proposed to underwrite the Notes and have been
selected by the Director of Finance
based on an evaluation of the qualifications of those firms (the “Note
Purchaser”) in the principal amount
set forth in a certificate of award to
be executed by the Director of
Finance (the “Note Certificate of
Award”). The proceeds of such sale
shall be paid into the proper fund
or funds set forth in the Note Certificate of Award and used for the
purpose for which the Notes are
being issued under the provisions of
this Ordinance.
Section 9. Official Statement; Continuing Disclosure. If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a
disclosure document (each, an “Official Statement”) is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the

The City Record
sale of the Notes or the Series 2008
Bonds, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare or cause to be
prepared on behalf of the City an
Official Statement with respect to
the Notes or the Series 2008 Bonds,
as the case may be, and any necessary supplements and to authorize
the use and distribution of each
Official Statement and any supplements. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign on behalf of the
City and in her official capacity
each Official Statement and any supplements approved by her. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign and deliver on behalf of the
City and in her official capacity
such certificates in connection with
the accuracy of each Official Statement and any supplements as may,
in her judgment, be necessary or
appropriate. The Director of Finance
is also authorized to determine and
certify on behalf of the City that
such disclosure document is “deemed
final” by the City within the meaning of Securities and Exchange
Commission Rule 15c2-12 the “SEC
Rule.”) The Director of Finance is
authorized to contract for services
for the production and distribution
of preliminary and final Official
Statements, including by printed
and electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Notes or the Series 2008
Bonds, the City agrees, in accordance with, and as the only obligated person with respect to the
Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds
under the SEC Rule, to provide or
cause to be provided such financial
information and operating data and
notices, in such manner as may be
required for purposes of the SEC
Rule. In order to describe and specify certain terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Director of
Finance is authorized and directed
to prepare, or cause to be prepared,
and to sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the
continuing
disclosure
agreement
made by the City for the benefit of
the holders and beneficial owners of
the Notes or the Series 2008 Bonds,
as the case may be, in accordance
with the SEC Rule. The performance
of that agreement shall be subject
to the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to
establish procedures in order to
ensure compliance by the City with
its continuing disclosure agreement,
including the timely provision of
information and notices.
Section 10.
Federal Tax Covenants.
The City covenants that it
will use, and will restrict the use
and investment of, the proceeds of
the Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds
in such manner and to such extent
as may be necessary so that (a) the
Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds will
not (i) constitute private activity
bonds, arbitrage bonds or hedge
bonds under Sections 141, 148 or 149
of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the Code) or (ii)

444

March 5, 2008
be treated other than as bonds to
which Section 103(a) of the Code
applies, and (b) the interest thereon will not be treated as an item of
tax preference under Section 57 of
the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the Notes
and the Series 2008 Bonds to be and
to remain excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will not take or authorize to be taken any actions that
would adversely affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting
for it, will, among other acts of compliance, (i) apply the proceeds of
the Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds
to the governmental purpose of the
borrowing, (ii) restrict the yield on
investment property acquired with
those proceeds, (iii) make timely
and adequate payments to the federal
government,
(iv)
maintain
books and records and make calculations and reports, and (v) refrain
from certain uses of those proceeds,
and,
as
applicable,
of
property
financed with such proceeds, all in
such manner and to the extent necessary to assure such exclusion of
that interest under the Code.
The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer of
the City having responsibility for
issuance of the Notes and the Series
2008 Bonds, is hereby authorized (a)
to make or effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent,
approval, or waiver on behalf of the
City with respect to the Notes and
the Series 2008 Bonds as the City is
permitted or required to make or
give under the federal income tax
laws, including, without limitation
thereto, any of the elections provided for in Section 148(f)(4)(C) of the
Code or available under Section 148
of the Code, for the purpose of
assuring, enhancing or protecting
favorable tax treatment or status of
the Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds
or interest thereon or assisting compliance with requirements for that
purpose, reducing the burden or
expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or payments
or penalties, or making payments of
special amounts in lieu of making
computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as rebate, or
obviating those amounts or payments, as determined by that officer,
which action shall be in writing and
signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf
of the City, as may be appropriate
to assure the exclusion of interest
from gross income and the intended
tax status of the Notes and the
Series 2008 Bonds, and (c) to give
one or more appropriate certificates
of the City, for inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Notes
and the Series 2008 Bonds, setting
forth the reasonable expectations of
the City regarding the amount and
use of all the proceeds of the Notes
and the Series 2008 Bonds, the facts,
circumstances
and
estimates
on
which they are based, and other
facts and circumstances relevant to
the tax treatment of the interest on
and the tax status of the Notes and
the Series 2008 Bonds.

March 5, 2008
Section 11.
Credit Facilities and
Ratings. If the Director of Finance
determines it to be in the best interests of the City, based on the written advice of a financial advisor, the
Director of Finance may obtain an
insurance policy, letter of credit,
standby bond purchase agreement
or other credit enhancement instrument as further security for the payment when due of the principal of
and interest on all or any portion of
the Series 2008 Bonds or Notes (a
“Credit Support Instrument”). The
Director of Finance may request a
rating on the Series 2008 Bonds or
Notes from one or more nationally
recognized rating organizations, and
do any and all things and take any
and all actions required to secure a
Credit Support Instrument and/or a
rating or ratings on the Series 2008
Bonds or Notes. The Director of
Finance may enter into one or more
agreements
for
Credit
Support
Instruments containing terms not
materially inconsistent with this
Ordinance or the Indenture. The

Ord. No. 122-08.
By Council Member Sweeney (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the issuance and sale of bonds
in the maximum principal amount of
$2,450,000 for the purpose of providing funds for improving municipal
cemetery facilities and authorizing
related matters.
Whereas, this Council desires to
issue bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed Two Million Four Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($2,450,000) (the “Series 2008
Bonds”) to finance the costs of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1; and
Whereas, the Series 2008 Bonds
shall be payable from and secured
by income tax revenues of the City
remaining after deposits required
under the General Bond Ordinance
(as defined in Section 2) are made
to the escrow agent for the City’s
general obligation bonds; and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of this City, has certified to this Council that the estimated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be financed with
the proceeds of the Series 2008
Bonds is at least five (5) years, as
evidenced by the certificate contained in File No. 122-08-A; and
Whereas, the authorization for
issuance of the Series 2008 Bonds is
necessary to provide funds to pay
the
costs
of
certain
permanent
improvements described in Section 1
that are urgently needed for the
benefit of the City, and as a result,
this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the
immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety, and for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary to issue the Series 2008
Bonds in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed Two Million
Four Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($2,450,000) for the purpose of
providing
funds
for
improving
municipal cemetery facilities, buildings, structures and grounds by constructing, reconstructing, installing,
enlarging, renovating, and rehabilitating
buildings,
structures
and
grounds, including clearing, grading
and excavating land, reconstructing,
installing, renovating, and rehabilitating septic system, drainage and
sewer facilities, installing access
roadways including any necessary
bridges and culverts, installing utility lines, laying out and numbering
burial plots, and planting and landscaping, together with all necessary
and incidental appurtenances and
the acquisition of any required real
estate and interests in real estate,
and to pay any capitalized interest
and all expenses incurred in connection with the issuance of the
securities, including all financing
costs within the meaning of Section
133.01(K) of the Revised Code and
such other costs of the foregoing
permanent improvements that may
be financed with the proceeds of
securities as permitted by Section
133.15(B) of the Ohio Revised Code
and as otherwise permitted by law.

60
Section 2. Authority, Security and
Source of Payment. The Series 2008
Bonds shall be issued pursuant to
the Ohio Constitution, Chapter 133 of
the Ohio Revised Code, the Charter
of the City, and this Ordinance for
the purpose stated in Section 1. The
Series 2008 Bonds shall be payable
from and secured by the income tax
revenues of the City on a basis subordinate to the security given to the
general obligation bonds of the City
under Ordinance No. 1749-80 passed
by the Council on October 8, 1980, as
amended by Ordinance No. 1112-83
passed by the Council on May 6,
1983,
and
Ordinance
No.
944-96,
passed by the Council on June 10,
1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so
amended and as the same may further be amended from time to time
in accordance with its provisions, is
referred to as the “General Bond
Ordinance”). The debt service on the
Series 2008 Bonds shall be payable
from income tax collections remaining after depositing with the escrow
agent under the General Bond Ordinance the amount required for the
payment of debt service on the
City’s
general
obligation
bonds
issued and outstanding, from time to
time, under the General Bond Ordinance. The Series 2008 Bonds shall
be issued and secured under the
terms of the Trust Indenture (the
“Indenture”) between the City and
U.S. Bank National Association, as
trustee (the “Trustee”) in substantially the form on file with the
Clerk of Council in the File No. referenced in the preambles of this
Ordinance, with such completions
and changes as may be consistent
with this Ordinance and the Certificate of Award identified in Section
4 and approved by the Director of
Finance as not being adverse to the
City, the Director’s signing and
delivery of the Indenture being conclusive evidence of that determination. The Indenture permits the
issuance of additional bonds, subject
to certain restrictions. Any additional issues of bonds, together with
the Series 2008 Bonds, are referred
to in this Ordinance and in the
Indenture as the “Bonds.”
Section 3.
Pledge and Covenant
to Maintain Income Tax. So long as
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City pledges the
municipal income taxes of the City
and grants a lien thereon, subordinate to the lien granted in the General Bond Ordinance as security for
the general obligation bonds of the
City issued and outstanding under
the General Bond Ordinance, to the
full extent required to meet debt
charges
payable
on
the
Bonds
issued and outstanding under the
Indenture and to pay any debt
charges on Parity Obligations (as
defined in the Indenture). The City
covenants to appropriate annually
sufficient amounts from the income
taxes for such purpose.
The City
further covenants that so long as
any Bonds are outstanding under
the Indenture, the City shall not
repeal or amend, or suffer the repeal
of, any ordinance for the levy or collection of its income taxes in any
manner or to such extent that the
City would not be able to meet its
obligations to the holders of the
Bonds.

The City Record
Section 4.
Terms of the Series
2008 Bonds. The Series 2008 Bonds
shall be issued in fully registered
form. The Series 2008 Bonds initially shall be delivered only in bookentry form, shall be registered in
the name of the Depository (as
defined in the Indenture) or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository, and shall not be transferable
or exchangeable (except for transfer to another Depository or its nominee) without further action by the
City pursuant to the provisions of
the Indenture and the First Supplement identified below. The Series
2008 Bonds shall be designated
“Cemeteries
Improvement
Bonds,
Series 2008” and may contain such
further designation as provided in
the Certificate of Award identified
below. The Series 2008 Bonds shall
be issued in one lot as fully registered Series 2008 Bonds in denominations of $5,000 or any whole multiple thereof. The Series 2008 Bonds
shall be numbered as determined by
the Director of Finance. The Series
2008 Bonds shall be signed by the
officials of the City and in the manner set forth in the Indenture.
The Series 2008 Bonds shall be
dated as of April 1, 2008, or such
other date, but in no event later
than December 31, 2009, specified in
the certificate of award providing
for the final terms of the Series 2008
Bonds and the sale of the Series
2008 Bonds in accordance with this
Ordinance
(the
“Certificate
of
Award”). The Series 2008 Bonds
shall be issued in the principal
amount specified in the Certificate
of Award, which shall not exceed
the amount stated in Section 1. The
Series 2008 Bonds shall bear interest
from their date until the principal
amount is paid at the rate or rates
per year specified in the Certificate
of Award, provided that the weighted average of such rates (taking
into account the principal amount
and maturity of each Bond to which
a rate applies) shall not exceed six
percent (6%) per year. Interest on
the Series 2008 Bonds shall be
payable semi-annually on the dates
specified in the Certificate of Award
(the “Interest Payment Dates”).
The
Series
2008
Bonds
shall
mature in the years and principal
amounts set forth in the Certificate
of Award, provided that (i) each
principal payment shall occur on an
Interest Payment Date, (ii) the first
principal payment on the Series 2008
Bonds shall be no later than December 15, 2010, and (iii) the final maturity date of the Series 2008 Bonds
shall be no later than December 15,
2030.
The Series 2008 Bonds stated to
mature in any year may be issued
as serial Series 2008 Bonds or as
term Series 2008 Bonds payable prior
to stated maturity pursuant to sinking fund redemption (the “Term
Bonds”). The Director of Finance
shall determine in the Certificate of
Award whether any of the Series
2008 Bonds shall be issued as Term
Bonds, any dates (the “Mandatory
Redemption Dates”) on which the
principal amount of the Term Bonds
shall be payable pursuant to mandatory
sinking
fund
installments
rather than at stated maturity and

446

March 5, 2008
the amount of principal to be paid
on
each
Mandatory
Redemption
Date (the “Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements”). If any
of the Series 2008 Bonds are issued
as Term Series 2008 Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be redeemed pursuant
to the Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption
Requirements
at
a
redemption price of 100 percent of
the principal amount redeemed, plus
interest accrued to the redemption
date, on the Mandatory Redemption
Dates. The aggregate of the moneys
to be deposited with the Trustee for
payment of principal of and interest
on any Term Bonds shall include
amounts sufficient to redeem on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates the
principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided in
the Indenture and the First Supplement).
The Series 2008 Bonds may be subject to redemption prior to maturity
by and at the option of the City, in
whole or in part on any date, in
whole multiples of $5,000, on the
optional redemption dates and at the
redemption prices (expressed as a
percentage of the principal amount
redeemed) specified in the Certificate of Award, plus, in each case,
accrued interest to the redemption
date. The first optional redemption
date, if any, shall not be later than
ten years from the first Interest
Payment Date, and the highest
redemption
price
shall
not
be
greater than 102% of the principal
amount redeemed plus accrued interest to the redemption date. Based on
the written advice of a financial
advisor, the Director of Finance may
determine
in
the
Certificate
of
Award that it is in the best interests of the City for some or all of
the Series 2008 Bonds not to be
callable prior to their stated maturity.
If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the City
may have the option to purchase
any Bond which is redeemable by
optional redemption at a purchase
price not less than the redemption
price that would be payable if that
Bond were called for optional redemption on the date of the proposed purchase. That election shall
be exercised as provided in the First
Supplement.
If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the Series
2008 Bonds may be secured by a
Debt Service Reserve Fund to be
held by the Trustee under the Indenture. The principal amount of
the Series 2008 Bonds may include
provision for funding the Debt Service Reserve Fund from the proceeds of the Bonds, subject to compliance with applicable federal tax
laws.

2008 Bonds and have been selected

March 5, 2008

Requirements), any optional redemption
dates, the Interest Payment Dates
and the date of the Series 2008
Bonds (if different from those set
forth in Section 3) and any other

to be set forth in that Certificate. As

Director of Finance is authorized to
sign and deliver on behalf of the
City a bond purchase agreement
between the City and the Original
Purchaser
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, setting forth the terms and
conditions on which the City agrees
to sell the Series 2008 Bonds and the
Original Purchaser agrees to buy
the Series 2008 Bonds on terms consistent with this Ordinance and the
Indenture, that are not substantially adverse to the City and that are
approved by the Director of Finance
on behalf of the City, all of which
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Bond Purchase
Agreement or amendments to the
Bond Purchase Agreement by the
Director of Finance. It is determined
that the terms of the Series 2008
Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance
and as may be provided in or pursuant to the Certificate of Award,
the Indenture and the First Supple-

authorized to sign and deliver on
behalf of the City a supplemental
indenture (the “First Supplement”),
supplementing the Indenture to provide procedures for the authentication, registration and transfer of the

Director of Finance as not substantially adverse to the City. The First
Supplement shall be approved as to
form and correctness by the Director of Law. The determination by
the Director of Finance that the provisions of the First Supplement are
not substantially adverse to the City
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the Director’s signing of the First
Amendment. As appropriate under
the Charter, the Mayor, the Director
of Finance, the Director of Law, the
Clerk of Council and other appropriate officers of the City are, and
each of them is, authorized to sign,

such documents, certifications and
instruments
in

to
the
Indenture and First Supplement as
may be necessary or appropriate to
issue and sell the Series 2008 Bonds
and to consummate the transactions
authorized by this Ordinance.
Section 8. Bond Anticipation Notes.
For the purpose of raising money in
anticipation of the issuance of the
Series 2008 Bonds for the purpose
set forth in Section 1, notes of the
City may be issued in an aggregate
principal amount not to exceed Two
Million Four Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars
($2,450,000)
(the
“Notes”) upon the direction of the
Director of Finance to be set forth
in a certificate providing for the
final terms of the Notes and the sale
of the Notes and signed by the
Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate of Award”). The Notes, if
sold as fixed rate obligations, shall
bear interest at such rate, not
exceeding six percent (6%) per
year, and shall be payable on the

447

61
date or dates, as shall be determined
by the Director of Finance of the
City in the Note Certificate of
Award; shall be dated their date of
issuance; shall mature on the date
set forth in the Note Certificate of
Award; shall be subject to redemption by the City at any time prior
to maturity without penalty, unless
the Director of Finance, based on
the advice of a financial advisor,
determines that it is in the best
interest of the City in order to
enhance the marketability of the
Notes, that the Notes not be redeemable prior to maturity; shall be
designated
“Cemeteries
Improvement Bond Anticipation Notes” or as
otherwise provided in the Note Certificate of Award; shall be issued in
such numbers and denominations as
may be requested by the Note Purchaser (hereinafter defined); and
shall be issued in fully registered
form (which may be in a book entry
only system) in denominations of
$5,000 or whole multiples thereof.
The provisions of Sections 9.98 to
9.983 of the Revised Code shall
apply to the Notes and pursuant to
that authority and this Ordinance,
the Director of Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award,
based on the written advice of a
financial advisor, that the City’s
best interests will be served by
causing all or a portion of the Notes
to be obligations bearing interest at
variable rates, redeemable by the
City without penalty or premium on
interest adjustment dates. If the
Director of Finance so determines,
then the Director of Finance shall
specify in the Certificate of Award
the method and procedure by which
the variable rate of interest to be
borne by the variable rate Notes
shall be determined, whether by reference to a market index, by a
remarketing agent or otherwise; provided that the variable rate Notes
shall not bear interest at a rate in
excess of sixteen percent (16%) per
year. Notwithstanding that limitation, Notes held by a provider of a
Credit
Support
Instrument
(as
defined in Section 11) may bear
interest at a rate not in excess of
twenty-five percent (25%) per year
as provided in the agreement with
the provider of the Credit Support
Instrument. Holders of variable rate
Notes may be given the right to tender their variable rate Notes for
purchase by the City at the times,
on the terms, and subject to the conditions set forth in the Certificate of
Award and any tender agreement;
provided that tender rights shall be
exercisable only at such times as a
Credit Support Instrument is in
place that provides for the payment
of the purchase price payable to the
tendering holder of a variable rate
Note. If the Director of Finance designates any Notes as variable rate
Notes, and if the holders of the variable rate Notes are to be entitled to
tender the variable rate Notes for
purchase,
then
the
Director
of
Finance shall also designate in the
Certificate of Award for those variable rate Notes the provider or
providers for any Credit Support
Instrument, the tender agent or
agents and the remarketing agent
or agents, which designations shall
be based on the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advi-

62
sor, that the parties so designated
possess the requisite resources and
experience to provide the services
required of them and that the terms
on which the designated parties
have agreed to provide such services are fair and commercially reasonable. The Director of Finance is
authorized to enter into agreements
in connection with the delivery of
the variable rate Notes, and from
time to time thereafter so long as
the variable rate Notes are outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support Instruments, tender agents
(which may be the Trustee), remarketing agents, and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a financial advisor, to be
necessary or appropriate to provide
for the method of determining the
variable interest rates, permitting
holders the right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support
for the payment of the variable rate
Notes upon tender for purchase or
redemption, and providing for the
repayment by the City of any
amounts drawn under the Credit
Support Instrument. The Trustee
shall be the authenticating agent,
registrar, transfer agent and paying
agent for the Notes. The Notes shall
be signed by the officials of the City
and in the manner set forth in the
Indenture. The Notes shall first be
offered for purchase to the Trustees
of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by them, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account
for purchase and, if not purchased
for that Account, shall be sold at not
less than par and accrued interest
to one or more firms that have proposed to underwrite the Notes and
have been selected by the Director
of Finance based on an evaluation
of the qualifications of those firms
(the “Note Purchaser”) in the principal amount set forth in a certificate of award to be executed by the
Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate of Award”). The proceeds of
such sale shall be paid into the
proper fund or funds set forth in the
Note Certificate of Award and used
for the purpose for which the Notes
are being issued under the provisions of this Ordinance.
Section 9. Official Statement; Continuing Disclosure. If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a
disclosure document (each, an “Official Statement”) is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
sale of the Notes or the Series 2008
Bonds, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare or cause to be
prepared on behalf of the City an
Official Statement with respect to
the Notes or the Series 2008 Bonds,
as the case may be, and any necessary supplements and to authorize
the use and distribution of each
Official Statement and any supplements. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign on behalf of the
City and in her official capacity
each Official Statement and any supplements approved by her. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign and deliver on behalf of the
City and in her official capacity
such certificates in connection with
the accuracy of each Official Statement and any supplements as may,
in her judgment, be necessary or
appropriate. The Director of Finance
is also authorized to determine and

The City Record
certify on behalf of the City that
such disclosure document is “deemed
final” by the City within the meaning of Securities and Exchange
Commission Rule 15c2-12 the “SEC
Rule.”) The Director of Finance is
authorized to contract for services
for the production and distribution
of preliminary and final Official
Statements, including by printed
and electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Notes or the Series 2008
Bonds, the City agrees, in accordance with, and as the only obligated person with respect to the
Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds
under the SEC Rule, to provide or
cause to be provided such financial
information and operating data and
notices, in such manner as may be
required for purposes of the SEC
Rule. In order to describe and specify certain terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Director of
Finance is authorized and directed
to prepare, or cause to be prepared,
and to sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the
continuing
disclosure
agreement
made by the City for the benefit of
the holders and beneficial owners of
the Notes or the Series 2008 Bonds,
as the case may be, in accordance
with the SEC Rule. The performance
of that agreement shall be subject
to the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it. The Director of

Federal Tax Covenants.
The City covenants that it
will use, and will restrict the use
and investment of, the proceeds of
the Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds
in such manner and to such extent
as may be necessary so that (a) the
Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds will
not (i) constitute private activity
bonds, arbitrage bonds or hedge
bonds under Sections 141, 148 or 149
of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the Code) or (ii)
be treated other than as bonds to
which Section 103(a) of the Code
applies, and (b) the interest thereon will not be treated as an item of
tax preference under Section 57 of
the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the Notes
and the Series 2008 Bonds to be and
to remain excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will not take or authorize to be taken any actions that
would adversely affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting
for it, will, among other acts of compliance, (i) apply the proceeds of
the Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds
to the governmental purpose of the
borrowing, (ii) restrict the yield on
investment property acquired with
those proceeds, (iii) make timely

March 5, 2008
and adequate payments to the federal
government,
(iv)
maintain
books and records and make calculations and reports, and (v) refrain
from certain uses of those proceeds,
and,
as
applicable,
of
property
financed with such proceeds, all in
such manner and to the extent necessary to assure such exclusion of
that interest under the Code.
The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer of
the City having responsibility for
issuance of the Notes and the Series
2008 Bonds, is hereby authorized (a)
to make or effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent,

permitted or required to make or
give under the federal income tax
laws, including, without limitation
thereto, any of the elections provided for in Section 148(f)(4)(C) of the
Code or available under Section 148
of the Code, for the purpose of
assuring, enhancing or protecting
favorable tax treatment or status of
the Notes and the Series 2008 Bonds
or interest thereon or assisting compliance with requirements for that
purpose, reducing the burden or
expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or payments
or penalties, or making payments of
special amounts in lieu of making
computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as rebate, or
obviating those amounts or payments, as determined by that officer,
which action shall be in writing and
signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf
of the City, as may be appropriate
to assure the exclusion of interest
from gross income and the intended
tax status of the Notes and the
Series 2008 Bonds, and (c) to give
one or more appropriate certificates
of the City, for inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Notes
and the Series 2008 Bonds, setting
forth the reasonable expectations of
the City regarding the amount and
use of all the proceeds of the Notes
and the Series 2008 Bonds, the facts,
circumstances
and
estimates
on
which they are based, and other
facts and circumstances relevant to
the tax treatment of the interest on
and the tax status of the Notes and
the Series 2008 Bonds.

The City Record
be an independent section or part of
a section and, notwithstanding any

Ord. No. 123-08.
By Council Member Sweeney (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the issuance and sale of bonds
in the maximum principal amount of
$6,900,000 for the purpose of providing funds to improve municipal
parks and recreation facilities and
authorizing related matters.
Whereas, this Council desires to
issue bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed Six Million Nine Hundred Thousand Dollars
($6,900,000) (the “Series 2008 Bonds”)
to finance the costs of certain permanent improvements described in
Section 1; and

449

63
Whereas, the Series 2008 Bonds
shall be payable from and secured
by income tax revenues of the City
remaining after deposits required
under the General Bond Ordinance
(as defined in Section 2) are made
to the escrow agent for the City’s
general obligation bonds; and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of this City, has certified to this Council that the estimated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be financed with
the proceeds of the Series 2008
Bonds is at least five (5) years, as
evidenced by the certificate contained in File No. 123-08-A; and
Whereas, the authorization for
issuance of the Series 2008 Bonds is
necessary to provide funds to pay
the
costs
of
certain
permanent
improvements described in Section 1
that are urgently needed for the
benefit of the City, and as a result,
this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the
immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health and safety, and for the usual daily operation
of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary to issue the Series 2008
Bonds in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed Six Million
Nine Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($6,900,000) for the purpose of
providing funds to improve municipal parks and recreation facilities
by constructing, reconstructing, rehabilitating, installing, renovating,
enlarging and otherwise improving
parks and recreation centers and
areas, pools, skating rinks, greenhouses, bicycle paths, playgrounds,
playfields, tracks, fields and related
buildings, structures, walkways, pavement and facilities, and providing
necessary water systems, drainage,
lighting, signage, fixtures, furnishings, equipment, safety modifications and site improvements, together with all necessary and incidental
appurtenances and the acquisition
of any required real estate and
interests in real estate and the
demolition of any existing buildings,
structures,
walkways
and
facilities, and to pay any capitalized
interest and all expenses incurred in
connection with the issuance of the
securities, including all financing
costs within the meaning of Section
133.01(K) of the Revised Code and
such other costs of the foregoing
permanent improvements that may
be financed with the proceeds of
securities as permitted by Section
133.15(B) of the Ohio Revised Code
and as otherwise permitted by law.
Section 2. Authority, Security and
Source of Payment. The Series 2008
Bonds shall be issued pursuant to
the Ohio Constitution, Chapter 133 of
the Ohio Revised Code, the Charter
of the City, and this Ordinance for
the purpose stated in Section 1. The
Series 2008 Bonds shall be payable
from and secured by the income tax
revenues of the City on a basis subordinate to the security given to the
general obligation bonds of the City
under Ordinance No. 1749-80 passed
by the Council on October 8, 1980, as
amended by Ordinance No. 1112-83
passed by the Council on May 6,
1983,
and
Ordinance
No.
944-96,
passed by the Council on June 10,

64
1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so
amended and as the same may further be amended from time to time
in accordance with its provisions, is
referred to as the “General Bond
Ordinance”). The debt service on the
Series 2008 Bonds shall be payable
from income tax collections remaining after depositing with the escrow
agent under the General Bond Ordinance the amount required for the
payment of debt service on the
City’s
general
obligation
bonds
issued and outstanding, from time to
time, under the General Bond Ordinance. The Series 2008 Bonds shall
be issued and secured under the
terms of the Trust Indenture (the
“Indenture”) between the City and
U.S. Bank National Association, as
trustee (the “Trustee”) in substantially the form on file with the
Clerk of Council in the File No. referenced in the preambles of this
Ordinance, with such completions
and changes as may be consistent
with this Ordinance and the Certificate of Award identified in Section
4 and approved by the Director of
Finance as not being adverse to the
City, the Director’s signing and
delivery of the Indenture being conclusive evidence of that determination. The Indenture permits the
issuance of additional bonds, subject
to certain restrictions. Any additional issues of bonds, together with
the Series 2008 Bonds, are referred
to in this Ordinance and in the
Indenture as the “Bonds.”
Section 3.
Pledge and Covenant
to Maintain Income Tax. So long as
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City pledges the
municipal income taxes of the City
and grants a lien thereon, subordinate to the lien granted in the General Bond Ordinance as security for
the general obligation bonds of the
City issued and outstanding under
the General Bond Ordinance, to the
full extent required to meet debt
charges
payable
on
the
Bonds
issued and outstanding under the
Indenture and to pay any debt
charges on Parity Obligations (as
defined in the Indenture). The City
covenants to appropriate annually
sufficient amounts from the income
taxes for such purpose. The City further covenants that so long as any
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City shall not repeal
or amend, or suffer the repeal of,
any ordinance for the levy or collection of its income taxes in any
manner or to such extent that the
City would not be able to meet its
obligations to the holders of the
Bonds.
Section 4.
Terms of the Series
2008 Bonds. The Series 2008 Bonds
shall be issued in fully registered
form. The Series 2008 Bonds initially shall be delivered only in bookentry form, shall be registered in
the name of the Depository (as
defined in the Indenture) or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository, and shall not be transferable
or exchangeable (except for transfer to another Depository or its nominee) without further action by the
City pursuant to the provisions of
the Indenture and the First Supplement identified below. The Series
2008 Bonds shall be designated
“Parks and Recreation Facilities
Improvement Bonds, Series 2008”

The City Record
and may contain such further designation as provided in the Certificate of Award identified below. The
Series 2008 Bonds shall be issued in
one lot as fully registered Series
2008 Bonds in denominations of
$5,000 or any whole multiple thereof. The Series 2008 Bonds shall be
numbered as determined by the
Director of Finance. The Series 2008
Bonds shall be signed by the officials of the City and in the manner
set forth in the Indenture.
The Series 2008 Bonds shall be
dated as of April 1, 2008, or such
other date, but in no event later
than December 31, 2009, specified in
the certificate of award providing
for the final terms of the Series 2008
Bonds and the sale of the Series
2008 Bonds in accordance with this
Ordinance
(the
“Certificate
of
Award”). The Series 2008 Bonds
shall be issued in the principal
amount specified in the Certificate
of Award, which shall not exceed
the amount stated in Section 1. The
Series 2008 Bonds shall bear interest
from their date until the principal
amount is paid at the rate or rates
per year specified in the Certificate
of Award, provided that the weighted average of such rates (taking
into account the principal amount
and maturity of each Bond to which
a rate applies) shall not exceed six
percent (6%) per year. Interest on
the Series 2008 Bonds shall be
payable semi-annually on the dates
specified in the Certificate of Award
(the “Interest Payment Dates”).
The
Series
2008
Bonds
shall
mature in the years and principal
amounts set forth in the Certificate
of Award, provided that (i) each
principal payment shall occur on an
Interest Payment Date, (ii) the first
principal payment on the Series 2008
Bonds shall be no later than December 15, 2010, and (iii) the final maturity date of the Series 2008 Bonds
shall be no later than December 15,
2030.
The Series 2008 Bonds stated to
mature in any year may be issued
as serial Series 2008 Bonds or as
term Series 2008 Bonds payable
prior to stated maturity pursuant
to sinking fund redemption (the
“Term Bonds”). The Director of
Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award whether any of
the Series 2008 Bonds shall be issued
as Term Bonds, any dates (the
“Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on
which the principal amount of the
Term Bonds shall be payable pursuant to mandatory sinking fund
installments rather than at stated
maturity and the amount of principal to be paid on each Mandatory
Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements”). If any of the Series
2008 Bonds are issued as Term
Series 2008 Bonds, the Term Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to the
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements at a redemption
price of 100 percent of the principal
amount
redeemed,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date, on
the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to be
deposited with the Trustee for payment of principal of and interest on
any
Term
Bonds
shall
include
amounts sufficient to redeem on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates the
principal amount of Term Bonds

450

March 5, 2008
payable on those dates pursuant to
the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided in
the Indenture and the First Supplement).
The Series 2008 Bonds may be subject to redemption prior to maturity
by and at the option of the City, in
whole or in part on any date, in
whole multiples of $5,000, on the
optional redemption dates and at the
redemption prices (expressed as a
percentage of the principal amount
redeemed) specified in the Certificate of Award, plus, in each case,
accrued interest to the redemption
date. The first optional redemption
date, if any, shall not be later than
ten years from the first Interest
Payment Date, and the highest
redemption
price
shall
not
be
greater than 102% of the principal
amount redeemed plus accrued interest to the redemption date. Based on
the written advice of a financial
advisor, the Director of Finance may
determine
in
the
Certificate
of
Award that it is in the best interests of the City for some or all of
the Series 2008 Bonds not to be
callable prior to their stated maturity.
If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the City
may have the option to purchase
any Bond which is redeemable by
optional redemption at a purchase
price not less than the redemption
price that would be payable if that
Bond
were
called
for
optional
redemption on the date of the proposed purchase. That election shall
be exercised as provided in the First
Supplement.
If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the Series
2008 Bonds may be secured by a
Debt Service Reserve Fund to be
held by the Trustee under the Indenture. The principal amount of the
Series 2008 Bonds may include provision for funding the Debt Service
Reserve Fund from the proceeds of
the Bonds, subject to compliance
with applicable federal tax laws.
Section 5.
Sale of Series 2008
Bonds. The Series 2008 Bonds shall
first be offered for purchase to the
Trustees of the Sinking Fund and,
if not purchased by them, shall be
offered to the Treasury Investment
Account for purchase and, if not purchased for that Account, shall be
sold to one or more firms that have
proposed to underwrite the Series
2008 Bonds and have been selected
by the Director of Finance based on
an evaluation of the qualifications
of those firms (collectively, the
“Original Purchaser”).
The Series 2008 Bonds shall be
awarded to the Original Purchaser
in the Certificate of Award which
shall specify the final terms of the
Series 2008 Bonds in accordance
with law, the provisions of this Ordinance, the written advice of a financial advisor retained under authority of Section 12 and the Original
Purchaser’s offer to purchase the
Series 2008 Bonds, including: the
principal amount of the Series 2008
Bonds, the purchase price (which
shall be not less than 97% of the
principal amount plus accrued interest to their date of delivery), interest rate or rates, the amounts and
years in which principal install-

Fund
Redemption
Requirements), any optional redemption
dates, the Interest Payment Dates
and the date of the Series 2008
Bonds (if different from those set
forth in Section 3) and any other
matters required in this Ordinance
to be set forth in that Certificate. As

by this Ordinance and to take all
steps necessary to effect the due
execution, authentication and delivery of the Series 2008 Bonds. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign and deliver on behalf of the
City a bond purchase agreement
between the City and the Original
Purchaser
(the
“Bond
Purchase
Agreement”), approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, setting forth the terms and
conditions on which the City agrees
to sell the Series 2008 Bonds and the
Original Purchaser agrees to buy
the Series 2008 Bonds on terms consistent with this Ordinance and the
Indenture, that are not substantially adverse to the City and that are
approved by the Director of Finance
on behalf of the City, all of which
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Bond Purchase
Agreement or amendments to the
Bond Purchase Agreement by the
Director of Finance. It is determined
that the terms of the Series 2008
Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance
and as may be provided in or pursuant to the Certificate of Award,
the Indenture and the First Supplement, are in the best interest of the
City and in compliance with all
legal requirements.

Section 8. Bond Anticipation Notes.
For the purpose of raising money in
anticipation of the issuance of the
Series 2008 Bonds for the purpose
set forth in Section 1, notes of the
City may be issued in an aggregate
principal amount not to exceed Six
Million Nine Hundred Thousand Dollars ($6,900,000) (the “Notes”) upon
the direction of the Director of
Finance to be set forth in a certificate providing for the final terms of
the Notes and the sale of the Notes
and signed by the Director of
Finance (the “Note Certificate of
Award”). The Notes, if sold as fixed
rate obligations, shall bear interest
at such rate, not exceeding six percent (6%) per year, and shall be
payable on the date or dates, as
shall be determined by the Director
of Finance of the City in the Note
Certificate of Award; shall be dated
their date of issuance; shall mature
on the date set forth in the Note Certificate of Award; shall be subject
to redemption by the City at any
time
prior
to
maturity
without
penalty,
unless
the
Director
of
Finance, based on the advice of a
financial advisor, determines that it
is in the best interest of the City in
order to enhance the marketability
of the Notes, that the Notes not be
redeemable prior to maturity; shall
be designated “Parks and Recreation Facilities Improvement Bond
Anticipation Notes” or as otherwise

451

65
provided in the Note Certificate of
Award; shall be issued in such numbers and denominations as may be
requested by the Note Purchaser
(hereinafter defined); and shall be
issued in fully registered form
(which may be in a book entry only
system) in denominations of $5,000
or whole multiples thereof. The provisions of Sections 9.98 to 9.983 of
the Revised Code shall apply to the
Notes and pursuant to that authority and this Ordinance, the Director
of Finance may determine in the
Certificate of Award, based on the
written advice of a financial advisor, that the City’s best interests
will be served by causing all or a
portion of the Notes to be obligations bearing interest at variable
rates, redeemable by the City without penalty or premium on interest
adjustment dates. If the Director of
Finance so determines, then the
Director of Finance shall specify in
the Certificate of Award the method
and procedure by which the variable
rate of interest to be borne by the
variable rate Notes shall be determined, whether by reference to a
market index, by a remarketing
agent or otherwise; provided that
the variable rate Notes shall not
bear interest at a rate in excess of
sixteen percent (16%) per year.
Notwithstanding
that
limitation,
Notes held by a provider of a Credit Support Instrument (as defined in
Section 11) may bear interest at a
rate not in excess of twenty-five percent (25%) per year as provided in
the agreement with the provider of
the Credit Support Instrument. Holders of variable rate Notes may be
given the right to tender their variable rate Notes for purchase by the
City at the times, on the terms, and
subject to the conditions set forth in
the Certificate of Award and any
tender agreement; provided that tender rights shall be exercisable only
at such times as a Credit Support
Instrument is in place that provides
for the payment of the purchase
price payable to the tendering holder of a variable rate Note. If the
Director of Finance designates any
Notes as variable rate Notes, and if
the holders of the variable rate
Notes are to be entitled to tender the
variable rate Notes for purchase,
then the Director of Finance shall
also designate in the Certificate of
Award for those variable rate Notes
the provider or providers for any
Credit Support Instrument, the tender agent or agents and the remarketing agent or agents, which designations shall be based on the
determination of the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed
to provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable. The Director of Finance is authorized to enter
into agreements in connection with
the delivery of the variable rate
Notes, and from time to time thereafter so long as the variable rate
Notes are outstanding, with providers
of Credit Support Instruments, tender
agents (which may be the Trustee),
remarketing agents, and others as

66
may be determined by the Director
of Finance, based on the written
advice of a financial advisor, to be
necessary or appropriate to provide
for the method of determining the
variable interest rates, permitting
holders the right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support
for the payment of the variable rate
Notes upon tender for purchase or
redemption, and providing for the
repayment by the City of any
amounts drawn under the Credit
Support Instrument. The Trustee
shall be the authenticating agent,
registrar, transfer agent and paying
agent for the Notes. The Notes shall
be signed by the officials of the City
and in the manner set forth in the
Indenture. The Notes shall first be
offered for purchase to the Trustees
of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by them, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account
for purchase and, if not purchased
for that Account, shall be sold at not
less than par and accrued interest
to one or more firms that have proposed to underwrite the Notes and
have been selected by the Director
of Finance based on an evaluation
of the qualifications of those firms
(the “Note Purchaser”) in the principal amount set forth in a certificate of award to be executed by the
Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate of Award”). The proceeds of
such sale shall be paid into the
proper fund or funds set forth in the
Note Certificate of Award and used
for the purpose for which the Notes
are being issued under the provisions of this Ordinance.

prepared on behalf of the City an
Official Statement with respect to
the Notes or the Series 2008 Bonds,

appropriate. The Director of Finance

certify on behalf of the City that
such disclosure document is “deemed
final” by the City within the meaning of Securities and Exchange
Commission Rule 15c2-12 the “SEC

authorized to contract for services
for the production and distribution

establish procedures in order to
ensure compliance by the City with
its continuing disclosure agreement,

series satisfy the requirements of

costs funded from the proceeds of
the
Refunding
Bonds.

that the issuance of the Refunding
Bonds for the purpose provided in
this Ordinance serves a proper, public, municipal purpose by reducing
the costs of air travel facilities serving the people of the City of Cleveland, thereby increasing and promoting commerce by providing necessary transportation for individuals
and
commercial
enterprises
purchasing and selling services and
products in northeastern Ohio, and
creating and preserving jobs and
employment opportunities in the
City and improving the economic
welfare of the City.
Section 3. Authorization of Hedging Arrangements.
This Council finds that by engaging
in
interest
rate
hedging
arrangements with respect to Revenue Bonds the City may reduce its
cost of borrowing by optimizing the
relative amounts of fixed and variable rate obligations, or minimizing
the risk of variations in its debt
service costs, or obtaining savings
by confirming rates of interest on
Revenue Bonds in advance of their
issuance. To permit the City to have
the flexibility to undertake interest
rate swap, swaption, rate cap, rate
collar and other hedging transactions, from time to time, and to
establish the procedures for approving those transactions, this Council
authorizes the signing and delivery
of one or more agreements (each, a
“Hedge Agreement”) and any related agreements necessary for the
consummation of the transactions
contemplated by each Hedge Agreement. The authorizations in this Section 3 are supplemental to and not
in derogation of any authority provided by any other ordinance of this
Council
concerning
hedging
arrangements.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is to the financial advantage of the City and in the City’s
best
interests
that
a
hedging
arrangement be undertaken by the
City with respect to any Revenue
Bonds issued or to be issued under
the
Indenture,
the
Director
of
Finance may authorize one or more
interest rate hedge transactions in
accordance
with
the
applicable
Hedge Agreement; provided that (a)
the counterparty shall be rated at
the time of signing the Hedge
Agreement not lower than A+ or A1
by at least one rating agency or its
obligations under the Hedge Agreement shall be guaranteed or insured
by an entity rated at the time of
signing the Hedge Agreement not
lower than A+ or A1 by at least one
rating agency, and (b) the term of
each hedge transaction shall not
exceed the final maturity of the

455

69
Revenue Bonds to which the hedge
relates.
The Director of Finance shall
negotiate the terms of each Hedge
Agreement with a counterparty satisfying the credit criteria in this
Ordinance. The City shall receive a
written opinion of a Financial Advisor that the payments made or to be
made by the counterparty to the
City, or by the City to the counterparty, shall be fair value for the
Hedge Agreement, given the credit
of the counterparty and the terms
and conditions of the Hedge Agreement. The Director of Finance shall
determine the terms and conditions
of the Hedge Agreement, including
without limitation, the time or times
and procedures for the exercise by
the counterparty or the City, as the
case may be, of its option under the
Hedge
Agreement,
whether
the
obligations of the City under the
Hedge Agreement shall be secured
by a Credit Support Instrument, and
the rates to be paid by the counterparty to the City and by the City to
the counterparty under the Hedge
Agreement in the event of the exercise of the option. The approval of
each interest rate hedge transaction
by the Director of Finance shall be
conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery of the applicable
Hedge Agreement by the Director of
Finance.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from
the
Airport
Revenues
as
defined in the Indenture and may be
payable also from other funds permitted by law to be used for the purpose, as identified by the Director of
Finance in the Hedge Agreement.
Those payments may be secured by
a pledge of Airport Revenues, to the
extent permitted by the Indenture,
all as determined by the Director of
Finance and set forth in the Hedge
Agreement. The obligation of the
City to make payments under any
Hedge Agreement does not and
shall not represent or constitute a
general obligation, debt, bonded
indebtedness or a pledge of the faith
and credit of the City or the State
of Ohio. Nothing gives any party to
any Hedge Agreement the right to
have excises, ad valorem or other
taxes levied by the City or the State
of Ohio for the payment of any
amounts due under any Hedge
Agreement.
Section 4.
Terms of Refunding
Bonds.
The Refunding Bonds shall contain the terms provided in or determined pursuant to, the Indenture,
this Ordinance, the applicable Certificate of Award and the applicable
Supplemental Indenture. Each series
of Refunding Bonds may be secured
by a separate Supplemental Indenture,
or
a
single
Supplemental
Indenture may secure more than one
series of Refunding Bonds.
(a) General. In the event that the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, determines that the City’s best
interests will be served by causing
a series of Refunding Bonds to be
obligations bearing interest at variable interest rates, then the Director of Finance is authorized to so
specify in the Certificate of Award
for that series. If the Director of

70
Finance so determines, then the
method and procedure by which the
variable rate of interest to be borne
by the Refunding Bonds of that
series shall be determined as provided in the applicable Supplemental Indenture, whether by auction,
by reference to a market index, by
a remarketing agent or otherwise,
provided that no series of variable
rate Refunding Bonds shall bear
interest at a rate in excess of twenty-five
percent
(25%)
per
year
(including any Refunding Bonds
held by a provider of a Credit Support Instrument). The Director of
Finance may determine that the
terms of a variable rate series of
Refunding Bonds may or may not
permit the holders to tender their
variable rate Refunding Bonds for
purchase by the City. If the Director of Finance designates any series
of Refunding Bonds as variable rate
Refunding Bonds, and if the Holders of that series of Refunding
Bonds are to be entitled to tender
those Refunding Bonds for purchase, then the Director of Finance
shall also designate for those variable rate Refunding Bonds (and
may designate others, from time to
time, in substitution therefor), the
tender agent or agents and the
remarketing agent or agents, which
designations shall be based on the
determination of the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed
to provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable. The Director of Finance is authorized to enter
into agreements in connection with
the
delivery
of
the
Refunding
Bonds, and from time to time thereafter so long as the Refunding
Bonds are outstanding, with providers of Credit Support Instruments, tender agents (which may be
the Trustee), remarketing agents
(which may be any of the Original
Purchasers) and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the method of
determining the variable interest
rates, permitting holders the right
of tender and providing for payment
of the purchase price of, or debt service on, the variable rate Refunding
Bonds. In the event the variable rate
Refunding Bonds are issued as auction rate obligations, the Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements, from time to time, with
auction agents and others, or to
cause the Trustee to enter into those
agreements, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor that
the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed
to provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of
any series of Refunding Bonds, and
regardless of whether that series of
Refunding Bonds bears interest at
variable or fixed rates, is authorized
to contract for a Credit Support

The City Record
Instrument, and to pay the costs of
it from proceeds of the Refunding
Bonds, if the Director determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the Credit
Support Instrument will result in a
savings in the cost of the financing
to the City.
(b) Form; Exchange and Transfer.
All Refunding Bonds shall be issued
in
fully
registered
form.
The
Refunding Bonds initially shall be
delivered only in book-entry form,
shall be registered in the name of
the Depository or its nominee, as
registered owner, and immobilized
in the custody of the Depository,
and shall not be transferable or
exchangeable (except for transfer to
another Depository or its nominee)
without further action by the City
pursuant to the provisions of the
Supplemental
Indenture.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Original Indenture, no
Refunding
Bonds
shall
be
exchanged for or transferable into a
coupon Revenue Bond or Bonds
unless and until the Indenture shall
have been amended in accordance
with the terms thereof to permit
such exchanges or transfers. To the
extent that the Original Indenture
(particularly, but without limitation,
Section 2.05) permits fully registered Revenue Bonds to be exchanged for or transferred into
coupon Revenue Bonds or Revenue
Bonds payable to bearer, then the
Original Indenture is amended to
prohibit such exchanges or transfers
for the Refunding Bonds unless and
until the Indenture shall have been
further amended to permit such
exchanges or transfers.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Refunding Bonds of any
series for use in a book entry system, the Director of Finance and the
Trustee may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance and the Trustee do not or
are unable to do so, the Director of
Finance and the Trustee, after making provision for notification of the
beneficial
owners
by
the
then
Depository and any other arrangements deemed necessary, shall permit withdrawal of the Refunding
Bonds of any series from the Depository, and authenticate and deliver
registered Bond certificates to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of action
or inaction of the City, of those persons requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into any agreements
determined by the Director to be
necessary in connection with the
book entry system for the Refunding Bonds, after determining that
those agreements will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
under the Indenture (as evidenced
by the Director’s signing of those
agreements).
(c) Dates; Denominations. The
Refunding Bonds of each series
shall be dated as of the date or
dates provided in the Certificate of
Award for that series. The Refunding Bonds of each series shall be

456

March 5, 2008
issued in the denominations permitted in the Supplemental Indenture
for that series.
(d) Interest and Place of Payment. The Refunding Bonds of each
series shall bear interest at their
respective interest rates specified in
the Certificate of Award (or, in the
case of variable rate Refunding
Bonds, determined pursuant to the
Supplemental Indenture) for that
series. Refunding Bonds of the same
series and same maturity may bear
interest at different interest rates.
The Refunding Bonds of each series
shall bear interest from the most
recent date to which interest has
been paid or duly provided for or, if
no interest has been paid or duly
provided for, from their date. The
principal and any redemption premium and the interest payable on
each series of Refunding Bonds
shall be payable at the times, to the
persons and in the manner set forth
in, or referenced by, the Supplemental Indenture, including, without
limitation, provisions thereof permitting special arrangements for
payments to the Depository.
(e) Maturities. The Refunding
Bonds of each series shall mature
on the dates and in the respective
principal amounts provided in the
Certificate
of
Award,
consistent
with this Ordinance and the Indenture.
(f) Optional and Mandatory Redemption. The Refunding Bonds of
each series may be subject to
redemption prior to maturity at the
option of the City, if and to the
extent so provided in the Certificate
of Award for that series. Any
Refunding Bonds so determined to
be subject to optional redemption
and maturing by their stated terms
after the earliest optional redemption date shall be subject to redemption at the option of the City on or
after the earliest optional redemption date in whole or in part on any
date at the redemption prices provided in the Certificate of Award
and in accordance with the applicable Supplemental Indenture and the
Indenture. The Refunding Bonds
designated in the Certificate of
Award as term bonds subject to
mandatory sinking fund redemption
shall be redeemed prior to maturity
on each mandatory redemption date
designated in the Certificate of
Award in the aggregate amount of
the sinking fund installment to be
paid on such mandatory redemption
date, all as provided in the Certificate of Award and in accordance
with the Supplemental Indenture.
(g)
Signing.
The
Refunding
Bonds shall be signed by the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, and
approved as to form by the Director
of Law. Any or all of the signatures
of those officials may be facsimiles.
The Refunding Bonds shall bear the
corporate seal of the City or a facsimile thereof.
(h) Numbering. The Refunding
Bonds shall be numbered as determined by the Director of Finance.
Section 5.
Award and Sale of
Refunding Bonds.
The Director of Finance shall sign
and deliver a Certificate of Award
for the Refunding Bonds. In the
event the Refunding Bonds are
issued in more than one series sold

March 5, 2008

delivered series. The sale of the
Refunding Bonds shall be awarded

to the City by those Original Purchasers, which amount shall be not
less than: (i) 97% of the amount
determined by adding to the aggregate principal amount of the Refunding Bonds any aggregate original issue premium and subtracting
from that amount any aggregate
original issue discount, plus (ii) any
accrued interest on the Refunding
Bonds from their date to the date of
their delivery to the Original Purchasers;
(c) whether any Refunding Bonds
are to be subject to optional redemption prior to maturity, and, if
so, the earliest optional redemption
date for those Refunding Bonds subject to prior redemption, which shall
be not later than ten years from the
first interest payment date of the
applicable series, and the applicable
redemption price, which shall be not
greater than 102% of the principal
amount redeemed;
(d) the dates on which principal
of the Refunding Bonds is to be
paid, which shall be not later than
thirty (30) years from their respective dates of issuance, with an identification of whether the payment is
due by stated maturity or by mandatory sinking fund redemption of
Refunding Bonds of a particular
maturity;
(e) the interest rates to be borne
by Refunding Bonds bearing interest at a fixed rate, the weighted
average of which shall not exceed
eight percent (8%) as to Refunding

determined for Refunding Bonds
bearing interest at variable rates,

and
any
determination
as
to
whether there shall be a special
reserve fund for the Refunding
Bonds of any series, separate from
the common Bond Service Reserve
Fund, or a surety or insurance policy, bank letter or line of credit, or
other form of credit or liquidity
facility enhancing the security for

The City Record
Refunding Bonds of that series in
lieu of a funded reserve fund;
(i) the Paying Agent; and
(j) whether any Refunding Bonds
are to be secured by or payable from
a Credit Support Instrument.
It is determined that the terms of
the Refunding Bonds as so determined within the limitations set
forth in this Ordinance and as so
specified and set forth in the Certificate of Award will be in the best
interest of the City and consistent
with all legal requirements.
The Director of Finance may
enter into one or more Bond Purchase Agreements with the Original
Purchasers of Refunding Bonds setting forth the conditions for delivery of the Refunding Bonds that are
consistent with this Ordinance, the
Certificate of Award, and the Indenture and that are determined by the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, to be customary for airport revenue bonds issued by governmental
entities, including, without limitation, representations as to the accuracy and completeness of information contained in the Official Statement of the City described in Section 12.

to the payment of the Bond service
charges on those Refunded Bonds;
and the irrevocable call for redemption of those Outstanding Revenue

called for redemption prior to maturity. The Director of Finance shall
provide for the payment of the services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant
to the escrow agreement from proceeds of the Refunding Bonds to the

Section 8. Conversion and Remarketing.
In the event that the Director of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is advantageous to the
City to convert to fixed interest
rates for a period of time or to
maturity the interest on any Outstanding Revenue Bonds bearing
interest at variable rates, the City
shall undertake the conversion and
remarketing
of
those
Revenue
Bonds
in
accordance
with
the
applicable Supplemental Indenture.
In connection with any conversion
and remarketing of Revenue Bonds,
the Director of Finance is authorized to obtain one or more Credit
Support Instruments if the Director
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the Credit Support Instrument will
facilitate the remarketing of the
Revenue Bonds. In the event the
Director
of
Finance
determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that it is necessary to supplement or amend the
Supplemental Indenture applicable
to a series of Revenue Bonds to be
remarketed in order to address current market conditions or to permit
the use of a Credit Support Instrument or otherwise obtain financing
arrangements advantageous to the
City, the Director of Finance and

72
the Director of Port Control are
authorized to sign and deliver an
amendment of that Supplemental
Indenture,
or
an
amended
and
restated
Supplemental
Indenture,
approved as to form by the Director
of Law. The Director of Finance is
further authorized to satisfy the
Required Bond Service Reserve for
the Revenue Bonds then outstanding under the Indenture by the
deposit of a credit facility in lieu of
cash, as permitted and more specifically provided in the Indenture,
and to apply cash released from the
Bond Service Reserve Fund to the
payment of costs of remarketing the
Revenue Bonds for which the interest rate has been converted from
variable rates of interest to fixed
rates of interest. To the extent the
costs of remarketing are not paid
from any cash released from the
Bond Service Reserve Fund, those
costs shall be paid from Fund Nos.
60 SF 001, 60 SF 104, 60 SF 105, 60
SF 106, 60 SF 140, 60 SF 141 and/or
passenger facility charges, as determined by the Director of Finance
after consultation with the Director
of Port Control. The Director of
Finance and the Director of Port
Control are authorized to prepare
one or more disclosure documents in
connection with any conversion and
remarketing under the same terms
and conditions as set forth in Section 12 of this Ordinance with
respect to Refunding Bonds. The
Director of Finance, the Director of
Port Control or any other officer of
the City having responsibility for
the conversion and remarketing of
the Revenue Bonds is authorized to
take such actions or cause to be
taken such actions as are necessary
to maintain the status of any Outstanding Revenue Bonds as TaxExempt Bonds, and the covenants
and authorizations in Section 10 of
this Ordinance shall apply to any
converted Revenue Bonds that are
Tax-Exempt Bonds. The Director of
Finance, the Director of Port Control and other City officials are
authorized to sign and deliver such
instruments, certificates and documents as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions authorized by this Section.
The Director of Finance, the Director of Port Control, the Director of
Law and other City officials, as
appropriate, are authorized to make
the
necessary
arrangements
on
behalf of the City to establish the
date, location, procedure and conditions for the conversion and remarketing of any series of Outstanding
Revenue Bonds and to take all
actions necessary to effect the conversion and remarketing of any
series
of
Outstanding
Revenue
Bonds under the terms of this Ordinance and the Indenture. The Clerk
of Council or other appropriate official of the City shall furnish the
Remarketing Agent a true transcript of proceedings certified by
the Clerk or other official, of all
proceedings had with reference to
the conversion and remarketing of
any series of Outstanding Revenue
Bonds along with such information

behalf of the City, to sign and deliver to the Trustee, in trust for the
Original Purchasers and subsequent

approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, not inconsistent with this Ordinance, the Certificate of Award and the Indenture
and not substantially adverse to the
City as may be approved by the officers signing the same on behalf of
the City. The determination by those

Section 10. Tax Covenants.
With respect to Refunding Bonds
that are to be issued and sold as
Tax-Exempt Bonds, the City covenants that it will use, and will
restrict the use and investment of,
the proceeds of the Tax-Exempt
Bonds in such manner and to such
extent as may be necessary so that
(a) the interest on the Tax-Exempt
Bonds will be excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, and (b) in the case of any
Tax-Exempt Bonds qualifying as
bonds, the interest on which is not
treated as an item of tax preference
under Section 57 of the Code (“NonAMT Bonds”), such Tax-Exempt
Bonds will be treated as Non-AMT
Bonds.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the TaxExempt Bonds to be and to remain
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will
not take or authorize to be taken
any actions that would adversely
affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or
persons acting for it, will, among
other acts of compliance, (i) apply
the proceeds of the Tax-Exempt
Bonds to the governmental purposes
of the borrowing, (ii) restrict the
yield on investment property, (iii)
make timely and adequate payments
to the federal government, (iv)
maintain books and records and
make calculations and reports, and
(v) refrain from certain uses of
those proceeds and, as applicable, of
property financed with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the
extent necessary to assure such
exclusion of that interest under the
Code.
The Director of Finance, or any
other officer of the City having
responsibility for issuance of the
Tax-Exempt Bonds, is hereby authorized (a) to make or effect any elec-

458

March 5, 2008
tion, selection, designation, choice,
consent, approval, or waiver on
behalf of the City with respect to
the Tax-Exempt Bonds as the City
is permitted or required to make or
give under the federal income tax
laws, including, without limitation
thereto, any of the elections provided for in Section 148(f)(4)(C) of the
Code or available under Section 148
of the Code, for the purpose of
assuring, enhancing or protecting
the favorable tax treatment or status of the Tax-Exempt Bonds or
interest thereon or assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose,
reducing
the
burden
or
expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or payments
of penalties, or making payments of
special amounts in lieu of making
computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as rebate, or
obviating those amounts or payments, as determined by that officer,
which action shall be in writing and
signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf
of the City, as may be appropriate
to assure the exclusion of interest
from gross income and the intended
tax status of the Tax-Exempt Bonds,
and (c) to give one or more appropriate certificates of the City, for
inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Tax-Exempt Bonds,
setting forth the reasonable expectations of the City regarding the
amount and use of all the proceeds
of the Tax-Exempt Bonds, the facts,
circumstances
and
estimates
on
which they are based, and other
facts and circumstances relevant to
the tax treatment of the interest on
and the tax status of the TaxExempt Bonds.
Each covenant made in this Section with respect to the Tax-Exempt
Bonds is also made with respect to
all issues any portion of the debt
service on which is paid from proceeds of the Tax-Exempt Bonds
(and, if different, the original issue
and any refunding issues in a series
of refundings), to the extent such
compliance is necessary to assure
exclusion of interest on the TaxExempt Bonds from gross income
for federal income tax purposes, and
the officers identified above are
authorized to take actions with
respect to those issues as they are
authorized in this Section to take
with respect to the Tax-Exempt
Bonds.

Ord. No. 289-08.
By Council Member Brady.
An emergency ordinance placing a
moratorium on accepting demolition
permit
applications
and
issuing
demolition permits in the LorainHighland/Westown area until such
time as it is designated as a Historic Landmark District.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has
identified
the
Lorain-Highland/Westown area between West
110th Street and West 123rd Street
as having architectural and historical significance; and
Whereas, under Section 161.04 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, the Landmarks
Commission is in the process of designating this area as a “Historic
Landmark District”; and
Whereas, on August 24, 2004, in a
public open meeting, the City Planning Department's nomination of
this area as a Historic Landmark
District was approved; and
Whereas, on January 29th, 2008,
the Lorain Avenue Master Plan was
presented to the public which incorporates the idea of the Historic
Landmark District, the preservation
of the historic character of the area
and the challenge of re-populating
these buildings where needed with
new uses; and
Whereas, a public hearing on the
Landmark designation for the area
is scheduled for March 13th, 2008
and the Lorain Avenue Master Plan
will be placed on the agenda of the
City Planning Commission for final
approval at the same time that the
landmark ordinance is heard by City
Planning Commission; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health or safety
in that a moratorium on accepting
demolition permit applications and
issuing demolition permits in the
proposed Historic Landmark District
is necessary to ensure revitalization
to an area that depends heavily on
the preservation of its historic character; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That, in order to protect
the public health, property, safety
and welfare, this Council declares a
moratorium on accepting demolition
permit
applications
and
issuing
demolition permits in the LorainHighland/Westown
area
between
West 110th Street and West 123rd
Street as further identified on the
map included in File No. 289-08-A
until such time as the proposed Historic Landmark District which is the
subject of this legislation becomes
effective, or until June 30, 2008,
whichever date occurs first.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Passed February 25, 2008.
Effective February 29, 2008.

The City Record
Ord. No. 290-08.
By Council Member Sweeney.
An emergency ordinance authorizing the issuance and sale of bonds
to refund series 1994 bonds issued to
fund a payment to the police and
fire pension fund and authorizing
related matters.
Whereas, under authority of Section 3 of Article XVIII of the Ohio
Constitution, Section 717.07 of the
Ohio Revised Code, the Charter of
the City, and Ordinance No. 367-94,
passed by the City Council on March
14, 1994, the City issued its Subordinated Income Tax Variable Rate
Refunding Bonds, Series 1994, now
outstanding in the principal amount
of
$58,900,000
(the
“Series
1994
Bonds”), to provide for a payment to
the Police and Fire Pension Fund of
the State of Ohio in satisfaction at
a reduced amount of certain obligations of the City for employer’s
accrued liability to that Pension
Fund; and
Whereas, the Series 1994 Bonds
are
payable
from
unrestricted
income taxes of the City, bear interest at variable rates determined
weekly by a remarketing agent, are
secured by a policy of municipal
bond insurance issued by Ambac
Assurance Corporation, have liquidity for the payment of the purchase
price of tendered bonds under a
standby bond purchase agreement
with Dexia Credit Local, acting by
and through its New York Branch,
and are hedged under certain hedge
agreements with Ambac Financial
Services, L.P. and JPMorgan Chase
Bank; and
Whereas, as a result of the downgrade of the credit rating of Ambac
Assurance Corporation, the Series
1994 Bonds are bearing interest at
volatile rates, and although the City
is presently protected from that
volatility under the hedge agreements, in the event of a further
downgrade of the credit rating of
Ambac Assurance Corporation, which
is presently threatened, the Series
1994 Bonds would lose the protection
of those hedge agreements and further could
be required by Dexia
Credit Local to be tendered for purchase, upon which the Series 1994
Bonds would bear interest at a higher, taxable commercial rate of interest; and
Whereas, this Council has determined to authorize the issuance by
the
City
of
bonds
(“Refunding
Bonds”) to refund the Series 1994
Bonds to minimize the risks of
increased interest expense on the
Series 1994 Bonds; and
Whereas, it is necessary to issue
the Refunding Bonds as soon as possible to address the risk of increased
interest expense on the Series 1994
Bonds, and, as a result, this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate
preservation of the public property,
health, and safety and for the usual
and daily operation of a municipal
department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

purpose of refunding the Series 1994
Bonds. The Refunding Bonds are
issued under authority of Article
XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio Constitution, Ohio Revised Code Section 717.07, the Charter of the City,
and this Ordinance. The principal
amount of the Refunding Bonds is
to be the amount set forth in the
Certificate of Award authorized in
Section 3 and shall be the amount
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
necessary (i) to refund the Series
1994 Bonds, (ii) to fund any deposit
to a debt service reserve fund, (iii)
to pay costs of any Credit Support

issuing the Refunding Bonds and
refunding the Series 1994 Bonds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Refunding Bonds shall be deposited
and applied as provided in the
Indenture and for the purposes stated in this Ordinance, and those proceeds are appropriated for those purposes.
Section 3.
Terms of Refunding
Bonds. The final terms of the Refunding Bonds shall be set forth in
a written certificate to be signed
and delivered by the Director of
Finance upon the sale of the Refunding Bonds upon terms and conditions consistent with this Ordinance and that in her opinion, based
on the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, are in the best interests of
the
City
(the
“Certificate
of
Award”).
The
Refunding
Bonds
shall be dated the date of issuance
or such other date as is designated
in the Certificate of Award. The
Refunding Bonds shall mature on
the dates and in the respective principal amounts determined in the
Certificate of Award, provided that
the final maturity date shall be not
later than 30 years from the date of
issuance of the Refunding Bonds.
The Refunding Bonds shall bear
interest from their date at the rate
or rates per year set forth in the

The City Record
Certificate of Award, or if any
Refunding Bonds bear interest at
variable rate or rates, at the rate
determined pursuant to the method
identified
in
the
Certificate
of
Award and set forth in the Indenture, until the principal amount of
the Refunding Bonds is paid or payment is provided for. Interest on the
Refunding Bonds shall be payable
on the dates determined in the Certificate of Award and as further provided for in the Indenture. If any
Refunding Bonds bear interest at a
fixed rate, that rate shall not exceed
eight percent (8%) per year (computed on the basis of a 360-day year
consisting of twelve 30-day months).
If any Refunding Bonds bear interest at a variable rate or rates, those
rates shall not exceed that set forth
below.
In the event that the Director of
Finance, based on the written advice of a Financial Advisor, determines that the City’s best interests will be served by causing all or
a portion of the Refunding Bonds to
be obligations bearing interest at
variable rates, redeemable by the
City without penalty or premium on
interest adjustment dates, then the
Director of Finance is authorized to
so specify in the Certificate of
Award. If the Director of Finance so
determines, then the Director of
Finance shall specify in the Certificate of Award the method and procedure by which the variable rate of
interest to be borne by the variable
rate Refunding Bonds shall be determined, whether by reference to a
market index, by a remarketing
agent or otherwise; provided that
the variable rate Refunding Bonds
shall not bear interest at a rate in
excess of twenty-five percent (25%)
per year (including any Refunding
Bonds held by a provider of a Credit Support Instrument). Holders of
variable rate Refunding Bonds may
be given the right to tender their
variable rate Refunding Bonds for
purchase by the City at the times,
on the terms, and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Certificate of Award and the Indenture. If
the Director of Finance designates
any Refunding Bonds as variable
rate Refunding Bonds, and if the
holders of the variable rate Refunding Bonds are to be entitled to tender the variable rate Refunding
Bonds for purchase, then the Director of Finance shall also designate
in the Certificate of Award for those
variable rate Refunding Bonds the
provider or providers for any Credit Support Instrument, the tender
agent or agents and the remarketing agent or agents, which designations shall be based on the determination of the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the parties
so designated possess the requisite
resources and experience to provide
the services required of them and
that the terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide
such services are fair and commercially reasonable. The Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements in connection with the
delivery of the variable rate Refunding Bonds, and from time to time
thereafter so long as the variable
rate Refunding Bonds are outstand-

465

ing, with providers of Credit Support
Instruments, tender agents (which
may be the Trustee), remarketing
agents, and others as may be determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, to be necessary
or appropriate to provide for the
method of determining the variable
interest rates, permitting holders
the right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support for the payment of the variable rate Refunding
Bonds upon tender for purchase or
redemption, and providing for the
repayment by the City of any
amounts drawn under the Credit
Support Instrument.
The Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, shall further determine and
specify in the Certificate of Award
whether
any
of
the
Refunding
Bonds
are
subject
to
optional
redemption prior to maturity, the
earliest date on which redeemable
Refunding Bonds shall be subject to
prior redemption, which shall not be
later than ten years from the first
interest payment date, and the applicable redemption premium for the
redeemable Refunding Bonds, which
shall be not greater than 102% of
the principal amount redeemed. The
Refunding Bonds may be subject to
purchase by the City in lieu of
optional redemption if and to the
extent provided in the Certificate of
Award and the Indenture.
The Director of Finance shall designate the Trustee in the Certificate
of Award, which designation shall
be based on the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the Trustee so designated
possesses the requisite resources
and experience to provide the services required of it under the Indenture and that the terms on which
the designated Trustee has agreed
to provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable.
Section 4. Form; Exchange; Execution. The Refunding Bonds shall
be issued in fully registered form.
The Refunding Bonds initially shall
be delivered only in book-entry
form, shall be registered in the
name of the Depository (as defined
in the Indenture) or its nominee, as
registered owner, and immobilized
in the custody of the Depository,
and shall not be transferable or
exchangeable (except for transfer to
another Depository or its nominee)
without further action by the City
pursuant to the provisions of the
Indenture. The principal and any
redemption premium and the interest payable on each Refunding Bond

thereof
permitting
special
arrangements for payments to the

by the Director of Finance to one or

80
more financial institutions selected
by the Director of Finance based on
an evaluation of the qualifications
of firms that have proposed to
underwrite the Refunding Bonds
(collectively, the “Original Purchaser”) in accordance with law, the provisions of this Ordinance and the
Certificate of Award. The Director
of Finance shall cause the Refunding Bonds to be prepared, and have
the Refunding Bonds signed and
delivered, together with a true transcript of proceedings with reference
to the issuance of the Refunding
Bonds if requested by the Original
Purchaser, to the Original Purchaser upon payment of the purchase
price. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
a bond purchase agreement between
the City and the Original Purchaser, or representative thereof (the
“Purchase Agreement”), containing
terms consistent with this Ordinance
and that are determined by the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, to be customary for revenue
bonds issued by governmental entities, including, without limitation,
representations as to the accuracy
and completeness of information
contained in the official statement
of the City described in Section 10.
The Director of Finance shall provide for the payment of the services
rendered and for reimbursement of
expenses incurred pursuant to the
Purchase Agreement from the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds to the
extent available and then from
Fund No. 01 SF 001 or from other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose. The Mayor, the Director of Finance, the Clerk, the Director of Law, and other City officials,
as appropriate, are each authorized
to sign any transcript certificates,
financial statements and other documents and instruments and to take
such actions as are necessary or
appropriate
to
consummate
the
transactions contemplated by this
Ordinance.
Section 6.
Security for the Refunding Bonds.
The Refunding
Bonds shall be special obligations of
the City, and the debt charges on
the
Refunding
Bonds
shall
be
payable solely from the Pledged
Revenues. The payment of debt
charges on the Refunding Bonds
will be secured by the Indenture
and by a pledge of and lien on the
debt service fund and any debt service reserve fund held by the
Trustee under the Indenture. The
Refunding Bonds do not and shall
not represent or constitute a general obligation debt or pledge of the
faith and credit of the City.
So long as the Refunding Bonds
are outstanding under the Indenture, the City pledges the Pledged
Revenues and grants a lien thereon,
subordinate to the lien granted in
the General Bond Ordinance as security for the general obligation bonds
of the City issued and outstanding
under the General Bond Ordinance,
to the full extent required to meet
debt charges payable on the Refunding Bonds and any debt charges on
Parity Obligations (as defined in
the Indenture). The City covenants

The City Record
to appropriate annually sufficient
amounts from the income taxes for
such purpose. The City further
covenants that so long as any
Refunding Bonds are outstanding
under the Indenture, the City shall
not repeal or amend, or suffer the
repeal of, any ordinance for the levy
or collection of its unrestricted
income taxes in any manner or to
such extent that the City would not
be able to meet its obligations to the
holders of the Refunding Bonds.
Section 7. Authorization of Indenture.
The Director of Finance is
authorized, in the name and on
behalf of the City, to sign and deliver the Indenture, in trust for the
holders of the Refunding Bonds,
containing terms not inconsistent
with this Ordinance or the Certificate of Award and otherwise substantially the same as the Existing
Indenture with such differences as
may be appropriate to permit the
City to obtain a Credit Support
Instrument or to permit increased
flexibility for the use of financial or
credit structures and techniques
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
in the best interests of the City.
The Indenture shall be approved as
to form and correctness by the
Director of Law. The determination
by the Director of Finance that the
terms of the Indenture are in the
best interests of the City shall be
conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery of the Indenture by
the Director of Finance.
Section 8.

the refunding of the Series 1994
Bonds; the application of the moneys derived from those investments
to the payment of the Bond service
charges on the Series 1994 Bonds;
and the irrevocable call for redemption of the Series 1994 Bonds. The
Director of Finance shall provide for
the payment of the services rendered and for reimbursement of
expenses incurred pursuant to the
escrow agreement from proceeds of
the Refunding Bonds to the extent
available and then from Fund No. 01
SF 001 or other money lawfully
available and appropriated or to be
appropriated for that purpose. Provision shall be made in the escrow
agreement to give the Trustee any
written notice of redemption required under the Existing Indenture. The Director of Finance and
other appropriate City officials shall

other actions necessary or appropriate on the part of the City to effect
such refunding in accordance with
the escrow agreement, the Existing
Indenture and to cause the Series
1994 Bonds to be deemed paid and

the mathematical accuracy of the
calculations relating to the escrow.

Section 9. Conversion and Remarketing. In the event that the Director of Finance determines, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, that it is advantageous to
the City to convert the interest on
any Series 1994 Bonds to fixed interest rates for a period of time or to
maturity, or to convert the interest
on any Series 1994 Bonds to a different variable rate period or mode,
the City shall undertake the conversion and remarketing in accordance with the Existing Indenture,
as it may be supplemented and
amended as authorized herein. In
connection with any conversion and
remarketing of Series 1994 Bonds,
the Director of Finance is authorized to obtain one or more Credit
Support Instruments if the Director
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the Credit Support Instrument will
facilitate the remarketing of the
Series 1994 Bonds. In the event the
Director
of
Finance
determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that it is necessary to supplement or amend the
Existing
Indenture
in
order
to
address current market conditions
or to permit the use of a Credit Support Instrument or to otherwise
obtain financing arrangements advantageous to the City, the Director
of Finance is authorized to sign and
deliver an amendment of the Existing Indenture, or an amended and
restated
Existing
Indenture,

and remarketing of the Series 1994
Bonds may be paid from Fund No.
01 SF 001 or from other money lawfully available and appropriated or
to be appropriated for that purpose
or, to the extent available, from
remarketing proceeds. The Director
of Finance is authorized to prepare
one or more disclosure documents in
connection with any conversion and
remarketing under the same terms
and conditions as set forth in Section 10 of this Ordinance with
respect to Refunding Bonds. The
Director of Finance and other City
officials are authorized to sign and
deliver such instruments, certificates and documents as are necessary or appropriate to consummate
the transactions authorized by this
Section.
The Director of Finance,
the Director of Law and other City
officials, as appropriate, are authorized
to
make
the
necessary
arrangements on behalf of the City
to establish the date, location, procedure and conditions for the conversion and remarketing of any
Series 1994 Bonds and to take all
actions necessary to effect the conversion and remarketing of any
Series 1994 Bonds under the terms
of this Ordinance and the Existing
Indenture, as it may be supplemented as authorized herein. The
Clerk of Council or other appropriate official of the City shall furnish
the Trustee a true transcript of proceedings certified by the Clerk or
other official, of all proceedings had
with reference to the conversion and
remarketing of any Series 1994
Bonds along with such information

to be prepared, and make or authorize modifications, completions or
changes of or supplements to, disclosure documents in the form of a

certify or otherwise represent, when
the preliminary official statement as
so prepared is a “deemed final” official statement (except for permitted
omissions) by the City as of its date
for
purposes
of
Securities
and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Rule
15c2-12(b)(1). The distribution and
use of a preliminary official statement is authorized and approved.
The Director of Finance is also
authorized, on behalf of the City
and in her official capacity, to complete the preliminary official statement
with
such
modifications,
changes and supplements as the
Director of Finance shall approve or
authorize for the purpose of preparing and determining, and to certify
or otherwise represent, that the official statement as so revised is a
final official statement for purposes
of SEC Rule 15c2-12(b) (3) and (4).
The Director of Finance is further
authorized to use and distribute, or
authorize the use and distribution
of, a final official statement and
supplements thereto in connection
with the original issuance of the
Refunding Bonds as may, in her
judgment, be necessary or appropriate. The Director of Finance is further authorized to sign and deliver,
on behalf of the City and in her official capacity, a final official statement and such certificates in connection with the accuracy of the preliminary official statement and the
final official statement and any
amendments thereto as may, in their
judgment, also be necessary or appropriate. The Director of Finance
is authorized to contract for services
for the production and distribution
of preliminary and final official
statements, including by printed and
electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Refunding Bonds, the City
agrees, in accordance with, and as
an obligated person with respect to
the Refunding Bonds under, SEC
Rule 15c2-12, to provide or cause to
be provided such financial information and operating data and notices,
in such manner, as may be required
for purposes of SEC Rule 15c2-12.
In order to describe and specify certain terms of the City’s continuing
disclosure agreement for that purpose, and thereby to implement that
agreement, including provisions for
enforcement, amendment and termination, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Refunding Bonds in
accordance with SEC Rule 15c2-12.
The performance of that agreement

The City Record
shall be subject to the availability
of funds and their annual appropriation to meet costs the City would
be required to incur to perform it.
Section 11.
Ratings; Credit Enhancement. If, in the judgment of
the Director of Finance, based on
written advice of a Financial Advisor, the filing of an application for
a rating on the Series 1994 Bonds or
the Refunding Bonds by one or more
nationally recognized rating agencies is in the best interests of the
City, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare and submit
those applications and to provide to
each such agency or company such
information as may be required
for the purpose. The Director of
Finance is authorized to contract for
one or more Credit Support Instruments for the Series 1994 Bonds or
the Refunding Bonds if she determines, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, that the
Credit
Support
Instruments
will
result in debt service savings to the
City, or will stabilize interest rates
on those Bonds or will minimize the
risk of increased interest expense
on those Bonds. The cost of obtaining each rating and each Credit Support
Instrument
shall
be
paid,
except to the extent paid by the
Original Purchaser in accordance
with the Purchase Agreement, from
the
proceeds
of
the
Refunding
Bonds or Fund No. 01 SF 001 or from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose, as determined by
the Director of Finance.
Section 12. Interest Rate Hedges
and Other Arrangements.
This
Council finds that by engaging in
interest rate hedging arrangements
with respect to bonds the City may
reduce its cost of borrowing by optimizing the relative amounts of fixed
and variable rate obligations, or
minimizing the risk of variations in
its debt service costs, or obtaining
savings by confirming rates of interest on bonds in advance of their
issuance. To permit the City to have
the flexibility to undertake interest
rate swap, swaption, rate cap, rate
collar and other hedging transactions, from time to time, and to
establish the procedures for approving
those
transactions,
this
Council authorizes the signing and
delivery of one or more agreements,
including amendments or supplements to existing agreements (each,
a “Hedge Agreement”), and any
related agreements necessary for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by each Hedge
Agreement. The authorizations in
this Section are supplemental to and
not in derogation of any authority
provided by any other ordinance of
this Council concerning hedging
arrangements.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is to the financial advantage of the City and in the City’s
best interests that a hedging arrangement be undertaken by the
City with respect to the Series 1994
Bonds or the Refunding Bonds, the
Director of Finance may authorize
one or more interest rate hedge
transactions in accordance with the
applicable Hedge Agreement; pro-

467

81
vided that (a) the counterparty
shall be rated at the time of signing the Hedge Agreement not lower
than A+ or A1 by at least one rating agency or its obligations under
the Hedge Agreement shall be guaranteed or insured by an entity rated
at the time of signing the Hedge
Agreement not lower than A+ or A1
by at least one rating agency, and
(b) the term of each hedge transaction shall not exceed the final
maturity of the Series 1994 Bonds or
Refunding
Bonds
to
which
the
hedge relates.
The Director of Finance shall
negotiate the terms of each Hedge
Agreement with a counterparty satisfying the credit criteria in this
Ordinance. The City shall receive a
written opinion of a Financial Advisor that the payments made or to be
made by the counterparty to the
City, or by the City to the counterparty, shall be fair value for the
Hedge Agreement, given the credit
of the counterparty and the terms
and conditions of the Hedge Agreement. The Director of Finance shall
determine the terms and conditions
of the Hedge Agreement, including
without limitation, the rates to be
paid by the counterparty to the City
and by the City to the counterparty
under the Hedge Agreement, the
time or times and procedures for the
exercise by the counterparty or the
City, as the case may be, of any
option under the Hedge Agreement,
and whether the obligations of the
City under the Hedge Agreement
shall be secured by a Credit Support
Instrument. The approval of each
interest rate hedge transaction by
the Director of Finance shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing
and
delivery
of
the
applicable
Hedge Agreement by the Director of
Finance.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from, and may be secured by, the
Pledged Revenues as determined by
the Director of Finance and set
forth in the Hedge Agreement. The
obligation of the City to make payments under any Hedge Agreement
does not and shall not represent or
constitute a general obligation debt,
or a pledge of the faith and credit
of the City or the State of Ohio.
Section 13.
Financial Advisor.
The Director of Finance may obtain
the services of one or more Financial Advisors, from time to time, to
assist the Director of Finance in
making any of the determinations
required by this Ordinance to be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance or to negotiate any Hedge
Agreements.
The
Director
of
Finance may rely on the written
advice of any Financial Advisor so
retained. Any Financial Advisor or
consultant
employed
under
the
authority of this Ordinance shall be
disinterested in the transaction and
be independent of the underwriters
or counterparties and any other
party interested in the transaction.

Ord. No. 291-08.
By Council Member Sweeney.
An emergency ordinance authorizing the issuance and sale of revenue
refunding bonds to refund outstanding revenue bonds of the core city
program for economic and community development in the city and
authorizing related matters.
Whereas, under authority of Ordinance No. 1982-02, passed by this
Council on June 10, 2003, and the
laws of the State of Ohio, the City
issued its Taxable Economic and
Community Development Revenue
Bonds, Series 2003, now outstanding in the principal amount of
$26,900,000 (the “Series 2003 Bonds”), to
provide funds to establish the City’s
Core City Fund Program for economic and community development
projects in the City, and to provide
for the source of payment and security for the Series 2003 Bonds the
City entered into the Trust Indenture dated as of December 15, 2003
(the “Original Indenture”) with U.S.
Bank
National
Association,
as
trustee (the “Trustee”); and
Whereas, the Series 2003 Bonds
bear interest at variable rates determined through an auction process
and are secured by a policy of
municipal bond insurance issued by
Ambac Assurance Corporation; and
Whereas, as a result of the downgrade of the credit ratings of Ambac
Assurance Corporation, and the deterioration of the auction securities
market, the Series 2003 Bonds are
bearing interest at volatile and
unacceptable rates; and
Whereas, this Council has determined to authorize the issuance by
the City of revenue refunding bonds
(“Refunding Bonds”) under the Original Indenture, as supplemented and
amended, to refund the Series 2003
Bonds to obtain debt service savings, to stabilize interest rates, or to
minimize risks of increased interest
expense on the Series 2003 Bonds;
and
Whereas, it is necessary to issue
the Refunding Bonds as soon as possible to address the increased interest expense being incurred on the
Series 2003 Bonds, and, as a result,
this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the
immediate preservation of the public property, health, and safety and
for the usual and daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

finds and determines that it is necessary and proper and in the best
interests of the City to authorize the
issuance of Refunding Bonds as
Additional Bonds under the Original
Indenture for the purpose of refunding the Series 2003 Bonds. The principal amount of the Refunding
Bonds is to be the amount set forth
in the Certificate of Award authorized in Section 3 and shall be the
amount determined by the Director
of Finance, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
necessary (i) to refund the Series
2003 Bonds, (ii) to fund any deposit
to the Bond Reserve Fund, (iii) to
pay costs of any Credit Support
Instruments, and (iv) to pay costs
of issuing the Refunding Bonds and
refunding the Series 2003 Bonds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Refunding Bonds shall be deposited
and applied as provided in the Supplemental Indenture for the Refunding Bonds and for the purposes stated in this Ordinance, and those proceeds are appropriated for those purposes.
Section 3.
Terms of Refunding
Bonds.
The final terms of the
Refunding Bonds shall be set forth
in a written certificate to be signed
and delivered by the Director of
Finance
upon
the
sale
of
the
Refunding Bonds upon terms and
conditions consistent with this Ordinance and that in her opinion, based
on the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, are in the best interests of
the
City
(the
“Certificate
of
Award”).
The
Refunding
Bonds
shall be dated the date of issuance
or such other date as is designated
in the Certificate of Award. The
Refunding Bonds shall mature on
the dates and in the respective principal amounts determined in the
Certificate of Award, provided that
the final maturity date shall be not
later than 30 years from the date of
issuance of the Refunding Bonds.
The Refunding Bonds shall bear
interest from their date at the rate
or rates per year set forth in the
Certificate of Award, or if any
Refunding Bonds bear interest at a
variable rate, at the rate determined
from time to time pursuant to the
method identified in the Certificate
of Award and set forth in the Inden-

The City Record
ture, and the Refunding Bonds shall
bear interest at those rates until the
principal amount of the Refunding
Bonds is paid or payment is provided for. Interest on the Refunding
Bonds shall be payable on the dates
determined or provided for in the
Certificate of Award and the Indenture. If any Refunding Bonds bear
interest at a fixed rate, that rate
shall not exceed eight percent (8%)
per year (computed on the basis of
a 360-day year consisting of twelve
30-day months). If any Refunding
Bonds bear interest at a variable
rate or rates, those rates shall not
exceed that set forth below.
In the event that the Director of
Finance, based on the written advice of a Financial Advisor, determines that the City’s best interests
will be served by causing all or a
portion of the Refunding Bonds to
be obligations bearing interest at
variable rates, redeemable by the
City without penalty or premium on
interest adjustment dates, then the
Director of Finance is authorized to
so specify in the Certificate of
Award. If the Director of Finance so
determines, then the Director of
Finance shall specify in the Certificate of Award the method and procedure by which the variable rate of
interest to be borne by the variable
rate Refunding Bonds shall be determined, whether by reference to a
market index, by a remarketing
agent or otherwise; provided that
the variable rate Refunding Bonds
shall not bear interest at a rate in
excess of twenty-five percent (25%)
per year (including any Refunding
Bonds held by a provider of a Credit Support Instrument). Holders of
variable rate Refunding Bonds may
be given the right to tender their
variable rate Refunding Bonds for
purchase by the City at the times,
on the terms, and subject to the conditions set forth in the Certificate of
Award and the Indenture. If the
Director of Finance designates any
Refunding Bonds as variable rate
Refunding Bonds, and if the holders
of the variable rate Refunding
Bonds are to be entitled to tender
the variable rate Refunding Bonds
for purchase, then the Director of
Finance shall also designate in the
Certificate of Award for those variable rate Refunding Bonds the
provider or providers for any Credit Support Instrument, the tender
agent or agents and the remarketing agent or agents, which designations shall be based on the determination of the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the parties
so designated possess the requisite
resources and experience to provide
the services required of them and
that the terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide
such services are fair and commercially reasonable. The Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements in connection with the
delivery of the variable rate Refunding Bonds, and from time to time
thereafter so long as the variable
rate Refunding Bonds are outstanding, with providers of Credit Support
Instruments, tender agents (which
may be the Trustee), remarketing
agents, and others as may be determined by the Director of Finance,

469

83
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, to be necessary
or appropriate to provide for the
method of determining the variable
interest rates, permitting holders
the right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support for the payment of the variable rate Refunding
Bonds upon tender for purchase or
redemption, and providing for the
repayment by the City of any
amounts drawn under the Credit
Support Instrument.
The Director of Finance shall further determine and specify in the
Certificate of Award whether any of
the Refunding Bonds are subject to
optional redemption prior to maturity, the earliest date on which
redeemable Refunding Bonds shall
be subject to prior redemption,
which shall not be later than ten
years from the first interest payment date, and the applicable redemption
premium
for
the
redeemable Refunding Bonds, which
shall be not greater than 103% of
the principal amount redeemed. The
Refunding Bonds may be subject to
purchase by the City in lieu of
optional redemption if and to the
extent provided in the Certificate of
Award and the Indenture.
Section 4. Form; Exchange; Execution. The Refunding Bonds shall
be issued in fully registered form.
The Refunding Bonds initially shall
be delivered only in book-entry
form, shall be registered in the
name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository, and shall not be transferable
or exchangeable (except for transfer to another Depository or its nominee) without further action by the
City pursuant to the provisions of
the Indenture. The principal and
any redemption premium and the
interest payable on each Refunding
Bond shall be payable at the times,
to the persons and in the manner set
forth in, or referenced by, the Indenture, including, without limitation,
provisions thereof permitting special arrangements for payments to
the
Depository.
The
Refunding
Bonds shall be signed by the persons and in the manner set forth
in the Indenture. The Refunding
Bonds shall be numbered as determined by the Director of Finance.
Section 5.
Sale of Refunding
Bonds. The Refunding Bonds shall
be sold at not less than (i) 97% of
par plus aggregate original issue
premium and minus aggregate original issue discount plus (ii) accrued
interest at private sale by the Director of Finance to one or more financial institutions selected by the
Director of Finance based on an
evaluation of the qualifications of
firms that have proposed to underwrite the Refunding Bonds (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”) in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance and the Certificate
of Award. The Director of Finance
shall cause the Refunding Bonds to
be prepared, and have the Refunding Bonds signed and delivered,
together with a true transcript of
proceedings with reference to the
issuance of the Refunding Bonds if
requested by the Original Purchaser, to the Original Purchaser upon
payment of the purchase price. The

84
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign and deliver, in the name and
on behalf of the City, a bond purchase agreement between the City
and the Original Purchaser, or representative thereof (the “Purchase
Agreement”), containing terms consistent with this Ordinance and that
are determined by the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
customary for revenue bonds issued
by governmental entities, including,
without limitation, representations
as to the accuracy and completeness
of information contained in the official statement of the City described
in Section 11. The Director of
Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and
for
reimbursement
of
expenses
incurred pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement from the proceeds of the
Refunding Bonds to the extent
available and then from the Program Funds or from other money
lawfully available and appropriated
or to be appropriated for that purpose, as determined by the Director
of Finance. The Mayor, the Director
of Finance, the Clerk, the Director
of Law, and other City officials, as
appropriate, are each authorized to
sign
any
transcript
certificates,
financial statements and other documents and instruments and to take
such actions as are necessary or
appropriate
to
consummate
the
transactions contemplated by this
Ordinance.
Section 6.
Security for the Refunding Bonds. The Refunding Bonds
shall be special obligations of the
City, and the debt charges on the
Refunding Bonds shall be payable
solely from the Net Project Revenues and the Nontax Revenues.
The payment of debt charges on the
Refunding Bonds is secured by a
pledge of and lien on the Bond Fund
held by the Trustee under the Indenture and by any reserve fund for
which provision is made in the
Indenture. The Refunding Bonds are
not and shall not be secured by an
obligation or pledge of any money
raised by taxation. The Refunding
Bonds do not and shall not represent
or constitute a debt or pledge of the
faith and credit or taxing power of
the City, and the owners thereof
have and shall have no right to
have taxes levied by the City for the
payment of debt charges thereon.
The Refunding Bonds shall contain
a statement to that effect and to the
effect that the Refunding Bonds are
payable solely from the Net Project
Revenues and the Nontax Revenues
and are not secured by an obligation or pledge of any money raised
by taxation.
The City covenants and agrees
that while the Refunding Bonds are
outstanding, it will appropriate and
maintain Nontax Revenues at such
times and in such amounts as will
be sufficient, together with the Net
Project Revenues and any other
funds available for the purpose, to
pay the debt charges on the Bonds
and will so restrict other obligations
payable from Nontax Revenues prior
to or on a parity with the Bonds as
will ensure the continuing availability for appropriation of sufficient Nontax Revenues to pay debt
charges when due.

The City Record
Section 7.
Payment of Debt
Charges on the Refunding Bonds.
Nothing herein shall be construed as
requiring the City to use or apply to
the payment of debt charges on the
Refunding Bonds any funds or revenues from any source other than
Net Project Revenues and the Nontax
Revenues.
Subject
to
the
requirements of Revised Code Section 176.04, nothing herein, however,
shall be deemed to prohibit the City,
of its own volition, from using, to
the extent that it is authorized by
law to do so, any other resources for
the fulfillment of any of the terms,
conditions or obligations of this
Ordinance or of the Refunding
Bonds.
The City will, solely from the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds or
from the Net Project Revenues or
the Nontax Revenues, pay or cause
to be paid the debt charges on the
Refunding Bonds on the dates, at
the places and in the manner provided herein and in the Refunding
Bonds. For that purpose, in each
year while the Refunding Bonds are
outstanding, this Council, after providing for the payment of debt
charges payable on the City’s general obligation securities in that
year from sources available for that
purpose, will appropriate Nontax
Revenues required to pay, and for
the purpose of paying, the debt
charges due in that year on the
Bonds (less other money available
for the purpose) and any outstanding parity obligations payable from
Nontax
Revenues.
Further,
this
Council will give effect to such
appropriations in all Ordinances it
passes thereafter in that year appropriating money for expenditure and
encumbrance and limit the other
appropriations of Nontax Revenues
in that year to the amount available
after deducting the amount required
for the payment of debt charges
payable on the City’s general obligation securities and to pay those
debt charges. The City covenants
that, so long as any of the Refunding Bonds are outstanding, it shall
not issue any additional obligations
payable from the Nontax Revenues
on a parity with the Bonds and any
other outstanding parity obligations
payable
from
Nontax
Revenues,
unless, prior to passage of the Ordinance authorizing such parity obligations, the Director of Finance shall
have certified to this Council that
the Nontax Revenues during the preceding calendar year, adjusted to
reflect, if necessary, changes in the
rates or charges resulting in the
Nontax
Revenues,
aggregate
in
amount not less than 100% of the
highest amount of (a) debt charges
on the Bonds and (b) required payments on such proposed parity obligations and any other outstanding
parity obligations due in any succeeding calendar year.
Each obligation of the City required to be undertaken pursuant
to this Ordinance and the Refunding Bonds is binding upon the City,
and upon each officer or employee
of the City as may from time to
time have the authority under law
to take any action on behalf of the
City as may be necessary to perform all or any part of such obligation, as a duty of the City and of

470

March 5, 2008
each of those officers and employees resulting from an office, trust
or station within the meaning of
Section 2731.01 of the Revised Code,
providing for enforcement by writ
of mandamus.
Section 8.
Authorization of Supplemental Indentures. The Director
of Finance is authorized, in the
name and on behalf of the City, to
sign and deliver to the Trustee, in
trust for the holders of the Refunding Bonds, one or more Supplemental Indentures, approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, not inconsistent with this Ordinance or the Certificate of Award,
and not substantially adverse to the
City as may be approved by the
Director of Finance. The determination by the Director of Finance that
a Supplemental Indenture is not substantially adverse to the City shall
be conclusively evidenced by the
signing and delivery of that Supplemental Indenture by the Director of Finance. Any Supplemental
Indenture may contain amendments
to the Original Indenture, as theretofor amended, or amend and restate
the Original Indenture, to permit the
City to obtain a Credit Support
Instrument, to eliminate the Land
Sales Fund and to release from the
lien of the Indenture any money on
deposit in the Land Sales Fund, or
to permit increased flexibility for
the use of financial or credit structures and techniques determined by
the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, to be in the best interests
of the City.
Section 9.
Refunding of Series
2003
Bonds;
Escrow
Agreement.
The Director of Finance is authorized to sign and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of the City, an
escrow agreement between the City
and the Trustee, as escrow trustee,
providing for, among other matters:
the
investment
and
holding
in
escrow of the proceeds of the
Refunding Bonds to be applied to
the refunding of the Series 2003
Bonds; the application of the moneys derived from those investments
to the payment of the debt service
charges on the Series 2003 Bonds;
and the irrevocable call for redemption of the Series 2003 Bonds. The
Director of Finance shall provide
for the payment of the services rendered and for reimbursement of
expenses incurred pursuant to the
escrow agreement from proceeds of
the Refunding Bonds to the extent
available and then from Program
Funds or from other money lawfully available and appropriated or to
be appropriated for that purpose, as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance. Provision shall be made in
the escrow agreement to give the
Trustee any written notice of redemption required under the Indenture. The Director of Finance and
other
appropriate
City
officials
shall sign all documents and take
all
other
actions
necessary
or
appropriate on the part of the City
to effect such refunding in accordance with the Indenture and to
cause the Series 2003 Bonds to be
deemed
paid
and
discharged,
including without limitation, the
retention of an independent firm of
accountants to verify the mathematical accuracy of the calculations relating to the escrow.

March 5, 2008
Section 10.
Conversion and Remarketing.
In the event that the
Director
of
Finance
determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that it is advantageous to the City to convert the
interest on any Series 2003 Bonds to
fixed interest rates for a period of
time or to maturity, or to convert
the interest on any Series 2003
Bonds to a different variable rate
period or mode, the City shall undertake the conversion and remarketing in accordance with the Indenture. In connection with any conversion and remarketing of Series
2003 Bonds, the Director of Finance
is authorized to obtain one or more
Credit Support Instruments if the
Director determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the Credit Support Instrument will facilitate the remarketing
of the Series 2003 Bonds. In the
event the Director of Finance determines, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, that it is
necessary to supplement or amend
the Original Indenture or any Supplemental Indenture in order to
address current market conditions
or to permit the use of a Credit Support Instrument or to otherwise
obtain
financing

Official Statements;
Continuing Disclosure.
The Director of Finance is authorized, on
behalf of the City and in her official capacity, to (i) prepare or cause
to be prepared, and make or authorize modifications, completions or
changes of or supplements to, disclosure documents in the form of a
preliminary official statement relating to the issuance of the Refunding Bonds, and (ii) determine, and
certify or otherwise represent, when
the preliminary official statement as
so prepared is a “deemed final” official statement (except for permitted
omissions) by the City as of its date
for
purposes
of
Securities
and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Rule
15c2-12(b)(1). The distribution and
use of a preliminary official statement is authorized and approved.
The Director of Finance is also
authorized, on behalf of the City
and in her official capacity, to complete the preliminary official statement
with
such
modifications,
changes and supplements as the
Director of Finance shall approve or
authorize for the purpose of preparing and determining, and to certify
or otherwise represent, that the official statement as so revised is a
final official statement for purposes
of SEC Rule 15c2-12(b) (3) and (4).
The Director of Finance is further
authorized to use and distribute, or
authorize the use and distribution
of, a final official statement and
supplements thereto in connection
with the original issuance of the
Refunding Bonds as may, in her
judgment, be necessary or appropriate. The Director of Finance is further authorized to sign and deliver,
on behalf of the City and in her official capacity, a final official statement and such certificates in connection with the accuracy of the preliminary official statement and the
final official statement and any
amendments thereto as may, in their
judgment, also be necessary or
appropriate. The Director of Finance
is authorized to contract for services
for the production and distribution
of preliminary and final official
statements, including by printed and
electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Refunding Bonds, the City
agrees, in accordance with, and as
an obligated person with respect to
the Refunding Bonds under, SEC
Rule 15c2-12, to provide or cause to
be provided such financial information and operating data and notices,
in such manner, as may be required
for purposes of SEC Rule 15c2-12. In
order to describe and specify certain
terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for that purpose,
and
thereby
to
implement
that
agreement, including provisions for
enforcement, amendment and termination, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare, or cause to be
prepared, and to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
a continuing disclosure agreement
or certificate, which shall constitute
the continuing disclosure agreement
made by the City for the benefit of
the holders and beneficial owners of
the Refunding Bonds in accordance
with SEC Rule 15c2-12. The performance of that agreement shall be

471

85
subject to the availability of funds
and their annual appropriation to
meet
costs
the
City
would
be
required to incur to perform it.
Section 12. Ratings; Credit Enhancement. If, in the judgment of
the Director of Finance, based on
written advice of a Financial Advisor, the filing of an application for
a rating on the Series 2003 Bonds or
the Refunding Bonds by one or more
nationally recognized rating agencies is in the best interests of the
City, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare and submit
those applications and to provide to
each such agency such information
as may be required for the purpose.
The Director of Finance is authorized to contract for one or more
Credit Support Instruments for the
Series 2003 Bonds or the Refunding
Bonds if she determines, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, that the Credit Support
Instruments will result in debt service savings to the City, or will stabilize interest rates on those Bonds
or
will
minimize
the
risk
of
increased interest expense on those
Bonds. The cost of obtaining each
rating and each Credit Support
Instrument, except to the extent
paid by the Original Purchaser in
accordance
with
the
Purchase
Agreement, shall be paid from the
proceeds of the Refunding Bonds or
the Program Funds or from other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose, as determined by the
Director of Finance.
Section 13. Interest Rate Hedges
and Other Arrangements.
This
Council finds that by engaging in
interest rate hedging arrangements
with respect to the Bonds the City
may reduce its cost of borrowing by
optimizing the relative amounts of
fixed and variable rate obligations,
or minimizing the risk of variations
in its debt service costs, or obtaining savings by confirming rates of
interest on the Bonds in advance of
their issuance. To permit the City to
have the flexibility to undertake
with respect to the Bonds interest
rate swap, swaption, rate cap, rate
collar and other hedging transactions, from time to time, and to
establish the procedures for approving those transactions, this Council
authorizes the signing and delivery
of one or more agreements, including amendments or supplements to
existing
agreements
(each,
a
“Hedge Agreement”), and any related agreements necessary for the
consummation of the transactions
contemplated by each Hedge Agreement. The authorizations in this Section are supplemental to and not in
derogation of any authority provided by any other Ordinance of this
Council
concerning
hedging
arrangements.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is to the financial advantage of the City and in the City’s
best
interests
that
a
hedging
arrangement be undertaken by the
City with respect to any Bonds
issued or to be issued under the
Indenture, the Director of Finance
may authorize one or more interest
rate hedge transactions in accor-

86
dance with the applicable Hedge
Agreement; provided that (a) the
counterparty shall be rated at the
time of signing the Hedge Agreement not lower than A+ or A1 by
at least one rating agency or its
obligations under the Hedge Agreement shall be guaranteed or insured
by an entity rated at the time of
signing the Hedge Agreement not
lower than A+ or A1 by at least one
rating agency, and (b) the term of
each hedge transaction shall not
exceed the final maturity of the
Bonds to which the hedge relates.
The Director of Finance shall
negotiate the terms of each Hedge
Agreement with a counterparty satisfying the credit criteria in this
Ordinance. The City shall receive a
written opinion of a Financial Advisor that the payments made or to be
made by the counterparty to the
City, or by the City to the counterparty, shall be fair value for the
Hedge Agreement, given the credit
of the counterparty and the terms
and conditions of the Hedge Agreement. The Director of Finance shall
determine the terms and conditions
of the Hedge Agreement, including
without limitation, the rates to be
paid by the counterparty to the City
and by the City to the counterparty
under the Hedge Agreement, the
time or times and procedures for the
exercise by the counterparty or the
City, as the case may be, of any
option under the Hedge Agreement,
and whether the obligations of the
City under the Hedge Agreement
shall be secured by a Credit Support
Instrument. The approval of each
interest rate hedge transaction by
the Director of Finance shall be
conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery of the applicable
Hedge Agreement by the Director of
Finance.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from the Net Project Revenues and
Nontax
Revenues
and
may
be
payable also from other funds permitted by law to be used for the purpose, as identified by the Director of
Finance in the Hedge Agreement.
Those payments may be secured by
a pledge of and lien on the Bond
Fund and the Bond Reserve Fund,
to the extent permitted by the
Indenture, all as determined by the
Director of Finance and set forth in
the Hedge Agreement. The obligation of the City to make payments
under any Hedge Agreement does
not and shall not represent or constitute a debt or pledge of the faith
and credit or taxing power of the
City. Nothing gives any party to any
Hedge Agreement the right to have
excises, ad valorem or other taxes
levied by the City or the State of
Ohio
for
the
payment
of
any
amounts due under any Hedge
Agreement.
Section 14.
Financial Advisor.
The Director of Finance may obtain
the services of one or more Financial Advisors, from time to time, to
assist the Director of Finance in
making any of the determinations
required by this Ordinance to be determined by the Director of Finance
or to negotiate any Hedge Agreements. The Director of Finance may
rely on the written advice of any
Financial Advisor so retained. Any

The City Record
Financial
Advisor
or
consultant
employed under the authority of this
Ordinance shall be disinterested in
the transaction and be independent
of the underwriters or counterparties and any other party interested
in the transaction.

contracts made or entered into by
the City.

Ordinance was passed in compliance
with all applicable provisions of the
City’s Charter and the rules of this
Council. This Council further finds
and determines that all acts and
conditions necessary to be done or
performed by the City or to have
been met precedent to and in the
issuing of the Refunding Bonds in
order to make them legal, valid, and
binding special obligations of the
City have been performed and have
been met, or will at the time of
delivery of the Refunding Bonds
have been performed and have been
met, in regular and due form as
required by law, and that no limitation of indebtedness or taxation,
either statutory or constitutional, is
applicable to the issuance of the
Refunding Bonds.

Meeting Requirements. This Council finds and determines that all formal actions of this Council and any
of its committees concerning and
relating to the passage of this Ordinance were taken in an open meeting of this Council or committees,
and that all deliberations of this
Council and any of its committees
that resulted in those formal actions
were in meetings open to the public, all in compliance with the law.

Ordinance shall expire one year
from the effective date of this Ordinance. If a preliminary official
statement with respect to the Refunding Bonds is distributed under

March 5, 2008
the authority of this Ordinance at
any time within the one-year period
following its effective date, then the
authority granted by this Ordinance

under the authority of this Ordinance. That forty days after passage of this legislation, the Director
of Finance shall make a status
report to the Chair of the Committee on Finance.

County Port Authority (the “Authority”), as lessor, and the City, as
lessee, and approved a Trust Agreement dated as of June 1, 1997 (as

signed and delivered various series
of Certificates (as defined in the
Trust Agreement), each such series
of Certificates evidencing proportionate interests in Base Rent (as
defined in the Facility Lease) to be
paid by the City pursuant to the
Facility Lease; and
Whereas, under the Trust Agreement, Additional Certificates (as
defined in the Trust Agreement)
may, with the approval of the City,
be issued to pay the cost of refunding outstanding Certificates; and
Whereas, this Council has determined to authorize the issuance of
Additional Certificates (“Refunding
Certificates”)
under
the
Trust
Agreement to refund outstanding
Certificates and to authorize hedging arrangements with respect to
Base Rent payments and Certificate
Payments (as defined in the Trust
Agreement) to obtain savings or to

March 5, 2008
minimize risks of increased interest
expense on the Certificates bearing
interest at variable rates and corresponding Base Rent payments, as
provided in this ordinance; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department and providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that approving the
issuance of Refunding Certificates
and authorizing related agreements
is necessary to enable the City to
minimize risks of increased interest
expense on a timely basis to reduce
the costs of the lease-purchase of

Determinations by

473

87
(a) Public Purpose. The acquisition, financing and refinancing by
the City of the Cleveland Stadium
pursuant to the Ground Lease, the
Facility Lease and the Trust Agreement and the use of the Cleveland
Stadium as a source of public relaxation and entertainment served and
serves a proper public municipal
purpose.
(b) Supplemental Ground Lease,
Supplemental Lease, Supplemental
Trust Agreement and Refunding
Certificates. It is necessary, proper
and in the best interest of the City
to authorize one or more Supplemental Ground Leases, Supplemental Leases and Purchase Agreements and approve one or more Supplemental Trust Agreements and the
issuance of Refunding Certificates
in one or more series for the purpose of refunding (i) one or more
series of the Outstanding Certificates or designated maturities (or
portions of maturities) thereof, to
obtain aggregate net present value
savings in Certificate Payments and
corresponding Base Rent payments
of not less than three percent (3%),
or (ii) one or more series of Outstanding Certificates, or designated
maturities (or portions of maturities) thereof, that are short-term or
variable-rate obligations and that
the Director of Finance has determined, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, are subjecting the City to Base Rent payments
the interest components of which
include undesirably high rates of
interest or undesirable fluctuations
in rates of interest that can economically be avoided or mitigated
through refinancing.
Separate series of Refunding Certificates may be issued at the same
or
different
times.
A
Purchase
Agreement, Supplemental Lease and
Supplemental Trust Agreement shall
be delivered for each series and may
be delivered for multiple series. A
Supplemental Ground Lease shall be
delivered for any series of Refunding Certificates with a final maturity later than the final maturity of
the then Outstanding Certificates.
This Council finds and determines
that the issuance of the Refunding
Certificates and signing and delivery of Supplemental Ground Leases,
Supplemental Leases and Purchase
Agreements and approval of Supplemental Trust Agreements in connection with such issuance for the
purpose provided in this Ordinance
serves a proper, public, municipal
purpose by reducing the costs to the
City of the lease-purchase of the
Cleveland Stadium which is a source
of public relaxation and entertainment for the people of the City of
Cleveland.
(c) Leased Premises. The Council
of the City found and determined at
the time of the authorization of the
Existing Facility Lease and approval of the Existing Trust Agreement and the Outstanding Certificates, and hereby reaffirms that the
Leased Premises are essential to the
proper, efficient and economic operation of the City.
Section 3. Authorization of Hedging Arrangements.
This Council
finds that by engaging in interest
rate hedging arrangements with
respect to the Facility Lease and

88
Certificates the City may reduce its
financing costs by optimizing the
relative amounts of fixed and variable rate obligations, or minimizing
the risk of variations in its financing costs, or obtaining savings by
confirming rates of interest on Certificates
in
advance
of
their
issuance. To permit the City to have
the flexibility to undertake interest
rate swap, swaption, rate cap, rate
collar and other hedging transactions, from time to time, and to
establish the procedures for approving those transactions, this Council
authorizes the signing and delivery
of one or more agreements, including amendments or supplements to
existing
agreements
(each,
a
“Hedge Agreement”), and any related agreements necessary for the
consummation of the transactions
contemplated by each Hedge Agreement. The authorizations in this Section 3 are supplemental to and not
in derogation of any authority provided by any other ordinance of this
Council
concerning
hedging
arrangements.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is to the financial advantage of the City and in the City’s
best
interests
that
a
hedging
arrangement be undertaken by the
City with respect to the Facility
Lease or any Outstanding Certificates, the Director of Finance may
authorize one or more interest rate
hedge transactions in accordance
with the applicable Hedge Agreement; provided that (a) the counterparty shall be rated at the time
of signing the Hedge Agreement not
lower than A+ or A1 by at least one
rating agency or its obligations
under the Hedge Agreement shall be
guaranteed or insured by an entity
rated at the time of signing the
Hedge Agreement not lower than
A+ or A1 by at least one rating
agency, and (b) the term of each
hedge transaction shall not exceed
the final maturity of the Certificates
to which the hedge relates.
The Director of Finance shall
negotiate the terms of each Hedge
Agreement with a counterparty satisfying the credit criteria in this
Ordinance. The City shall receive a
written opinion of a Financial Advisor that the payments made or to be
made by the counterparty to the
City, or by the City to the counterparty, shall be fair value for the
Hedge Agreement, given the credit
of the counterparty and the terms
and conditions of the Hedge Agreement. The Director of Finance shall
determine the terms and conditions
of the Hedge Agreement, including
without limitation, the rates to be
paid by the counterparty to the City
and by the City to the counterparty
under the Hedge Agreement, the
time or times and procedures for the
exercise by the counterparty or the
City, as the case may be, of any
option under the Hedge Agreement,
and whether the obligations of the
City under the Hedge Agreement
shall be secured by a Credit Support
Instrument. The approval of each
interest rate hedge transaction by
the Director of Finance shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing
and
delivery
of
the
applicable

The City Record
Hedge Agreement by the Director of
Finance.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be subject
to appropriation and certification as
provided in the Facility Lease.
Those payments may be secured by
the Facility Lease, to the extent permitted by the Trust Agreement, all
as determined by the Director of
Finance and set forth in the Hedge
Agreement. The obligation of the
City to make payments under any
Hedge Agreement does not and
shall not represent or constitute a
general obligation, debt, bonded
indebtedness or a pledge of the faith
and credit of the City or the State
of Ohio. Nothing gives any party to
any Hedge Agreement the right to
have excises, ad valorem or other
taxes levied by the City or the State
of Ohio for the payment of any
amounts due under any Hedge
Agreement.
Section 4. Refunding of the Series
2007 Certificates; Escrow Agreements. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
one or more escrow agreements
between the City and the Trustee,
as escrow trustee, providing for,
among other matters: the investment
and holding in escrow of the proceeds of Refunding Certificates to
be applied to the refunding of Series
2007 Certificates; the application of
the moneys derived from those
investments to the payment of the
Certificate Payments on Series 2007
Certificates, and the irrevocable call
for redemption of Series 2007 Certificates to be called for redemption
prior to maturity. The Director of
Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and
for
reimbursement
of
expenses
incurred pursuant to each escrow
agreement from proceeds of Refunding Certificates to the extent available and then from Fund Nos. 67 SF
600 and 01 SF 100 or from other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose, as determined by the
Director of Finance. Provision shall
be made in each escrow agreement
to give the Trustee any written
notice of redemption required under
the Trust Agreement. The Director
of Finance and other appropriate
City officials shall sign all documents and take all other actions
necessary or appropriate on the part
of the City to effect each such
refunding in accordance with the
Trust Agreement and to cause the
Series 2007 Certificates to be deemed
paid and discharged, including without limitation, the retention of an
independent firm of accountants to
verify the mathematical accuracy of
the calculations relating to the
escrow. Upon the issuance and delivery of a series of Refunding Certificates, the Trustee and the City
are authorized to disburse from the
Funds established and maintained
under the Trust Agreement such
amounts of moneys as are in excess
of the balances required by the
Trust Agreement to then be maintained in those Funds. The Director
of Finance is authorized to give
written notice to the Trustee of the
call for redemption of the Series
2007 Certificates on the earliest

474

March 5, 2008
redemption
date
following
the
issuance of the Refunding Certificates, pursuant to the Trust Agreement and the applicable escrow
agreement.
Section 5. Determination of Base
Rent and Terms of Refunding Certificates; Application of Proceeds.
(a) Principal Components and
Term. Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is to the financial advantage of the City and in the City’s
best interests that one or more
series of Refunding Certificates be
issued to refund Outstanding Certificates, the Director of Finance is
authorized to negotiate and provide
for the terms of the Refunding Certificates and the Base Rent, as
amended pursuant to a Supplemental Lease, including the final Lease
Term, which shall end not later than
the final maturity of the Outstanding Certificates, and the annual and
aggregate principal components of
Base Rent. The principal amount of
each series of Refunding Certificates and the corresponding principal component of Base Rent is to be
the amount set forth in the Purchase Agreement for that series and
shall be the amount determined by
the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, to be necessary (i) to pay
the costs of refunding the Series
2007 Certificates, (ii) to fund any
reserves required under the Trust
Agreement, (iii) to pay costs of any
Credit Support Instruments, (iv) to
pay identified amounts owed under
Hedge Agreements, and (v) to pay
costs of issuing the Refunding Certificates. The Refunding Certificates
of each series shall mature on the
dates and in the respective principal
amounts set forth in the Purchase
Agreement for that series, consistent with this Ordinance and the
Trust Agreement.
(b) Interest. The Refunding Certificates may be issued as obligations bearing interest at fixed or
variable interest rates, based on the
determination of the Director of
Finance as to the financial advantage to, and best interests of, the
City, as specified in the Purchase
Agreement.
If
the
Director
of
Finance so determines, then the
method and procedure by which the
variable rate of interest to be borne
by
the
Refunding
Certificates
shall be determined as provided in
the applicable Supplemental Trust
Agreement, whether by reference to
a market index, by a remarketing
agent or otherwise; provided that no
Refunding Certificates shall bear
interest at a rate in excess of twenty-five
percent
(25%)
per
year
(including any Refunding Certificate held by a provider of a Credit
Support Instrument). The Director
of Finance may determine that the
terms of a variable rate series of
Refunding Certificates may or may
not permit the holders to tender
their variable rate Refunding Certificates for purchase by the City. If
the Director of Finance designates
any series of Refunding Certificates
as variable rate Certificates, and if
the holders of that series of Refunding Certificates are to be entitled to
tender those Certificates for pur-

March 5, 2008
chase, then the Director of Finance
shall also designate in the Purchase
Agreement for those variable rate
Certificates (and may designate
others, from time to time, in substitution therefor), the tender agent or
agents and the remarketing agent
or agents, which designations shall
be based on the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the parties so designated
possess the requisite resources and
experience to provide the services
required of them and that the terms
on which the designated parties
have agreed to provide such services are fair and commercially reasonable.
(c) Optional and Mandatory Redemption. The Refunding Certificates of each series, and the corresponding principal component of
Base Rent, may be subject to
redemption prior to maturity at the
option of the City, if and to the
extent set forth in the Purchase
Agreement for that series. Any
Refunding
Certificates
so
determined to be subject to optional
redemption and maturing by their
stated
terms
after
the
earliest
optional redemption date shall be
subject to redemption at the option
of the City on or after the earliest
optional redemption date in whole
or in part on any date at the
redemption prices set forth in the
Purchase Agreement and in accordance with the applicable Supplemental Trust Agreement. The Refunding Certificates designated in
the Purchase Agreement as term
Certificates subject to mandatory
sinking fund redemption shall be
redeemed prior to maturity on each
mandatory redemption date designated in the Purchase Agreement in
the aggregate amount of the sinking fund installment to be paid on
such mandatory redemption date, all
as provided in the Purchase Agreement and in accordance with the
Supplemental Trust Agreement.
(d) Credit Support and Other Instruments. The Director of Finance,
regardless of whether a series of
Refunding Certificates bears interest at variable or fixed rates, is
authorized to contract for one or
more Credit Support Instruments, if
the Director of Finance determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the Credit
Support Instruments will result in a
savings in the cost of the financing
to the City. The costs of such Credit Support Instruments may be paid
from proceeds of Refunding Certificates or from Fund Nos. 67 SF 600
and 01 SF 001 or from other money
lawfully available and appropriated
or to be appropriated for that purpose, as determined by the Director
of Finance. The Director of Finance
is authorized to enter into agreements in connection with the delivery of the Refunding Certificates,
and from time to time thereafter so
long as the Refunding Certificates
are outstanding, with providers of
Credit Support Instruments, tender
agents (which may be the Trustee),
remarketing agents (which may be
any of the Original Purchasers) and
others as may be determined by the
Director of Finance to be necessary
or appropriate to provide for the

The City Record
method of determining the variable
interest rates, permitting holders
the right of tender and providing for
payment of the purchase price of, or
Certificate Payments on, the variable rate Refunding Certificates.
(e) Base Rent. The City acknowledges that the aggregate principal
amount of Outstanding Certificates
shall be based on the aggregate
principal component of Base Rent
under the Facility Lease and that
the interest on the Certificates shall
be based on the interest components
of Base Rent. The Base Rent to be
payable under and in accordance
with the Facility Lease during any
Lease Term shall be an amount sufficient to cover the amount of Certificate Payments on the Outstanding Certificates that are due and
payable during that Lease Term,
and such Base Rent shall be specified or determined in an exhibit to
the Facility Lease; provided, however, that the City’s payment of Base
Rent and Additional Rent is Subject
to Appropriation and Certification
as provided in the Facility Lease
and nothing in the Facility Lease,
the Certificates, the Trust Agreement, or any Hedge Agreement constitutes or shall constitute a pledge
by the City, or an obligation of the
City, of any taxes or other moneys
to the payments due thereunder.
(f) Primary Offering Disclosure.
If, in the judgment of the Director
of Finance after consultation with
the Original Purchasers, a disclosure document is appropriate relating to the initial offering of one or
more series of Refunding Certificates, the Director of Finance, on
behalf of the City and in that officer’s official capacity, is authorized
to (i) cooperate with the Original
Purchasers in the preparation of,
and the making of modifications,
completions or changes of or supplements to, such a disclosure document, (ii) determine, and certify or
otherwise represent when the disclosure document is to be deemed
final or is final, (iii) authorize the
use and distribution of that disclosure document and any supplements
thereto in connection with the initial offering of the applicable series
of Refunding Certificates, and (iv)
sign certificates, statements or other
documents in connection with the
finality, accuracy and completeness
of that disclosure document. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
contract for services for the production and distribution of any disclosure statements, including by printed and electronic means.
(g) Continuing Disclosure. If and
to the extent required by Rule 15c212 promulgated by the Securities
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
in connection with the sale of one
or more series of Refunding Certificates, the City shall enter into continuing
disclosure
agreements,
approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, between the
City and the Trustee, with terms not
inconsistent with this Ordinance and
as may be approved by the officers
signing those agreements on behalf
of the City, all of which shall be
conclusively evidenced by that signing. In each such continuing disclosure agreement, the City shall agree
to provide, or cause to be provided,

475

89
to each nationally recognized municipal securities information repository designated by the SEC from time
to time in accordance with that
Rule, and to any state information
depository,
the
annual
financial
information and operating data and
notices of specified events required
by that Rule, as more particularly
described in the continuing disclosure agreement. The Director of
Finance is authorized to sign and
deliver each continuing disclosure
agreement and any related agreements, certificates and other instruments, and to deliver such information, as may be necessary or appropriate to comply with the requirements of the Rule. The City understands and agrees that those commitments are intended to be for the
benefit of the holders from time to
time of the applicable series of
Refunding
Certificates,
including
holders of book-entry interests in
those Certificates.
(h) Application for Ratings. If, in
the judgment of the Director of
Finance, the filing of applications
for one or more ratings on Refunding Certificates by one or more
nationally-recognized rating agencies is necessary or desirable for
marketing purposes, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare
and submit those applications, and
to provide information as may be
required in support of those applications for the purpose. The cost of
obtaining each such rating, except
to the extent paid by the Original
Purchasers in accordance with the
Purchase Agreement, shall be paid
from the proceeds of the Refunding
Certificates to the extent available
and then from other money lawfully available and appropriated or to
be appropriated for that purpose.
(i) Application of Proceeds; Costs of
Issuance. The proceeds from the
sale of the Refunding Certificates
shall be deposited and applied as
provided in the Supplemental Indenture and for the purposes stated in
this Ordinance and are appropriated
for those purposes. Costs of issuing
the Refunding Certificates that are
not paid from those proceeds may be
paid from Fund Nos. 67 SF 600 and
01 SF 001 or from other money lawfully available and appropriated or
to be appropriated for that purpose,
as determined by the Director.
Section 6. Sale of the Refunding
Certificates; Purchase Agreements.
The Director of Finance shall sign
and deliver Purchase Agreements
for Refunding Certificates setting
forth the conditions for delivery of
the Refunding Certificates that are
consistent with this Ordinance and
the Trust Agreement and that are
determined

the
Director
of
Finance,

the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to be

participation issued by governmental entities, including, without limitation, representations as to the accuracy and completeness of information contained in the disclosure

this Ordinance. In the event the
Refunding Certificates are issued in
more than one series sold at different times, a separate Purchase
Agreement shall be signed and
delivered for each separately deliv-

90
ered series. The Purchase Agreement shall provide for the sale of
the applicable series of Refunding
Certificates to the Original Purchasers selected by the Director of
Finance and identified in the Purchase Agreement, based on an evaluation of the qualifications of firms
that have proposed to underwrite
the Refunding Certificates.
Each Purchase Agreement shall
set forth the following, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, consistent with this Ordinance
and the Trust Agreement:
(a)
the
aggregate
principal
amount of Refunding Certificates
issued;
(b) the Purchase Price for the
Refunding Certificates;
(c) whether any Refunding Certificates are to be subject to optional redemption prior to maturity, and,
if so, the earliest optional redemption date for those Refunding Certificates subject to prior redemption,
which shall be not later than ten
years from the first interest payment date of the applicable series,
and the applicable redemption price,
which shall be not greater than
102%
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed;
(d) the dates on which principal
of the Refunding Certificates is to
be paid, which shall be not later
than thirty (30) years from their
respective dates of issuance, with an
identification of whether the payment is due by stated maturity or
by mandatory sinking fund redemption of Refunding Certificates of a
particular maturity;
(e) the interest rates to be borne
by Refunding Certificates bearing
interest
at
a
fixed
rate,
the
weighted average of which shall
not exceed eight percent (8%) as to
Refunding Certificates of any series,
and the method by which the interest rate is to be determined for
Refunding Certificates bearing interest at variable rates, consistent
with Section 5;
(f) the particular Outstanding
Certificates or portions thereof to be
Series 2007 Certificates;
(g) the title and series designation for the Refunding Certificates;
(h) the amount, if any, of proceeds of the sale of the Refunding
Certificates to be deposited in the
Reserve Account in order to cause
the balance therein to equal the
Reserve Requirement, if and to the
extent required by the applicable
Supplemental Trust Agreement, and
any determination as to whether
there shall be a special reserve fund
for the Refunding Certificates of
any series, separate from the common Reserve Account, or a surety or
insurance policy, bank letter or line
of credit, or other form of credit or
liquidity
facility
enhancing
the
security for Refunding Certificates
of that series in lieu of a funded
reserve fund;
(i) whether any Refunding Certificates are to be secured by or
payable
from
a
Credit
Support

It is determined that the terms of
the Refunding Certificates and the
corresponding terms of Base Rent as
so determined within the limitations
set forth in this Ordinance and as
so specified and set forth in the Pur-

The City Record
chase Agreement will be in the best
interest of the City and consistent
with all legal requirements.
Section 7. Conversion and Remarketing.
In the event that the Director of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is advantageous to the
City to convert the interest on any
Series
2007
Certificates
bearing
interest at variable rates to fixed
interest rates for a period of time or
to maturity or to convert to a different variable rate period or mode,
the City shall undertake the conversion and remarketing of those
Certificates in accordance with the
applicable
Supplemental
Trust
Agreement. In connection with any
conversion and remarketing of Certificates, the Director of Finance is
authorized to obtain one or more
Credit Support Instruments if the
Director determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the Credit Support Instrument will facilitate the remarketing
of the Certificates. In the event the
Director
of
Finance
determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that it is necessary in connection with the conversion and remarketing of Certificates
to supplement or amend the Existing Facility Lease or the Existing
Trust Agreement in order to address
current market conditions or to permit the use of a Credit Support
Instrument or to otherwise obtain
financing
arrangements
advantageous to the City, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
to sign and deliver an amendment
of the Existing Facility Lease, or an
amended
and
restated
Facility
Lease, and to signify approval of
the Amendment to the Existing
Trust Agreement, or an amended
and restated Existing Trust Agreement, in each case approved as to
form by the Director of Law. The
costs of any conversion and remarketing of Certificates may be paid,
as determined by the Director of
Finance, from the proceeds of remarketing or from Fund Nos. 67 SF 600
and 01 SF 001 or from other money
lawfully available and appropriated
or to be appropriated for that purpose. The Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare one or more
disclosure documents in connection
with any conversion and remarketing under the same terms and conditions as set forth in Section 5 of
this
Ordinance
with
respect
to
Refunding Certificates. The Director
of Finance or any other officer of
the City having responsibility for
the conversion and remarketing of
the Certificates is authorized to
take such actions or cause to be
taken such actions as are necessary
to maintain the tax-exempt status of
any Outstanding Certificates, and
the covenants and authorizations in
Section 9 of this Ordinance shall
apply to any converted Certificates.
The Director of Finance and other
City officials are authorized to sign
and deliver such instruments, certificates and documents as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions authorized by
this
Section.
The
Director
of

other City officials, as appropriate,

Certificates
under
the
terms of this Ordinance, the Facility Lease and the Trust Agreement.
The Clerk of Council or other appropriate official of the City shall furnish the remarketing agent a true
transcript of proceedings certified
by the Clerk or other official, of all
proceedings had with reference to

the validity of the conversion and
remarketing.

any series of Refunding Certificates,
the Mayor and the Director of
Finance are authorized, in the name
and on behalf of the City, to sign
and deliver one or more Supplemental Leases and, if the final maturity of the Refunding Certificates is
later than the final maturity of the
then Outstanding Certificates, one
or more Supplemental Ground Leases, and to signify approval of one or
more Supplemental Trust Agreements, in each case approved as to
form and correctness by the Director of Law, not inconsistent with
this Ordinance and the Purchase
Agreement and not substantially
adverse to the City as may be
approved by the officers signing the
same on behalf of the City. The
determination by those officers that
a Supplemental Lease, Supplemental
Ground Lease or Supplemental Trust
Agreement
is
not
substantially
adverse to the City shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing and
delivery of that Supplemental Lease,
Supplemental Ground Lease or Supplemental Trust Agreement by those
officers. Any Supplemental Lease
may contain amendments to the
Facility Lease, as theretofor amended, and any Supplemental Trust
Agreement
may
contain
amendments to the Trust Agreement, as
theretofor amended, to permit the
City increased flexibility for the use
of financial or credit structures and
techniques determined by the Director of Finance, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
in the best interests of the City.

Mayor,
the
Director

the
Original
Purchasers a true transcript of proceedings certified by the Clerk or
other official, of all proceedings had

of the Refunding Certificates.
Section 9.

Director of Finance, as the fiscal
officer, or any other officer having
responsibility for the issuance of
Refunding Certificates, is, alone or
in conjunction with any of the foregoing or with any other officer or
employee of the City, authorized (a)
to cooperate with the Original Purchasers and the Trustee by making,
on
behalf
of
the
City,
such
covenants and representations in the
Facility Lease as are appropriate
and necessary so that (a) the Facility Lease and the Refunding Certificates of any series will not (i)
constitute private activity bonds,
arbitrage bonds or hedge bonds

Code or (ii) be treated other than as
obligations to which Section 103(a)
of the Code applies, and (b) the
interest components of Base Rent
and interest on the Refunding Certificates will not be treated as an
item of tax preference under Section
57 of the Code. The City hereby
covenants it will take or cause to be
taken such actions that may be
required of it for the interest components of Base Rent and interest
on the Refunding Certificates to be
and remain excluded from gross

authorize to be taken any actions
that would adversely affect that
exclusion.
The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer
of the City having responsibility
for the issuance of Refunding Certificates is hereby authorized (a) to
make or effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent,
approval, or waiver on behalf of the
City with respect to the Facility
Lease and the Refunding Certificates as the City is permitted to or
required to make or give under the
federal income tax laws, including,
without limitation thereto, any of
the elections provided for in Section
148(f)(4)(C) of the Code or available under Section 148 of the Code,
for the purpose of assuring, enhancing or protecting favorable tax
treatment or status of the Facility
Lease and the Refunding Certificates or the interest components
thereof
or
assisting
compliance

reducing the burden or expense of
such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or payments or penalties, or making payments of special
amounts in lieu of making computations to determine, or paying,
excess earnings as rebate, or obviating those amounts or payments,
as
determined
by
that
officer,
which action shall be in writing
and signed by the officer, (b) to
take any and all other actions,
make or obtain calculations, make
payments,
and
make
or
give
reports, covenants and certifications of and on behalf of the City,

income and the intended tax status
of the interest components of the
Facility Lease and on the Refunding Certificates, and (c) to give one
or more appropriate certificates of
the City, for inclusion in the transcript for the Refunding Certificates, setting forth the reasonable
expectations of the City regarding
the amount and use of all the proceeds from the sale of the Refunding Certificates, the facts, circumstances and estimates on which
they are based, and other facts and
circumstances relevant to the tax
treatment of the interest component
of and the tax status of the Refunding Certificates. Notwithstanding
the foregoing or any other provisions of this Ordinance to the contrary, if the Director of Finance
determines prior to the execution
and delivery of a Purchase Agreement and that it is necessary and
appropriate and in the best interests of the City for interest on a
series of Refunding Certificates
and the corresponding interest components of Base Rent to be included in gross income for federal
income tax purposes, the City shall
not be bound by the covenants of
this Section.
Each covenant made in this Section with respect to the Refunding
Certificates
is
also
made
with
respect to all issues any portion of
the principal of or interest on which
is paid from proceeds of the Refunding Certificates (and, if different,
the original issue and any refunding issues in a series of refundings),
to the extent such compliance is necessary to assure exclusion of interest on the Refunding Certificates
from
gross
income
for
federal
income tax purposes, and the officers identified above are authorized
to take actions with respect to those
issues as they are authorized in this
Section to take with respect to the
Refunding Certificates.
