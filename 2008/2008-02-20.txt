state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body

Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the

respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and

on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
