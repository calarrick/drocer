ensure that each minor who is a
passenger of an automobile being
operated by that person is wearing
all of the available elements of a
properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of division
(B)(2) of this section shall not be
considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of
negligence or contributory negligence. But, the trier of fact may
determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio Rules
of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the
tort action and may diminish a
recovery of compensatory damages
that represents noneconomic loss, as
defined in Section 2307.011 of the
Revised Code, in a tort action that
could have been recovered but for
the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of
the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure shall
not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other
than a prosecution for a violation of
this section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal
action involving the person other
than a prosecution for a violation of
this section.

involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices,
any occupant of the passenger car
who sustained injury or death was
not wearing an available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing
all of the available elements of such
a device or was not wearing such a
device as properly adjusted, then,
consistent with the rules of evidence, the fact that such occupant
was not wearing the available occupant restraining device, was not
wearing all of the available elements of such a device or was not
wearing such a device as properly
adjusted is admissible in evidence
in relation to any claim for relief in
a tort action to the extent that the
claim for relief satisfies all of the
following:
A. It seeks to recover damages for
injury or death to such occupant;

May 14, 2008
B. The defendant in question is
the manufacturer, designer, distributor or seller of the passenger car;

defendant in question is that the

occupant was enhanced or aggravated by some design defect in the
passenger car or that the passenger
car was not crashworthy.

Whoever
violates
division
(b)(1) of this section shall be fined
thirty dollars ($30.00).
(h)
Whoever
violates
division
(b)(3) of this section shall be fined
twenty dollars ($20.00).
(i) Except as otherwise provided
in this section, whoever violates
division (b)(4) of this section is
guilty of a minor misdemeanor on a
first offense; on a second or subsequent offense such person is guilty
of a misdemeanor of the third
degree. (RC4513.263)

Res. No. 777-08.
By Council Members Westbrook,
Brancatelli and Cummins.
An emergency resolution congratulating the U.S. House of Representatives for the passage of H.R. 5818
and urging the U.S. Senate to support the passage of H.R 5818, cited
as the Neighborhood Stabilization
Act of 2008, which will authorize the
Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development
to
make
loans
to
States to acquire foreclosed housing
and to make grants to States for
related costs.
Whereas, vacant foreclosed properties often become a breeding
ground for crime and fires, and
require a disproportionate amount
of government maintenance, from
securing properties against criminal
activity to removal of garbage and
rodents to demolition, all at a cost
to taxpayers; and
Whereas, vacant properties reduce
city tax revenue in three ways: they
are often tax delinquent; their low
value means they generate little in
taxes; and they depress property
values across an entire neighborhood; and
Whereas, the citizens who live in
neighborhoods with many vacant

953

29
and
abandoned
properties
have
great difficulty obtaining homeowner’s insurance, mortgages and loans
for home improvements; and
Whereas, vacant properties degrade and devalue the quality of
life for remaining residents, isolating and weakening the neighborhood, and increasing the likelihood
that property values will continue to
decline and further abandonment
will set in; and
Whereas, H.R. 5818 will establish
a loan and grant program administered by the Department of Housing
and Development to help States purchase and rehabilitate owner-vacated foreclosed homes with the goal
of stabilizing and occupying them
as soon as possible, either through
resale or rental qualified families:
and
Whereas, H.R. 5818 will distribute
these loans and grants to areas with
the highest foreclosure levels; and
Whereas, H.R. 5818 will provide
incentives for States to use funds to
stabilize as many properties as possible; and
Whereas, H.R. 5818 will provide
housing for low- and moderateincome families, especially those
that have lost homes to foreclosure;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council congratulates the U.S. House of Representatives for the passage of H.R.
5818 and urges the U.S. Senate to
support the passage of H.R 5818,
cited as the Neighborhood Stabilization Act of 2008, which will authorize the Secretary of Housing and
Urban Development to make loans
to States to acquire foreclosed housing and to make grants to States for
related costs.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to George
W. Bush, President of the United
States, Nancy Pelosi, Speaker, U.S.
House of Representatives, Harry
Reid, Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,
George Voinovich, U.S. Senator from
Ohio, Sherrod Brown, U.S. Senator
from Ohio, Dennis Kucinich, Congressman, Ted Strickland, the Governor of the State of Ohio, and
James Rokakis, Cuyahoga County
Treasurer.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it

AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 167-08.
By Council Members Cleveland,
Brady, Cimperman and Sweeney (by
request).
An emergency resolution declaring the intent to vacate a portion of
East 71st Street (90 feet wide).
Whereas, this Council is satisfied
that there is good cause to vacate a
portion of East 71st Street (90 feet
wide), as described; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council declares its intent to vacate a portion
of the following described real property:
Declaring the intent to vacate the
easterly 20 feet of East 71st Street
(90 feet wide) extending northerly
from the northerly right of way line
of Woodland Avenue S.E. (80 feet
wide) to the southerly right of way
line of Platt Avenue S.E. (50 feet
wide).

May 14, 2008
Legal Description approved by
Greg Esber, Section Chief, Plats,
Surveys and House Numbering Section.
Section 2. That this resolution is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted May 5, 2008.
Effective May 9, 2008.

Res. No. 709-08.
By Mayor Jackson and Council
Members Sweeney, Zone, Polensek,
Cummins, Brady, Brancatelli, Cimperman, Cleveland, Coats, Conwell,
Johnson,
Keane,
Kelley,
Lewis,
Mitchell, Pierce Scott, Reed, Santiago, Turner, Westbrook and White.
An emergency resolution urging
the General Assembly to amend Sub.
S.B. 171, as passed by the Senate, to
strike language that purports to prohibit municipal regulation of scrap
metal dealers, pawnbrokers and secondhand dealers, and to instead recognize and allow for local regulation that is not in conflict with the
state regulation of these activities;
and to expressly allow a municipality to elect, by ordinance, to require
that
the
records
that
the
bill
requires that these businesses keep
be submitted to the police electronically.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has suffered at the hands of criminals who strip homes of their plumbing, furnaces, electrical wiring and
other metal components, and vehicles of their catalytic converters;
and
Whereas, the problem has become
more severe as the salvage value of
these metals has increased; and
Whereas, the Ohio Senate recently passed Sub. S.B. 171 to comprehensively revise the laws regulating
scrap metal dealers, pawnbrokers,
and secondhand dealers; and
Whereas, the bill, despite many
positive provisions, contains a serious shortcoming because it purports

The City Record
to prohibit all local regulation of
scrap metal dealers contrary to the
home rule provisions of the Ohio
Constitution; and
Whereas, there is a similar prohibition in existing state law that
declares that the state of Ohio is the
sole regulator of pawnbrokers; and
Whereas,
municipalities
have
local needs that the General Assembly may not be aware of, or have
considered or addressed in the bill;
and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has been working on a local initiative to require that scrap metal dealers provide records of their transactions to the police electronically;
and
Whereas, the police believe that
this could be a critical tool in the
fight against scrap metal thieves;
and
Whereas, Sub. S.B. 171 as passed
by the Senate does not address electronic reporting and would purport
to prohibit municipalities from implementing such a program; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the General Assembly to amend Sub.
S.B. 171, as passed by the Senate,
and currently under consideration in
the House of Representatives, to
strike language that purports to prohibit municipal regulation of scrap
metal dealers, pawnbrokers and secondhand dealers, and to instead recognize and allow for local regulation that is not in conflict with the
state regulation of these activities;
and to expressly allow a municipality to elect, by ordinance, to require
that
the
records
that
the
bill
requires that these businesses keep
be submitted to the police electronically.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to all members of the
Ohio General Assembly.
Section 3. That this resolution is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it

39
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted May 5, 2008.
Effective May 9, 2008.

Res. No. 710-08.
By Council Member Coats.
An emergency resolution withdrawing objection to the transfer of
stock of a C1 Liquor Permit at 657
East 152nd Street and repealing Resolution No. 10-08, objecting to said
transfer.
Whereas, this Council objected to
the transfer of stock of a C1 Liquor
Permit to East 152nd Street, Inc., 657
East 152nd Street, Cleveland, Ohio
44110, Permanent No. 2405365, adopted by the Council on January 7,
2008; and
Whereas, this Council wishes to
withdraw its objection to the above
transfer and consents to said transfer; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That objection to a C1
Liquor Permit to East 152nd Street,
Inc., 657 East 152nd Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44110, Permanent Number 2405365 be and the same is
hereby withdrawn and Resolution
No. 10-08, containing such objection, be and the same is hereby
repealed and that this Council consents to the immediate transfer
thereof.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
