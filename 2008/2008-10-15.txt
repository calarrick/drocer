FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS REFERRED
Res. No. 1563-08.
By Council Member Cimperman and
Mitchell.
An emergency resolution urging
the Jackson Administration to adopt
the 2008 Food Charter and to work

1970

October 15, 2008
with Cuyahoga County in order to
promote regional economic development and food security for our
neighborhoods, and to champion a
local food system that secures the
right of all residents to adequate
amounts of safe, nutritious, culturally acceptable foods.
Whereas, according to a 2008
study by the Ohio State University
Extension, the residents of Northeast Ohio spend an estimated $9.2
billion annually on food; and
Whereas, current market demand
for fruits and vegetables consumed
in the household alone is estimated
to be valued at $563 million, while
current regional demand for meat
consumed in the household is valued
at just over $1 billion; and
Whereas, very few of these dollars support local farmers or local
food businesses; and
Whereas, food access is a growing
problem for many urban neighborhoods in Cleveland and Cuyahoga
County; and
Whereas, according to a Cuyahoga County Planning Commission
assessment in 2008, fast food is 4.5
times more accessible than largerscale supermarkets in Cleveland and
3 times more accessible throughout
the county; and
Whereas, because 14% of county
households and 25% of City households do not own a vehicle and 34
out of 36 Cleveland neighborhoods
have 25% or more households receiving food stamps or other food assistance, it is essential that the City
and the County work together to
ensure that all residents have access
to an adequate supply of nutritious,
affordable, locally-grown and culturally appropriate foods; and
Whereas, locally produced healthy
foods have the benefits of reducing
climate impacts of distance-shipped
or highly processed foods, increasing urban greenspace and community gathering spaces, fostering
stronger connections between urban
and rural communities and strengthening the local and regional economy; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Jackson Administration to adopt
the 2008 Food Charter and to work
with Cuyahoga County in order to
promote regional economic development and food security for our
neighborhoods, and to champion a
local food system that secures the
right of all residents to adequate
amounts of safe, nutritious, culturally acceptable foods.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to the Cuyahoga Board of County Commissioners.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it

October 15, 2008
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Referred to Director of Law; Committees on Health and Human Services, Finance.
Res. No. 1564-08.
By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency resolution establishing a food purchasing and contracting policy for the City of Cleveland that promotes regional economic growth, regional collaboration, environmental sustainability,
and food security through the support of regional food growers and
producers.
Whereas, the food system is a
major component of the regional
economy with residents spending an
estimated $9 billion dollars a year
annually on food; and
Whereas, the “regional economy”
includes a nine county region including Cuyahoga, Ashtabula, Geauga, Lake, Portage, Summit, Wayne,
Medina, and Lorain; and
Whereas, Ohio Governor Strickland’s Executive Order 2007-27S to
create a Ohio Food Policy Advisory
Council states that “increasing the
percentage of food grown, processed, and consumed in Ohio will
provide significant financial benefits to the entire State;” and
Whereas, the “locally grown” can
be defined as food grown within 150
miles the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, the Greater Cleveland
region has a strong agricultural heritage and food growing capacity;
and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has an emerging urban agriculture
small business sector; and
Whereas, urban agriculture is a
small business development opportunity and strong component of
urban neighborhood revitalization;
and
Whereas, Cleveland Mayor Frank
Jackson’s Urban Agenda states a
need to “support sustainable revitalization of urban neighborhoods and
business districts;” and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
recently established the “Gardening
for Greenbacks” program that assists small urban farm development
through a forgivable grant program;
and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
adopted the Fanny Lewis Resident
Employment Law that established
the City’s commitment to enter contracts that support the employment
of local residents; and
Whereas, purchasing locally grown
foods supports regional businesses;
and
Whereas, a strong regional economy benefits the residents of Cleveland; and
Whereas, Cleveland Mayor Frank
Jackson’s letter of support for the
UN Global Compact states that “we
challenged our local businesses to
buy local to help support the local
economy, protect the environment,
and support local jobs;” and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland is
a active member of the International
Council for Local Environmental Initiatives-Local Governments for Sustainability to promote citywide sustainable development practices; and

The City Record
Whereas, purchasing locally grown
food will reduce the City’s carbon
footprint by reducing the distance
that food travels from farm to plate;
and
Whereas, building a stronger local
food supply is essential for regional self reliance and emergency preparedness; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
ought to act as a model for local
purchasing policies that support
regional business development and
economic growth; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
will work with the Cleveland –
Cuyahoga County Food Policy Coalition to establish a local food purchasing policy that supports local
growers and producers; and
Whereas, current food contracts
will be reviewed by the City and its
vendors to acknowledge any current
local buying patterns and to explore
voluntary local procurement options
moving forward until contract terms
are up for review; and
Whereas, future contracts that
include the purchase of food signed
by the City of Cleveland will mandate a local food purchasing component consistent with goals set by
the City of Cleveland and the Cleveland-Cuyahoga Food Policy Coalition; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby establishes a food purchasing
and contracting policy for the City
of Cleveland that promotes regional
economic growth, regional collaboration, environmental sustainability,
and food security through the support of regional food growers and
producers.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby directed to send certified copies
of this resolution to representatives
of the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County
Food Policy Coalition.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Howse, Zone, Conwell, Sweeney,
Coats and Mitchell.
An emergency resolution strongly
urging all City of Cleveland residents to vote YES on State Issue 5
to preserve a rate cap on payday
lenders.
Whereas, payday loans are designed to trap people in a cycle of repeat
borrowing; and
Whereas, the interest on a typical
payday loan is 391 percent APR; and
Whereas, these high interest rates
aggravate Cleveland’s home mortgage foreclosure crisis; and

The City Record
Whereas, Democratic state legislators joined with Republicans to
crack down on abusive lending by
passing House Bill 545, which caps
Ohio’s annual interest on payday
loans at 28 percent; and
Whereas,
Gov.
Ted
Strickland
signed House Bill 545 into law; and
Whereas,
the
national
payday
lobby is financing a referendum
that would undermine Ohio’s nationally acclaimed payday reform law
and allow lenders to continue charging rates commonly associated with
loan sharking; and
Whereas, this referendum would
appear on the Nov. 4 ballot as Issue
5; and
Whereas, a YES vote on Issue 5
will preserve Ohio’s 28 percent rate
cap and block lenders from charging 391 percent interest; and
Whereas, preserving the rate cap
will help Cleveland’s families, neighborhoods and businesses by allowing
borrowers to keep more of their
money by spending less on high
interest rates; and
Whereas, a YES vote on Issue 5
will extend the same loan protections to Cleveland families that the
federal government provides to military families.
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby strongly urges all City of Cleveland residents to vote YES on State
