there is such a disparity; and
Whereas, the Task Force established a Commission on Minority
Health (“Commission”) to implement Task Force recommendations;

are responsible for excess morbidity
and mortality in minority populations; and
Whereas, the Commission targets
economically disadvantaged blacks,
Hispanics, Native American Indians
and Asians; and
Whereas,
the
Commission
has
announced the availability of funds
from the Health Priorities Trust
Fund to support planning grants for
the creation of Local Offices of
Minority Health;
Whereas, the minority populations
in the City of Cleveland would be
greatly served by the establishment
of a Local Office of Minority Health
by the City’s Health Department;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

Whereas, Cleveland and Cuyahoga
County residents and businesses are
challenged daily with uncertain economic conditions and rising energy
costs; and
Whereas, at Governor Strickland’s
request, the Ohio General Assembly
is considering Sub. S.B. 221 which
would restructure Ohio’s electric

Cleveland’s economy and the wellbeing of residential consumers and
small businesses alike; and
Whereas, that this Council endorses legislation that promotes the
development of a renewable energy
portfolio, energy efficiency, demand
response
and
other
sustainable
energy policies to be developed
most efficiently in a free-market
system; and
Whereas, utility companies should
be required to file at the Public
Utilities Commission of Ohio both
the Electric Security Plan and the
Market Rate Option every three
years and the comparison of the
two plans will allow the Commission to chose the least cost plan for
consumers in each utility’s service
territory; and

added to the bill to clarify the automatic adjustments in rates due to a
utility’s expenses for environmental,
fuel, maintenance and investment in
generation facilities does not occur
with proper hearings to be established; and

lower the demand for electricity,
programs need to be established by
the utility companies to help consumers in making good educated
choices when it comes to energy
conservation with renewable energy
sources needing to be utilized now
to help stabilize prices in the future;
and

104

January 23, 2008
Whereas, renewable and energy
efficiency
standard
benchmarks
need to be established to ensure
compliance from the utilities between now and 2025 with enforcement of these standards, appropriate penalties if the utilities fail to
comply; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
does not support language in Substitute Bill 221, Section 4928(b)(2)
which would allow utilities to avoid
the 25% Advanced Energy Portfolio
Standard by 2025 if the cost of
advanced energy is greater than 3%
of the cost of non-advanced energy;
and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
has twice previously supported the
Governors Energy Plan by passage
of Resolution No. 1661-07, passed
October 8, 2007 and Resolution No.
1987-07, passed December 3, 2007; and
