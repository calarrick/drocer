expense, provided that the person
does not refuse to permit reasonable
modifications by a disabled person,
which are necessary for that person
to fully enjoy the premises in which
he or she resides or will reside,
when the modifications are made at
the expense of the disabled person,
which permission may be reasonably based on the disabled person’s
promise, under division (m) of Section 665.03, to restore the interior of

nor shall this chapter be construed
to relieve any disabled person of

in a written lease, rental agreement
or contract of purchase or sale, or
to forbid distinctions based on the
inability to fulfill the terms and conditions, including financial obligations, of the lease, agreement, or
contract, so long as the distinctions
are not based on the disability, or
on the landlord’s refusal to make
reasonable
modifications
in
the
lease, agreement or contract conditions for the purpose of denying a
disabled person equal opportunity to
the use and enjoyment of the
premises. Making the modifications
permitted under this division does
not relieve any person from the

(ORC 4112.12(K), (N));

persons by a unit of the local, state
or federal government, so long as
the restrictions do not discriminate
against an otherwise qualified disabled person;

made available to an individual
whose tenancy would constitute a
direct threat to the health or safety
of other individuals or whose tenancy would result in substantial
physical damage to the property of
others;
(e) prohibit the application of any
reasonable local, state or federal
restrictions regarding the maximum
number of occupants permitted to
occupy a property;
(f) with regard to familial status,
apply to properties that have been
determined to be housing for older
persons;
(g) hold a person personally
liable for monetary damages for discrimination on the basis of familial
status if such person reasonably
relied, in good faith, on the application of the exemption under 42
USC Section 3607(b)(1) relating to
housing for older persons; or
(h) prohibit a person engaged in
the
business
of
furnishing
appraisals of real property to take into
consideration
factors
other
than
membership in a protected class.

February 27, 2008
Ord. No. 289-08.
By Council Member Brady.
An emergency ordinance placing a
moratorium on accepting demolition
permit
applications
and
issuing
demolition permits in the LorainHighland/Westown area until such
time as it is designated as a Historic Landmark District.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has
identified
the
Lorain-Highland/Westown area between West
110th Street and West 123rd Street
as having architectural and historical significance; and
Whereas, under Section 161.04 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, the Landmarks
Commission is in the process of designating this area as a “Historic
Landmark District”; and
Whereas, on August 24, 2004, in a
public open meeting, the City Planning Department's nomination of
this area as a Historic Landmark
District was approved; and
Whereas, on January 29th, 2008,
the Lorain Avenue Master Plan was
presented to the public which incorporates the idea of the Historic
Landmark District, the preservation
of the historic character of the area
and the challenge of re-populating
these buildings where needed with
new uses; and
Whereas, a public hearing on the
Landmark designation for the area
is scheduled for March 13th, 2008
and the Lorain Avenue Master Plan
will be placed on the agenda of the
City Planning Commission for final
approval at the same time that the
landmark ordinance is heard by City
Planning Commission; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health or safety
in that a moratorium on accepting
demolition permit applications and
issuing demolition permits in the
proposed Historic Landmark District
is necessary to ensure revitalization
to an area that depends heavily on
the preservation of its historic character; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That, in order to protect
the public health, property, safety
and welfare, this Council declares a
moratorium on accepting demolition
permit
applications
and
issuing
demolition permits in the LorainHighland/Westown
area
between
West 110th Street and West 123rd
Street as further identified on the
map included in File No. 289-08-A
until such time as the proposed Historic Landmark District which is the
subject of this legislation becomes
effective, or until June 30, 2008,
whichever date occurs first.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Motion to suspend rules. Charter
and statutory provisions and place
on final passage.
The rules were suspended. Yeas
19. Nays 0. Read second time. Read
third time in full. Passed. Yeas 19.

The City Record
Ord. No. 290-08.
By Council Member Sweeney.
An emergency ordinance authorizing the issuance and sale of bonds
to refund series 1994 bonds issued to
fund a payment to the police and
fire pension fund and authorizing
related matters.
Whereas, under authority of Section 3 of Article XVIII of the Ohio
Constitution, Section 717.07 of the
Ohio Revised Code, the Charter of
the City, and Ordinance No. 367-94,
passed by the City Council on March
14, 1994, the City issued its Subordinated Income Tax Variable Rate
Refunding Bonds, Series 1994, now
outstanding in the principal amount
of
$58,900,000
(the
“Series
1994
Bonds”), to provide for a payment to
the Police and Fire Pension Fund of
the State of Ohio in satisfaction at
a reduced amount of certain obligations of the City for employer’s
accrued liability to that Pension
Fund; and
Whereas, the Series 1994 Bonds
are
payable
from
unrestricted
income taxes of the City, bear interest at variable rates determined
weekly by a remarketing agent, are
secured by a policy of municipal
bond insurance issued by Ambac
Assurance Corporation, have liquidity for the payment of the purchase
price of tendered bonds under a
standby bond purchase agreement
with Dexia Credit Local, acting by
and through its New York Branch,
and are hedged under certain hedge
agreements with Ambac Financial
Services, L.P. and JPMorgan Chase
Bank; and
Whereas, as a result of the downgrade of the credit rating of Ambac
Assurance Corporation, the Series
1994 Bonds are bearing interest at
volatile rates, and although the City
is presently protected from that
volatility under the hedge agreements, in the event of a further
downgrade of the credit rating of
Ambac Assurance Corporation, which
is presently threatened, the Series
1994 Bonds would lose the protection
of those hedge agreements and further could
be required by Dexia
Credit Local to be tendered for purchase, upon which the Series 1994
Bonds would bear interest at a higher, taxable commercial rate of interest; and
Whereas, this Council has determined to authorize the issuance by
the
City
of
bonds
(“Refunding
Bonds”) to refund the Series 1994
Bonds to minimize the risks of
increased interest expense on the
Series 1994 Bonds; and
Whereas, it is necessary to issue
the Refunding Bonds as soon as possible to address the risk of increased
interest expense on the Series 1994
Bonds, and, as a result, this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate
preservation of the public property,
health, and safety and for the usual
and daily operation of a municipal
department; now, therefore,

the City of Cleveland:

Authorized Principal
Amount and Purpose. This Council
finds and determines that it is necessary and proper and in the best
interest of the City to authorize the
issuance of Refunding Bonds for the
purpose of refunding the Series 1994
Bonds.
The Refunding Bonds are
issued under authority of Article
XVIII, Section 3 of the Ohio Constitution, Ohio Revised Code Section
717.07, the Charter of the City, and
this
Ordinance.
The
principal
amount of the Refunding Bonds is
to be the amount set forth in the
Certificate of Award authorized in
Section 3 and shall be the amount
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
necessary (i) to refund the Series
1994 Bonds, (ii) to fund any deposit
to a debt service reserve fund, (iii)
to pay costs of any Credit Support
Instruments, (iv) to pay any identified amounts owed under Hedge

issuing the Refunding Bonds and
refunding the Series 1994 Bonds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Refunding Bonds shall be deposited
and applied as provided in the
Indenture and for the purposes stated in this Ordinance, and those proceeds are appropriated for those purposes.
Section 3.
Terms of Refunding
Bonds.
The final terms of the
Refunding Bonds shall be set forth
in a written certificate to be signed
and delivered by the Director of
Finance
upon
the
sale
of
the
Refunding Bonds upon terms and
conditions consistent with this Ordinance and that in her opinion, based
on the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, are in the best interests of
the
City
(the
“Certificate
of
Award”).
The Refunding Bonds
shall be dated the date of issuance
or such other date as is designated
in the Certificate of Award.
The
Refunding Bonds shall mature on
the dates and in the respective principal amounts determined in the
Certificate of Award, provided that
the final maturity date shall be not
later than 30 years from the date of
issuance of the Refunding Bonds.
The Refunding Bonds shall bear
interest from their date at the rate
or rates per year set forth in the
Certificate of Award, or if any
Refunding Bonds bear interest at
variable rate or rates, at the rate
determined pursuant to the method
identified
in
the
Certificate
of
Award and set forth in the Inden-

The City Record
ture, until the principal amount of
the Refunding Bonds is paid or payment is provided for.
Interest on
the
Refunding
Bonds
shall
be
payable on the dates determined in
the Certificate of Award and as further provided for in the Indenture.
If any Refunding Bonds bear interest at a fixed rate, that rate shall
not exceed eight percent (8%) per
year (computed on the basis of a
360-day year consisting of twelve 30day months). If any Refunding
Bonds bear interest at a variable
rate or rates, those rates shall not
exceed that set forth below.
In the event that the Director of
Finance, based on the written advice of a Financial Advisor, determines that the City’s best interests will be served by causing all or
a portion of the Refunding Bonds to
be obligations bearing interest at
variable rates, redeemable by the
City without penalty or premium on
interest adjustment dates, then the
Director of Finance is authorized to
so specify in the Certificate of
Award. If the Director of Finance
so determines, then the Director of
Finance shall specify in the Certificate of Award the method and procedure by which the variable rate of
interest to be borne by the variable
rate Refunding Bonds shall be determined, whether by reference to a
market index, by a remarketing
agent or otherwise; provided that
the variable rate Refunding Bonds
shall not bear interest at a rate in
excess of twenty-five percent (25%)
per year (including any Refunding
Bonds held by a provider of a Credit Support Instrument). Holders of
variable rate Refunding Bonds may
be given the right to tender their
variable rate Refunding Bonds for
purchase by the City at the times,
on the terms, and subject to the conditions set forth in the Certificate of
Award and the Indenture.
If the
Director of Finance designates any
Refunding Bonds as variable rate
Refunding Bonds, and if the holders
of the variable rate Refunding
Bonds are to be entitled to tender
the variable rate Refunding Bonds
for purchase, then the Director of
Finance shall also designate in the
Certificate of Award for those variable rate Refunding Bonds the
provider or providers for any Credit Support Instrument, the tender
agent or agents and the remarketing agent or agents, which designations shall be based on the determination of the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the parties
so designated possess the requisite
resources and experience to provide
the services required of them and
that the terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide
such services are fair and commercially reasonable.
The Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements in connection with the
delivery of the variable rate Refunding Bonds, and from time to time
thereafter so long as the variable
rate Refunding Bonds are outstanding, with providers of Credit Support
Instruments, tender agents (which
may be the Trustee), remarketing
agents, and others as may be determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a

332

February 27, 2008
Financial Advisor, to be necessary
or appropriate to provide for the
method of determining the variable
interest rates, permitting holders
the right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support for the payment of the variable rate Refunding
Bonds upon tender for purchase or
redemption, and providing for the
repayment by the City of any
amounts drawn under the Credit
Support Instrument.
The Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, shall further determine and
specify in the Certificate of Award
whether
any
of
the
Refunding
Bonds
are
subject
to
optional
redemption prior to maturity, the
earliest date on which redeemable
Refunding Bonds shall be subject to
prior redemption, which shall not be
later than ten years from the first
interest payment date, and the
applicable redemption premium for
the redeemable Refunding Bonds,
which shall be not greater than
102%
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed.
The Refunding Bonds
may be subject to purchase by the
City in lieu of optional redemption
if and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award and the Indenture.
The Director of Finance shall designate the Trustee in the Certificate
of Award, which designation shall
be based on the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the Trustee so designated
possesses the requisite resources
and experience to provide the services required of it under the Indenture and that the terms on which
the designated Trustee has agreed
to provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable.
Section 4. Form; Exchange; Execution. The Refunding Bonds shall
be issued in fully registered form.
The Refunding Bonds initially shall
be delivered only in book-entry
form, shall be registered in the
name of the Depository (as defined
in the Indenture) or its nominee, as
registered owner, and immobilized
in the custody of the Depository,
and shall not be transferable or
exchangeable (except for transfer to
another Depository or its nominee)
without further action by the City
pursuant to the provisions of the
Indenture.
The principal and any
redemption premium and the interest payable on each Refunding Bond
shall be payable at the times, to the
persons and in the manner set forth
in, or referenced by, the Indenture,
including, without limitation, provisions
thereof
permitting
special
arrangements for payments to the
Depository.
The Refunding Bonds
shall be signed by the persons and
in the manner set forth in the Indenture. The Refunding Bonds shall be
numbered as determined by the
Director of Finance.
Section 5.
Sale of Refunding
Bonds. The Refunding Bonds shall
be sold at not less than 97% of par
plus accrued interest at private sale
by the Director of Finance to one or
more financial institutions selected
by the Director of Finance based on
an evaluation of the qualifications
of firms that have proposed to
underwrite the Refunding Bonds

February 27, 2008
(collectively, the “Original Purchaser”) in accordance with law, the provisions of this Ordinance and the
Certificate of Award. The Director
of Finance shall cause the Refunding Bonds to be prepared, and have
the Refunding Bonds signed and
delivered, together with a true transcript of proceedings with reference
to the issuance of the Refunding
Bonds if requested by the Original
Purchaser, to the Original Purchaser upon payment of the purchase
price. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
a bond purchase agreement between
the City and the Original Purchaser, or representative thereof (the
“Purchase Agreement”), containing
terms consistent with this Ordinance
and that are determined by the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, to be customary for revenue
bonds issued by governmental entities, including, without limitation,
representations as to the accuracy
and completeness of information
contained in the official statement
of the City described in Section 10.
The Director of Finance shall provide for the payment of the services
rendered and for reimbursement of
expenses incurred pursuant to the
Purchase Agreement from the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds to the
extent available and then from
Fund No. 01 SF 001 or from other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose. The Mayor, the Director of Finance, the Clerk, the Director of Law, and other City officials,
as appropriate, are each authorized
to sign any transcript certificates,
financial statements and other documents and instruments and to take
such actions as are necessary or
appropriate
to
consummate
the
transactions contemplated by this
Ordinance.
Section 6.
Security for the Refunding Bonds.
The Refunding
Bonds shall be special obligations of
the City, and the debt charges on
the
Refunding
Bonds
shall
be
payable solely from the Pledged
Revenues. The payment of debt
charges on the Refunding Bonds
will be secured by the Indenture
and by a pledge of and lien on the
debt service fund and any debt service reserve fund held by the
Trustee under the Indenture. The
Refunding Bonds do not and shall
not represent or constitute a general obligation debt or pledge of the
faith and credit of the City.
So long as the Refunding Bonds
are outstanding under the Indenture, the City pledges the Pledged
Revenues and grants a lien thereon,
subordinate to the lien granted in
the General Bond Ordinance as security for the general obligation bonds
of the City issued and outstanding
under the General Bond Ordinance,
to the full extent required to meet
debt charges payable on the Refunding Bonds and any debt charges on
Parity Obligations (as defined in
the Indenture). The City covenants
to appropriate annually sufficient
amounts from the income taxes for
such purpose. The City further
covenants that so long as any
Refunding Bonds are outstanding

The City Record
under the Indenture, the City shall
not repeal or amend, or suffer the
repeal of, any ordinance for the levy
or collection of its unrestricted
income taxes in any manner or to
such extent that the City would not
be able to meet its obligations to the
holders of the Refunding Bonds.
Section 7. Authorization of Indenture.
The Director of Finance is
authorized, in the name and on
behalf of the City, to sign and deliver the Indenture, in trust for the
holders of the Refunding Bonds,
containing terms not inconsistent
with this Ordinance or the Certificate of Award and otherwise substantially the same as the Existing
Indenture with such differences as
may be appropriate to permit the
City to obtain a Credit Support
Instrument or to permit increased
flexibility for the use of financial or
credit structures and techniques
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
in the best interests of the City.
The Indenture shall be approved as
to form and correctness by the
Director of Law. The determination
by the Director of Finance that the
terms of the Indenture are in the
best interests of the City shall be
conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery of the Indenture by
the Director of Finance.
Section 8.
Refunding of Series
1994 Bonds; Escrow Agreement. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign and deliver, in the name and
on behalf of the City, an escrow
agreement between the City and the
Existing Trustee, as escrow trustee,
providing for, among other matters:
the
investment
and
holding
in
escrow of the proceeds of the
Refunding Bonds to be applied to
the refunding of the Series 1994
Bonds; the application of the moneys derived from those investments
to the payment of the Bond service
charges on the Series 1994 Bonds;
and the irrevocable call for redemption of the Series 1994 Bonds. The
Director of Finance shall provide for
the payment of the services rendered and for reimbursement of
expenses incurred pursuant to the
escrow agreement from proceeds of
the Refunding Bonds to the extent
available and then from Fund No. 01
SF 001 or other money lawfully
available and appropriated or to be
appropriated for that purpose. Provision shall be made in the escrow
agreement to give the Trustee any
written notice of redemption required under the Existing Indenture. The Director of Finance and
other appropriate City officials shall
sign all documents and take all
other actions necessary or appropriate on the part of the City to effect
such refunding in accordance with
the escrow agreement, the Existing
Indenture and to cause the Series
1994 Bonds to be deemed paid and
discharged, including without limitation, the retention of an independent firm of accountants to verify
the mathematical accuracy of the
calculations relating to the escrow.
Section 9. Conversion and Remarketing. In the event that the Director of Finance determines, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, that it is advantageous to

333

25
the City to convert the interest on
any Series 1994 Bonds to fixed interest rates for a period of time or to
maturity, or to convert the interest
on any Series 1994 Bonds to a different variable rate period or mode,
the City shall undertake the conversion and remarketing in accordance with the Existing Indenture,
as it may be supplemented and
amended as authorized herein. In
connection with any conversion and
remarketing of Series 1994 Bonds,
the Director of Finance is authorized to obtain one or more Credit
Support Instruments if the Director
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the Credit Support Instrument will
facilitate the remarketing of the
Series 1994 Bonds. In the event the
Director
of
Finance
determines,
based on the written advice of a

26
to be prepared, and make or authorize modifications, completions or
changes of or supplements to, disclosure documents in the form of a

15c2-12(b)(1). The distribution and

The Director of Finance is also
authorized, on behalf of the City
and in her official capacity, to complete the preliminary official statement
with
such
modifications,
changes and supplements as the
Director of Finance shall approve or
authorize for the purpose of preparing and determining, and to certify
or otherwise represent, that the official statement as so revised is a
final official statement for purposes
of SEC Rule 15c2-12(b) (3) and (4).
The Director of Finance is further
authorized to use and distribute, or
authorize the use and distribution
of, a final official statement and
supplements thereto in connection
with the original issuance of the
Refunding Bonds as may, in her
judgment, be necessary or appropriate. The Director of Finance is further authorized to sign and deliver,
on behalf of the City and in her official capacity, a final official statement and such certificates in connection with the accuracy of the preliminary official statement and the

The City Record
Section 11.
Ratings; Credit Enhancement. If, in the judgment of
the Director of Finance, based on
written advice of a Financial Advisor, the filing of an application for
a rating on the Series 1994 Bonds or
the Refunding Bonds by one or more
nationally recognized rating agencies is in the best interests of the
City, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare and submit
those applications and to provide to
each such agency or company such
information as may be required for
the
purpose.
The
Director
of
Finance is authorized to contract for
one or more Credit Support Instruments for the Series 1994 Bonds or
the Refunding Bonds if she determines, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, that the
Credit
Support
Instruments
will
result in debt service savings to the
City, or will stabilize interest rates
on those Bonds or will minimize the
risk of increased interest expense
on those Bonds. The cost of obtaining each rating and each Credit Support
Instrument
shall
be
paid,
except to the extent paid by the
Original Purchaser in accordance
with the Purchase Agreement, from
the
proceeds
of
the
Refunding
Bonds or Fund No. 01 SF 001 or from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose, as determined by
the Director of Finance.
Section 12. Interest Rate Hedges
and Other Arrangements.
This
Council finds that by engaging in
interest rate hedging arrangements
with respect to bonds the City may
reduce its cost of borrowing by optimizing the relative amounts of fixed
and variable rate obligations, or
minimizing the risk of variations in
its debt service costs, or obtaining
savings by confirming rates of interest on bonds in advance of their
issuance. To permit the City to have
the flexibility to undertake interest
rate swap, swaption, rate cap, rate
collar and other hedging transactions, from time to time, and to
establish the procedures for approving
those
transactions,
this
Council authorizes the signing and
delivery of one or more agreements,
including amendments or supplements to existing agreements (each,
a “Hedge Agreement”), and any
related agreements necessary for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by each Hedge
Agreement. The authorizations in
this Section are supplemental to and
not in derogation of any authority
provided by any other ordinance of
this Council concerning hedging
arrangements.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is to the financial advantage of the City and in the City’s
best
interests
that
a
hedging
arrangement be undertaken by the
City with respect to the Series 1994
Bonds or the Refunding Bonds, the
Director of Finance may authorize
one or more interest rate hedge
transactions in accordance with the
applicable Hedge Agreement; provided that (a) the counterparty
shall be rated at the time of signing the Hedge Agreement not lower
than A+ or A1 by at least one rating agency or its obligations under
the Hedge Agreement shall be guar-

334

February 27, 2008
anteed or insured by an entity rated
at the time of signing the Hedge
Agreement not lower than A+ or A1
by at least one rating agency, and
(b) the term of each hedge transaction shall not exceed the final
maturity of the Series 1994 Bonds or
Refunding
Bonds
to
which
the
hedge relates.
The Director of Finance shall
negotiate the terms of each Hedge
Agreement with a counterparty satisfying the credit criteria in this
Ordinance. The City shall receive a
written opinion of a Financial Advisor that the payments made or to be
made by the counterparty to the
City, or by the City to the counterparty, shall be fair value for the
Hedge Agreement, given the credit
of the counterparty and the terms
and conditions of the Hedge Agreement. The Director of Finance shall
determine the terms and conditions
of the Hedge Agreement, including
without limitation, the rates to be
paid by the counterparty to the City
and by the City to the counterparty
under the Hedge Agreement, the
time or times and procedures for the
exercise by the counterparty or the
City, as the case may be, of any
option under the Hedge Agreement,
and whether the obligations of the
City under the Hedge Agreement
shall be secured by a Credit Support
Instrument. The approval of each
interest rate hedge transaction by
the Director of Finance shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing
and
delivery
of
the
applicable
Hedge Agreement by the Director of
Finance.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from, and may be secured by, the
Pledged Revenues as determined by
the Director of Finance and set
forth in the Hedge Agreement. The
obligation of the City to make payments under any Hedge Agreement
does not and shall not represent or
constitute a general obligation debt,
or a pledge of the faith and credit
of the City or the State of Ohio.
Section 13.
Financial Advisor.
The Director of Finance may obtain
the services of one or more Financial Advisors, from time to time, to
assist the Director of Finance in
making any of the determinations
required by this Ordinance to be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance or to negotiate any Hedge
Agreements.
The
Director
of
Finance may rely on the written
advice of any Financial Advisor so
retained. Any Financial Advisor or
consultant
employed
under
the
authority of this Ordinance shall be
disinterested in the transaction and
be independent of the underwriters
or counterparties and any other
party interested in the transaction.

Ord. No. 291-08.
By Council Member Sweeney.
An emergency ordinance authorizing the issuance and sale of revenue
refunding bonds to refund outstanding revenue bonds of the core city
program for economic and community development in the city and
authorizing related matters.
Whereas, under authority of Ordinance No. 1982-02, passed by this
Council on June 10, 2003, and the
laws of the State of Ohio, the City
issued its Taxable Economic and
Community Development Revenue
Bonds, Series 2003, now outstanding
in
the
principal
amount
of
$26,900,000 (the “Series 2003 Bonds”),
to provide funds to establish the
City’s Core City Fund Program for
economic and community development projects in the City, and to provide for the source of payment and
security for the Series 2003 Bonds
the City entered into the Trust
Indenture dated as of December 15,
2003 (the “Original Indenture”) with
U.S. Bank National Association, as
trustee (the “Trustee”); and
Whereas, the Series 2003 Bonds
bear interest at variable rates determined through an auction process
and are secured by a policy of
municipal bond insurance issued by
Ambac Assurance Corporation; and
Whereas, as a result of the downgrade of the credit ratings of Ambac
Assurance Corporation, and the deterioration of the auction securities
market, the Series 2003 Bonds are
bearing interest at volatile and
unacceptable rates; and
Whereas, this Council has determined to authorize the issuance by
the City of revenue refunding bonds
(“Refunding Bonds”) under the Original Indenture, as supplemented and
amended, to refund the Series 2003
Bonds to obtain debt service savings, to stabilize interest rates, or to
minimize risks of increased interest
expense on the Series 2003 Bonds;
and
Whereas, it is necessary to issue
the Refunding Bonds as soon as possible to address the increased interest expense being incurred on the
Series 2003 Bonds, and, as a result,
this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the
immediate preservation of the public property, health, and safety and
for the usual and daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

Section 3.
Terms of Refunding
Bonds.
The final terms of the
Refunding Bonds shall be set forth
in a written certificate to be signed
and delivered by the Director of
Finance
upon
the
sale
of
the
Refunding Bonds upon terms and
conditions consistent with this Ordinance and that in her opinion, based
on the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, are in the best interests of
the
City
(the
“Certificate
of
Award”).
The
Refunding
Bonds
shall be dated the date of issuance
or such other date as is designated
in the Certificate of Award. The
Refunding Bonds shall mature on
the dates and in the respective principal amounts determined in the
Certificate of Award, provided that
the final maturity date shall be not
later than 30 years from the date of
issuance of the Refunding Bonds.
The Refunding Bonds shall bear
interest from their date at the rate
or rates per year set forth in the
Certificate of Award, or if any
Refunding Bonds bear interest at a
variable rate, at the rate determined
from time to time pursuant to the
method identified in the Certificate
of Award and set forth in the Indenture, and the Refunding Bonds shall
bear interest at those rates until the
principal amount of the Refunding

The City Record
Bonds is paid or payment is provided for. Interest on the Refunding
Bonds shall be payable on the dates
determined or provided for in the
Certificate of Award and the Indenture. If any Refunding Bonds bear
interest at a fixed rate, that rate
shall not exceed eight percent (8%)
per year (computed on the basis of
a 360-day year consisting of twelve
30-day months).
If any Refunding
Bonds bear interest at a variable
rate or rates, those rates shall not
exceed that set forth below.
In the event that the Director of
Finance, based on the written advice of a Financial Advisor, determines that the City’s best interests
will be served by causing all or a
portion of the Refunding Bonds to
be obligations bearing interest at
variable rates, redeemable by the
City without penalty or premium on
interest adjustment dates, then the
Director of Finance is authorized to
so specify in the Certificate of
Award. If the Director of Finance so
determines, then the Director of
Finance shall specify in the Certificate of Award the method and procedure by which the variable rate of
interest to be borne by the variable
rate Refunding Bonds shall be determined, whether by reference to a
market index, by a remarketing
agent or otherwise; provided that
the variable rate Refunding Bonds
shall not bear interest at a rate in
excess of twenty-five percent (25%)
per year (including any Refunding
Bonds held by a provider of a Credit Support Instrument). Holders of
variable rate Refunding Bonds may
be given the right to tender their
variable rate Refunding Bonds for
purchase by the City at the times,
on the terms, and subject to the conditions set forth in the Certificate of
Award and the Indenture. If the
Director of Finance designates any
Refunding Bonds as variable rate
Refunding Bonds, and if the holders
of the variable rate Refunding
Bonds are to be entitled to tender
the variable rate Refunding Bonds
for purchase, then the Director of
Finance shall also designate in the
Certificate of Award for those variable rate Refunding Bonds the
provider or providers for any Credit Support Instrument, the tender
agent or agents and the remarketing agent or agents, which designations shall be based on the determination of the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the parties
so designated possess the requisite
resources and experience to provide
the services required of them and
that the terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide
such services are fair and commercially reasonable. The Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements in connection with the
delivery of the variable rate Refunding Bonds, and from time to time
thereafter so long as the variable
rate Refunding Bonds are outstanding, with providers of Credit Support
Instruments, tender agents (which
may be the Trustee), remarketing
agents, and others as may be determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, to be necessary
or appropriate to provide for the

336

February 27, 2008
method of determining the variable
interest rates, permitting holders
the right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support for the payment of the variable rate Refunding
Bonds upon tender for purchase or
redemption, and providing for the
repayment by the City of any
amounts drawn under the Credit
Support Instrument.
The Director of Finance shall further determine and specify in the
Certificate of Award whether any of
the Refunding Bonds are subject to
optional redemption prior to maturity, the earliest date on which
redeemable Refunding Bonds shall
be subject to prior redemption,
which shall not be later than ten
years from the first interest payment date, and the applicable redemption
premium
for
the
redeemable Refunding Bonds, which
shall be not greater than 103% of
the principal amount redeemed. The
Refunding Bonds may be subject to
purchase by the City in lieu of
optional redemption if and to the
extent provided in the Certificate of
Award and the Indenture.
Section 4. Form; Exchange; Execution. The Refunding Bonds shall
be issued in fully registered form.
The Refunding Bonds initially shall
be delivered only in book-entry
form, shall be registered in the
name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository, and shall not be transferable
or exchangeable (except for transfer to another Depository or its nominee) without further action by the
City pursuant to the provisions of
the Indenture. The principal and
any redemption premium and the
interest payable on each Refunding
Bond shall be payable at the times,
to the persons and in the manner set
forth in, or referenced by, the Indenture, including, without limitation,
provisions thereof permitting special arrangements for payments to
the
Depository.
The
Refunding
Bonds shall be signed by the persons and in the manner set forth in
the Indenture. The Refunding Bonds
shall be numbered as determined by
the Director of Finance.
Section 5.
Sale of Refunding
Bonds. The Refunding Bonds shall
be sold at not less than (i) 97% of
par plus aggregate original issue
premium and minus aggregate original issue discount plus (ii) accrued
interest at private sale by the Director of Finance to one or more financial institutions selected by the
Director of Finance based on an
evaluation of the qualifications of
firms that have proposed to underwrite the Refunding Bonds (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”) in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance and the Certificate
of Award. The Director of Finance
shall cause the Refunding Bonds to
be prepared, and have the Refunding Bonds signed and delivered,
together with a true transcript of
proceedings with reference to the
issuance of the Refunding Bonds if
requested by the Original Purchaser, to the Original Purchaser upon
payment of the purchase price. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign and deliver, in the name and
on behalf of the City, a bond pur-

February 27, 2008
chase agreement between the City
and the Original Purchaser, or representative thereof (the “Purchase
Agreement”), containing terms consistent with this Ordinance and that
are determined by the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
customary for revenue bonds issued
by governmental entities, including,
without limitation, representations
as to the accuracy and completeness
of information contained in the official statement of the City described
in Section 11. The Director of
Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and
for
reimbursement
of
expenses
incurred pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement from the proceeds of the
Refunding Bonds to the extent
available and then from the Program Funds or from other money
lawfully available and appropriated
or to be appropriated for that purpose, as determined by the Director
of Finance. The Mayor, the Director
of Finance, the Clerk, the Director
of Law, and other City officials, as
appropriate, are each authorized to
sign
any
transcript
certificates,
financial statements and other documents and instruments and to take
such actions as are necessary or
appropriate
to
consummate
the
transactions contemplated by this
Ordinance.
Section
6.
Security
for
the
Refunding Bonds.
The Refunding
Bonds shall be special obligations of
the City, and the debt charges on
the
Refunding
Bonds
shall
be
payable solely from the Net Project
Revenues and the Nontax Revenues.
The payment of debt charges on the
Refunding Bonds is secured by a
pledge of and lien on the Bond Fund
held by the Trustee under the Indenture and by any reserve fund for
which provision is made in the
Indenture. The Refunding Bonds are
not and shall not be secured by an
obligation or pledge of any money
raised by taxation. The Refunding
Bonds do not and shall not represent
or constitute a debt or pledge of the
faith and credit or taxing power of
the City, and the owners thereof
have and shall have no right to
have taxes levied by the City for the
payment of debt charges thereon.
The Refunding Bonds shall contain
a statement to that effect and to the
effect that the Refunding Bonds are
payable solely from the Net Project
Revenues and the Nontax Revenues
and are not secured by an obligation or pledge of any money raised
by taxation.
The City covenants and agrees
that while the Refunding Bonds are
outstanding, it will appropriate and
maintain Nontax Revenues at such
times and in such amounts as will
be sufficient, together with the Net
Project Revenues and any other
funds available for the purpose, to
pay the debt charges on the Bonds
and will so restrict other obligations
payable from Nontax Revenues prior
to or on a parity with the Bonds as
will ensure the continuing availability for appropriation of sufficient Nontax Revenues to pay debt
charges when due.
Section 7.
Payment of Debt
Charges on the Refunding Bonds.
Nothing herein shall be construed as

requiring the City to use or apply to
the payment of debt charges on the
Refunding Bonds any funds or revenues from any source other than
Net Project Revenues and the Nontax
Revenues.
Subject
to
the
requirements of Revised Code Section 176.04, nothing herein, however,
shall be deemed to prohibit the City,
of its own volition, from using, to
the extent that it is authorized by
law to do so, any other resources for
the fulfillment of any of the terms,
conditions or obligations of this
Ordinance or of the Refunding
Bonds.
The City will, solely from the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds or
from the Net Project Revenues or
the Nontax Revenues, pay or cause
to be paid the debt charges on the
Refunding Bonds on the dates, at
the places and in the manner provided herein and in the Refunding
Bonds. For that purpose, in each
year while the Refunding Bonds are
outstanding, this Council, after providing for the payment of debt
charges payable on the City’s general obligation securities in that
year from sources available for that
purpose, will appropriate Nontax
Revenues required to pay, and for
the purpose of paying, the debt
charges due in that year on the
Bonds (less other money available
for the purpose) and any outstanding parity obligations payable from
Nontax
Revenues.
Further,
this
Council will give effect to such
appropriations in all Ordinances it
passes thereafter in that year appropriating money for expenditure and
encumbrance and limit the other
appropriations of Nontax Revenues
in that year to the amount available
after deducting the amount required
for the payment of debt charges
payable on the City’s general obligation securities and to pay those
debt charges. The City covenants
that, so long as any of the Refunding Bonds are outstanding, it shall
not issue any additional obligations
payable from the Nontax Revenues
on a parity with the Bonds and any
other outstanding parity obligations
payable
from
Nontax
Revenues,
unless, prior to passage of the Ordinance
authorizing
such
parity
obligations, the Director of Finance
shall have certified to this Council
that the Nontax Revenues during
the preceding calendar year, adjusted to reflect, if necessary, changes
in the rates or charges resulting in
the Nontax Revenues, aggregate in
amount not less than 100% of the
highest amount of (a) debt charges
on the Bonds and (b) required payments on such proposed parity obligations and any other outstanding
parity obligations due in any succeeding calendar year.
Each obligation of the City required to be undertaken pursuant to
this Ordinance and the Refunding
Bonds is binding upon the City, and
upon each officer or employee of the
City as may from time to time have
the authority under law to take any
action on behalf of the City as may
be necessary to perform all or any
part of such obligation, as a duty of
the City and of each of those officers and employees resulting from
an office, trust or station within the

337

29
meaning of Section 2731.01 of the
Revised Code, providing for enforcement by writ of mandamus.
Section 8.
Authorization of Supplemental Indentures. The Director
of Finance is authorized, in the
name and on behalf of the City, to
sign and deliver to the Trustee, in
trust for the holders of the Refunding Bonds, one or more Supplemental Indentures, approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, not inconsistent with this Ordinance or the Certificate of Award,
and not substantially adverse to the
City as may be approved by the
Director of Finance. The determination by the Director of Finance that
a Supplemental Indenture is not substantially adverse to the City shall
be conclusively evidenced by the
signing and delivery of that Supplemental Indenture by the Director
of
Finance.
Any
Supplemental
Indenture may contain amendments
to the Original Indenture, as theretofor amended, or amend and restate
the Original Indenture, to permit the
City to obtain a Credit Support
Instrument, to eliminate the Land
Sales Fund and to release from the
lien of the Indenture any money on
deposit in the Land Sales Fund, or
to permit increased flexibility for
the use of financial or credit structures and techniques determined by
the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, to be in the best interests
of the City.
Section 9.
Refunding of Series
2003
Bonds;
Escrow
Agreement.
The Director of Finance is authorized to sign and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of the City, an
escrow agreement between the City
and the Trustee, as escrow trustee,
providing for, among other matters:
the
investment
and
holding
in
escrow of the proceeds of the
Refunding Bonds to be applied to
the refunding of the Series 2003
Bonds; the application of the moneys derived from those investments
to the payment of the debt service
charges on the Series 2003 Bonds;
and the irrevocable call for redemption of the Series 2003 Bonds. The
Director of Finance shall provide
for the payment of the services rendered and for reimbursement of
expenses incurred pursuant to the
escrow agreement from proceeds of
the Refunding Bonds to the extent
available and then from Program
Funds or from other money lawfully available and appropriated or to
be appropriated for that purpose, as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance. Provision shall be made in
the escrow agreement to give the
Trustee any written notice of redemption required under the Indenture. The Director of Finance and
other
appropriate
City
officials
shall sign all documents and take
all
other
actions
necessary
or
appropriate on the part of the City
to effect such refunding in accordance with the Indenture and to
cause the Series 2003 Bonds to be
deemed
paid
and
discharged,
including without limitation, the
retention of an independent firm of
accountants to verify the mathematical accuracy of the calculations relating to the escrow.

Section 10.
Conversion and Remarketing.
In the event that the
Director
of
Finance
determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that it is advantageous to the City to convert the
interest on any Series 2003 Bonds to
fixed interest rates for a period of
time or to maturity, or to convert
the interest on any Series 2003
Bonds to a different variable rate
period or mode, the City shall undertake the conversion and remarketing in accordance with the Indenture. In connection with any conversion and remarketing of Series
2003 Bonds, the Director of Finance
is authorized to obtain one or more
Credit Support Instruments if the
Director determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the Credit Support Instrument will facilitate the remarketing
of the Series 2003 Bonds. In the
event the Director of Finance determines, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, that it is
necessary to supplement or amend
the Original Indenture or any Supplemental Indenture in order to
address current market conditions
or to permit the use of a Credit Support Instrument or to otherwise
obtain
financing
arrangements
advantageous to the City, the Director of Finance is authorized to sign
and deliver an amendment of the
Original Indenture or Supplemental
Indenture,
or
an
amended
and
restated Indenture or Supplemental
Indenture, approved as to form by
the Director of Law. The costs of
any conversion and remarketing of
the Series 2003 Bonds may be paid,
as determined by the Director of
Finance, from the Program Funds
or, to the extent available, from
Fund 01 SF 001 and remarketing
proceeds, or from other money lawfully available and appropriated or
to be appropriated for that purpose.
The Director of Finance is authorized to prepare one or more disclosure documents in connection with
any conversion and remarketing
under the same terms and conditions
as set forth in Section 11 of this
Ordinance with respect to Refunding Bonds. The Director of Finance
and other City officials are authorized to sign and deliver such
instruments, certificates and documents as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions
authorized by this Section. The
Director of Finance, the Director of
Law and other City officials, as
appropriate, are authorized to make
the
necessary
arrangements
on
behalf of the City to establish the
date, location, procedure and conditions for the conversion and remarketing of any Bonds and to take all
actions necessary to effect the conversion and remarketing of any
Bonds under the terms of this Ordinance and the Indenture. The Clerk
of Council or other appropriate official of the City shall furnish the
Trustee a true transcript of proceedings certified by the Clerk or
other official, of all proceedings had
with reference to the conversion and
remarketing of any Bonds along
with
such
information
for
the
records as is necessary to determine
the validity of the conversion and
remarketing.

The City Record
Section 11.
Official Statements;
Continuing Disclosure.
The Director of Finance is authorized, on
behalf of the City and in her official capacity, to (i) prepare or cause
to be prepared, and make or authorize modifications, completions or
changes of or supplements to, disclosure documents in the form of a
preliminary official statement relating to the issuance of the Refunding Bonds, and (ii) determine, and
certify or otherwise represent, when
the preliminary official statement as
so prepared is a “deemed final” official statement (except for permitted
omissions) by the City as of its date
for
purposes
of
Securities
and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Rule
15c2-12(b)(1). The distribution and
use of a preliminary official statement is authorized and approved.
The Director of Finance is also
authorized, on behalf of the City
and in her official capacity, to complete the preliminary official statement
with
such
modifications,
changes and supplements as the
Director of Finance shall approve or
authorize for the purpose of preparing and determining, and to certify
or otherwise represent, that the official statement as so revised is a
final official statement for purposes
of SEC Rule 15c2-12(b) (3) and (4).
The Director of Finance is further
authorized to use and distribute, or
authorize the use and distribution
of, a final official statement and
supplements thereto in connection
with the original issuance of the
Refunding Bonds as may, in her
judgment, be necessary or appropriate. The Director of Finance is further authorized to sign and deliver,
on behalf of the City and in her official capacity, a final official statement and such certificates in connection with the accuracy of the preliminary official statement and the
final official statement and any
amendments thereto as may, in their
judgment, also be necessary or
appropriate. The Director of Finance
is authorized to contract for services
for the production and distribution
of preliminary and final official
statements, including by printed and
electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Refunding Bonds, the City
agrees, in accordance with, and as
an obligated person with respect to
the Refunding Bonds under, SEC
Rule 15c2-12, to provide or cause to
be provided such financial information and operating data and notices,
in such manner, as may be required
for purposes of SEC Rule 15c2-12. In
order to describe and specify certain
terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for that purpose,
and
thereby
to
implement
that
agreement, including provisions for
enforcement, amendment and termination, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare, or cause to be
prepared, and to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
a continuing disclosure agreement
or certificate, which shall constitute
the continuing disclosure agreement
made by the City for the benefit of
the holders and beneficial owners of
the Refunding Bonds in accordance
with SEC Rule 15c2-12. The performance of that agreement shall be

338

February 27, 2008
subject to the availability of funds
and their annual appropriation to
meet
costs
the
City
would
be
required to incur to perform it.
Section 12. Ratings; Credit Enhancement. If, in the judgment of
the Director of Finance, based on
written advice of a Financial Advisor, the filing of an application for
a rating on the Series 2003 Bonds or
the Refunding Bonds by one or more
nationally recognized rating agencies is in the best interests of the
City, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare and submit
those applications and to provide to
each such agency such information
as may be required for the purpose.
The Director of Finance is authorized to contract for one or more
Credit Support Instruments for the
Series 2003 Bonds or the Refunding
Bonds if she determines, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, that the Credit Support
Instruments will result in debt service savings to the City, or will stabilize interest rates on those Bonds
or
will
minimize
the
risk
of
increased interest expense on those
Bonds. The cost of obtaining each
rating and each Credit Support
Instrument, except to the extent
paid by the Original Purchaser in
accordance
with
the
Purchase
Agreement, shall be paid from the
proceeds of the Refunding Bonds or
the Program Funds or from other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose, as determined by the
Director of Finance.
Section 13. Interest Rate Hedges
and Other Arrangements.
This
Council finds that by engaging in
interest rate hedging arrangements
with respect to the Bonds the City
may reduce its cost of borrowing by
optimizing the relative amounts of
fixed and variable rate obligations,
or minimizing the risk of variations
in its debt service costs, or obtaining savings by confirming rates of
interest on the Bonds in advance of
their issuance. To permit the City to
have the flexibility to undertake
with respect to the Bonds interest
rate swap, swaption, rate cap, rate
collar and other hedging transactions, from time to time, and to
establish the procedures for approving those transactions, this Council
authorizes the signing and delivery
of one or more agreements, including amendments or supplements to
existing
agreements
(each,
a
“Hedge Agreement”), and any related agreements necessary for the
consummation of the transactions
contemplated by each Hedge Agreement. The authorizations in this Section are supplemental to and not in
derogation of any authority provided by any other Ordinance of this
Council
concerning
hedging
arrangements.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is to the financial advantage of the City and in the City’s
best
interests
that
a
hedging
arrangement be undertaken by the
City with respect to any Bonds
issued or to be issued under the
Indenture, the Director of Finance
may authorize one or more interest
rate hedge transactions in accor-

February 27, 2008
dance with the applicable Hedge
Agreement; provided that (a) the
counterparty shall be rated at the
time of signing the Hedge Agreement not lower than A+ or A1 by
at least one rating agency or its
obligations under the Hedge Agreement shall be guaranteed or insured
by an entity rated at the time of
signing the Hedge Agreement not
lower than A+ or A1 by at least one
rating agency, and (b) the term of
each hedge transaction shall not
exceed the final maturity of the
Bonds to which the hedge relates.
The Director of Finance shall
negotiate the terms of each Hedge
Agreement with a counterparty satisfying the credit criteria in this
Ordinance. The City shall receive a
written opinion of a Financial Advisor that the payments made or to be
made by the counterparty to the
City, or by the City to the counterparty, shall be fair value for the
Hedge Agreement, given the credit
of the counterparty and the terms
and conditions of the Hedge Agreement. The Director of Finance shall
determine the terms and conditions
of the Hedge Agreement, including
without limitation, the rates to be
paid by the counterparty to the City
and by the City to the counterparty
under the Hedge Agreement, the
time or times and procedures for the
exercise by the counterparty or the
City, as the case may be, of any
option under the Hedge Agreement,
and whether the obligations of the
City under the Hedge Agreement
shall be secured by a Credit Support
Instrument. The approval of each
interest rate hedge transaction by
the Director of Finance shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing
and
delivery
of
the
applicable
Hedge Agreement by the Director of
Finance.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from the Net Project Revenues and
Nontax
Revenues
and
may
be
payable also from other funds permitted by law to be used for the purpose, as identified by the Director of
Finance in the Hedge Agreement.
Those payments may be secured by
a pledge of and lien on the Bond
Fund and the Bond Reserve Fund,
to the extent permitted by the
Indenture, all as determined by the
Director of Finance and set forth in
the Hedge Agreement. The obligation of the City to make payments
under any Hedge Agreement does
not and shall not represent or constitute a debt or pledge of the faith
and credit or taxing power of the
City. Nothing gives any party to any
Hedge Agreement the right to have
excises, ad valorem or other taxes
levied by the City or the State of
Ohio
for
the
payment
of
any
amounts due under any Hedge
Agreement.
Section 14.
Financial Advisor.
The Director of Finance may obtain
the services of one or more Financial Advisors, from time to time, to
assist the Director of Finance in
making any of the determinations
required by this Ordinance to be determined by the Director of Finance
or to negotiate any Hedge Agreements. The Director of Finance may
rely on the written advice of any
Financial Advisor so retained. Any

Financial
Advisor
or
consultant
employed under the authority of this
Ordinance shall be disinterested in
the transaction and be independent
of the underwriters or counterparties and any other party interested
in the transaction.

Ordinance was passed in compliance
with all applicable provisions of the
City’s Charter and the rules of this
Council. This Council further finds
and determines that all acts and
conditions necessary to be done or
performed by the City or to have
been met precedent to and in the
issuing of the Refunding Bonds in
order to make them legal, valid, and
binding special obligations of the
City have been performed and have
been met, or will at the time of

Council and any of its committees
that resulted in those formal actions
were in meetings open to the public, all in compliance with the law.

from the effective date of this Ordinance. If a preliminary official
statement with respect to the Refunding Bonds is distributed under

other agreements relating to the
lease-purchase of the Cleveland Stadium; approving supplemental trust

signed and delivered various series
of Certificates (as defined in the

Facility Lease; and
Whereas, under the Trust Agreement, Additional Certificates (as
defined in the Trust Agreement)
may, with the approval of the City,
be issued to pay the cost of refunding outstanding Certificates; and
Whereas, this Council has determined to authorize the issuance of
Additional Certificates (“Refunding
Certificates”)
under
the
Trust
Agreement to refund outstanding
Certificates and to authorize hedging arrangements with respect to

32
Base Rent payments and Certificate
Payments (as defined in the Trust
Agreement) to obtain savings or to
minimize risks of increased interest
expense on the Certificates bearing
interest at variable rates and corresponding Base Rent payments, as
provided in this ordinance; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department and providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that approving the
issuance of Refunding Certificates
and authorizing related agreements
is necessary to enable the City to
minimize risks of increased interest
expense on a timely basis to reduce

Determinations by
Council.
This Council finds and
determines as follows:
(a) Public Purpose. The acquisition, financing and refinancing by
the City of the Cleveland Stadium
pursuant to the Ground Lease, the
Facility Lease and the Trust Agreement and the use of the Cleveland
Stadium as a source of public relaxation and entertainment served and
serves a proper public municipal
purpose.
(b) Supplemental Ground Lease,
Supplemental Lease, Supplemental
Trust Agreement and Refunding
Certificates. It is necessary, proper
and in the best interest of the City
to authorize one or more Supplemental Ground Leases, Supplemental Leases and Purchase Agreements and approve one or more Supplemental Trust Agreements and the
issuance of Refunding Certificates
in one or more series for the purpose of refunding (i) one or more
series of the Outstanding Certificates or designated maturities (or
portions of maturities) thereof, to
obtain aggregate net present value
savings in Certificate Payments and
corresponding Base Rent payments
of not less than three percent (3%),
or (ii) one or more series of Outstanding Certificates, or designated
maturities (or portions of maturities) thereof, that are short-term or
variable-rate obligations and that
the Director of Finance has determined, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, are subjecting the City to Base Rent payments
the interest components of which
include undesirably high rates of
interest or undesirable fluctuations
in rates of interest that can economically be avoided or mitigated
through refinancing.
Separate series of Refunding Certificates may be issued at the same
or
different
times.
A
Purchase
Agreement, Supplemental Lease and
Supplemental Trust Agreement shall
be delivered for each series and may
be delivered for multiple series. A
Supplemental Ground Lease shall be
delivered for any series of Refunding Certificates with a final maturity later than the final maturity of
the then Outstanding Certificates.
This Council finds and determines
that the issuance of the Refunding
Certificates and signing and delivery of Supplemental Ground Leases,
Supplemental Leases and Purchase
Agreements and approval of Supplemental Trust Agreements in connection with such issuance for the
purpose provided in this Ordinance
serves a proper, public, municipal
purpose by reducing the costs to the
City of the lease-purchase of the
Cleveland Stadium which is a source
of public relaxation and entertainment for the people of the City of
Cleveland.
(c) Leased Premises. The Council
of the City found and determined at
the time of the authorization of the
Existing Facility Lease and approval of the Existing Trust Agreement and the Outstanding Certificates, and hereby reaffirms that the
Leased Premises are essential to the
proper, efficient and economic operation of the City.

February 27, 2008
Section 3. Authorization of Hedging Arrangements.
This Council
finds that by engaging in interest
rate hedging arrangements with
respect to the Facility Lease and
Certificates the City may reduce its
financing costs by optimizing the
relative amounts of fixed and variable rate obligations, or minimizing
the risk of variations in its financing costs, or obtaining savings by
confirming rates of interest on Certificates
in
advance
of
their
issuance. To permit the City to have
the flexibility to undertake interest
rate swap, swaption, rate cap, rate
collar and other hedging transactions, from time to time, and to
establish the procedures for approving those transactions, this Council
authorizes the signing and delivery
of one or more agreements, including amendments or supplements to
existing
agreements
(each,
a
“Hedge Agreement”), and any related agreements necessary for the
consummation of the transactions
contemplated by each Hedge Agreement. The authorizations in this Section 3 are supplemental to and not
in derogation of any authority provided by any other ordinance of this
Council
concerning
hedging
arrangements.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is to the financial advantage of the City and in the City’s
best
interests
that
a
hedging
arrangement be undertaken by the
City with respect to the Facility
Lease or any Outstanding Certificates, the Director of Finance may
authorize one or more interest rate
hedge transactions in accordance
with the applicable Hedge Agreement; provided that (a) the counterparty shall be rated at the time
of signing the Hedge Agreement not
lower than A+ or A1 by at least one
rating agency or its obligations
under the Hedge Agreement shall be
guaranteed or insured by an entity
rated at the time of signing the
Hedge Agreement not lower than
A+ or A1 by at least one rating
agency, and (b) the term of each
hedge transaction shall not exceed
the final maturity of the Certificates
to which the hedge relates.
The Director of Finance shall
negotiate the terms of each Hedge
Agreement with a counterparty satisfying the credit criteria in this
Ordinance. The City shall receive a
written opinion of a Financial Advisor that the payments made or to be
made by the counterparty to the
City, or by the City to the counterparty, shall be fair value for the
Hedge Agreement, given the credit
of the counterparty and the terms
and conditions of the Hedge Agreement. The Director of Finance shall
determine the terms and conditions
of the Hedge Agreement, including
without limitation, the rates to be
paid by the counterparty to the City
and by the City to the counterparty
under the Hedge Agreement, the
time or times and procedures for the
exercise by the counterparty or the
City, as the case may be, of any
option under the Hedge Agreement,
and whether the obligations of the
City under the Hedge Agreement
shall be secured by a Credit Support

The City Record
Instrument. The approval of each
interest rate hedge transaction by
the Director of Finance shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing
and
delivery
of
the
applicable
Hedge Agreement by the Director of
Finance.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be subject
to appropriation and certification as
provided in the Facility Lease.
Those payments may be secured by
the Facility Lease, to the extent permitted by the Trust Agreement, all
as determined by the Director of
Finance and set forth in the Hedge
Agreement. The obligation of the
City to make payments under any
Hedge Agreement does not and
shall not represent or constitute a
general obligation, debt, bonded
indebtedness or a pledge of the faith
and credit of the City or the State
of Ohio. Nothing gives any party to
any Hedge Agreement the right to
have excises, ad valorem or other
taxes levied by the City or the State
of Ohio for the payment of any
amounts due under any Hedge
Agreement.
Section 4. Refunding of the Series
2007 Certificates; Escrow Agreements. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
one or more escrow agreements
between the City and the Trustee,
as escrow trustee, providing for,
among other matters: the investment
and holding in escrow of the proceeds of Refunding Certificates to
be applied to the refunding of Series
2007 Certificates; the application of
the moneys derived from those
investments to the payment of the
Certificate Payments on Series 2007
Certificates, and the irrevocable call
for redemption of Series 2007 Certificates to be called for redemption
prior to maturity. The Director of
Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and
for
reimbursement
of
expenses
incurred pursuant to each escrow
agreement from proceeds of Refunding Certificates to the extent available and then from Fund Nos. 67 SF
600 and 01 SF 100 or from other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose, as determined by the
Director of Finance. Provision shall
be made in each escrow agreement
to give the Trustee any written
notice of redemption required under
the Trust Agreement. The Director
of Finance and other appropriate
City officials shall sign all documents and take all other actions
necessary or appropriate on the part
of the City to effect each such
refunding in accordance with the
Trust Agreement and to cause the
Series 2007 Certificates to be deemed
paid and discharged, including without limitation, the retention of an
independent firm of accountants to
verify the mathematical accuracy of
the calculations relating to the
escrow. Upon the issuance and delivery of a series of Refunding Certificates, the Trustee and the City
are authorized to disburse from the
Funds established and maintained
under the Trust Agreement such
amounts of moneys as are in excess
of the balances required by the
Trust Agreement to then be main-

341

33
tained in those Funds. The Director
of Finance is authorized to give
written notice to the Trustee of the
call for redemption of the Series
2007 Certificates on the earliest
redemption
date
following
the
issuance of the Refunding Certificates, pursuant to the Trust Agreement and the applicable escrow
agreement.
Section 5. Determination of Base
Rent and Terms of Refunding Certificates; Application of Proceeds.
(a) Principal Components and
Term. Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is to the financial advantage of the City and in the City’s
best interests that one or more
series of Refunding Certificates be
issued to refund Outstanding Certificates, the Director of Finance is
authorized to negotiate and provide
for the terms of the Refunding Certificates and the Base Rent, as
amended pursuant to a Supplemental Lease, including the final Lease
Term, which shall end not later than
the final maturity of the Outstanding Certificates, and the annual and
aggregate principal components of
Base Rent. The principal amount of
each series of Refunding Certificates and the corresponding principal component of Base Rent is to be
the amount set forth in the Purchase Agreement for that series and
shall be the amount determined by
the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, to be necessary (i) to pay
the costs of refunding the Series
2007 Certificates, (ii) to fund any
reserves required under the Trust
Agreement, (iii) to pay costs of any
Credit Support Instruments, (iv) to
pay identified amounts owed under
Hedge Agreements, and (v) to pay
costs of issuing the Refunding Certificates. The Refunding Certificates
of each series shall mature on the
dates and in the respective principal
amounts set forth in the Purchase
Agreement for that series, consistent with this Ordinance and the
Trust Agreement.
(b) Interest. The Refunding Certificates may be issued as obligations bearing interest at fixed or
variable interest rates, based on the
determination of the Director of
Finance as to the financial advantage to, and best interests of, the
City, as specified in the Purchase
Agreement.
If
the
Director
of
Finance so determines, then the
method and procedure by which the
variable rate of interest to be borne
by the Refunding Certificates shall
be determined as provided in the
applicable
Supplemental
Trust
Agreement, whether by reference to
a market index, by a remarketing
agent or otherwise; provided that no
Refunding Certificates shall bear
interest at a rate in excess of twenty-five
percent
(25%)
per
year
(including any Refunding Certificate held by a provider of a Credit
Support Instrument). The Director
of Finance may determine that the
terms of a variable rate series of
Refunding Certificates may or may
not permit the holders to tender
their variable rate Refunding Certificates for purchase by the City. If
the Director of Finance designates

34
any series of Refunding Certificates
as variable rate Certificates, and if
the holders of that series of Refunding Certificates are to be entitled to
tender those Certificates for purchase, then the Director of Finance
shall also designate in the Purchase
Agreement for those variable rate
Certificates (and may designate others, from time to time, in substitution therefor), the tender agent or
agents and the remarketing agent
or agents, which designations shall
be based on the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the parties so designated
possess the requisite resources and
experience to provide the services
required of them and that the terms
on which the designated parties
have agreed to provide such services are fair and commercially reasonable.
(c)
Optional and Mandatory Redemption.
The Refunding Certificates of each series, and the corresponding principal component of
Base Rent, may be subject to
redemption prior to maturity at the
option of the City, if and to the
extent set forth in the Purchase
Agreement for that series. Any
Refunding
Certificates
so
determined to be subject to optional
redemption and maturing by their
stated
terms
after
the
earliest
optional redemption date shall be
subject to redemption at the option
of the City on or after the earliest
optional redemption date in whole
or in part on any date at the
redemption prices set forth in the
Purchase Agreement and in accordance with the applicable Supplemental Trust Agreement. The Refunding Certificates designated in
the Purchase Agreement as term
Certificates subject to mandatory
sinking fund redemption shall be
redeemed prior to maturity on each
mandatory redemption date designated in the Purchase Agreement in
the aggregate amount of the sinking fund installment to be paid on
such mandatory redemption date, all
as provided in the Purchase Agreement and in accordance with the
Supplemental Trust Agreement.
(d)
Credit Support and Other
Instruments.
The
Director
of
Finance, regardless of whether a
series
of
Refunding
Certificates
bears interest at variable or fixed
rates, is authorized to contract for
one or more Credit Support Instruments, if the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the Credit Support Instruments will
result in a savings in the cost of the
financing to the City. The costs of
such Credit Support Instruments
may be paid from proceeds of
Refunding Certificates or from Fund
Nos. 67 SF 600 and 01 SF 001 or from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose, as determined by
the Director of Finance. The Director of Finance is authorized to enter
into agreements in connection with
the delivery of the Refunding Certificates, and from time to time
thereafter so long as the Refunding
Certificates are outstanding, with
providers of Credit Support Instruments, tender agents (which may be

The City Record
the Trustee), remarketing agents
(which may be any of the Original
Purchasers) and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the method of
determining the variable interest
rates, permitting holders the right
of tender and providing for payment
of the purchase price of, or Certificate Payments on, the variable rate
Refunding Certificates.
(e)
Base Rent.
The City
acknowledges that the aggregate
principal amount of Outstanding
Certificates shall be based on the
aggregate principal component of
Base Rent under the Facility Lease
and that the interest on the Certificates shall be based on the interest
components of Base Rent. The Base
Rent to be payable under and in
accordance with the Facility Lease
during any Lease Term shall be an
amount
sufficient
to
cover
the
amount of Certificate Payments on
the Outstanding Certificates that
are due and payable during that
Lease Term, and such Base Rent
shall be specified or determined in
an exhibit to the Facility Lease; provided, however, that the City's payment of Base Rent and Additional
Rent is Subject to Appropriation and
Certification as provided in the
Facility Lease and nothing in the
Facility Lease, the Certificates, the
Trust Agreement, or any Hedge
Agreement constitutes or shall constitute a pledge by the City, or an
obligation of the City, of any taxes
or other moneys to the payments
due thereunder.
(f) Primary Offering Disclosure.
If, in the judgment of the Director
of Finance after consultation with
the Original Purchasers, a disclosure document is appropriate relating to the initial offering of one or
more series of Refunding Certificates, the Director of Finance, on
behalf of the City and in that officer’s official capacity, is authorized
to (i) cooperate with the Original
Purchasers in the preparation of,
and the making of modifications,
completions or changes of or supplements to, such a disclosure document, (ii) determine, and certify or
otherwise represent when the disclosure document is to be deemed
final or is final, (iii) authorize the
use and distribution of that disclosure document and any supplements
thereto in connection with the initial offering of the applicable series
of Refunding Certificates, and (iv)
sign certificates, statements or other
documents in connection with the
finality, accuracy and completeness
of that disclosure document. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
contract for services for the production and distribution of any disclosure statements, including by printed and electronic means.
(g)
Continuing Disclosure.
If
and to the extent required by Rule
15c2-12 promulgated by the Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
(“SEC”) in connection with the sale
of one or more series of Refunding
Certificates, the City shall enter into
continuing disclosure agreements,
approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, between the
City and the Trustee, with terms not
inconsistent with this Ordinance and

342

February 27, 2008
as may be approved by the officers
signing those agreements on behalf
of the City, all of which shall be
conclusively evidenced by that signing. In each such continuing disclosure agreement, the City shall agree
to provide, or cause to be provided,
to each nationally recognized municipal securities information repository designated by the SEC from time
to time in accordance with that
Rule, and to any state information
depository,
the
annual
financial
information and operating data and
notices of specified events required
by that Rule, as more particularly
described in the continuing disclosure agreement. The Director of
Finance is authorized to sign and
deliver each continuing disclosure
agreement and any related agreements, certificates and other instruments, and to deliver such information, as may be necessary or appropriate to comply with the requirements of the Rule. The City understands and agrees that those commitments are intended to be for the
benefit of the holders from time to
time of the applicable series of
Refunding
Certificates,
including
holders of book-entry interests in
those Certificates.
(h) Application for Ratings. If,
in the judgment of the Director of
Finance, the filing of applications
for one or more ratings on Refunding Certificates by one or more
nationally-recognized rating agencies is necessary or desirable for
marketing purposes, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare
and submit those applications, and
to provide information as may be
required in support of those applications for the purpose. The cost of
obtaining each such rating, except
to the extent paid by the Original
Purchasers in accordance with the
Purchase Agreement, shall be paid
from the proceeds of the Refunding
Certificates to the extent available
and then from other money lawfully available and appropriated or to
be appropriated for that purpose.
(i) Application of Proceeds; Costs
of Issuance. The proceeds from the
sale of the Refunding Certificates
shall be deposited and applied as
provided in the Supplemental Indenture and for the purposes stated in
this Ordinance and are appropriated
for those purposes. Costs of issuing
the Refunding Certificates that are
not paid from those proceeds may be
paid from Fund Nos. 67 SF 600 and
01 SF 001 or from other money lawfully available and appropriated or
to be appropriated for that purpose,
as determined by the Director.
Section 6. Sale of the Refunding
Certificates; Purchase Agreements.
The Director of Finance shall sign
and deliver Purchase Agreements
for Refunding Certificates setting
forth the conditions for delivery of
the Refunding Certificates that are
consistent with this Ordinance and
the Trust Agreement and that are
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
customary for lease certificates of
participation issued by governmental entities, including, without limitation, representations as to the accuracy and completeness of information contained in the disclosure

February 27, 2008
document described in Section 5 of
this Ordinance. In the event the
Refunding Certificates are issued in
more than one series sold at different times, a separate Purchase
Agreement shall be signed and
delivered for each separately delivered series. The Purchase Agreement shall provide for the sale of
the applicable series of Refunding
Certificates to the Original Purchasers selected by the Director of
Finance and identified in the Purchase Agreement, based on an evaluation of the qualifications of firms
that have proposed to underwrite
the Refunding Certificates.
Each Purchase Agreement shall
set forth the following, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, consistent with this Ordinance
and the Trust Agreement:
(a)
the
aggregate
principal
amount of Refunding Certificates
issued;
(b) the Purchase Price for the
Refunding Certificates;
(c) whether any Refunding Certificates are to be subject to optional redemption prior to maturity, and,
if so, the earliest optional redemption date for those Refunding Certificates subject to prior redemption,
which shall be not later than ten
years from the first interest payment date of the applicable series,
and the applicable redemption price,
which shall be not greater than
102%
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed;
(d) the dates on which principal
of the Refunding Certificates is to
be paid, which shall be not later
than thirty (30) years from their
respective dates of issuance, with an
identification of whether the payment is due by stated maturity or
by mandatory sinking fund redemption of Refunding Certificates of a
particular maturity;
(e) the interest rates to be borne
by Refunding Certificates bearing
interest at a fixed rate, the weighted average of which shall not
exceed eight percent (8%) as to
Refunding Certificates of any series,
and the method by which the interest rate is to be determined for
Refunding
Certificates
bearing
interest at variable rates, consistent
with Section 5;
(f) the particular Outstanding
Certificates or portions thereof to be
Series 2007 Certificates;
(g) the title and series designation for the Refunding Certificates;
(h) the amount, if any, of proceeds of the sale of the Refunding
Certificates to be deposited in the
Reserve Account in order to cause
the balance therein to equal the
Reserve Requirement, if and to the
extent required by the applicable
Supplemental Trust Agreement, and
any determination as to whether
there shall be a special reserve fund
for the Refunding Certificates of
any series, separate from the common Reserve Account, or a surety or
insurance policy, bank letter or line
of credit, or other form of credit or
liquidity
facility
enhancing
the
security for Refunding Certificates
of that series in lieu of a funded
reserve fund;
(i) whether any Refunding Certificates are to be secured by or

The City Record
payable
from
a
Credit
Support
Instrument.
It is determined that the terms of
the Refunding Certificates and the
corresponding terms of Base Rent as
so determined within the limitations
set forth in this Ordinance and as
so specified and set forth in the Purchase Agreement will be in the best
interest of the City and consistent
with all legal requirements.
Section 7. Conversion and Remarketing.
In the event that the Director of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is advantageous to the
City to convert the interest on any
Series
2007
Certificates
bearing
interest at variable rates to fixed
interest rates for a period of time or
to maturity or to convert to a different variable rate period or mode,
the City shall undertake the conversion and remarketing of those
Certificates in accordance with the
applicable
Supplemental
Trust
Agreement. In connection with any
conversion and remarketing of Certificates, the Director of Finance is
authorized to obtain one or more
Credit Support Instruments if the
Director determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the Credit Support Instrument will facilitate the remarketing
of the Certificates. In the event the
Director
of
Finance
determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that it is necessary in connection with the conversion and remarketing of Certificates
to supplement or amend the Existing Facility Lease or the Existing
Trust Agreement in order to address
current market conditions or to permit the use of a Credit Support
Instrument or to otherwise obtain
financing
arrangements
advantageous to the City, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
to sign and deliver an amendment
of the Existing Facility Lease, or an
amended
and
restated
Facility
Lease, and to signify approval of
the Amendment to the Existing
Trust Agreement, or an amended
and restated Existing Trust Agreement, in each case approved as to
form by the Director of Law. The
costs of any conversion and remarketing of Certificates may be paid,
as determined by the Director of
Finance, from the proceeds of remarketing or from Fund Nos. 67 SF 600
and 01 SF 001 or from other money
lawfully available and appropriated
or to be appropriated for that purpose. The Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare one or more
disclosure documents in connection
with any conversion and remarketing under the same terms and conditions as set forth in Section 5 of
this
Ordinance
with
respect
to
Refunding Certificates. The Director
of Finance or any other officer of
the City having responsibility for
the conversion and remarketing of
the Certificates is authorized to
take such actions or cause to be
taken such actions as are necessary
to maintain the tax-exempt status of
any Outstanding Certificates, and
the covenants and authorizations in
Section 9 of this Ordinance shall
apply to any converted Certificates.
The Director of Finance and other

343

35
City officials are authorized to sign
and deliver such instruments, certificates and documents as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions authorized by
this
Section.
The
Director
of
Finance, the Director of Law and
other City officials, as appropriate,
are authorized to make the necessary arrangements on behalf of the
City to establish the date, location,
procedure and conditions for the
conversion and remarketing of the
Series 2007 Certificates and to take
all actions necessary to effect the
conversion and remarketing of Outstanding
Certificates
under
the
terms of this Ordinance, the Facility Lease and the Trust Agreement.
The Clerk of Council or other
appropriate official of the City shall
furnish the remarketing agent a
true transcript of proceedings certified by the Clerk or other official,
of all proceedings had with reference to the conversion and remarketing of the Series 2007 Certificates
along with such information for the
records as is necessary to determine
the validity of the conversion and
remarketing.
Section 8.
Authorization of Supplemental Ground Leases, Supplemental Leases and Supplemental
Trust Agreements; Additional Documents.
In connection with the issuance of
any series of Refunding Certificates,
the Mayor and the Director of
Finance are authorized, in the name
and on behalf of the City, to sign
and deliver one or more Supplemental Leases and, if the final maturity of the Refunding Certificates is
later than the final maturity of the
then Outstanding Certificates, one
or more Supplemental Ground Leases, and to signify approval of one or
more Supplemental Trust Agreements, in each case approved as to
form and correctness by the Director of Law, not inconsistent with
this Ordinance and the Purchase
Agreement and not substantially
adverse to the City as may be
approved by the officers signing the
same on behalf of the City. The
determination by those officers that
a Supplemental Lease, Supplemental
Ground Lease or Supplemental Trust
Agreement
is
not
substantially
adverse to the City shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing and
delivery of that Supplemental Lease,
Supplemental Ground Lease or Supplemental Trust Agreement by those
officers. Any Supplemental Lease
may contain amendments to the
Facility Lease, as theretofor amended, and any Supplemental Trust
Agreement
may
contain
amendments to the Trust Agreement, as
theretofor amended, to permit the
City increased flexibility for the use
of financial or credit structures and
techniques determined by the Director of Finance, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
in the best interests of the City.
The
Mayor,
the
Director
of
Finance, the Clerk, the Director of
Law and other City officials are
authorized to sign and deliver such
instruments, certificates and documents as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions
authorized by this Ordinance, the
Purchase Agreements, the Supplemental Ground Leases, the Supple-

36
mental Leases, the Supplemental
Trust
Agreements,
the
Ground
Lease, the Facility Lease, the Trust
Agreement, the escrow agreements
and the Hedge Agreements.
The
Mayor,
the
Director
of
Finance, the Director of Law and
other City officials, as appropriate,
are authorized to make the necessary arrangements on behalf of the
City to establish the date, location,
procedure and conditions for the
delivery of each series of Refunding
Certificates to the Original Purchasers and to take all actions necessary to effect due signing, authentication and delivery of each series
of Refunding Certificates under the
terms of this Ordinance, the Supplemental Trust Agreements, the Purchase Agreements and the Trust
Agreement. The Clerk of Council or
other appropriate official of the City
shall
furnish
the
Original
Purchasers a true transcript of proceedings certified by the Clerk or
other official, of all proceedings had
with reference to the issuance of the
Refunding Certificates along with
such information for the records as
is necessary to determine the regularity and validity of the issuance
of the Refunding Certificates.
Section 9.
Tax Covenants.
The
Director of Finance, as the fiscal
officer, or any other officer having
responsibility for the issuance of
Refunding Certificates, is, alone or
in conjunction with any of the foregoing or with any other officer or
employee of the City, authorized (a)
to cooperate with the Original Purchasers and the Trustee by making,
on
behalf
of
the
City,
such
covenants and representations in the
Facility Lease as are appropriate
and necessary so that (a) the Facility Lease and the Refunding Certificates of any series will not (i)
constitute private activity bonds,
arbitrage bonds or hedge bonds
under Sections 141, 148 or 149 of the
Code or (ii) be treated other than as
obligations to which Section 103(a)
of the Code applies, and (b) the
interest components of Base Rent
and interest on the Refunding Certificates will not be treated as an
item of tax preference under Section
57 of the Code. The City hereby
covenants it will take or cause to be
taken such actions that may be
required of it for the interest components of Base Rent and interest
on the Refunding Certificates to be
and remain excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes and that it will not take or
authorize to be taken any actions
that would adversely affect that
exclusion.
The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer of
the City having responsibility for
the issuance of Refunding Certificates is hereby authorized (a) to
make or effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent,
approval, or waiver on behalf of the
City with respect to the Facility
Lease and the Refunding Certificates as the City is permitted to or
required to make or give under the
federal income tax laws, including,
without limitation thereto, any of
the elections provided for in Section
148(f)(4)(C) of the Code or available under Section 148 of the Code,
for the purpose of assuring, enhancing or protecting favorable tax

The City Record
treatment or status of the Facility
Lease and the Refunding Certificates or the interest components
thereof or assisting compliance with
requirements
for
that
purpose,
reducing the burden or expense of
such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or payments or penalties, or making payments of special
amounts in lieu of making computations to determine, or paying,
excess earnings as rebate, or obviating those amounts or payments, as
determined by that officer, which
action shall be in writing and
signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf
of the City, as may be appropriate
to assure the exclusion of interest
from gross income and the intended
tax status of the interest components of the Facility Lease and on
the Refunding Certificates, and (c)
to give one or more appropriate certificates of the City, for inclusion in
the transcript for the Refunding
Certificates, setting forth the reasonable expectations of the City
regarding the amount and use of all
the proceeds from the sale of the
Refunding Certificates, the facts,
circumstances
and
estimates
on
which they are based, and other
facts and circumstances relevant to
the tax treatment of the interest
component of and the tax status of
the Refunding Certificates. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provisions of this Ordinance to the
contrary, if the Director of Finance
determines prior to the execution
and delivery of a Purchase Agreement and that it is necessary and
appropriate and in the best interests
of the City for interest on a series
of Refunding Certificates and the
corresponding interest components
of Base Rent to be included in gross
income for federal income tax purposes, the City shall not be bound
by the covenants of this Section.
Each covenant made in this Section with respect to the Refunding
Certificates
is
also
made
with
respect to all issues any portion of
the principal of or interest on which
is paid from proceeds of the Refunding Certificates (and, if different,
the original issue and any refunding issues in a series of refundings),
to the extent such compliance is necessary to assure exclusion of interest on the Refunding Certificates
from
gross
income
for
federal
income tax purposes, and the officers identified above are authorized
to take actions with respect to those
issues as they are authorized in this
Section to take with respect to the
Refunding Certificates.
Section 10.
Financial Advisor.
The Director of Finance may obtain
the services of one or more Financial Advisors, from time to time, to
assist the Director of Finance in
making any of the determinations
required by this Ordinance to be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance or to negotiate any Hedge
Agreements.
The
Director
of
Finance may rely on the written
advice of any Financial Advisor so
retained. Any Financial Advisor or
consultant
employed
under
the
authority of this Ordinance shall be
disinterested in the transaction and
be independent of the underwriters

344

February 27, 2008
or counterparties and any other
party interested in the transaction.
Section 11.
Interpretation.
Any
provisions of the Codified Ordinances
of the City which are inconsistent
with the provisions of this Ordinance
shall not apply to the Certificates or
matters authorized herein. Northing
in this Ordinance is intended to, and
no provision hereof shall be applied
in any manner as would, impair the
obligation of contract of the City
with respect to any outstanding
bonds, certificates of indebtedness,
other
obligations,
indentures,
or
other agreements or contracts made
or entered into by the City.
Section 12. Validity. It is found
and determined, and is hereby represented and recited, that all applicable provisions of the City's Charter and the rules of this Council
have been fully complied with and
this Ordinance was passed in conformity therewith.
Section 13.
Severability.

Res. No. 298-08.
By Council Members Sweeney and
Zone.
An emergency resolution supporting the American Municipal Power
Generating Station (“AMPGS”) project based on thorough review of all
documentation, independent evaluation, testimony from consultants and
comments from community stakeholders; and resolving continued
support to Cleveland Public Power
in its effort to become one of the
most progressively operated public
utilities in the nation.
Whereas, this Council has considered the proposed participation by
Cleveland Public Power (“CPP”) in
the American Municipal Power Generating Station (“AMPGS”), to be
constructed in Meigs County, Ohio
by American Municipal Power —
Ohio (“AMP-Ohio”); and
Whereas, this project has been
considered by this Council and the
City
Administration
through
an
open and transparent public process
that solicited the participation of all
concerned stakeholders, appropriately
considered
the
sustainability
interests of the City and CPP, the
need for CPP to continue to offer
competitive electric rates for the
City’s residents and businesses, and
the efforts and commitments of
AMP-Ohio to mitigate the impact of
the AMPGS project and fulfill its
role in environmental stewardship
on behalf of all its members including CPP; and
Whereas, on April 7, 2003, this
Council passed Ordinance No. 375-03
authorizing CPP to participate in a
feasibility study by AMP-Ohio to
study the feasibility of constructing
a base load generating plant including studies to determine the optimal
strategy for meeting or exceeding
all environmental requirements; and
Whereas, on June 4, 2007, this
Council passed Ordinance No. 484-07
authorizing CPP to participate in a
feasibility study by AMP-Ohio to
study the feasibility of constructing
multiple
hydroelectric
generating
plants on the Ohio River to add
renewable
energy
resources
for
AMP-Ohio’s
members,
including
CPP; and
Whereas, on June 17, 2007, AMPOhio completed the initial feasibility study of the AMPGS project,
which examined available technologies, fuel availabilities, generating
needs,
anticipated
environmental
regulations, economics, and other
factors; and
Whereas, on November 20, 2006,
this Council passed Ordinance No.
1716-06, authorizing CPP to employ
consultants to study the AMPGS project, as well as the AMP-Ohio hydroelectric project and other generation
projects; and
Whereas, CPP retained the engineering firm of Burns & Roe to
study the AMPGS project and, on
October 16, 2007, Burns & Roe

38
issued a final report supporting
CPP’s participation in the AMPGS
project; and
Whereas, on January 23, 2006, this
Council passed Ordinance No. 186805 authorizing CPP to retain a consultant to develop a 5-year Strategic
Business Plan to develop a strategic
plan to enhance CPP’s competitiveness, including a review of CPP’s
power supply strategy; and
Whereas, on March 28, 2007, CPP
presented
its
Strategic
Business
Plan to the Public Utilities Committee in a public hearing; and
Whereas, based on the recommendations in the Strategic Business
Plan, CPP developed a power supply
portfolio
diversification
strategy
based on the fuel source of generation, location of generation, environmental impacts, availability and
reliability, transmission access, and
cost; and
Whereas, to implement the recommendations in the Strategic Business Plan, CPP created internal special project teams in 2007 to explore
alternative and renewable energy
sources including wind power, landfill gas, pump storage, and a municipal waste-to-energy facility; and
Whereas, the Public Utilities Committee held a series of public hearings in 2006 and 2007 (PURPA I and
II) during which the AMPGS project
was discussed, as well as alternatives to this type of generation; and
Whereas, the Public Utilities Committee solicited written public comments, conducted public hearings on
November 30, 2006 and May 23, 2007,
and conducted a public workshop on
April 18, 2007, addressing standards
for Interconnection; Net Metering;
Time-Based Metering and Communications; and
Whereas, the Public Utilities Committee has initiated review of the
PURPA standards for Fossil Fuel
Generation
Efficiency
and
Fuel
Source Diversity and has conducted
public hearings on November 29,
2007 and January 16, 2008, and a
public workshop on December 6,
2007, addressing these Standards;
and
Whereas, at the Public Utilities
Committee hearing on January 16,
2008, the Commissioner of CPP presented testimony on Fuel Diversity
and the use of coal, Integrated Gasification Combined-Cycle power plant
technology, and carbon storage, in
support for CPP’s participation in

Fuel Generation Efficiency Standard; and
Whereas, concurrent with Council’s proceedings to consider adopting the Fuel Source Diversity standard,
the
City
announced
the
planned adoption of an Advanced
Energy Portfolio Standard for CPP;
and
Whereas, an Advanced Energy
Portfolio Standard will encourage
development of alternative energy
sources such as cogeneration, distributed generation, and fuel cells,
and renewable energy resources

The City Record
including waste-to-energy generation, low-impact hydropower, wind
power, biomass, solar power, landfill
gas, solar photovoltaic, and solar
thermal resources; and
Whereas, the City, in its attempt
to take a global lead in relying
more on renewable energy and energy efficiency has begun several initiatives,
projects
and
programs,
including:
• Researching the feasibility of
local wind capacity by conducting a
wind resource assessment;
• Installation of a solar thermal
system on a fire station and continued development of strategies to
install solar thermal energy systems
throughout the City;
• Development of Green building
policies for City funded projects and
municipal capital projects to reduce
the City’s energy consumption and
promote green building in Cleveland;
• Development of an Energy Efficiency & Conservation program for
CPP customers and City residents
helping residents and small businesses reduce their energy bills and
conserve energy;
• Exploring cogeneration opportunities throughout the City at existing district energy facilities and at
CPP’s commercial and industrial
customers; and
Whereas, it is imperative to develop a thorough understanding of
what CPP must do to be competitive
in the future, in an evolving regulatory climate; and
Whereas, the initiatives listed
above, and other initiatives in the
planning stage, will guarantee the
future of public power in Cleveland
and position CPP to advance Cleveland as a city that owns and runs
one of the most progressively operated public utilities in the nation;
and
Whereas, on October 10, 2007 and
October 24, 2007, Council’s Public
Utilities Committee held hearings
exclusively
about
the
proposed
AMPGS project in which the public
was given and took the opportunity
to comment regarding the AMPGS
project; and
Whereas, on October 29, 2007, this
Council passed Ordinance No. 165307, authorizing an agreement with
AMP-Ohio to authorize CPP to participate the AMPGS project; and
Whereas, the Public Utilities Committee amended Ordinance No. 165307 to include a provision requiring
that the Director of Public Utilities
appear before the Utilities Committee and provide an updated feasibility report on the AMPGS project
prior to March 1, 2008; and
Whereas,
by
this
amendment,
Council refused to commit to the
project unless and until it learned
all information necessary to pursue
the best course of action for the city
of Cleveland and its citizens; and
Whereas, during the public hearings on the AMPGS project, discussion was never limited with regard
to the larger energy or environmental issues; the public, community
stakeholders,
and
representatives
from AMP-Ohio and CPP were provided a forum to address their
respective concerns and issues; and
Whereas, this Council has reviewed outstanding issues with the

346

February 27, 2008
public as well as with AMP-Ohio,
and has received AMP-Ohio’s firm
commitment regarding those issues
of most concern to Cleveland City
Council; and
Whereas, the AMP-Ohio Board has
agreed, by Resolution No. 08-02-2552,
to shut down the Gorsuch Generating Station contemporaneously with
the commercial operation of the
AMPGS;
Whereas, the City of St. Marys, a
member municipality of AMP-Ohio,
will close its coal-fired generating
plant, which load will be eventually met by the AMP-Ohio Generating
Station; and
Whereas, in recognition that carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are a
significant greenhouse gas leading
to global climate change, AMP-Ohio
anticipates that future regulations
on CO2 emissions will be imposed on
coal-fired base load power plants;
and
Whereas, AMP-Ohio has partnered
with FirstEnergy to install a pilot
CO2 capture system at the FirstEnergy R.E. Burger generation station;
and
Whereas, AMP-Ohio has committed, by Resolution No. 08-02-2551, to
using Power Span technology in the
operation of AMPGS and to the use
of “supercritical” boilers, in order to
achieve maximum efficiency; and
Whereas, AMP-Ohio has committed, by Resolution No. 08-02-2550, to
support the City’s environmental initiatives; and
Whereas, as a consequence of closure of the Gorsuch and City of St.
Marys
generating
stations
and
replacement of market purchases
with capacity from the AMPGS, it is
expected that there will be a net
reduction in SO2 emissions of 112,162
tons per year, NOx emissions of
18,219 and particulate matter emissions of 3,626; and
Whereas, on February 7, 2008,
Ohio EPA issued a Final Permit to
Install for the proposed AMPGS; and
Whereas,
development
of
the
AMPGS project will serve to reduce
the overall emissions footprint of
AMP-Ohio and its members; and
Whereas, participation by CPP in
the AMPGS project will lower CPP’s
emissions footprint by replacing its
current supply of power from the
conventional
Gorsuch
Generating
Plant and other regional coal plants
with power from a cleaner source;
and
Whereas,
Council
engaged
an
independent consultant, ION Consulting
(“ION”),
to
provide
an
assessment of the data and reports
relative to the AMPGS project; and
Whereas, at the final hearing on
the project on February 22, 2008,
ION reported the results of their
independent assessment, and AMPOhio and CPP were given a chance
to respond; in addition there was yet
another opportunity for public comment; and
Whereas, ION found, among other
things, the following: the February
2007 Power Supply Plan (“PSP”)
developed a reasonably diversified
portfolio of supply alternatives to
meet CPP’s projected need; the
AMPGS project has been a generally well-managed development project and the expected outcome is an
asset that will provide net econom-

February 27, 2008
ic benefits to its owners; ION’s projections do not significantly differ
from R.W. Beck’s; CPP’s unique
competitive
market
environment
causes it to be vulnerable to the
risks associated with the AMPGS
project; thus, CPP must match its
capacity additions with existing
load requirements in a way that conforms with its risk tolerance; CPP
should quantify its exposure to customer losses under a worst case
planning scenario; CPP and the City
have influenced AMP-Ohio to develop the AMPGS in an environmentally conscious and prudent manner;
and
Whereas, for the reasons set
forth in this Resolution, this Council has determined that CPP’s participation in the AMPGS project
will
promote
the
sustainability
interests of the City and CPP, the
need for CPP to continue to offer
competitive electric rates for the
City’s residents and businesses,
and the efforts and commitments of
AMP-Ohio to mitigate the impact of
the AMPGS project and fulfill its
role in environmental stewardship
on behalf of all its members including CPP; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports the American Municipal
Power Generating Station (AMPGS)
project based on thorough review of
all documentation, independent evaluation, testimony from consultants
and
comments

An emergency resolution encouraging fast food chain restaurants in
the City to list calories and cholesterol content on the wrappers and
containers of food items.
Whereas, it is well documented
that the food in fast food chain
restaurants are high in calories and
cholesterol; and
Whereas, to help consumers maintain healthy life-styles and make
healthy choices, it is important that
they are aware of the calories and
