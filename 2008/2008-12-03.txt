Ord. No. 1826-08.
By Council Members Kelley and
Sweeney (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Port Control to
enter into one or more agreements
with the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and the Northeast
Ohio Regional Sewer District, or
their designees, to pay or reimburse
directly related costs incurred by
them for the purpose of implementing projects required to mitigate
adverse consequences on Abram
Creek; and authorizing the Director
of Parks, Recreation and Properties
to employ one or more professional
consultants to prepare a master plan
for Rockefeller Park.
Whereas, the capital improvement
program
for
Cleveland
Hopkins
International Airport required that
Abram Creek be put into a culvert,
and in response to that, the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency
(“Ohio EPA”) Director issued Findings and Orders dated April 2001,
that directed the restoration of Doan
Brook
and
other
wetlands
and
streams
as
mitigation
for
the
adverse impact to Abram Creek; and
Whereas, twice in 2005, the Department of Port Control solicited
construction
bids
for
the
Doan
Brook mitigation project, but in
both instances, the bids came back
greatly exceeding authorized funding and so were rejected; and
Whereas, in 2006, the City contacted the Northeast Ohio Regional
Sewer District (“NEORSD”) regarding a potential joint project for the
Doan
Brook
mitigation
project.
NEORSD’s examination resulted in a

2259

re-design of the project that will
substantially reduce the cost; and
Whereas, the re-design required
modifications to the Ohio EPA’s April
2001 Findings and Orders which,
after lengthy negotiations concluding in September 2008, will be issued
shortly and are agreeable to both the
Ohio EPA and the City; and
Whereas, the modifications to the
April 2001 Findings and Orders require additional legislative authority; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Port Control is authorized to enter
into one or more agreements with
the Ohio EPA and the NEORSD, or
their designees, to pay or reimburse
directly related costs incurred by
them for the purpose of implementing projects required to mitigate
adverse consequences on Abram
Creek, including but not limited to
various water quality and stream
restoration and mitigation projects
within Cuyahoga County, mitigation
construction on Doan Brook, stream
monitoring for a period up to five
years after the mitigation construction is completed, as required by the
Ohio EPA and Section 106 Memorandum of Agreement dated January 13, 2005.
Section 2. That the Director of
Parks, Recreation and Properties is
authorized to employ by contract or
contracts one or more consultants or
one or more firms of consultants for
the purpose of supplementing the
regularly employed staff of the several departments of the City of
Cleveland in order to provide professional services necessary to prepare a master plan for Rockefeller
Park, as required by the Ohio EPA
and Section 106 Memorandum of
Agreement dated January 13, 2005.
The selection of the consultants
for the services shall be made by
the Board of Control on the nomination of the Director of Parks,
Recreation and Properties from a
list of qualified consultants available for employment as may be
determined after a full and complete
canvass by the Director of Parks,
Recreation and Properties for the
purpose of compiling a list. The
compensation to be paid for the services shall be fixed by the Board of
Control. The contract or contracts
authorized shall be prepared by the
Director of Law, approved by the
Director of Parks, Recreation and
Properties, and certified by the
Director of Finance.
Section 3. That the cost of the payments and the contract or contracts
authorized shall be paid from Fund
Nos. 60 SF 130, 60 SF 128, and 60 SF
141, Request No. 175233.

Section 341.06
Local Design Review Advisory Committees
The City Planning Commission
shall establish Local Design Review
Advisory Committees to advise the
Commission on applications received
pursuant to the regulations of this
Chapter. The following provisions
shall govern the establishment and
operation of each such committee:
(a) Appointment of Members. The
City Planning Commission shall
appoint the members of each Local
Design Review Advisory Committee.
In making these appointments, the
City Planning Commission shall
solicit nominations from Community
Development Corporations operating
within each committee’s geographic
area of jurisdiction. Each Advisory
Committee shall be composed of not
less than five (5) and not more than
eleven (11) members, except that
the City Planning Commission may
increase membership on a particular
committee if necessary to incorporate relevant perspectives and areas
of expertise. A maximum of three
(3)
alternate
members
may
be
appointed to each committee. The
alternate members may vote in
place of members not in attendance
at a particular meeting, as determined by the Committee’s chairperson.
(b) Committee Composition. A
majority of the members appointed
to each Advisory Committee shall be
architects
or
other
recognized
design professionals, with the remaining members representing businesses or other organizations with
operations in the local area or being
residents of the local area. The term
“recognized
design
professionals”
shall refer to individuals with documented expertise in such fields as
architecture, landscape architecture,
urban design, graphic design, or historic preservation.
(c) Committee Jurisdiction and
Name. Each Local Design Review
Advisory Committee shall review
applications received pursuant to
this Chapter for properties located
within the boundaries of its area of
jurisdiction, as established by the

shall assign each Local Design
Review Advisory Committee a name
identified with the area of the City
served by the Committee.

to replace the member with a new
appointment or until the member
resigns. The City Planning Commission shall replace members whose
attendance is poor or who fail to act
in accordance with the regulations
of this Chapter.
(e) Quorum and Voting. A majority of the Advisory Committee's
membership shall constitute a quorum, without which no votes may be
taken. Approval of an application
shall require the affirmative vote of
a majority of the members present
at a meeting.
(f) Meetings and Records. The
Advisory Committee shall meet at
least twice monthly unless there is
no business to conduct. The staff
representative of the City Planning
Commission shall be designated as
the Advisory Committee’s Secretary
and shall be responsible for prompt
preparation of minutes, which shall
be retained by the City Planning
Commission.
Section 341.07 Design Guidelines
In reviewing applications subject
to provisions of this Chapter, the
Local Design Review Advisory Committee and the City Planning Commission shall follow the design
guidelines set forth in the succeeding sections as well as any supplemental design guidelines adopted by
Commission for a particular district.
(a) Design Compatibility. Alterations, additions and new development shall be compatible in scale,
material, color, placement and character with the design of the subject
property as well as the design of
properties that are representative of
the area’s most valued architectural
and environmental qualities. In evaluating compatibility, consideration
shall also be given to the value of
diversity
and
individuality
in
design.
Contemporary
Design.
All
(b)
buildings are recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations, additions and new developments which
have no historical basis and which
seek to create an appearance characteristic of an earlier time are not
required.
Conversely,
compatible
contemporary design is encouraged
except where such design would
clearly detract from the architectural unity of a grouping of architecturally significant structures.
(c) Preservation of Features. The
distinguishing original qualities of
a property should not be diminished
through alteration or removal of distinctive architectural features.
(d) Replacement of Features. In
the event that replacement of significant architectural features is
necessary, the new material should
closely match the original material
in composition, design, color, texture
and all other visual qualities.
(e) Cleaning. The cleaning of
exterior wall surfaces should be

12
undertaken by the gentlest means
possible. Sandblasting and other
cleaning methods that will damage
facing materials and architectural
features shall not be undertaken.
(f) Fences and Other Accessory
Structures. Fences, walkways, lighting, benches, landscaping and other
accessory structures should be compatible in design with adjoining
buildings and with the most valued
aspects of an area’s character. Use
of chain-link fences along street
frontages is discouraged unless otherwise specified in guidelines for a
district.
(g) Parking Lots. Use of evergreen shrubbery and trees in combination with low ornamental fences
is encouraged in screening parking
lots from streets. Use of curbed,
planted islands is encouraged to provide visual relief in large parking
areas and to control traffic circulation. For districts characterized by
buildings set along the street line,
parking lots shall be located behind
buildings whenever possible, with
entrances located off of adjoining
side streets.
(h) Sustainability. Buildings and
properties should be designed and
constructed to minimize energy consumption and to promote conservation
of
materials
and
natural
resources.
(i) Signs. In addition to meeting
Zoning Code and Building Code
requirements for signs in applicable
zoning districts, signs subject to
approval under the provisions of
this Chapter shall also meet the following design guidelines. In the
case of a conflict between these regulations and the Zoning Code regulations, these regulations prevail.
(1) Placement. Wall signs should
be designed to fit within the architectural space intended for signage
and should not cover distinctive
architectural features.
(2) Compatibility. Signs to be seen
as a series should be designed with
compatibility in terms of location,
size, shape, style, material, illumination and color. As a general rule,
uniformity should be maintained in
certain characteristics while other
characteristics are varied to permit
individual expression and identification.
(3) Color. The colors of a sign
should complement the color of the
building facade to which the sign
relates. If a raceway or similar
device is used for attachment of a
sign’s letters or characters, the color
of the raceway should match the
color of the wall surface.
(4) Lettering and Symbols. The
lettering and symbols on a sign
should be large enough to be easily
read but not overly large or out of
scale with the building on which the
sign is displayed. An excessive
amount of information on signs, creating an image of visual clutter,
should be avoided. Use of distinctive
symbols or logos on signs is encouraged.
(5) Projecting Signs. Where permitted, projecting signs should be
no larger than necessary for readability by nearby pedestrians and
should contain no internal illumination unless other than in use of
exposed neon and similar treatments. Spacing between projecting

The City Record

December 3, 2008

signs should be sufficient to prevent
an image of clutter.
(6) Wall Signs. For signs mounted
flat against the wall of a building,
use of individual letters or characters is preferable to use of panel or
cabinet signs in instances where
individual letters or characters are
less likely to detract from a building’s architectural character. Such
letters
or
characters
should
be
attached in a manner that will minimize damage to the wall surface
after removal. For buildings lacking
appropriately designed wall space
for placement of a sign, consideration should be given to use of a projecting sign, window sign or canopy
sign as an alternative to a wall sign.
(7) Billboards. Billboards or “advertising signs”, as defined in Section 325.64(b) of the Zoning Code,
shall not be permitted in any Design
Review District.
(8) Design Exceptions. In accordance with standards of Section
350.16 of the Zoning Code, the City
Planning Commission, may vary the
sign regulations of Chapter 350 as
necessary to permit signs that are
better suited to the design of the
subject property or nearby properties of architectural or historic significance.

six (6) months, on the demolition or
moving of a building in order to
allow economic viability studies to
be conducted, as well as to allow
interested parties the opportunity to
explore alternatives to the proposed
action. At the end of such period,
the Commission shall either approve
or disapprove the request to demolish or move, or may choose to delay
action for a second and final period
of not more than six (6) months if
the Commission determines that this
additional time period may be useful in securing an alternative to the
proposed demolition or moving. At
the end of such second and final
period, the Commission shall either
approve or disapprove the request.
Section 3. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Referred to Directors of City Planning Commission, Finance, Law;
Committees on City Planning, Legislation, Finance.

Section 341.08
Demolition and
Moving
For applications proposing the
demolition or moving of a building
in a Design Review District, other
than
for
emergency
demolition
activities ordered by the Director of
the Building and Housing to remedy conditions that pose immediate
danger to human life or health, the
following provisions shall apply:
(a) Criteria for Action. In considering a request to demolish or move
a building or other structure located
within a Design Review District, the
City Planning Commission and its
Local Design Review Advisory Committee shall consider the following
factors in making its decision to approve or disapprove the request:
(1) the architectural and historic
significance of the subject building
or structure;
(2) the significance of the building or structure in contributing to
the architectural or historic character of its environs;
(3) in the case of a request to
move a building or other structure,
the relationship between the location of the subject building or
structure and its overall significance;
(4) the present and potential economic viability of the subject building or structure, given its physical
condition and marketability;
(5) the presence of conditions on
the subject property that are dangerous or are detrimental to the
immediate area and cannot be reasonably remedied other than by the
proposed demolition;
(6) the degree to which the applicant proposes to salvage and facilitate re-use of structures proposed
for demolition; and
(7) the design quality and significance and the appropriateness of
the proposed re-use of the property.
(b) Nature of Action. The City
Planning Commission may delay
action, for a period of not more than

An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Senate and House of Representatives to support the passage
of H.B.602 and S.B 353, known as the
Land Reutilization Bills, which will
allow for the creation of Countywide land banks.
Whereas, Ohio has had one of the
highest foreclosure rates in the
country, with a loan default rate
more than three times the national
average; and
Whereas, vacant foreclosed properties often become a breeding
ground for crime and fires, and
require a disproportionate amount of
government maintenance, from securing properties against criminal activity, to removal of garbage and
rodents, to demolition, all at a cost
to taxpayers; and
Whereas, vacant properties reduce
city tax revenue because such properties are often tax delinquent, their
low value means they generate little in taxes and they depress property values across an entire neighborhood; and
Whereas, the cost of living in a
neighborhood with many vacant and
abandoned properties makes obtaining homeowner’s insurance, mortgages and loans for home improvements more difficult; and
Whereas, vacant properties degrade and devalue the quality of
life for remaining residents, isolating and weakening the neighborhood, and increasing the likelihood
that property values will continue to
decline and further abandonment
will occur; and
Whereas, Cuyahoga County is projecting approximately 12,000 foreclosures in 2008, with Cleveland experiencing sixty percent of those foreclosures and of which, according to
a recent study by Case Western
Reserve
University’s
NEO-CANDO
Data
Center,
most
will
remain
vacant after a sheriffs sale; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has approximately 8,000 vacant and
abandoned homes an number that is
currently
beyond
the
financial
capacity of the City to mitigate; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
and Cuyahoga County continue to
encourage regional collaboration for
regional issues such as foreclosure;
and

The City Record
Whereas, the mortgage foreclosure crisis has dramatically increased the amount of vacant, abandoned
and
distressed
properties,
which pose a unique and growing
problem in the City of Cleveland
and Cuyahoga County in maintaining residential and economic stability; and
Whereas, the development and
implementation of a county land
reutilization corporation can assist
cities in facilitating the reclamation,
rehabilitation and reutilization of
vacant, abandoned, tax-foreclosed or
other real property; and
Whereas, the structure of proposed H.B. 602 and S.B. 353 provide
multiple sources of funding and collaboration that will not rely on any
one entity too heavily and will provide the best, most effective and
responsible manner of addressing
this aspect of the mortgage foreclosure crisis plaguing our city, county, state and country; and
Whereas, it is incumbent upon the
Ohio Legislature to assist local governments with the tools and information
to
reduce
the
negative
impacts of foreclosed and vacant
properties and provide local government with the ability to land bank
property; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the Ohio Senate and House
of Representatives to support the
passage of H.B. 602 and S.B 353,
known as the Land Reutilization
Bills, which will allow for the creation of County-wide land banks.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Governor Ted Strickland, Bill Harris,
Ohio Senate President, Ray Miller,
Ohio Senate Minority Leader, Senator David Goodman, Speaker of the
House Jon Husted, House Minority
Leader Joyce Beatty and James
Rokakis, Cuyahoga County Treasurer.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
