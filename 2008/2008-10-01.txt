An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Port Control to

deicer, potassium acetate, for the
various divisions of the Department
of Port Control, for a period concurrent with the term of Contract

Whereas, under Ordinance No. 98507, passed July 11, 2007, and Board

liquid
deicer,
potassium
acetate
(“PA”), for the various divisions of
the Department of Port Control, for
a period of two years, with two oneyear options to renew, beginning
December 4, 2007; and
Whereas, due to a miners’ strike
in Canada affecting the supply of
the main chemical component needed to make PA, Cryotech is unable
to deliver the deicing chemical
under Contract No. 67616, until the
strike is resolved; and
Whereas, for airport operational
and safety reasons and because the
City is federally required to maintain all taxiways, runways, and

City must obtain PA from another
source while Cryotech is unable to
deliver it; and
Whereas, the Director of Port Control desires to enter into an agreement with Old World Industries, Inc.
to supply PA until the miners’ strike
rendering Cryotech unable to provide the chemical under Contract
No. 67616 is resolved and at any time
during the Cryotech contract term,
including
any
optional
renewal
years or extensions, that Cryotech is
unable or delayed to supply Port
Control’s requirements for PA due

being the need to obtain PA deicing

safety during winter weather and
that liquid deicing chemical, potassium acetate (“PA”), cannot be
secured with assurance from any
source other than Old World Industries, Inc. Therefore, any provisions
of the Charter and the Codified Ordinances to the contrary notwithstanding, the Director of Port Control is authorized to make a written
requirement
contract
with
Old
World Industries, Inc. for a term

The City Record
coterminous with the term of Contract No. 67616 with Cryotech Deicing Technology, a division of General Atomics International Services

more extension days under the General Conditions of the Cryotech contract, for the Department of Port
Control’s requirements for PA, to be
purchased by the Commissioner of
Purchases and Supplies on a unit
basis, for the various divisions of

An emergency resolution encouraging the Jackson Administration to
research upgrading the current 9-1-1
emergency system to a "Next Generation 9-1-1 System" that includes
new technology such as text messaging, video and picture images.
Whereas, the current 9-1-1 system
in the United States is based on
decades-old technology that cannot
handle the text, data, images and
video that are increasingly common
today; and
Whereas, the limitations of the
current 9-1-1 system mean that each
introduction of a new access technology,
for
example,
wireless
phones, or expansion of system functions, requires significant engineering and system modifications; and
Whereas, the nation’s current 9-11 system is “an analog technology
in
an
overwhelmingly
digital
world”; and
Whereas, the U.S Department of
Transportation believes that a fundamental reexamination of the technological approach to 9-1-1 is essential as the nation’s public safety
emergency service networks struggle to accommodate the challenges

8
of wireless communications and digital services; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby encourages the Jackson Administration to research upgrading the
current 9-1-1 emergency system to a

Number 00239900015; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of

Be it resolved by the Council of

term loans to 28% APR and change
short term lending laws; and
Whereas, payday loans are designed to trap people in a cycle of
repeat borrowing; and
Whereas, the interest on a typical
payday loan is 391% APR; and
Whereas, these high interest rates
aggravate Cleveland’s home mortgage foreclosure crisis; and
Whereas, Democratic state legislators joined with Republicans to
crack down on abuse lending by
passing House Bill 545, which caps
Ohio’s annual interest on payday
loans at 28%; and
Whereas, Governor Ted Strickland
signed House Bill 545 into law; and
Whereas,
the
national
payday
lobby is financing a referendum
that would undermine Ohio’s nationally acclaimed payday reform law
and allow lenders to continue charging rates commonly associated with
loan sharking; and
Whereas, this referendum would
appear on the November 4 ballot as
Issue 5; and
Whereas, a YES vote on Issue 5
will preserve Ohio’s 28% rate cap
and block lenders from charging
391% interest; and
Whereas, preserving the rate cap
will
help
Cleveland’s
families,
neighborhoods and businesses by
allowing borrowers to keep more of
their money by spending less on
high interest rates; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health,
or safety in that passage of Issue 5
will extend the same loan protections to Cleveland families that the
federal government provides to military families; now therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Mayor and
Council pledge their support of and
urge the voters of the City of Cleveland to support State Issue 5 at the
election to be held on November 4,
2008, relating to payday lending.
Section 2. That this resolution is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
