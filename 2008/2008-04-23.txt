ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 563-08.
By Council Member Conwell.
An emergency resolution acknowledging Cleveland’s first ever Black
Marriage Day celebration and recognizing the importance of successful
marriages of black couples in the
black community.
Whereas, on Sunday March 30,
2008, Cleveland held its first-ever
Black Marriage Day celebration, one
of more than 200 taking place across
the country; and
Whereas, the three hour celebration ended with nearly 40 couples
renewing their marriage vows; and
Whereas, Black Marriage Day
was created in 2003 to try to counteract the plummeting black marriage rate and to strengthen black
families by showcasing black couples in successful marriages despite the statistics: for instance,
2000 census figures show that 70%
of all black babies born in Cleveland are born to unmarried parents;
and
Whereas, it is critical for the
African-American community to “reclaim the institution of marriage”
and an annual event that recognizes
the importance of marriage will
help; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

April 23, 2008
Section 1. That this Council hereby acknowledges Cleveland’s first
ever Black Marriage Day celebration and recognizes the importance
of successful marriages of black
couples in the black community.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted April 14, 2008.
Effective April 18, 2008.

By Council Members Zone, Sweeney, Pierce Scott, Coats, Santiago,
White, Turner, Polensek, Cleveland,
Brancatelli, Keane, Cummins, Brady,
Reed, Mitchell, Cimperman and Westbrook.
An emergency resolution urging
the U.S. Congress to support the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block
Grant program that was enacted as
part of the Energy Independence and
Security Act of 2007 and appropriate
$2 billion for fiscal year 2009.
Whereas, the U.S. Congress has
enacted the Energy Independence
and Security Act of 2007 aimed at
moving the U.S. toward greater energy independence and security, increasing the production of clean
renewable fuels, and increasing the
energy efficiency of products, buildings and vehicles; and
Whereas, a variety of challenges
have brought increased attention
and timeliness to sustainability, including
the
threat
to
climate
change, rising energy prices, and
the depletion of natural resources;
and
Whereas, sustainability is a defining issue of our time, representing
the broad notion that activities
should take into account implications for people and the environment so that our actions meet the
needs of the current generation
without compromising future generations; and
Whereas, our nation’s cities are
innovators in implementing energy
conservation and environmental protection programs to support their
communities and the national economy; and
Whereas, local governments recognize they have a central role to
play in effecting change, but need
the support and cooperation of the
federal government, by including
funds for the block grant program,
municipal leaders will be able to
expand their efforts to support
building and home energy conservation programs and improve energy efficiency; and
Whereas, the new law authorizes
$2 billion annually, Cleveland City
Council is urging the appropriation
of funding for the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant
program; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the

The City Record
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the U.S. Congress to support the
Energy Efficiency and Conservation
Block Grant program that was
enacted as part of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007
and appropriate $2 billion for fiscal
year 2009.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
U.S.
Senators
George
Voinovich,
Sherrod Brown, Robert C. Byrd and
Thad Cochran, U.S. Congress persons Stephanie Tubbs-Jones, Dennis
Kucinich, David R. Obey and Jerry
Lewis, the Director of the National
League of Cities and the Director of
the Ohio Municipal League.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted April 14, 2008.
Effective April 18, 2008.

Res. No. 569-08.
By Council Members Brady, Brancatelli, Westbrook, Cummins, Coats,
Keane,
Zone,
Polensek,
Turner,
Sweeney, White, Conwell, Cleveland,
Pierce Scott and Cimperman.
An emergency resolution urging
the U. S. Department of Housing and
Urban
Development
(“HUD”)
to
resume selling foreclosed houses to
communities, so that cities like
Cleveland can continue to purchase
and renovate or demolish the properties to get ride of blight.
Whereas, last week the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) decided to delay the sales of hundreds of foreclosed houses to communities because it claims it wants to review
the program; and
Whereas,
currently,
there
are
more foreclosed homes set to sell to
communities in Ohio and Michigan,
than in the program’s entire fiveyear history; and
Whereas, the HUD program is
designed to sell foreclosed properties for $1 each in order to give new
life to such properties on the market for more than 6 months; and
Whereas, most of these homes are
in disrepair with mortgages guaranteed by the Federal Housing
Administration, so the federal government gets the titles after the previous owners default; and
Whereas, by selling the houses for
$1 each to local governments, HUD
can
remove
the
slowest-moving
houses from its inventory, communities can then demolish the houses
or renovate them and sell them to
people to live in; and
Whereas, in recent months, Ohio
and Michigan began to use this pro-

793

21
gram
aggressively,
through
the
Chapman Law Firm, which got the
right to manage and market all the
HUD-owned houses in these two
states; and
Whereas, the aggressive use of
the HUD program can be instrumental in helping counteract blight
left in Ohio and Michigan by the
nation’s foreclosure crises; and
Whereas, HUD recently refused to
extend its contract with The Chapman Law Firm and no new process
has been implemented to access
HUD-foreclosed properties; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the U. S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development
(“HUD”) to resume selling foreclosed houses to communities, so
that cities like Cleveland can continue to purchase and renovate or
demolish the properties to get rid of
blight.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Sherrod
Brown and George Voinovich, U.S.
Senators of Ohio, Ted Strickland,
Governor of Ohio, Peter Lawson
Jones, Tim Hagan, Jimmy Dimora,
Cuyahoga County Commissioners,
and Jorgelle Lawson, Director, Ohio
HUD Office.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted April 14, 2008.
Effective April 18, 2008.

An emergency ordinance authorizing the Mayor to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with the
Mayor of the City of Youngstown
relating to shared economic issues
and concerns.
Whereas, the Mayor of the City of

they strive to overcome challenges
related to slow economic growth,
loss of large manufacturing, and
diminishing population;
Whereas, both Mayors recognize,
and celebrate, the considerable physical, economic, and cultural attributes that set their cities apart from
suburban counterparts; and
Whereas, the Mayor of Cleveland
and
the
Mayor
of
Youngstown
ardently believe their cities are and
will continue to capitalize on existing assets to become global centers
of excellence in the health care, bioscience, electronics, polymer, advanced manufacturing, product design, construction, advanced energy,
and other growing economic sectors;
and
Whereas, the Mayor of Cleveland
and the Mayor of Youngstown are
committed to fostering development,
land use, infrastructure, public procurement, and investment policies
that promote environmental sustainability and the adoption and use of
advanced and renewable sources of
energy; and
Whereas, the Mayor of Cleveland
and the Mayor of Youngstown are
convinced the future well-being of
Northeast Ohio will depend on increased,
heightened,
and
more
sophisticated forms of cooperation
and coordination among local governments, civic institutions, and the
State of Ohio; and
Whereas, the Mayor of Cleveland
and
the
Mayor
of
Youngstown
agree, among other things, that the
expansion of their city’s respective
water
systems
will
inescapably
impact the pace and nature of
regional development patterns and
the environment of the Lake Erie
and Ohio River watersheds; and
Whereas, the Mayor of Cleveland
and the Mayor of Youngstown desire

796

April 23, 2008
to undertake certain joint activities,
including but not limited to economic development protocols, joint
public policy advocacy, coordinated
approaches to water system expansions, and ongoing mechanisms for
sharing best practices; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Mayor is
authorized to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”)
with the Mayor of the City of
Youngstown relating to economic
issues and concerns shared by both
the cities of Cleveland and Youngstown. The MOU shall be substantially in the following form and
once executed by all parties, the
Mayor shall transmit copies of the
signed MOU and any modifications
made thereafter, to the President
and Clerk of Council:
Memorandum of Understanding
Between
The Mayor of the City of Cleveland
And
The Mayor of the City of Youngstown
This Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) is entered into as of
the ____ day of _________________,
2008, by and between the Mayor of
the City of Cleveland and the Mayor
of the City of Youngstown to
advance the mutual well-being and
interests of their respective cities as
they strive to overcome challenges
related to slow economic growth,
loss of large manufacturing, and
diminishing population and as they
join with other Northeast Ohio leaders to affirm the essential connection between the fortunes of urban
centers and the competitiveness of
Northeast Ohio.
RECITALS
1. Whereas, the Mayor of Cleveland and the Mayor of Youngstown
recognize – indeed celebrate – the
considerable
physical,
economic,
and cultural attributes that set their
cities apart from suburban counterparts but offer a foundation for the
economic well-being of the region
and the state. Those competitive
advantages include centrality to
large and diverse markets, the selfevident attraction of mature waterfronts, well-endowed and internationally recognized cultural institutions and offerings, energetic centers of learning and research, extremely well developed multi-modal
transportation networks, significant
regional employment centers (despite weak economies), culturally
and racially diverse populations,
and authentic livable urban neighborhoods that are in demand by
people and companies throughout
the world.
2. Whereas, the Mayor of Cleveland and the Mayor of Youngstown
ardently believe their cities are and

April 23, 2008
will continue to capitalize on existing assets to become global centers
of excellence in the health care,
bio-science, electronics, polymer, advanced manufacturing, product design, construction, advanced energy, and other growing economic
sectors.
3. Whereas, the Mayor of Cleveland and the Mayor of Youngstown
are committed to fostering development, land use, infrastructure, public procurement, and investment
policies that promote environmental
sustainability and the adoption and
use of advanced and renewable
sources of energy.
4. Whereas, the Mayor of Cleveland and the Mayor of Youngstown
are convinced the future well-being
of Northeast Ohio will depend on
increased, heightened, and more
sophisticated forms of cooperation
and coordination among local governments, civic institutions, and the
State of Ohio. To be competitive,
Northeast Ohio will need to find
ways
to
eliminate
inefficiencies
inherent in the burgeoning number
of political jurisdictions, the overinvestment in new and often redundant
public
infrastructure,
and
wasteful land use practices.
5. Whereas, the Mayor of the
Cleveland and the Mayor of Youngstown share profound conviction that
the most important and underutilized regional resources are found in
the inherent skills, talents, and creativity of all Northeast Ohioans and,
hence, submit that equitable access
to
quality
education,
vocational
training, healthy environments, and
livable neighborhoods are of paramount consequence to the future of
the region.
6. Whereas, the Mayor of Cleveland and the Mayor of Youngstown
agree that the expansion of their
city’s respective water systems will
inescapably impact the pace and
nature of regional development patterns and the environment of the
Lake Erie and Ohio River watersheds.
7. Whereas, the Mayor of Cleveland and the Mayor of Youngstown
desire to undertake certain joint
activities, including but not limited
to economic development protocols,
joint public policy advocacy, coordinated approaches to water system
expansions, and ongoing mechanisms for sharing best practices.
NOW, THEREFORE, the Mayor of
Cleveland
and
the
Mayor
of
Youngstown agree as follows:
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
PROTOCOLS
1. Limitation on the use of tax
Abatements; allowable incentives.
(a) Real Estate Tax Abatements.
The parties agree that for any business relocating between Cleveland
and Youngstown there shall be a
limit on any new industrial or commercial real estate tax abatement to
a term not to exceed 10 years. The
abatement shall not exceed 75 percent.
(b) Income Tax Abatements. The
parties agree that they shall not
provide any income tax abatement

The City Record
to any businesses relocating between Cleveland and Youngstown.
(c) Allowable Incentives. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b), as stated above,
the parties may continue to offer
incentives including, but not limited
to, the discounted sale of property,
low-interest loans, and tax increment financing. The limitations provided in subsections (a) and (b), as
stated above, shall not apply to business relocations from outside the
territorial boundaries of the City of
Cleveland
or
the
City
of
Youngstown.
2. Income tax sharing for business
relocations from the City of Cleveland to the City of Youngstown or
from the City of Youngstown to the
City of Cleveland.
(a) The parties agree that if any
business with an annual gross payroll of more than $500,000 relocates
from the City of Cleveland to the
City of Youngstown or from the
City of Youngstown to the City of
Cleveland, the city losing the business shall be entitled to receive
from the city gaining the business,
for a period of 5 years, 50 percent
of future income tax revenue based
upon payroll in existence immediately prior to the relocation. However, if the business ceases operations prior to the conclusion of the
5 year period, the entitlement to
shared income tax revenue shall
also cease. The 50% share for the
city gaining the business shall be
calculated based upon that city’s
employment-based tax rate as may
be amended from time to time,
minus the percentage that may be
earmarked for that city’s school district pursuant to city ordinance.
The 5-year income tax sharing
obligation for the city gaining the
business is a continuing obligation
that shall survive the termination
of this Agreement.
(b) The 5-year tax sharing obligation may be earlier terminated or
reduced if the city losing the business “backfills” space at the same
payroll value with a similar business, as follows: (i) The business
that moved jobs adds equivalent
new payroll anywhere in the jurisdiction of the city losing the business; and (ii) If the moving business replaces part of the vacated
space with new jobs and payroll, the
aggregate employment-based income
tax paid to the city losing the business will be deducted from this tax
sharing obligation. Upon becoming
aware
that
“backfilling”
has
occurred, the city losing the business shall provide the city gaining
the business with written notice
within 30 days.
3. Joint Economic Development
Activities.
The parties agree to instruct their
respective
economic
development
personnel to work in tandem on various initiatives, including but not
limited to efforts to productively
redevelop abandoned and contaminated industrial sites, to promote
the development of a life sciences
research corridor from Cleveland to

797

25
Pittsburgh, and to market available
commercial space to national and
international companies.
PUBLIC POLICY ADVOCACY
The parties agree to instruct their
respective personnel to work with
counterparts of the other city to
fashion and act on public policy initiatives in the following areas:
1. Regional Infrastructure and
Land Use.
(a) Press the Ohio Department of
Transportation to adopt a “fix it
first” approach to allocating scarce
resources for major highway, road,
utility, and bridge projects. The new
policy would deemphasize funding
for new highway and interchange
improvements that encourage the
outflow of population and commerce
to undeveloped areas of the region.
Instead, a “fix it first” policy would
give preference to repairing and
upgrading extant highways, roads,
bridges, and utility systems in fullybuilt communities.
(b) Encourage the expansion of
state and federal programs that provide
incentives,
including
direct
grants and expedited remediation
certifications, for the redevelopment
of
large
marketable
abandoned
“Brownfield” sites.
2. Education Reform
(a) Work to establish a regional
“Education Cooperative” among multiple independent school districts in
Northeast Ohio as a vehicle for
achieving cost savings through collective purchasing programs and for
sharing information and resources
related to curriculum reform, technology, professional development for
teachers and administrators, and
constructive relationships with colleges and universities.
(b) Encourage increased appropriations by state and federal governments for vocational education
(especially in sectors where skilled
labor shortages threaten competitiveness, like advanced manufacturing, health care, construction, and
financial services).
(c) Encourage state and federal
support for universal pre-school programs.
3. Economic Development Incentives
(a) Encourage State of Ohio to
fortify economic development incentives that focus explicitly on reinvigorating cities.
Ohio should be
encouraged to make direct investments that leverage private investments – not unlike the discontinued
Urban Development Action Grant
program of the federal government
– and maximize the preservation of
the urban fabric.
(b) Support continuation and expansion of the CleanOhio Fund, a
proven State program for redeveloping environmentally contaminated
properties.
(c) Support continuation of the
recently enacted State Historic Tax
Credit program as an effective
mechanism for leveraging private
investments in the restoration of
historic properties.

26
4. Public Health
(a) Encourage the State of Ohio
to establish an ongoing funding
mechanism tied to House Bill 248, a
measure that authorizes funding of
local lead paint abatement programs.
(b) Support a statewide plan to
provide the opportunity for health
insurance for all Ohio residents. A
state plan would have private and
public solutions and may in some
cases directly provide insurance for
underserved residents through existing federal and other programs, and
in other cases would allow for the
purchase of private insurance coverage for those able to pay.
(c) Urge the Ohio Department of
Education to establish regulations
to ensure that healthy foods and
beverages are provided to students
in public schools. Also, encourage
the State to set rigorous standards
and funding to support healthy
physical education programs in public schools.
5. Public Safety
(a) Work with state and federal
authorities to establish more robust
programs and funding for programs
that combat criminal conspiracies
responsible
for
the
drug
and
weapons trafficking cartels that
feast on and ultimately undermine
communities.
(b) Work with State of Ohio to
formulate stronger programs for
supporting the reentry of ex-offenders to their communities of origin.
6. Neighborhood Development
(a) Support modifications of state
rules for allocating Low Income
Housing Tax Credits that would
give preference to “green” housing
practices and to developments in
mixed income neighborhoods.
(b) Advocate for increased Federal funding of public housing initiatives – like Hope VI – that encourage the development of affordable housing in strong mixed use
communities.
(c) Join cities throughout Ohio to
urge the Ohio General Assembly and
the Governor to adopt changes in
state law that would result in expedited tax foreclosure processes for
abandoned unproductive properties.
(d) Work with the Strickland
Administration to implement regulatory
and
funding
reforms
that
enhance vacant property recovery
and redevelopment, including legislation that would establish “superlien” status for municipal demolition
and nuisance abatement expenses.
(e) Assess potential for legal
actions that seek redress to unprecedented harm caused by predatory lending to Cleveland, Youngstown, and other communities.
(f) Encourage the federal government
to
authorize
supplemental
CDBG funds to cities, like Cleveland
and Youngstown, which have been
plagued by unprecedented property
abandonment, nuisance abatement
expenditures, and compromised public
safety as a direct result of the profiteering by predatory lenders.
(g) Encourage State and Federal
Environmental Protection Agencies

The City Record
to adopt more reasonable air quality standards relating to residential
demolition activities directed toward
removing neighborhood slum and
blight.
7. Advanced Energy
(a) Encourage the PUCO to adopt
an Advanced Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS). An AEPS would obligate each retail seller of electricity
to derive 10% of its electricity from
advanced energy resources – such as
wind, biomass or solar power – by
2015 and 20% by 2020.
(b) Work with PUCO to create an
Advanced Energy Trading System
in Ohio through which qualified
advance energy generation or efficiency units could be traded in an
open market.
(c) Urge PUCO to adopt interconnection, net metering, and smart
metering regulations.
(d) Call on the State to provide
seed capital – through tax-exempt
bond financing and grants – to
assist the market in meeting AEPS
requirements.
WATER SYSTEM PROTOCOLS
The parties recognize the direct
relationship between the provision
of water services and the outflow of
population and investments from
cities respective inner-ring suburbs.
While the Youngstown and Cleveland systems are not now in direct
competition (the Youngstown system is restricted to the Ohio River
Watershed and the Cleveland system is restricted to the Great Lakes
Watershed), the parties agree to the
following principles:
1. Neither city will take actions
that would allow them to provide
water services to customers in the
other city’s service area or watershed.
2. Both cities will endeavor to
secure Joint Economic Development
Zone agreements with jurisdictions
within which they might expand and
those agreements will be structured
to encourage controlled growth and
the sharing of economic benefits.
3. Join together to encourage the
federal government to fully fund
mandated “combined sewer overflow
control projects” and to require
jurisdictions throughout Northeast
Ohio to adopt uniform wastewater
policies.
EXCHANGE OF BEST PRACTICES
The parties mutually acknowledge the contributions of both
cities to the practice of progressive
municipal governance and in particular to the field of urban redevelopment. In this spirit, the parties agree to:
1. Assign cabinet-level staff and
other personnel to participate in an
ongoing joint task group formed for
the purpose of guiding the implementation of this MOU and to sharing best practices, lessons learned,
and innovations. Among the topics
for future consideration by the task
group will be cooperative approaches to sharing operational costs with
other jurisdictions, efforts to produce internal operational efficiencies, and ways to accelerate the

798

April 23, 2008
development of a “Life Science Corridor” between Cleveland and Pittsburgh.
2. Jointly seek financial support
from the State of Ohio in furtherance of joint planning and information sharing activities.
This agreement may be modified
from time to time as deemed necessary and/or appropriate through the
mutual consent of both parties. This
agreement may be terminated at discretion by either party upon giving
90 days notification.
The parties have executed this
instrument as of the day and year
first written.
