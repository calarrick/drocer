Adopted June 9, 2008.
Effective June 16, 2008.

Res. No. 874-08.
By Council Members Pierce Scott

Res. No. 957-08.
By Council Members Pierce Scott,
Sweeney,
Brancatelli,
Westbrook,
Johnson, Turner, Zone, Brady, Keane,
Polensek, Mitchell, Cimperman, Conwell, Santiago, Kelley, Coats, White,
Cummins, Reed and Cleveland.
An emergency resolution urging
the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas to initiate an emergency
foreclosure moratorium to stay all
active and newly filed foreclosure
cases involving occupied residences
and continue to work with Council
and community organizations to
implement a comprehensive program
that strengthens distressed neighborhoods, calling upon the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas
to “fast track” the foreclosure process for abandoned residential properties in the manner established by
Magistrate Stephen M. Bucha III
and offering to the Court specific
recommendations that will protect
the borrower and the lender, as well
as the community and the housing
market, as developed in part by way
of a hearing to be conducted by the
Community and Economic Development Committee.
Whereas, vacant foreclosed properties often become a breeding
ground for crime and fires, and
require a disproportionate amount of
government maintenance, for securing
properties
against
criminal
activity, removal of garbage and
rodents, including elimination of
blight through demolition, all at a
cost to taxpayers; and
Whereas, vacant properties reduce
city tax revenue in three ways: they
are often tax delinquent; their low
value means they generate little in
taxes; and they depress property
values across an entire neighborhood; and

1240

June 18, 2008
Whereas, the citizens who live in
neighborhoods with many vacant
and
abandoned
properties
have
great difficulty obtaining homeowner’s insurance, mortgages and loans
for home improvements; and
Whereas, vacant properties degrade and devalue the quality of
life for remaining residents, isolating and weakening the neighborhood, and increasing the likelihood
that property values will continue to
decline, further abandonment will
set in and a recent study by
CWRU/NEO-CANDO indicates that
in the City of Cleveland properties
lose 70% of their value following
foreclosure; and
Whereas, the Cuyahoga County
Court of Common Pleas is to be congratulated for recognizing the debilitating impacts of the high number
of foreclosures in Cleveland’s neighborhoods; and
Whereas, the Court has recommended a systematic process under
it’s jurisdiction to achieve equitable
work-outs and to mitigate and to
reduce the number of home-owners
losing their homes through foreclosure by instituting a mediation program; and
Whereas, a moratorium on foreclosures
of
occupied
residences
would allow time to establish a system that would emphasis counseling
and mediation, with foreclosure as a
measure of last resort; and
Whereas, the Cuyahoga County
Court of Common Pleas is about to
establish a new process for additional outreach to those home-owners being foreclosed and to establish
a new process for pre-determining
mediation options to the effected
home-owner and a comprehensive
system would stabilize neighborhoods, reduce abandonment and protect both the borrowers and lenders;
and
Whereas, Cuyahoga County has
created a foreclosure counseling program that has thus far helped 2,251
homeowners avail foreclosure; and
Whereas, a study commissioned
by Cuyahoga County, conducted by
Cleveland
State
University,
has
found that HUD certified counselors
funded by the county have a 52%
success rate in adverting foreclosures; and
Whereas, various community based
organizations and Cleveland City
Council believe that the proposed
Court mediation program will operate best within a structured and stable process and the Cleveland City
Council
urge
that
the
process
include expanded opportunities for
home-owner counseling and representation; and
Whereas, the Cleveland City Council urge that the process for outreach and notification be improved
which would also include identification of foreclosed landlord properties so that tenants are advised of
rights and resources; and
Whereas,
the
Cleveland
City
Council urges the Court to proceed
with all due hast to consider the
concerns of the Cleveland City Council and other interested parties in
establishing a foreclosure time out
plan, and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,

June 18, 2008
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas to initiate an emergency
foreclosure moratorium to stay all
active and newly filed foreclosure
cases involving occupied residences
and continue to work with Council
and community organizations to
implement a comprehensive program
that strengthens distressed neighborhoods.
Section 2. That this Council calls
upon the Cuyahoga County Court of
Common Pleas to “fast track” the
foreclosure process for abandoned
residential properties in the manner
established by Magistrate Stephen
M. Bucha III.
Section 3. That this Council will
offer to the Court specific recommendations that will protect the borrower and the lender, as well as the
community and the housing market,
as developed in part by way of a
hearing to be conducted by the Community and Economic Development
Committee.
Section 4. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Eileen
Gallagher, Judge, Cuyahoga County
Court of Common Pleas, Stephen M.
Bucha III, Chief Magistrate.
Section 5. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted June 9, 2008.
Effective June 16, 2008.

Res. No. 958-08.
By Council Members Santiago, Pierce
Scott,
Kelley,
Brancatelli,
Westbrook, Reed, Mitchell, Coats, Conwell, Sweeney, Brady, Turner, Cummins, Keane, Polensek, Zone and
White.
An emergency resolution urging
the National Credit Union Administration, the Federal Reserve Board
and the Office of Thrift Supervision
to adopt the reforms proposed for
the Federal Trade Commission Act,
Truth in Savings Act, and Truth in
Lending Act to protect consumers
from unfair and abusive practices
by the credit card industry.
Whereas, many responsible consumers are being harmed by a growing number of fees, penalties and
interest charges attached to bill payments and credit card debts; and
Whereas, the home foreclosure crisis serves as a daily reminder of the
need for responsible federal regulation to protect citizens from unfair
or predatory business practices; and
Whereas, the proposal from the
National Credit Union Administration, the Federal Reserve Board and
the Office of Thrift Supervision will
help consumers in our community
avoid
excess
fees
and
unfair
charges that put their personal
financial stability in jeopardy; and
Whereas, the proposed regulations
will put an end to business practices

The City Record
that only serve to increase the
amount of interest and fees that are
owed and trap more consumers in a
cycle of debt; and
Whereas, the proposed regulations
will help to provide responsible consumers with greater peace of mind
that the terms they agreed to when
they
opened
their
credit
card
accounts will not be changed unexpectedly or without their knowledge; and
Whereas, through the adoption of
these principles, the National Credit
Union Administration, the Federal
Reserve Board and the Office of
Thrift Supervision will help to protect our community’s quality of life
by preventing financial hardship
and lessening the demands on our
local social-service providers for
help; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the National Credit Union Administration, the Federal Reserve Board
and the Office of Thrift Supervision to adopt the reforms proposed
for the Federal Trade Commission
Act, Truth in Savings Act, and
Truth in Lending Act to protect
consumers from unfair and abusive
practices by the credit card industry.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to the
National Credit Union Administration, the Federal Reserve Board
and the Office of Thrift Supervision
and the members of Ohio’s Congressional delegation through the
office of Ohio Treasurer Richard
Cordray.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Revitalization grant application to
the Ohio Department of Development and supporting the loan application of Shaker Associates, LLC to
the Cuyahoga County Brownfield
Development Fund for the redevelopment of 1966 East 66th Street in
Ward 5.
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports the Cuyahoga County’s

By Council Members Reed, Santiago, Polensek, Pierce Scott, Mitchell,
Cleveland, Cummins and Conwell.
An emergency resolution urging
the Jackson Administration to convene, along with the Council, to
study whether City workers, excluding safety forces, should go to a
four-day, 40-hour work week.
Whereas, U.S. oil and natural gas
production have peaked and are
now in decline, ensuring our nation’s continued and growing dependence on oil and natural gas imported from politically unstable regions;
and
Whereas, a growing body of energy industry experts believe that the
world has already arrived at, or will
soon arrive at, the peak of global
oil production, which will be followed by an inevitable decline in
available supply thereafter; and
Whereas, global demand for oil
and natural gas continue to increase; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
and its citizens and businesses
depend on oil and natural gas for
their economic welfare and their
most critical activities, including
transportation and food supply; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland is
committed to sustainability and its
indicators of community well-being:
economic vitality, environmental health
and social equity; and
Whereas, reducing the work week
from 5 days to 4 days would reduce
the use of cars, thereby reducing the
emissions of carbon dioxide; and
Whereas, reducing the work week
from 5 days to 4 days would reduce
the energy used in city hall when
open and would reduce the fuel used
by city workers when on the job in
vehicles; and
Whereas, reducing the work week
from 5 days to 4 days would allow
employees to pay less for child care,
because they would need child care
only four days per week, not five;
and

Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of

Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

Res. No. 964-08.
By Council Members Zone, Cummins and Brady.
An emergency resolution calling
upon the Jackson Administration to
work with this Council and convene
a working group that will assess
Cleveland’s exposure to diminishing
supplies of oil and natural gas and
make recommendations to address
vulnerabilities.
Whereas, global reserves of oil
and natural gas are finite and sufficient substitutes are unlikely to be
available in the immediate future;
and
Whereas, U.S. oil and natural gas
production have peaked and are now
in decline, ensuring our nation’s continued and growing dependence on
oil and natural gas imported from
politically unstable regions; and
Whereas, a growing body of energy industry experts believe that the
world has already arrived at, or will
soon arrive at, the peak of global
oil production, which will be followed by an inevitable decline in
available supply thereafter; and
Whereas, global demand for oil
and natural gas continue to increase; and
Whereas, following the global
peaks of oil and natural gas production, the interaction of decreasing supply and increased demand
will cause the price of oil and natural gas to become more volatile;
and
Whereas, the United States Department of Energy’s National Energy Technology Laboratory has stated that, “The problems associated
with world oil production peaking
will not be temporary, and past
‘energy crisis’ experience will provide relatively little guidance. The
challenge of oil peaking deserves
immediate, serious attention, if risks
are to be fully understood and mitigation begun on a timely basis”;
and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
and its citizens and businesses
depend on oil and natural gas for
their economic welfare and their
most critical activities, including
transportation and food supply; and
Whereas, a large majority of
money spent on fossil fuels leaves
Ohio and provides no local economic
benefit, while many of the solutions
to lessening dependence on fossil

The City Record
fuels may result in local jobs and
substantial economic benefits; and
Whereas, Cleveland residents and
businesses are not currently aware
of the full implications of an impending decline and will greatly
benefit from an objective source of
information on this topic; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
should work to adopt a Local Action
Plan On Global Warming, the success of which depends upon reducing carbon dioxide emissions from
burning fossil fuels; and
Whereas, the Cities of Portland,
Oregon; San Francisco and Oakland,
California; Austin, Texas; among
other cities have convened task
forces to examine the effect on
cities of diminishing supplies of oil
and natural gas; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland’s
working group should include members from the City’s the Office of
Sustainability, Departments of Public Utilities, Finance, Public Service,
City
Planning
and
Health
and
should seek technical assistance
from the Ohio Departments of Energy and Transportation and any
other applicable local, state and federal
entities;
further,
it
should
include
members
representing
a
broad range of community and business interests; and
Whereas, among other things this
working group should convene:
1. To acquire and study current
and credible data and information
on the issues of peak oil and natural gas production and the related
economic and other societal consequences;
2. To seek community and business input on the impacts and proposed solutions;
3. To develop recommendations to
City Council in this calendar year
on strategies the City and its
Departments can take to mitigate
the impacts of declining energy supplies in areas including, but not limited to: transportation, business and
home energy use, water, food security, health care, communications,
land use planning, and wastewater
treatment; and
4. To propose methods of educating the public about this issue in
order to create positive behavior
change among businesses and residents that reduce dependence on fossil fuels.
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council calls
upon the Jackson Administration to
work with this Council and convene
a working group that will assess
Cleveland’s exposure to diminishing
supplies of oil and natural gas and
make recommendations to address

Section 2. That this resolution is

Res. No. 965-08.
By Council Member Keane.
An emergency resolution objecting to the transfer of ownership of
a C1 and C2 Liquor Permit to 4075
Rocky River Drive.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Department of Liquor
Control of an application for the
transfer of ownership of a C1 and
C2 Liquor Permit from Raja International, Inc., DBA 7-Eleven Food
Store #56, 4075 Rocky River Drive,
Cleveland, Ohio 44135, Permanent
Number 7178802 to Handee Marts,
Inc., DBA 7 Eleven #56, 4075 Rocky
River Drive, Cleveland, Ohio 44135,
Permanent Number 35665300190; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of
notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby record its objection to the transfer of ownership of a C1 and C2
Liquor Permit from Raja International, Inc., DBA 7-Eleven Food
Store #56, 4075 Rocky River Drive,
Cleveland, Ohio 44135, Permanent
Number 7178802 to Handee Marts,
Inc., DBA 7 Eleven #56, 4075 Rocky
River Drive, Cleveland, Ohio 44135,
Permanent Number 35665300190; and
requests the Director of Liquor Control to set a hearing for said application in accordance with provisions
of Section 4303.26 of the Revised
Code of Ohio.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she is hereby directed to
transmit two certified copies of this
resolution, together with two copies

(a) Purpose. The requirements for
bicycle parking are established for
the purpose of ensuring adequate
and safe facilities to accommodate
bicycle parking and to encourage
use of bicycles for travel as an
alternative to use of automobiles.
(b) Applicability. Bicycle parking
facilities shall be provided in every
new
automobile
parking
lot
or
garage, and for every expansion of
an automobile parking lot or garage
when the expansion includes the
provision of ten (10) or more additional automobile parking spaces.
(c) Number of Bicycle Parking
Spaces. Unless otherwise expressly
stated, bicycle parking spaces shall
be provided at a rate of one (1)
bicycle parking space for each twenty (20) automobile spaces provided.
(1)
Maximum.
No
automobile
parking lot or garage shall be
required to provide more than twenty-four (24) bicycle parking spaces.
(2) Variances. When the number
of
required
automobile
parking
spaces for a new or expanded use is
reduced by means of a zoning variance, the number of required bicycle spaces shall be calculated on the
basis of the number of automobile
parking spaces required had the
variance not been granted, unless a
variance also is granted to reduce
the number of required bicycle parking spaces.
(d) Substitution for Automobile
Spaces. The total number of required automobile off-street parking
spaces required under this Zoning

that it serves unless it is determined
by either the Director of Building
and Housing or the Director of City
Planning that a location on another
property or in the public right-of
way represents the only feasible
means of meeting the requirement

June 18, 2008
erly adjusted occupant restraining
device
in
violation
of
division
(B)(2) of this section shall not be
considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of
negligence or contributory negligence. But, the trier of fact may
determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio Rules
of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the
tort action and may diminish a
recovery of compensatory damages
that represents noneconomic loss, as
defined in Section 2307.011 of the
Revised Code, in a tort action that
could have been recovered but for
the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of
the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device. Evidence of that failure shall

than a prosecution for a violation of
this section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal
action involving the person other
than a prosecution for a violation of
this section.

involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices,
any occupant of the passenger car
who sustained injury or death was
not wearing an available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing
all of the available elements of such
a device or was not wearing such a
device as properly adjusted, then,
consistent with the rules of evidence, the fact that such occupant
was not wearing the available occupant restraining device, was not
wearing all of the available elements of such a device or was not
wearing such a device as properly
adjusted is admissible in evidence
in relation to any claim for relief in
a tort action to the extent that the
claim for relief satisfies all of the
following:
A. It seeks to recover damages for
injury or death to such occupant;
B. The defendant in question is
the manufacturer, designer, distributor or seller of the passenger car;

defendant in question is that the
injury or death sustained by such
occupant was enhanced or aggravated by some design defect in the
passenger car or that the passenger
car was not crashworthy.
(g)
Whoever
violates
division
(b)(1) of this section shall be fined
thirty dollars ($30.00).
(h)
Whoever
violates
division
(b)(3) of this section shall be fined
twenty dollars ($20.00).
(i) Except as otherwise provided
in this section, whoever violates
division (b)(4) of this section is
guilty of a minor misdemeanor on a
first offense; on a second or subsequent offense such person is guilty
of a misdemeanor of the third
degree. (RC4513.263)
