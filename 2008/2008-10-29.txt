An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Port Control
to enter into a requirement contract without competitive bidding
with Old World Industries, Inc. for
liquid deicer, potassium acetate, for
the various divisions of the Department of Port Control, for a period
concurrent with the term of Contract No. 67616 with Cryotech Deicing Technology, a division of General Atomics International Services

2061

19
Whereas, under Ordinance No. 98507, passed July 11, 2007, and Board
of Control Resolution No. 576-07,
adopted October 24, 2007, this Council authorized the Director of Port
Control to enter into Requirement
Contract No. 67616 with Cryotech
Deicing Technology, a division of
General Atomics International Services Corp., (“Cryotech”) to provide
liquid
deicer,
potassium
acetate
(“PA”), for the various divisions of
the Department of Port Control, for
a period of two years, with two oneyear options to renew, beginning
December 4, 2007; and
Whereas, due to a miners’ strike
in Canada affecting the supply of
the main chemical component needed to make PA, Cryotech is unable
to deliver the deicing chemical
under Contract No. 67616, until the
strike is resolved; and
Whereas, for airport operational
and safety reasons and because the
City is federally required to maintain
all taxiways, runways, and ramps
free of snow and ice accumulations
using FAA and Ohio EPA-approved
materials and methods, the City
must obtain PA from another source
while Cryotech is unable to deliver
it; and

Control desires to enter into an
agreement with Old World Industries, Inc. to supply PA until the
miners’ strike rendering Cryotech
unable to provide the chemical
under Contract No. 67616 is resolved and at any time during the
Cryotech contract term, including
any optional renewal years or
extensions, that Cryotech is unable
or delayed to supply Port Control’s
requirements for PA due solely to
the causes beyond its control, as
expressly provided in Contract No.
67616; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,

the City of Cleveland:

1.
That
this
Council
determines

emergency
exists being the need to obtain PA
deicing chemical for airport operations and safety during winter
weather and that liquid deicing
chemical,
potassium
acetate
(“PA”), cannot be secured with
assurance from any source other
than Old World Industries, Inc.
Therefore, any provisions of the
Charter and the Codified Ordinances to the contrary notwithstanding, the Director of Port Control is authorized to make a written requirement contract with Old
World Industries, Inc. for a term
coterminous with the term of Contract No. 67616 with Cryotech Deicing Technology, a division of General Atomics International Services
Corp., as it may be extended by
exercise of any renewal options or
by the Director’s grant of one or
more extension days under the General Conditions of the Cryotech contract, for the Department of Port

20
Control’s requirements for PA, to
be purchased by the Commissioner
of Purchases and Supplies on a
unit basis, for the various divisions
of the Department of Port Control,
only until the strike disabling Cryotech from supplying PA is resolved or at any later time during
the term that Cryotech is delayed
in
contract
performance
by
a
cause beyond its control, as expressly provided under Contract
No. 67616.
Section 2. That the costs of the
contract authorized in Section 1
shall be charged against the proper appropriation accounts and the
Director of Finance shall certify
the amount of the initial purchase,
