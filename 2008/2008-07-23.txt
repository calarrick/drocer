ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS AND ORDINANCES

REPRINT
Ord. No. 961-08.
By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting new Sections 698A.01 and 698A.99, relating to outdoor sales of tickets of admission to sporting and other events and the
establishment of exclusion and permissive zones for that activity and penalty; and to amend Section 698.06 as
enacted by Ordinance No. 1290-A-43, passed October 22, 1945, relating to ticket brokers.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are supplemented by enacting new Sections
698A.01 and 698A.99 to read as follows:
CHAPTER 698A
OUTDOOR SALES OF TICKETS OF ADMISSION TO SPORTING EVENTS AND OTHER EVENTS
Section 698A.01
Outdoor Sales of Tickets of Admission to Sporting Events and Other Events Restricted;
Penalty
(a) Findings. The activities of vendors of tickets of admission to sporting events and other events in and near
the Central Business District has caused inconvenience and annoyance to persons on their way to the events or
patronizing restaurants and other businesses in the vicinity of the events. At times, pedestrians encounter a gauntlet of ticket vendors employing aggressive sales tactics, or witness sidewalk turf disputes among ticket vendors
that sometimes escalate to physical altercations. The time, place and manner restrictions imposed by this section
are narrowly tailored to respond to this matter of public and governmental interest.
(b) Offense. No person who possesses a ticket or tickets of admission to a sporting event, theater, show or
other event shall, after first being warned by a law enforcement officer to desist, sell, hawk, peddle, display for
sale or solicit another to purchase the ticket or tickets outdoors within the zone identified in division (c) of this
section, except the parts of the zone designated as permissive ticket sales areas, for a period of six hours before
or during any event at the Cleveland State University Convocation Center or Gateway complex or the event regardless of venue to which the ticket or tickets pertain.
(c) Ticket Zone Established. The zone referred to in division (b) of this section and the permissive ticket sales
areas within the zone are shown on the map and set forth by legal description both contained in File No. 96108-A. The Director of Public Safety may, through the issuance of a regulation, modify the boundaries or placement of the zone or permissive ticket sales areas as set forth in the file if the Director determines that such
changes are needed to advance the purposes of this legislation as stated in division (a). Any such regulation
shall take effect fourteen days after its publication in the City Record.
The Director of Public Safety may cause signs to be posted to apprise persons of the existence of the zone and
permissive ticket sales areas established by this section, but the absence of signs or any deficiency of signs shall
not constitute a defense to division (b) of this section provided that the offender, in accordance with division
(b), has first been warned by a law enforcement officer to desist from the proscribed conduct.
Section 698A.99 Penalty
Whoever violates division (b) of Section 698A.01 is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on the first offense, a misdemeanor of the fourth degree on the second offense, and a misdemeanor of the second degree on the third and
any subsequent offense.
Section 2. That Section 698.06, as enacted by Ordinance No. 1290-A-43, passed October 22, 1945, is amended to
read as follows:
Section 698.06 Operating Regulations
The Commissioner of Assessments and Licenses, and any person or persons designated by him, and every police
officer shall enforce the following regulations:
(a) There shall be conspicuously posted and at all times displayed prominently at the location licensed, a price
list showing the price charged by the person, firm or corporation owning, operating or controlling the theater,
place of amusement or entertainment, or the place where the public exhibition, game, contest or performance for
which a ticket is being sold by such licensee, together with the price being charged by such licensee for the
resale of such ticket so that all persons visiting such place may readily see the same. The licensee shall also
on request, furnish each purchaser of a ticket with a receipt showing the same information.
(b) No licensee shall pay to any officer or employee of any theater or place of amusement or entertainment or
other place where public exhibitions, games, contests or performances are held, or to any producer or manager
or employee of any theatrical or other exhibition or theatrical company, any commission, gratuity or bonus in
connection with the sale, delivery or payment of tickets or in connection with the business being done by such
licensee in tickets of admission to such places.
Section 3. That existing Section 698.06, as enacted by Ordinance No. 1290-A-43, passed October 22, 1945, is repealed.
Section 4. That the map and legal description contained in the legislative file referenced in division (c) of
Section 698A.01 shall be published in the City Record along with the publication of the enacted version of this
ordinance.
Section 5. That this ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the affirmative
vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take effect and be in force immediately upon
its passage and approval by the Mayor; otherwise it shall take effect and be in force from and after the earliest
period allowed by law.
