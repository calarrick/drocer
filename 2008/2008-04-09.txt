and 457.11, as enacted by Ordinance
No. 1552-A-90, passed June 17, 1991,
to new “Section 457.11” and “Section
457.12”.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
supplemented by enacting new Sections 349.15 and 457.10 to read as follows:
Section 349.15 Bicycle Parking
(a) Purpose. The requirements for
bicycle parking are established for
the purpose of ensuring adequate
and safe facilities to accommodate
bicycle parking and to encourage
use of bicycles for travel as an
alternative to use of automobiles.
(b) Applicability. Bicycle parking
facilities shall be provided in every
new
automobile
parking
lot
or
garage, and for every expansion of
an automobile parking lot or garage
when the expansion includes the
provision of ten (10) or more additional automobile parking spaces.
(c) Number of Bicycle Parking
Spaces. Unless otherwise expressly
stated, bicycle parking spaces shall
be provided at a rate of one (1)
bicycle parking space for each twenty (20) automobile spaces provided.
Maximum.
No
automobile
(1)
parking lot or garage shall be
required to provide more than twenty-four (24) bicycle parking spaces.
(2) Variances. When the number
of
required
automobile
parking
spaces for a new or expanded use is
reduced by means of a zoning variance, the number of required bicycle spaces shall be calculated on the
basis of the number of automobile
parking spaces required had the
variance not been granted, unless a
variance also is granted to reduce

The City Record
the number of required bicycle parking spaces.
(d) Substitution for Automobile
Spaces. The total number of required automobile off-street parking
spaces required under this Zoning
Code shall be reduced at the ratio
of one (1) automobile off-street
parking space for each six (6) bicycle spaces provided. The total number of required automobile off-street
parking spaces, however, shall not
be reduced by more than five (5)
percent for any parking lot or
garage.

Required bicycle parking spaces for
nonresidential uses must have minimum dimensions of two (2) feet in
width by six (6) feet in length.
(f) Bicycle Parking Space LocaRequired
bicycle
parking
tion.
spaces shall be located at least as
close to the entrance of the building
as
the
nearest
non-handicapped
automobile parking space. Where
automobile parking is provided in
an enclosed area, bicycle parking
shall be provided within the enclosure or in such a way as to provide
comparable protection from the elements. Bicycle parking spaces shall
be located on the property of the use
that it serves unless it is determined
by either the Director of Building
and Housing or the Director of City
Planning that a location on another
property or in the public right-of
way represents the only feasible
means of meeting the requirement
for bicycle parking spaces. A location in the public right-of-way shall
be permitted only if such location
meets all requirements for issuance
of an Encroachment Permit.

lockers must be securely anchored
to the ground or a building. Bicycle
racks must provide a stable frame
to which the bicycle may be conveniently secured, such as the inverted-U, post and loop, or another type
of rack that meets these standards.
Bicycle racks that support the wheel
but not the frame of the bike may
not be used to fulfill a bicycle parking requirement. In parking lots and
parking garages, physical barriers,
such as posts or bollards, shall be
provided so as to prevent a motor
vehicle from striking a parked bicycle.
(2) Residential Uses. Neither bicycle racks nor bicycle lockers are
required for bicycle parking associated with residential uses. Required
bicycle parking for residential uses
may be provided in garages, storage
rooms, or any other resident-accessible, secure areas.

defined in Section 325.12 or as subsequently amended, regardless of
exemptions for automobile parking,

An emergency resolution opposing
S.B. 171, now in the Ohio House,
which prohibits Cleveland and other
Ohio municipalities, from regulating
the purchase or sale of scrap metal
by scrap metal dealers, directly in
conflict with a municipality’s Constitutional right to govern itself.
Whereas, the Ohio Senate has
passed S.B. 171, which purports to
establish uniform regulations on the
purchase or sale of scrap metal; and
Whereas, S.B. 171 was amended to
prohibit all municipal corporations
in Ohio from enacting or enforcing
its own regulations or ordinances
regulating scrap metal dealers and
the sale or purchase of scrap metal;
and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
has many vacant structures that are
vandalized for scrap metals, such as
copper and aluminum; and
Whereas, the Codified Ordinances
of the City of Cleveland provide for
the regulation of scrap metal dealers; and
Whereas, this Council anticipates
the need to enact stricter laws with
harsher penalties with respect to
sale and purchase of scrap metal;
and
Whereas, passage of S.B. 171 by
the Ohio House will deny the City
of Cleveland its right to enact and
enforce its own scrap metal regulations which are much better suited
to the very serious problem of sale
of stolen scrap metal in our city;
and
Whereas, the Ohio legislature has
found yet another way to deny the
City of Cleveland, and all other Ohio
municipalities, the right to local self
government; and

ten (10) years from the date electric service is initially provided. This Agreement shall continue in force thereafter at the rates and charges in the applicable standard rate schedule until canceled by thirty (30) days written notice given by either party.
