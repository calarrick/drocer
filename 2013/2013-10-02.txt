Boulevard; that the Mayor is authorized to file all papers and execute all
documents necessary to receive the
funds under the grant; and that the

An emergency resolution calling
upon the Ohio Legislature to include
sexual orientation and disability as
classifications under Revised Code
Section 2927.12, ethnic intimidation.
Whereas,
under
Ohio’s
ethnic
intimidation statute, Section 2927.12
of Revised Code, someone who commits a crime against another based
on the victim’s race, color, religion
or national origin will be charged
with an offense of the next higher
degree, and
Whereas, the Ohio ethnic intimidation statute does not include “sexual orientation” or “disability” as
classifications for which someone
committing a hate crime may be
charged for an offense of the next
higher degree; and

disabled and members of the lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transgender
communities occur with frightening
frequency in Ohio; and
Whereas, most recently here in
Cleveland, violence was committed

16
on two separate occasions in front
of the same bar noted for its gay
clientele; and
Whereas,
although
the
City
includes sexual orientation and disability in its ethnic intimidation
statute, the highest degree that a
violator can be charged is a first
degree misdemeanor; and
Whereas, the state should help to
protect the disabled and the LGBT
community and recognize that the
continuing violence against the disabled and the LGBT community are
hate crimes; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,

Assembly
to
