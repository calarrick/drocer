An emergency resolution declaring this Council’s support of Emerald Development & Economic Network, Inc.’s and Cleveland Housing
Network Inc.’s application to the
Ohio Housing Finance Agency for

the Emerald Alliance VIII Permanent Supportive Housing project.
Whereas, each year the Ohio
Housing Finance Agency allocates
low-income
housing
credits
for
affordable
housing
developments
throughout Ohio using a competitive
proposal process; and
Whereas, Permanent Supportive
Housing is a national model that
provides housing first, followed by
on-site support services that give
individuals the support needed to
achieve greater self-sufficiency and
to regain their places as productive
citizens in our community; and
Whereas, the Cleveland City Council has recognized the need to
encourage and support the development of Permanent Supportive Housing in the City; and
Whereas, the former Bridgeway,
Inc. administrative building at 8301
Detroit Avenue has been vacant
since April 2012, and the County
ADAMHS Board has high interest in
a new Permanent Supportive Housing
development
replacing
this
vacant structure in order to stabilize
the former Bridgeway, Inc. campus
on which the Board currently operates its Crisis Stabilization Unit;
Whereas, Emerald Alliance VIII

Res. No. 204-13.
By Council Members Westbrook,
Zone and Cummins.
An emergency resolution supporting the February 17, 2013 Forward
on Climate rally in Washington DC
and commending the efforts of the
Northeast Ohio Sierra Club Group,
the Sierra Club, 350.org, the Hip Hop
Caucus, and over one hundred other
organizations that have worked so
hard for the success of this event.
Whereas, the overwhelming majority of the world’s climate scientists
agree
that
human-caused
global
warming is real, is accelerating in
intensity, and presents a clear and
present danger to the climate stability of the planet and the wellbeing and future of our civilization;
and
Whereas, the United States and
other countries have witnessed an
increase in droughts, record breaking heat waves and unprecedented
storms such as Super Storm Sandy
which not only battered the East
Coast, but Cleveland as well; it is
clear that global warming is not a
distant possibility, but is a present
day reality; and
Whereas, global warming’s impacts are especially serious for poor
communities and communities of
color, making global warming a
social justice issue, as was seen in
Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the
great heat wave in Chicago in 1995;
and
Whereas, many of our Cleveland
neighborhoods are very similar to
those neighborhoods that suffered in
New Orleans and Chicago; and
Whereas, global warming is a
threat to the most basic of civil
rights — the right of people to live
and have a future on a habitable,
sustainable and healthy planet; and
Whereas,
Cleveland
has
made
great strides in becoming a Green
City on a Blue Lake, we recognize
that run-away global warming will
jeopardize everything our city has
accomplished in becoming an example of good environmental stewardship for the rest of the nation; and

14
Whereas, there has been a lack of
national political will and moral
leadership on the climate issue; and
Whereas, the Forward on Climate
rally in Washington DC will ensure
that the importance of taking action
on the vital issue of climate change
comes
to
the
attention
of
our
nation’s leaders; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the February 17, 2013 Forward
on Climate rally in Washington DC
and commends the efforts of the
Northeast Ohio Sierra Club Group,

Ohio Sierra Club Group.

hereby declared to be an emergency

shall take effect and be in force

Res. No. 212-13.
By Council Members Cimperman,
Westbrook and Zone.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Department of Health to
continue funding the AIDS Taskforce of Greater Cleveland in order
to keep services for Northeast Ohio
in local and trusted hands.
Whereas, the AIDS Taskforce of
Greater Cleveland (ATGC) has 30
years of experience in designing,
delivering,
and
administering
a
range of services to people living
with and affected by HIV/AIDS,
serving more than 1200 clients in
case management services alone;
and
Whereas, 38 ATGC staff members
with over 200 years of combined
experience and a turnover rate less
than a 1%, provide direct services,
nutrition, and prevention education
to clients; and
Whereas, ATGC programming relies upon a three-part approach
offered through 13 programs or ini-

258

February 20, 2013
tiatives: Support Services, Prevention
Education, and Public Policy/Advocacy, with the cornerstone being
intensive medical Case Management
Services; and
Whereas, the Taskforce serves as
a “one-stop shop” for non-medical
HIV services, including case management and client advocacy, housing, nutrition, transportation, individual and group counseling, access
to chemical dependency and recovery services, and social and recreational activities; and
Whereas, the ATGC’s ancillary
support services promote adherence
and provide social service supports,
which is proven to increase the
chance that patients will continue to
participate in HIV medical care over
time; and
Whereas, due to the current economic climate, increased needs, and
flat or diminishing resources, ATGC
finds itself looking toward stabilizing its financial future, after having
sustained itself through financial
challenges for 30 years through the
support of the community, staff dedication, individuals, foundations and
other funders; and
Whereas, the agency has taken
numerous steps to strengthen its
financial position, including reaching out to new partners to stabilize
and expand services; and
Whereas, the Ohio Department of
Health has steadily funded the
ATGC since the inception of the
Ryan White Part B program, and
has lauded its staff and service to
clients.
Whereas, ATCG’s case management funding from the Ohio Department of Health is at risk with intent
to shift these dollars to an organization outside of Northeast Ohio,
narrowing the field of service providers; and
Whereas, this shifting of dollars
will interrupt the continuity of service and will impact the quality of
life of clients by disrupting their
access to services, specifically: doctor appointments, medications, food,
and housing to name a few; and
Whereas, in addition, clients have
developed a long-standing relationship and trust with current case
management staff that are vital to
their physical and emotional wellbeing; and
Whereas, this Council urges the
Ohio Department of Health to continue funding the AIDS Taskforce of
Greater Cleveland in order to keep
services for Northeast Ohio in local
and trusted hands for the benefit of
Cleveland’s citizens; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council the
Ohio Department of Health to continue funding the AIDS Taskforce of
Greater Cleveland in order to keep
services for Northeast Ohio in local
and trusted hands.
