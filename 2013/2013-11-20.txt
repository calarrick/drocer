Ord. No. 1555-13.
By Council Members Cleveland,
Mitchell and Kelley (by departmental
request).
An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976 by enacting
new Sections 351.01 to 351.19 relating to riparian setbacks and wetlands setbacks; and to amend Section 327.99, as amended by Ordinance No. 899-06, passed August 16,
2006, relating to penalties under the
Zoning Code.
Whereas, flooding is a significant
threat to public health and safety
and public and private property in
the City of Cleveland, and riparian
areas and wetlands lessen flood
damage
by
holding
runoff
and
releasing it slowly over time; and,
Whereas, streambank erosion in
the City of Cleveland is a significant threat to public health and
safety and public and private property, and riparian areas and wetlands control runoff and reduces its
erosive force; and,
Whereas, insufficient control of
riparian areas and wetlands can
result in significant damage to
receiving water resources, impairing
the capacity of these resources to
sustain aquatic systems and their
associated aquatic life use designations; and,
Whereas, there is a regional effort
to reduce the flooding and erosion
and to protect water quality, riparian areas and wetlands and to pro-

1829

tect
and
enhance
the
water
resources of the City of Cleveland,
and the City of Cleveland recognizes
its obligation as a part of a watershed to reduce flooding and erosion
and to protect water quality by controlling runoff within its borders;
and,
Whereas, to promote public health
and safety and sound economic
development in the City of Cleveland, it is important to provide
homebuilders,
developers,
and
landowners with consistent, technically feasible, and operationally
practical standards for storm water
management; and,
Whereas, Ohio EPA has interpreted Permit No. OHQ00002, effective
January 30, 2009, Part II, §5 to
require
designated
communities,
including the City of Cleveland, to
develop a Storm Water Management
Program to address the quality of
storm water runoff during and after
soil disturbing activities through
the use of best management practices such as appropriate policies
and ordinances that provide requirements
and
standards
to
direct
growth to identified areas, protect
sensitive areas such as wetlands
and riparian areas, maintain and/or
increase open space, provide buffers
along sensitive water bodies, minimize impervious surfaces, and minimize disturbance of soils and vegetation; and,
Whereas, Article XVIII, Section 3
of the Ohio Constitution grants
municipalities the legal authority to
adopt rules to abate soil erosion and
water pollution by soil sediments;
and,
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
supplemented by enacting new Sections 351.01 to 351.19 to read as follows:
Chapter 351 Riparian
Setbacks and Wetlands Setbacks
Section 351.01 Purpose
(a) It is determined that the system
of wetlands, riparian areas, rivers,
streams, and other natural watercourses within the City contributes to
the health, safety, and general welfare of the residents. The specific purpose and intent of this chapter is to
regulate uses and developments within riparian and wetland areas for the
benefit of the City for the following
reasons:
(1) To establish consistent, technically feasible and operationally practical standards to achieve a level of
storm water quantity and quality control to minimize damage to public and
private property and degradation of
water resources from the impacts of
flooding, erosion and storm water pollution.
(2) To reduce flood impacts by
absorbing peak flows, slowing the
velocity of floodwaters, and regulating base flow.
(3) To reduce urban storm water
pollutants,
including
pollutants
already present in watercourses,
especially during periods of high
flows, through filtration, settlement,
and absorption and transformation of

10
those pollutants in the riparian and
wetland setback, before the pollutants enter watercourses.
(4) To reduce sediment pollution,
especially from erosion, by preventing unnecessary stripping of vegetation and loss of soil, especially adjacent to water resources and wetlands.
(5) To assist in stabilizing the
banks of watercourses to reduce bank
erosion and the downstream transport of sediments eroded from watercourse banks.
(6) To preserve to the maximum
extent practicable the value of the
natural drainage characteristics in
the City, including on building sites,
minimizing the need for costly engineering solutions to flooding and erosion problems such as the construction, repair, and replacement of
enclosed storm drain systems.
(7) To minimize encroachment on
wetlands and watercourse channels
and the need for costly engineering
solutions such as dams, retention
basins, and rip rap armoring, to protect structures and reduce property
damage and threats to the safety of
residents; and contribute to the scenic
beauty and environment of the City
preserving the character of the City,
the quality of life of the residents of
the City, and corresponding property
values.
(8) To reduce the need for costly
maintenance and repairs to roads,
embankments,
sewage
systems,
ditches, water resources, and wetlands, resulting from inadequate
storm water management due to the
loss of riparian areas and wetlands.
(9) To protect and maintain the
receiving water’s or wetland’s physical, chemical, and biological characteristics and, in turn, to maintain its
riparian or wetland functions, benefits and values.
(10) Provide habitat to a wide array
of aquatic organisms and wildlife,
including but not limited to many that
are on Ohio’s Endangered and/or
Threatened Species listings, by maintaining diverse and connected riparian and wetland vegetation.
(11) To reduce the long-term
expense of remedial projects and
maintenance projects needed to
address problems caused by inadequate storm water management and
control.
(b) The following regulations have
been enacted to protect the values,
services and benefits riparian and
wetland areas provide by establishing reasonable management and controls governing structures and uses
within a wetland setback and a riparian setback along designated watercourses in the City.

setback shall be extended to the outer
edge of the 100-year floodplain. The
100-year floodplain shall be defined
by FEMA and federal floodplain regulations and the City’s Flood Plain
Management Ordinances at Chapter
3167.
(4) Where a wetland is identified
within a minimum riparian setback,
the minimum riparian setback width
shall be extended to the outermost
boundary of the wetland. In addition,
wetlands shall be protected to the
extent detailed in these regulations.
(5) Wetlands shall be delineated by
a site survey approved by the City
using delineation protocols accepted
by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
and the Ohio EPA at the time an application is made under this regulation.
If a conflict exists between the delineation protocols of these two agencies, the delineation protocol that
results in the most inclusive area of
wetland shall apply. Any costs associated with reviewing these delineations may be assessed by the City to
the applicant.
(e) The applicant or his or her designated
representative
shall
be
responsible for delineating riparian
and wetland setbacks, including any
or
modifications
as
expansions
required by these regulations, and
identifying these setbacks on all
property subdivision/property/parcel
splits, commercial development or
other land development plans, and/or
building permit applications submitted to the City. This delineation may
be done by a metes and bounds, or
higher level survey and shall be subject to review and approval by the

1832

November 20, 2013
City. As a result of this review, the
City may consult with a representative of the local county SWCD or other
technical experts as necessary.
(f) Prior to any land clearing or soil
disturbing activity, riparian and wetland setbacks shall be clearly delineated on site by the applicant or his or
her designated representative, and
the delineation shall be maintained
throughout soil disturbing activities.
(g) No approvals or subdivision
plan approval, site plan approval, nor
land development plan approval shall
be issued by the City prior to on-site
delineation of riparian and wetland
setbacks in conformance with these
regulations. No building permits that
include land clearing or soil disturbing activities shall be issued by the
City prior to delineation of riparian
and wetland setbacks in conformance
with these regulations.
(h) Upon completion of an approved
property subdivision/property/parcel
split, land development, or other
improvement, riparian and wetland
setbacks shall be permanently recorded on the plat records of the City.
Section 351.06 Establishment of
Wetland Setbacks
Wetland setbacks are established
as follows:
(a) A minimum of 120 feet surrounding and including all Ohio EPA
Category 3 Wetlands, or current
equivalent Ohio EPA classification.
(b) A minimum of 75 feet surrounding and including all Ohio EPA Category 2 Wetlands, or current equivalent Ohio EPA classification.
Section 351.07 Procedure for Wetland Setbacks
(a) No change to parcel boundaries
or land use change:
(1) Upon filing a request for a
building permit that does not involve
changing of any parcel boundaries or
changes in land use, the applicant
will check for indicators of wetlands
on the National Wetlands Inventory
maps, and Ohio Wetlands Inventory
map, and the Cuyahoga County Wetlands Inventory (if applicable). A
photocopy of the applicable section of
each map will be attached to the permit application.
(2) If a potential wetland is shown
on any of the maps or if there is reason for the City to believe that an
unmapped wetland exists on or within 120 feet of the project site, the
applicant will retain a qualified wetland professional to evaluate the proposed project site for wetlands or wetland buffer areas under this chapter.
If no wetland or wetland buffer areas
are found, the applicant shall submit
a letter from the qualified wetland
professional with the preliminary
plat or permit application verifying
his or her negative findings.
(b) New residential or commercial
or other type development and projects involving a change to parcel
boundaries or a land use change:
Upon filing a request for approval
of a preliminary plat or building permit for new residential, commercial
or other type of development that
involves changes in any parcel boundaries or changes in land use, the applicant or his or her designated representative shall retain a qualified wetland professional to survey the proposed development site for wetlands.
If no wetlands are found, the applicant or his or her designated representative shall submit a letter with

November 20, 2013
the preliminary plat or permit application verifying that a qualified wetland professional has surveyed the
site and found no wetlands. If wetlands are found, the following procedures shall be followed:
(1) A qualified wetland professional, acceptable to the Director of Building and Housing, shall determine the
presence of Ohio EPA Category 2 or 3
wetlands (or current equivalent Ohio
EPA classification) on the proposed
development site using the latest version of the Ohio Rapid Assessment
Method
for
wetland
evaluation
approved at the time of application of
this regulation. Acceptance of this
determination shall be subject to
approval by the Director of Building
and Housing.
(2) If Ohio EPA Category 2 or 3 wetlands (or current equivalent Ohio
EPA classification) are located on
the proposed development site, the
applicant or his or her designated representative shall delineate these wetlands and the wetland setback in conformance with these regulations. The
applicant or his or her designated representative shall identify all delineated wetlands and their associated setbacks
on
all
property
subdivision/property/parcel
split
plans,
land
development
plans,
and/or permit applications submitted
to the City.
(c) Wetlands shall be delineated by
a site survey, approved by the City,
using delineation protocols accepted
by the US Army Corps of Engineers
and the Ohio EPA at the time of application of this regulation. If conflict
exists between the delineation protocols of these two agencies, the delineation protocol that results in the
most inclusive area of wetland shall
apply.
(d) Wetland setbacks shall be
delineated through a metes and
bounds, or higher level, survey subject to approval by the City.
(e) Prior to any soil or vegetation
disturbing activity, the applicant or
his or her designated representative
shall delineate wetland setbacks on
the development site in such a way
that they can be clearly viewed, and
such delineation shall be maintained
throughout construction.
(f) No approvals or permits shall be
issued by the City prior to delineation
of wetland setbacks in conformance
with this regulation.
(g)
Upon
completion
of
an
approved property subdivision/property/parcel split, commercial development or other land development or
improvement, riparian and wetland
setbacks shall be permanently recorded on the plat records for the City and
shall be maintained as open space
thereafter through a permanent conservation easement. A third party, not
the landowner or permittee or the
City, which is allowed by state law,
shall be given the conservation easement. If no third party will accept the
conservation easement, the City shall
accept it and protect it in perpetuity.
Section 351.08 Uses Permitted in
Riparian and Wetland Setbacks
(a) By-Right Uses Without A Permit: No use permitted under these regulations shall be construed as allowing public trespass on privately held
lands. Open space uses that are passive in character shall be permitted in
riparian
and
wetland
setbacks,
including the following:

The City Record
(1) Recreational Activity. Passive
recreational use activity, as otherwise legally permitted by federal,
state, and local laws, such as hiking,
swimming, fishing, hunting, picnicking, and similar uses.
(2) Removal of damaged or diseased trees and control of noxious
weeds if the control does not involve
drainage or fill.
(3) Revegetation and/or Reforestation. Riparian and wetland setbacks
may be revegetated, enhanced or
restored. Any revegetation must be
performed with non-invasive plant
species. Refer to the Ohio Invasive
Plant Species list created by the Ohio
Department of Natural Resources to
determine invasive plant species
undesirable for revegetation, reforestation, or restoration of riparian
areas.
(4) Conservation of soil, vegetation, water, fish, and wildlife consistent with the purposes of this chapter
that does not involve hydrologic modification or fill.
(5) Maintenance of lawns, gardens
and landscaping: Lawns, gardens and
landscaping that existed at the time
this chapter was enacted, may be
maintained as long as they are not
increased in size to further encroach
onto the riparian area, wetland or
watercourse. In that case, trees,
shrubbery and other non-lawn wood
vegetation in the riparian or wetland
setback must be maintained to the
extent practicable to reduce the
impact to the riparian area, wetland
or watercourse.
(b) By-Right Uses With A Permit:
(1) Streambank Stabilization and
Erosion Control Measures. Any activity not prohibited by the regulations
that also involves streambank stabilization and erosion control measures
may be performed in regulated areas
as long as it is conducted under the
standards and specifications in the
current edition of Ohio’s Rainwater
and Land Development manual or
other standards acceptable to Ohio
EPA.
(2) Crossings. Crossings of designated watercourses and through
riparian setbacks or wetland setbacks by publicly and privately
owned roads, drives, sewer and/or
water lines and public and private
utility transmission lines shall only
be allowed upon approval of a Crossing Plan by the Manager of Engineering and Construction. Such crossings
shall minimize disturbance in riparian setbacks, wetland setbacks, and
watercourse substrate and shall mitigate any necessary disturbances. Soil
erosive materials will not be used in
making stream crossings.
(3) Construction of Fencing. Construction of fencing shall be allowed
with the condition that reasonable
efforts be taken to minimize the
destruction of existing vegetation,
provided that the fence does not
impede stream or flood flow, and the
disturbed area is replanted to the natural or preexisting conditions before
the addition of the fence, as approved
by the Director of Building and Housing.
Section 351.09 Uses Prohibited in
Riparian and Wetland Setbacks
Any use not authorized under this
chapter shall be prohibited in riparian and wetland setbacks. By way of
example, the following uses are
specifically prohibited; however, prohibited uses are not limited to those
examples listed here:

1833

13
(a) Construction. There shall be no
structures of any kind.

shall be no drilling, filling, dredging,
or dumping of soil, spoils, liquid, or
solid materials, except for non-commercial composting of uncontaminated natural materials, and except as
permitted under this chapter.
(c) Roads or Driveways. There
shall be no roads or driveways permitted in riparian and/or wetland setback area, except as permitted under
this chapter.
(d) Motorized Vehicles. There shall
be no use of motorized vehicles,
except as permitted under this chapter.
(e) Disturbance of Natural Vegetation. There shall be no disturbance,
including mowing, of the natural vegetation, except for conservation maintenance necessary to control noxious
weeds; for plantings that are consistent with this regulation; for disturbances that are approved under this
chapter; and for the passive enjoyment, access, and maintenance of
landscaping or lawns existing at the
time of passage of this regulation as
provided in the chapter.
(f) Parking Lots. There shall be no
parking lots or other human-made
impervious cover, except as permitted
under this chapter.
(g) New Surface and/or Subsurface
Sewage Disposal or Treatment Areas.
Riparian and wetland setbacks shall
not be used for the disposal or treatment of sewage except under local
county Board of Health regulations in
effect at the time of application of
this regulation.
(h) Crossings. Crossings of designated riparian and wetland setbacks
by publicly and privately owned
sewer and/or water lines and small
public and small private utility transmission lines in accordance with a
permit or regulatory exemption
issued by, or under the regulations of,
the US Army Corps of Engineers and
the Ohio EPA.
(i) Other permits and approvals.
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as exempting any person from
obtaining other permits by other
agencies that may be required, including permits from the US Army Corps
of Engineers and/or the Ohio EPA
under the federal and state Clean
Water Acts.
351.10
Non-Conforming
Section
Structures or Uses in Riparian and
Wetland Setbacks
(a) A non-conforming use within a
riparian and wetland setback that is
in existence at the time of passage of
this regulation and that is not otherwise permitted under these regulations, may be continued. However, the
use shall not be changed or enlarged
unless it is changed to a use permitted
under these regulations.
(b) A non-conforming structure
within a riparian or wetland setback
that is in existence at the time of passage of this regulation and that is not
otherwise permitted under these regulations, may be continued, but shall
not have the existing building footprint
or
roofline
expanded
or
enlarged.
(c) A non-conforming structure or
use or deteriorated structure within a
riparian and wetland setback that is
in existence at the time of passage of
this regulation and that is discontinued, terminated, or abandoned for a
period of six (6) months or more, may

14
not be revived, restored, or re-established. This section shall not apply to
a structure that is vacant and that is
not subject to condemnation orders by
the Director of Building and Housing
unless the vacant structure has been
destroyed or damaged for more than
50% of its value by flooding, wind,
fire, or other natural or man-made
force. This section shall also not prohibit ordinary repairs to a residence
or residential accessory building that
are not in conflict with other provisions of this chapter.
(d) In the case of a non-conforming
structure within a riparian or wetland setback, the City will allow a ten
(10) foot maintenance access zone
measured perpendicular to the structure, to temporarily extend further
into the setback as long as disturbance to existing vegetation is minimized and vegetation is restored to
the pre-existing state, as near as practical, upon completion. If any soil disturbance in a wetland will occur as
part of any such maintenance activity, a permit from the U. S. Army Corps
of Engineers or the Ohio EPA, as
appropriate, must be submitted prior
to the onset of the soil disturbing
activity.
(e) In the case of a non-conforming
residential structure, the Director of
Building and Housing may allow
minor upgrades to the structure that
extend further into the riparian setback, such as awnings and pervious
decks/patios, provided the modifications do not extend more than ten (10)
feet further toward the watercourse
than the original foundation of the
structure existing at the time of passage of this regulation, and further
provided that the modification will
not impair the function of the riparian
zone or wetland nor destabilize any
slope nor stream bank, as determined
by the Director of Building and Housing.
Section 351.11 Variances within
Riparian and Wetland Setbacks
(a) The Board of Zoning Appeals
may grant a variance from this regulation as provided in these codified
ordinances. In determining whether
there is unnecessary hardship or practical difficulty to justify the granting
of a variance, the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall consider the potential
harm to, or reduction in the functions
of, the riparian area or wetland area
that may be caused by a proposed
structure or use.
(b) In making a variance determination, the Board of Zoning Appeals
shall consider the following:
(1) Varying the front, rear and side
yard setback before the riparian and
wetland setbacks are varied.
(2) Variances should not be granted for asphalt or concrete paving in
the riparian and wetland setbacks in
any situation where gravel or porous
pavement (i.e., porous pavers, and
similar products) will do the job.
(c) In making a variance determination, the Board of Zoning Appeals
may consider the following:
(1) A parcel existing at the time of
enactment of this chapter is made
unbuildable.
(2) The soil type and natural vegetation of the parcel, as well as the percentage of the parcel that is in the 100year floodplain. The standards and
criteria for granting variances in the
City’s Flood Plain Management Ordinances at Chapter 3167 may be used
as guidance.

The City Record
(3) The extent to which the requested variance impairs the flood control,
soil erosion control, sediment control,
water quality protection, ecological
functions, or other functions of the
riparian area or wetland area. This
determination shall be based on sufficient technical and scientific data.
(4) The degree of hardship with
respect to the use of the property or
the degree of practical difficulty with
respect to maintaining the setback as
established in this chapter placed on
the landowner, and the availability of
alternatives to the proposed structure
or use.
(5) Soil disturbing activities permitted in a riparian setback areas or
wetland setback areas through variances should be controlled in order to
minimize clearing to the maximum
extent possible, and must include
Best Management Practices necessary to minimize soil erosion and
maximize sediment control.
(6) The presence of significant
impervious cover, or smooth vegetation such as maintained lawns, in or
near the riparian setback areas or
wetland setback areas that compromises the benefits of the riparian setback areas or wetland setbacks areas
received by the City.
(7) Whether the benefit of reduction of storm water infiltration into
the soil in wetland areas will be lost.
(8) If the request is for an aboveground fence, whether it increases
the existing area of mowed grass or
lawn.
(9) Whether parking needs can be
modified before varying the riparian
setback.
(10) Whether the building shape,
size or design can be modified to
avoid or minimize intrusion into the
riparian setback.
(11) In the case of a lot made
unbuildable by this regulation, the
minimum variance needed to make it
buildable for an appropriately-sized
and compatibly-designed structure,
while following the guidance provided in this section.
(12) Whether the variance will
increase the likelihood of flood or erosion damage to either the applicant’s
property or to other properties.
(13) Culverting of watercourses
should be avoided.
(14) Whether the variance will
result in the need for artificial slope
or bank stabilization measures that
could interfere with the function of
the riparian or wetland zone.
Section 351.12 Mitigation
All riparian or wetland restoration,
creation and/or enhancement projects required under this chapter
either as a permit condition or as a
result of an enforcement action shall
follow a mitigation plan prepared by
a qualified professional and approved
by the Director of Building and Housing. The applicant or violator shall
receive written approval of the mitigation plan by the Director of Building and Housing prior to commencement of any wetland area restoration,
creation or enhancement activity. To
realize preservation goals, the City
will use the following methods of
riparian or wetland impact mitigation in order of preference:
(a) The applicant shall avoid all
impacts that degrade the functions
and value of the wetland. Unless otherwise provided in this chapter if
alteration to the area is unavoidable,
all adverse impacts to the area and

1834

November 20, 2013
associated buffer resulting from a
development proposal shall be mitigated under an approved wetland
report and an approved mitigation
plan.
(b) Mitigation shall be in-kind and
onsite, when possible, and sufficient
to maintain the functions and values
of the riparian/wetland area.
(c) Mitigation shall not be implemented until after the Director of
Building and Housing or his designated authority has approved the
appropriate wetland report and mitigation plan.
(d) Mitigation measures. Mitigation shall achieve equivalent or
greater biological and habitat functions as existed in wetland prior to
mitigation. Applicants shall demonstrate that all reasonable efforts have
been examined with the intent to
avoid and minimize impacts to these
areas. When an alteration is proposed, such alteration shall be avoided, minimized, or compensated for in
the following order of preference:
(1) Avoid impact altogether by not
taking a certain action or parts of an
action;
(2) Minimize impact by limiting the
degree or magnitude of the action by
project redesign, relocation, timing
changes, or technological applications;
(3) Rectifying the impacts to wetlands, frequently flooded areas, and
habitat conservation areas by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the
affected environment to conditions
equal to or higher quality than at the
time of initiation of the project;
(4) Restoring, replacing, or enhancing the wetland on site of the project;
(5) Restoring, replacing, or enhancing degraded riparian corridors/wetlands in the same sub-basin;
(6) Preserving high quality wetlands that are under eminent threat;
(7) Reduce or eliminate the impact
over time by prevention and maintenance operations during the life of
the actions;
(8) Compensate for the impact by
replacing, enhancing or providing
substitute resources or environments;
(9) All mitigation efforts will be
monitored and remedial action taken
if necessary
(10) Mitigation actions shall be conducted within the same sub-drainage
basin and on the impacted site.
Section 351.13 Monitoring Program
The mitigation plan shall include a
program for monitoring construction,
and for assessing a completed project
by a riparian corridor/wetland specialist. A protocol for the schedule of
monitoring and reporting shall be
implemented that verify the performance standards are being met. The
period of monitoring shall be adequate to verify that the performance
goals and objectives are being met
and will vary at the discretion of the
Director of Building and Housing, or
his designated authority. Monitoring
would never be less than three years.
Section 351.14 Financial Guarantees
The mitigation plan shall include
financial guarantees, if necessary, to
ensure that the mitigation plan is
fully implemented. The requirement
of financial guarantees is at the discretion of the Director of Building
and Housing based on the size, complexity, and cost of the mitigation
project. If financial guarantees are

November 20, 2013
required they shall be of sufficient
funding to ensure mitigation, maintenance, and monitoring.
Section 351.15 Boundary Interpretation and Appeals Procedure
Any applicant seeking a variance
to the regulations or criteria under
this chapter or any appeal of an
administrative order made under this
chapter may request the variance or
make an appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals. The following procedures shall apply:
(a) Before filing the request or
appeal, when an applicant or his or
her designated representative disputes the boundary of a riparian or
wetland setback or the ordinary high
water mark of a watercourse, the
applicant or his or her designated representative shall submit documentation to the Director of Building and
Housing which describes the boundary, the applicant’s proposed boundary, and justification for the proposed
boundary change.
(b) The Department of Building
and Housing shall evaluate this documentation and shall make a determination within sixty (60) days. If during this evaluation the Department of
Building and Housing requires further information, it may be required
of the applicant. In the event that the
Department of Building and Housing
requests such additional information,
the sixty (60) day period for determination shall be postponed until the
applicant provides the information.
(c) If the applicant does not receive
the determination regarding the
boundary dispute within 60 days, the
applicant’s submission shall be considered denied and the denial may be
appealed to the Board of Zoning
Appeals within 30 days. In the event
the applicant receives an adverse
determination, that determination
may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals within 30 days.
Section 351.16 Inspection of Riparian and Wetland Setback
The delineation of riparian setbacks or wetland setbacks may be
inspected by the City, as follows:
(a) Prior to any soil disturbing
activities authorized by the City for a
property subdivision/property/parcel
split, land development plan, and/or
building permit. The applicant or his
or her designated representative
shall provide the Department of
Building and Housing with at least
five (5) working days’ notice under
this chapter prior to starting soil disturbing or land clearing activities.
(b) Prior to starting any of the
activities authorized by this chapter,
the applicant or his or her designated
representative shall provide the
Department of Building and Housing
with at least five (5) working days’
notice prior to starting the activities.
(c) Any time evidence is brought to
the attention of the City that uses or
structures are occurring that may reasonably be expected to violate the provisions of these regulations.
Section 351.17 Disclaimer of Liability
Neither submission of a plan under
the provisions of this chapter, nor
compliance with the provisions of
these regulations, shall relieve any
person or entity from responsibility
for damage to any person or property
that is otherwise imposed by law.

The City Record
Section 351.18 Conflicts, Severability, Nuisances & Responsibility
(a) Where this chapter imposes a
greater restriction upon land than is
imposed or required by other City provisions of law, ordinance, contract or
deed, the provisions of this chapter
shall prevail.
(b) If a court of competent jurisdiction declares any clause, section, or
provision of these regulations invalid
or unconstitutional, the validity of
the remainder shall not be affected.
(c) These regulations shall not be
construed as authorizing any person
to maintain a private or public nuisance on his or her property. Compliance with the provisions of this regulation shall not be a defense in any
action to abate the nuisance.
(d) Failure of the City to observe or
recognize hazardous or unsightly
conditions or to recommend corrective measures shall not relieve the
owner from the responsibility for the
condition or damage resulting there
from, and shall not result in the City,
its officers, employees, or agents
being responsible for any condition or
damage resulting there from.
Section 351.19 Authority to Stop
Work
Upon notice from the Director of
Building and Housing, or designated
representative, that work is being
performed contrary to this regulation,
such work shall immediately stop.
The notice shall be in writing and
shall be given to the owner or person
responsible for the development area,
or person performing the work, and
shall state the conditions under which
the work may be resumed; provided,
however, in instances where immediate action is deemed necessary for
public safety or the public interest,
the Director of Building and Housing
may require that work be stopped
upon verbal order pending issuance
of the written order.

An emergency resolution supporting the efforts of the Northeast Ohio
Regional Sewer District to reinstate
its Regional Stormwater Management Program.
Whereas,
pursuant
to
Ohio
Revised Code Chapter 6119 and Title
V of the Code of Regulations enacted by the Northeast Ohio Regional
Sewer District (the “District”), the
District
established
a
regional
stormwater management program
which included fully the City of
Cleveland; and
Whereas, on June 28, 2012 Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas
Judge Thomas J. Pokorny issued his
final opinion in the case Northeast
Ohio Regional Sewer District v.
Bath Township, affirming the District’s authority to implement a
regional stormwater program and
determining that the fees are not
taxes; and
Whereas, on September 26, 2013,
the Eighth District Court of Appeals
for Cuyahoga County, reversed the
opinion of the Common Pleas Court
stating that the District has no
authority
to
enact
a
regional
stormwater management program
and is enjoined from implementing
collecting
Title
V
and
from
stormwater fees; and
Whereas,
the
decision
of
the
Eighth District Court of Appeals
threatens to leave the City of Cleveland and much of the rest of Northeast Ohio with no effective means
of
watershed
based,
regional
stormwater management; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has numerous stormwater management issues that can only be effectively addressed on a watershed
along
basis,
including
flooding
Euclid Creek and Big Creek that
has resulted in basements being
filled with stormwater and other
property damage, as well as the routine flooding of Martin Luther King
Drive by Doan Brook; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has several regional stormwater
management problems that it cannot
address within its capital budget,
including the Euclid Creek Concrete
Spillway Repair, the Euclid Creek
Flood Control Rehabilitation Project, the Big Creek Streambank Erosion at John Nagy Boulevard, and
the Doan Brook Stream Restoration
and Bank Stabilization, collectively
estimated to cost at least $16 million
dollars; and
Whereas, the District intends to
appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court to
overturn the holding of the Eighth
District Court of Appeals; and
Whereas, this Council supports
the efforts of the District to overturn the decision of the Eighth District Court of Appeals by appeal to
the Ohio Supreme Court, and urges
the Court to take jurisdiction in this
discretionary appeal; and

The City Record
Whereas, this Council supports
the Northeast Ohio Regional District’s efforts to manage wet weather, and relies on these efforts;
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby
supports the efforts of the Northeast
Ohio Regional Sewer District to reinstate its Regional Stormwater Management Program.
Section 2. That the Clerk is directed
to send a copy of this resolution to
Julius Ciaccia, Executive Director of
the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer
District.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption

shall take effect and be in force from

plans for the Improvement. That the
companies have agreed to make necessary rearrangements immediately
after notification by the City.
(f) That the City, at its own
expense, shall make all rearrangements of water mains, service lines,

and appurtenances which do not comply with the provisions of Section 8204
(Utility Reimbursement Eligibility)
of the Ohio Department of Transportation’s Real Estate Policies and
Procedures Manual, whether inside or
outside the corporate limits, as may
be necessary to conform to the
improvement.
(g) That the County will participate in the costs of alterations of governmentally-owned utility facilities
which come within the provisions of
Section 8204 (Utility Reimbursement
Eligibility) of the Ohio Department of

extent that it participates in the other
costs of the project, provided, however, that such participation will not
extend to any additions or betterments of existing facilities.
(h) That the construction, reconstruction, and rearrangement of all
utilities shall be done in a manner as
not to interfere unduly with the operations of the contractor or contractors
constructing the Improvement, and

affecting the movement of traffic on
any street within the limits of the

Improvement by any class of vehicle
or vehicle load permitted by the
