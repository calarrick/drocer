By Council Members Reed, Cummins, Conwell, J. Johnson and

An emergency resolution calling
upon the CBS News organization,
specifically the 60 Minutes television news magazine to hire AfricanAmericans and Hispanics as contributing correspondents.
Whereas, Ed Bradley, a wellknown and respected African-American journalist was a contributing
correspondent for the CBS news
magazine 60 Minutes for 25 years;
and,
Whereas, at the time of Ed
Bradley’s death in 2006, he was 60
Minutes’ only on-screen black correspondent; and
Whereas, it took 60 Minutes 3
years to find another African-American contributing correspondent, hiring Byron Pitts in 2009, the first
African-American contributing correspondent at 60 Minutes since
Bradley’s death; and
Whereas, Byron Pitts left 60 Minutes for ABC news in March 2013,
leaving the news magazine again
with no African-American on-screen
correspondent; and
Whereas, although there are Hispanic news correspondents, such as
Soledad O’Brien and John Quinones,
on news shows at other networks,
no Hispanics are represented as contributing correspondents on 60 Minutes; and
Whereas, 60 Minutes, as the number 1 television news magazine in
the country, should have contributing correspondents that are members of the leading minorities in this
country; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby
calls upon the CBS News organization, specifically the 60 Minutes television news magazine to hire AfricanAmericans and Hispanics as contributing correspondents.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit copies

Minutes, to NBC-LEO, HELO, the

Cities, the chair of the Congressional
Black Caucus Ohio Congresswoman
Marcia Fudge, the Hispanic Roundtable, the Hispanic Alliance, and the

measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and

approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted October 28, 2013.
Effective October 30, 2013.

Res. No. 1476-13.
By Council Members Pruitt, Westbrook, Zone, Mitchell, Brancatelli,
Polensek, Cleveland, Conwell, Keane,
Cummins and J. Johnson.
An emergency resolution supporting the state of Ohio’s Energy Efficiency
Resource
Standard
and
Renewable Portfolio Standard and
opposing Substitute Senate Bill 58
and House Bill 302 which would gut
those standards and the consumerfriendly benefits that save electricity costs and create jobs.
Whereas, Ohio’s energy efficiency
and renewable energy standards
have been in place for over five
years, since SB 221 was passed in
April, 2008; and
Whereas,
in
2012,
Governor
Kasich, with bi-partisan support
from the Ohio legislature, reviewed
these standards and passed SB 315,
making the energy efficiency standards stronger by including technologies to help Ohio manufacturers;
and
Whereas, to date, all four of
Ohio’s Investor Owned Utilities are
exceeding the standards; and
Whereas, energy efficiency is one
of the cleanest and cheapest ways
to address our energy needs, and is
still the lowest-cost electric system
resource, even in a time of very low
natural gas prices, and
Whereas, these energy efficiency
standards have saved rate payers an
average of 1.4 % or $300 million dollars each year since their inception;
continuing utility commitments to
such standards will save $5.6 billion
in avoided energy expenditures; and
Whereas, requiring utilities to
participate in energy efficiency programs has been shown to reduce
Ohio’s energy consumption, encourage the development of energy efficiency technologies within Ohio,
reduce the cost of electricity and
create local jobs, and
Whereas, energy efficiency investments pursuant to Ohio’s Energy
Efficiency Resource Standard are
made only when the efficiency costs
less than an equal amount of energy, and the costs consumers and
businesses pay for these programs
is typically far outweighed by the
savings they provide, and
Whereas, investments in energy
efficiency and renewable energy not
only reduce overall expenditures on
energy, but provide important environmental and health benefits to the
community, including reductions in
toxic
air
pollutants
such
as
methane, nitrous oxide, nitrogen
oxide, sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, lead, and
mercury, and
Whereas, more than 160 companies in Ohio provide jobs in the
solar industry and 55 of these companies have manufacturing facilities in the state; further, Ohio ranks
#4 in wind industry employment,
largely due to our strong manufacturing base; and
Whereas, in July, 2013, the City
provided 100% renewable electricity
to 65,000 residents and small business customers through municipal

The City Record
aggregation, and
Whereas, the Ohio legislature is
currently attempting to halt the
state’s Energy Efficiency Resource
Standard by passing Substitute SB
58 and HB 302; and
Whereas, Sub. SB 58 and HB 302
threaten to outsource Ohio jobs,
increase the cost of electricity and
give an unprecedented profit to electric utilities at the expense of Ohio’s
residents and businesses; and
Whereas, Sub. SB 58 and HB 302
will reverse the significant progress
made since the 2008 adoption of
Ohio’s Energy Efficiency Resource
Standard and Renewable Portfolio
Standard; and
Whereas, this Council joins with
Mayor Frank Jackson, the 1.5 million
people
represented
by
the
AARP, the 600,000 members of the
Ohio Manufacturer’s Association, the
American Lung Association, United
Steel Workers, Sheet Metal Workers
International, the Toledo Blade, the
Akron Beacon Journal, and the
Cleveland Plain Dealer, among others, who oppose the stripping of
Ohio’s energy efficiency standards;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the state of Ohio’s Energy Efficiency
Resource
Standard
and
Renewable Portfolio Standard and
opposes Substitute Senate Bill 58 and
House Bill 302 which would gut those
standards and the consumer-friendly
benefits that save electricity costs
and create jobs.
Section 2. That the Clerk is directed
to send copies of this resolution to
Governor John Kasich, Ohio Senate
President Keith Faber, Ohio House
Speaker Bill Batchelder, Senate Energy and Public Utilities Committee
Chair Senator Bill Seitz, Ohio House
Public Utilities Committee Chair Representative Peter Stautberg, all members of the Ohio House and Senate
Public Utilities Committees; Executive Assistant for Energy, Environment and Agriculture, Craig Butler,
and Director of Policy Wayne Struble.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted October 28, 2013.
Effective October 30, 2013.

Ord. No. 1113-13.
By Council Members Keane, Cleveland and Kelley (by departmental
request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the issuance and sale by the city
of airport system revenue bonds in
an aggregate principal amount not
to exceed one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) to pay costs of
improving the airport system; authorizing supplemental indentures and
other agreements related to the
bonds; and authorizing and approving related matters.

November 6, 2013
Whereas, under authority of the
Constitution of the State of Ohio and
the Charter of the City of Cleveland,
Ohio (the “City”), this Council has
by
ordinance
authorized
the
issuance of Revenue Bonds, from
time to time, for the Airport System
under the terms and security of the
Amended and Restated Trust Indenture
(Seventeenth
Supplemental
Trust Indenture), effective as of
January 31, 2012 (the “Trust Indenture”), between the City and The
Bank of New York Mellon Trust
Company,
N.A.,
as
trustee
(the
“Trustee”); and
Whereas, this Council has determined to authorize the issuance by
the City of Airport System Revenue
Bonds (“Bonds”) under the Trust
Indenture for the purpose of improving the facilities of the Airport System; and
Whereas, this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department and providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that authorizing the
Bonds is necessary to fund contracts
for improvements to the Airport System needed for the provision of air
services to the public; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Definitions.
In addition to the words and terms
defined in the Trust Indenture, the
following words and terms shall have
the following meanings, unless the
context or use indicates a contrary
meaning or intention.
“Bond Purchase Agreement” means,

Bond Purchase Agreements between
the City and the Original Purchasers
authorized in Section 5 of this Ordinance.
“Book–entry form” or “book–entry
system” means a form or system, as
applicable, under which (a) the ownership of beneficial interests in Revenue Bonds and Bond service charges
may be transferred only through a
book–entry, and (b) physical Revenue Bond certificates in fully registered form are registered only in the
name of a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the physical Bond certificates “immobilized” in
the custody of the Depository. The
book–entry system is maintained by
and is the responsibility of the Depository and not the City or the Trustee.
The book–entry is the record that
identifies, and records the transfer of
the interest of, the owners of beneficial (book–entry) interests in the
Revenue Bonds.
“Certificate of Award” means one or
more certificates delivered by the
Director of Finance pursuant to Section 5 of this Ordinance providing for
the final terms of the Bonds of any
series consistent with the requirements of the Trust Indenture and this

advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
the amount necessary, together with
other funds available for the purpose
(i) to pay costs of the Project, including funding interest on the Bonds for

deposit to the Bond Service Reserve
Fund required under the Trust Indenture or any special reserve fund for
that series separate from the Bond
Service Reserve Fund, (iii) to fund
any deposit to the Renewal and

improving air travel facilities serving the people of the City of Cleveland, thereby increasing and promoting commerce by providing necessary

minimizing the risk of variations in

savings by confirming rates of interest on the Bonds in advance of their
issuance. To permit the City to have
the flexibility to undertake interest
rate swap, swaption, rate cap, rate
collar and other hedging transactions
from time to time, and to establish the
procedures for approving those trans-

1769

9
actions, this Council authorizes the
signing and delivery of one or more
agreements (each, a “Hedge Agreement”) and any related agreements
necessary for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by
each Hedge Agreement. The authorizations in this Section 3 are supplemental to and not in derogation of any
authority provided by any other ordinance of this Council concerning
hedging arrangements.
Prior to entering into any Hedge
Agreement with respect to the Bonds
or any Credit Support Instrument
with respect to such Hedge Agreement, the Director of Finance shall
determine, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
(a) the Hedge Agreement or Credit
Support Instrument with respect to
such Hedge Agreement is (i) justified
by the corresponding benefit to the
City, (ii) commercially reasonable
based on then-current market conditions, and (iii) in the City’s best interests, and (b) the City will receive fair
value in return for entering into the
Hedge
Agreement,
considering,
among other things, the credit of the
City’s Airport System, the credit of
the counterparty and the terms and
conditions of the Hedge Agreement.
To the extent that any amounts to be
paid by the City in connection with
any such Hedge Agreement or any
Credit Support Instrument with
respect to such Hedge Agreement are
not paid from proceeds of the Bonds,
those amounts shall be paid from
Fund Nos. 60 SF 001, 60 SF 104, 60 SF
105, 60 SF 106 and 60 SF 141 and/or
passenger facility charges, as determined by the Director of Finance
after consultation with the Director
of Port Control.
The Director of Finance shall negotiate the terms of each Hedge Agreement. The Director of Finance shall
determine the terms and conditions of
the Hedge Agreement, including
without limitation, the time or times
and procedures for the exercise by the
counterparty or the City, as the case
may be, of any option under the
Hedge Agreement, whether the obligations of the City under the Hedge
Agreement shall be secured by a Credit Support Instrument, and the rates
to be paid by the counterparty to the
City or by the City to the counterparty
under the Hedge Agreement in the
event of the exercise of the option.
The approval of each interest rate
hedge transaction by the Director of
Finance shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery of
the applicable Hedge Agreement by
the Director of Finance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into an amendment,
modification or novation of any
Hedge Agreement or any Credit Support Instrument securing a Hedge
Agreement or to terminate any Hedge
Agreement, in whole or in part, if the
Director of Finance determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that (a) the
amendment, modification, novation or
termination is (i) justified by the corresponding benefit to the City, (ii)
commercially reasonable based on
then-current market conditions, and
(iii) in the City’s best interests, and
(b) the City received fair value in
return for entering into such amendment, modification, novation or termination, given the credit of the counterparty and the terms and conditions
of the amendment, modification,

10
novation or termination. To the
extent that any amounts to be paid by
the City in connection with any such
amendment, modification, novation or
termination are not paid from proceeds of the Bonds, those amounts
shall be paid from Fund Nos. 60 SF
001, 60 SF 104, 60 SF 105, 60 SF 106 and
60 SF 141 and/or passenger facility
charges, as determined by the Director of Finance after consultation with
the Director of Port Control.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from the Airport Revenues as defined
in the Trust Indenture and may be
payable also from other funds permitted by law to be used for the purpose,
as identified by the Director of
Finance in the Hedge Agreement.
Those payments may be secured by a
pledge of Airport Revenues, to the
extent permitted by the Trust Indenture, all as determined by the Director
of Finance and set forth in the Hedge
Agreement. The obligation of the City
to make payments under any Hedge
Agreement does not and shall not represent or constitute a general obligation, debt, bonded indebtedness or a
pledge of the faith and credit of the
City or the State of Ohio. Nothing
gives any party to any Hedge Agreement the right to have excises, ad valorem or other taxes levied by the City
or the State of Ohio for the payment of
any amounts due under any Hedge
Agreement.
In the event the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that it
is necessary to supplement or amend
the Trust Indenture or a Supplemental Indenture in connection with any
Hedge Agreement or any amendment,
modification, novation or termination
of any Hedge Agreement, then, subject to the requirements of Article
XIII of the Trust Indenture, the
Mayor and the Director of Finance
are authorized to sign and deliver a
Supplemental Indenture or amendment of an existing Supplemental
Indenture.
Section 4. Terms of Bonds.
The Bonds shall contain the terms
provided in or determined pursuant
to, the Trust Indenture, this Ordinance, the applicable Certificate of
Award and the applicable Supplemental Indenture. Each series of Bonds
may be secured by a separate Supplemental Indenture, or a single Supplemental Indenture may secure more
than one series of Bonds.
(a) General. The Bonds may be
issued as obligations bearing interest
at fixed or variable rates. The Bonds
may also be issued as obligations
under Federal or State programs that
provide for interest payment subsidies or other financial or credit support. In the event that the Director of
Finance, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, determines
that the City’s best interests will be
served by a series of Bonds bearing
interest at variable interest rates,
then provision shall be made in the
Supplemental Indenture applicable to
that series for the method and procedure by which the variable rate of
interest to be borne by the Bonds of
that series shall be determined
(whether by reference to a market
index, by a remarketing agent or otherwise); provided that no series of
variable rate Bonds shall bear interest at a rate in excess of twenty–five
percent (25%) per year (including
any Bonds held by a provider of a

The City Record
Credit Support Instrument). The
Director of Finance may determine
that the terms of a variable rate
series of Bonds may or may not permit the holders to tender their variable rate Bonds for purchase by the
City. If the Director of Finance designates any series of Bonds as variable
rate Bonds, and if the Holders of that
series of Bonds are to be entitled to
tender those Bonds for purchase, then
the Director of Finance may also designate for those variable rate Bonds
(and may designate others, from time
to time, in substitution therefor), the
tender agent or agents (which may be
the Trustee), the remarketing agent
or agents (which may be any of the
Original Purchasers) and the calculation agent or agents (which may be
any of the Original Purchasers or the
Trustee), which designations shall be
based on the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
that the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed to
provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into agreements with
others in connection with the delivery
of the Bonds, and from time to time
thereafter so long as the Bonds are
outstanding, as may be determined by
the Director of Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for (i)
the method of determining the variable interest rates, (ii) the rights and
procedures for tender, (iii) liquidity
or credit support, (iv) repayment by
the City of any amounts drawn under
the Credit Support Instrument, (v)
the direct purchase of tendered
Bonds, and (vi) other arrangements
in the best interests of the City. The
Director of Finance is further authorized to terminate any such agreements if the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the City’s best interests will be served
by such termination. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to enter
into agreements, from time to time so
long as the variable rate Bonds are
supplementing
or
outstanding,
amending the applicable Supplemental Indenture for a series of Bonds as
provided in Section 7. To the extent
that any fees and expenses associated
with agreements entered into or terminated pursuant to this Section are
not paid from proceeds of the Bonds,
those fees and expenses shall be paid
from Fund Nos. 60 SF 001, 60 SF 104,
60  SF  105, 60 SF 106 and 60 SF 141
and/or passenger facility charges, as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance after consultation with the
Director of Port Control.
(b) Form; Exchange and Transfer.
All Bonds shall be issued in fully registered form. The Bonds initially may
be delivered in book-entry only form,
registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered
owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository, and not transferable or exchangeable (except for
transfer to another Depository or its
nominee) without further action by
the City pursuant to the provisions of
the Trust Indenture.
If any Depository determines not to
continue to act as a Depository for the
Bonds of any series held in a
book–entry system, the Director of

1770

November 6, 2013
Finance and the Trustee may attempt
to
establish
a
securities
depository/book–entry relationship
with another qualified Depository. If
the Director of Finance and the
Trustee do not or are unable to do so,
the Director of Finance and the
Trustee, after making provision for
notification of the beneficial owners
by the then Depository and any other
arrangements deemed necessary,
shall permit withdrawal of the Bonds
of any series from the Depository, and
authenticate and deliver registered
Bond certificates to the assigns of the
Depository or its nominee, all at the
cost and expense (including any costs
of printing), if the event is not the
result of action or inaction of the City,
of those persons requesting such
issuance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into any agreements
determined by the Director to be necessary
in
connection
with
the
book–entry system for the Bonds,
after determining that those agreements will not endanger the funds or
securities of the City under the Trust
Indenture (as evidenced by the Director’s signing of those agreements).

arrangements or relating to the
Bonds or reserve requirements. The
Director of Finance is further authorized to agree to the amendment,

of interest to the final maturity of

and to take all actions necessary to
effect the remarketing of any series
of Bonds under the terms of this Ordinance and the Supplemental Indenture. The Clerk of Council or other

appropriate of all proceedings had
with reference to the conversion and
remarketing of any series of Bonds.

against the City (irrespective of
whether such parties have notice of
such pledge and create a perfected
security interest for all purposes of
Chapter 1309, Ohio Revised Code)
without the necessity for separation
of delivery of the Airport Revenues or
for the filing or recording of the Trust
Indenture or any other resolution or
instrument by which such pledge is
created or any certificate, statement
or other document with respect to
such pledge. The pledge of the Airport Revenues under the Trust Indenture shall be effective and the money
therefrom and thereof may be applied

from time to time, to provide reports
in connection with the issuance and
sale of any Bonds or the delivery of
any Hedge Agreements concerning
the utilization and operation of the

timely allocations from the proceeds
of the Tax-Exempt Bonds or other

all at the times and in the manner
required under the Reimbursement
Regulations in order for the reimbursement to be treated as an expenditure of such proceeds for purposes
of Sections 103 and 141 to 150 of the
Code. No advance from any fund or
account or order for payment may be
made for original expenditures (other
than expenditures excepted from
such requirement under the Reimbursement Regulations) that are to

obligations, unless a declaration of
