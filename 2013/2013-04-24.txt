issued and outstanding under the
General Bond Ordinance, to the full
extent required to meet debt charges
payable on the Bonds issued and outstanding, from time to time, under the

sufficient
amounts from the income taxes to pay

The City Record
all debt charges on the General Obligation Bonds, the Bonds outstanding
under the Indenture, any Parity
Obligations and the Unrestricted
Income Tax Obligations (each as
defined in the Indenture). The City
further covenants that so long as any
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City shall not repeal or
amend, or suffer the repeal of, any
ordinance for the levy or collection of
its income taxes in any manner or to
such extent that the City would not be
able to meet its obligations to the
holders of the Bonds.
Section 4. Terms of the Series 2013
Bonds. The Series 2013 Bonds shall be

Series 2013 Bonds may be delivered
only in book-entry form, and if so
delivered, shall be registered in the
name of the Depository (as defined in
the Indenture) or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the
custody of the Depository, and shall
not be transferable or exchangeable
(except for transfer to another Depository or its nominee) without further
action by the City pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture and the
Fourth Supplement identified in Section 7. The Series 2013 Bonds shall be
designated “Bridges and Roadway
Improvement Bonds, Series 2013” and
may contain such further designation
as provided in the Certificate of
Award identified below. The Series
2013 Bonds shall be issued in one lot
as fully registered Series 2013 Bonds
in denominations of $5,000 or any
whole multiple thereof. The Series
2013 Bonds shall be numbered as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance. The Series 2013 Bonds shall
be signed by the officials of the City
and in the manner set forth in the
Indenture.
The Series 2013 Bonds shall be
dated the date of their issuance and
delivery or such other date specified
in the certificate of award providing
for the final terms of the Series 2013
Bonds and the sale of the Series 2013
Bonds in accordance with this Ordinance (the “Certificate of Award”).
The Series 2013 Bonds shall bear
interest from their date until the principal amount is paid at the rate or
rates per year specified in the Certificate of Award, provided that the yield
(determined in accordance with the
arbitrage provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) of
the Series 2013 Bonds shall not exceed
six per cent (6.00%) per year. Interest
on the Series 2013 Bonds shall be
payable semi-annually on April 1 and
October 1, or such other dates specified in the Certificate of Award (the
“Interest Payment Dates”).
The Series 2013 Bonds shall mature
in the years and principal amounts
set forth in the Certificate of Award,
provided that (i) each principal payment shall occur on an Interest Payment Date, and (ii) the final maturity
date of the Series 2013 Bonds shall be
no later than August  1, 2033. The
Series 2013 Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as serial
Series 2013 Bonds or as term Series
2013 Bonds payable prior to stated
maturity pursuant to sinking fund
redemption (the “Term Bonds”). The
Director of Finance shall determine
in the Certificate of Award whether
any of the Series 2013 Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates (the
“Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on

655

23
which the principal amount of the
Term Bonds shall be payable pursuant to mandatory sinking fund
installments rather than at stated
maturity and the amount of principal
to be paid on each Mandatory
Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements”). If any of the Series 2013
Bonds are issued as Term Series 2013
Bonds, the Term Bonds shall be
redeemed pursuant to the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to the
redemption date, on the Mandatory
Redemption Dates. The aggregate of
the moneys to be deposited with the
Trustee for payment of principal of
and interest on any Term Bonds shall
include amounts sufficient to redeem
on the Mandatory Redemption Dates
the principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided in
the Indenture and the Fourth Supplement).
The Series 2013 Bonds may be subject to redemption prior to maturity
by and at the option of the City, in
whole or in part on any date, in whole
multiples of $5,000, on the redemption
dates and at the redemption prices
specified in the Certificate of Award,
plus, in each case, accrued interest to
the redemption date. Based on the
written advice of a financial advisor,
the Director of Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that
it is in the best interests of the City
(i) for some or all of the Series 2013
Bonds not to be callable prior to their
stated maturity, and (ii) for a premium to be payable on the redemption of
any Series 2013 Bonds calculated in a
manner to make the bondholder
whole for the loss of the investment or
calculated as a percentage in excess
of 100% of the principal amount
redeemed.
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the City may
have the option to purchase any Bond
which is redeemable by optional
redemption at a purchase price not
less than the redemption price that
would be payable if that Bond were
called for optional redemption on the
date of the proposed purchase. That
election shall be exercised as provided in the Fourth Supplement.
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the Series 2013
Bonds may be secured by a Debt Service Reserve Fund to be held by the
Trustee under the Indenture. The
principal amount of the Series 2013
Bonds may include provision for funding the Debt Service Reserve Fund
from the proceeds of the Bonds, subject to compliance with applicable
federal tax laws.

(the

The provisions of Sections 9.98 to 9.983
of the Revised Code shall apply to the
Notes and pursuant to that authority
and this Ordinance, the Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award, based on the written
advice of a financial advisor, that the
City’s best interests will be served by
causing all or a portion of the Notes to
be obligations bearing interest at
variable rates. If the Director of
Finance so determines, then the
Director of Finance shall specify in
the Certificate of Award the method
and procedure by which the variable
rate of interest to be borne by the variable rate Notes shall be determined;
provided that the variable rate Notes
shall not bear interest at a rate in
excess
of
twenty-five
percent
(25.00%) per year. The Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements in connection with the
delivery of the variable rate Notes,
and from time to time thereafter so
long as the variable rate Notes are
outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support Instruments (as defined in
Section 11) and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance, based on the written advice
of a financial advisor, to be necessary
or appropriate to provide for the
method of determining the variable
interest rates, permitting holders the
right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support for the payment of
the variable rate Notes upon tender
for purchase or redemption, and providing for the repayment by the City
of any amounts drawn under the Credit Support Instrument. The Trustee
shall be the authenticating agent,
registrar, transfer agent and paying
agent for the Notes. The Notes shall
be signed by the officials of the City
and in the manner set forth in the
Indenture. The Notes shall first be
offered for purchase to the Trustees
of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by them, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased for
that Account, shall be sold at not less
than par and accrued interest to one
or more firms that have proposed to
underwrite the Notes and have been
selected by the Director of Finance
based on an evaluation of the qualifications of those firms (the “Note Purchaser”) in the principal amount set
forth in a certificate of award to be
executed by the Director of Finance
(the “Note Certificate of Award”).
The proceeds of such sale shall be
paid into the proper fund or funds set
forth in the Note Certificate of Award
and used for the purpose for which
the Notes are being issued under the
provisions of this Ordinance.
Section 9. Official Statement; Continuing Disclosure. If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a disclosure document (each, an “Official

City agrees, in accordance with, and
as the only obligated person with
respect to the Notes and the Series
2013 Bonds under the SEC Rule, to

may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for that
purpose, and thereby to implement
that agreement, including provisions
for enforcement, amendment and termination, the Director of Finance is
authorized and directed to prepare, or
cause to be prepared, and to sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of
the City, a continuing disclosure
agreement or certificate, which shall
constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the

incur to perform it. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to
establish procedures in order to
ensure compliance by the City with
its continuing disclosure agreement,
including the timely provision of

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 542-13.
By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency resolution supporting Northeast Ohio hospitals and
Ohioans in urging the Ohio General
Assembly to include the expansion
of Medicaid eligibility in their proposed budget bill for the health and
economic benefit of all Ohioans.
Whereas, this Council passed a
resolution on March 25, 2013 urging
Governor Kasich and the Ohio General Assembly to propose and pass
a budget that expands Medicaid eligibility in Ohio; and
Whereas, the Ohio General Assembly has a unique opportunity to
expand Medicaid eligibility to cover
people making up to 138% of the
federal
poverty
level,
which
is
$15,420 for an individual or $26,352
for a family of three; and
Whereas,
such
an
expansion
would be supported by generous federal
funding
levels
that
have
already been set aside for that purpose under the Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act (ACA),

32
including an average of 95% of the
expansion cost through 2019; and
Whereas, Governor Kasich included the expansion of Medicaid eligibility in his budget, and strongly
supports the expansion, but last
week Republicans in the Ohio House
of Representatives introduced a substitute budget that stripped out Medicaid expansion; and
Whereas, Northeast Ohio hospitals, including the Cleveland Clinic,
University
Hospitals,
Sisters
of
Charity Health System and others,
along with the business community
and concerned Ohioans, are working
to
convince
lawmakers
that
Ohioans’ lives and the economy are
at stake; and
Whereas, Ohio hospitals will lose
millions of dollars in federal funding currently used to treat uninsured patients and provide free care
that was supposed to be replaced by
Medicaid expansion; and
Whereas, if Ohio does not expand
Medicaid eligibility, local hospitals
that rely on decreasing Medicaid
uncompensated care dollars to help
them treat the uninsured will be atrisk of decreasing treatment or closing their doors; and
Whereas, many Ohioans who will
qualify for expanded Medicaid are
the working poor, not necessarily
the unemployed; Governor Kasich’s
office estimates that about 45 percent of those who will qualify for
coverage
under
the
expansion
statewide have jobs; and
Whereas,
Ohio
Consumers
for
Health Coverage states that if Ohio
expands
Medicaid
eligibility,
at
least 600,000 low-income working
Ohioans who are currently uninsured will have access to health
care through Ohio’s Medicaid managed care plans, and seek more preventive care with better health outcomes as a result; and
Whereas, the nonpartisan Health
Policy Institute of Ohio’s countylevel study projects that in Cuyahoga County, about 46,000 uninsured
residents ages 19 to 64 would gain
coverage through Medicaid if expansion occurs; and
Whereas, in addition to health
benefits, expanding Medicaid eligibility will help our economy with an
investment of $20 billion in federal
Medicaid dollars during the years
2014 through 2019 to pay for the
expansion; and
Whereas,
this
investment
will
stimulate the Ohio economy by
going directly into our health care
system, to hospitals, and doctors,
and other providers, and creating
additional jobs, attracting additional businesses, and raising state revenue through income and other
taxes; and
Whereas, larger urban areas like
Northeast Ohio may see as many as
4,300 new jobs, and because of the
higher employment, Cuyahoga County is projected to net an additional
$9 million in additional sales tax
revenues from Medicaid managed
care plans as well as general sales
tax, according to the Health Policy
Institute report; and
Whereas,
The
Ohio
Medicaid
Expansion Study found that expanding Medicaid eligibility would allow
$1.6 billion in state budget savings
during state fiscal years 2014-2022,
because certain categories of current Medicaid spending would qualify for higher federal matching
rates, letting the state reduce its

The City Record
spending; also, non-Medicaid spending on health care for the poor and
near-poor
uninsured
would
be
replaced by federal Medicaid dollars, allowing a reduction in state
general fund spending; and
Whereas,
expanding
Medicaid
would generate between 2.7 billion
and 2.8 billion in state revenue during state fiscal years 2014-2022 thorough 1) increased state’s managed
care sales and insurance tax revenue from increased enrollment; 2)
increased state’s receipt of rebates
from drug manufacturers covering
more Medicaid prescription drug
customers, and finally; 3) resulting
economic activity from the Ohio
health industry and businesses generating sales and income tax revenue; and
Whereas, an estimated $1.8 to 1.9
billion in net state budget gains
over this nine-year period studied by
The Ohio Medicaid Expansion Study
could be redirected to other priorities, including tax relief or education funding; and
Whereas, a Medicaid expansion
would affect Ohio residents during
2022, the final year studied, by
reducing the number of uninsured
Ohio residents by more than 450,000,
creating more than 27,000 Ohio jobs,
reducing health care costs for Ohio
employers and residents by $285 million and $1.1 billion, respectively,
and generating significant savings
and revenues for Ohio counties; and
Whereas,
without
a
Medicaid
expansion, the ACA would create
small, net budget losses during the
state fiscal years 2014-2022 period as
a whole; policymakers would need
to add the Medicaid expansion to
the remainder of the ACA for the
federal legislation to yield net state
budget gains; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports Northeast Ohio hospitals and
Ohioans in urging the Ohio General
Assembly to include the expansion of
Medicaid eligibility in their proposed
budget bill for the health and economic benefit of all Ohioans.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
resolution to Governor John Kasich,
the Ohio General Assembly, Dr. David
Bronson, the Cleveland Clinic, Heidi
Garland, University Hospitals, and
Robin Bachman, Sisters of Charity
Health System.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.

Whereas, this Council objected to

Series 2008 Bonds, the Series 2010
Bonds, the Series 2012 Bonds, the
Series 2013 Bonds and any additional

collectively referred to in this Ordinance as the “Bonds.”

Indenture, the City pledges the
municipal income taxes of the City

tion 7. The Series 2013 Bonds shall be
designated
“Public
Facilities
Improvement Bonds, Series 2013” and
may contain such further designation
as provided in the Certificate of
Award identified below. The Series
2013 Bonds shall be issued in one lot
as fully registered Series 2013 Bonds
in denominations of $5,000 or any
whole multiple thereof. The Series
2013 Bonds shall be numbered as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance. The Series 2013 Bonds shall
be signed by the officials of the City
and in the manner set forth in the
Indenture.
The Series 2013 Bonds shall be
dated the date of their issuance and
delivery or such other date specified
in the certificate of award providing
for the final terms of the Series 2013
Bonds and the sale of the Series 2013
Bonds in accordance with this Ordinance (the “Certificate of Award”).
The Series 2013 Bonds shall bear
interest from their date until the principal amount is paid at the rate or
rates per year specified in the Certificate of Award, provided that the yield
(determined in accordance with the
arbitrage provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) of
the Series 2013 Bonds shall not exceed
six per cent (6.00%) per year. Interest
on the Series 2013 Bonds shall be
payable semi-annually on April 1 and
October 1, or such other dates specified in the Certificate of Award (the
“Interest Payment Dates”).
The Series 2013 Bonds shall mature
in the years and principal amounts
set forth in the Certificate of Award,
provided that (i) each principal payment shall occur on an Interest Payment Date, and (ii) the final maturity
date of the Series 2013 Bonds shall be
no later than August  1, 2024. The
Series 2013 Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as serial
Series 2013 Bonds or as term Series
2013 Bonds payable prior to stated
maturity pursuant to sinking fund
redemption (the “Term Bonds”). The
Director of Finance shall determine
in the Certificate of Award whether
any of the Series 2013 Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates (the
“Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on
which the principal amount of the
Term Bonds shall be payable pursuant to mandatory sinking fund
installments rather than at stated
maturity and the amount of principal
to be paid on each Mandatory
Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements”). If any of the Series 2013
Bonds are issued as Term Series 2013
Bonds, the Term Bonds shall be
redeemed pursuant to the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to the
redemption date, on the Mandatory
Redemption Dates. The aggregate of
the moneys to be deposited with the
Trustee for payment of principal of
and interest on any Term Bonds shall
include amounts sufficient to redeem
on the Mandatory Redemption Dates
the principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided in
the Indenture and the Fourth Supplement).
The Series 2013 Bonds may be subject to redemption prior to maturity
by and at the option of the City, in

April 24, 2013
whole or in part on any date, in whole
multiples of $5,000, on the redemption
dates and at the redemption prices
specified in the Certificate of Award,
plus, in each case, accrued interest to
the redemption date. Based on the
written advice of a financial advisor,
the Director of Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that
it is in the best interests of the City
(i) for some or all of the Series 2013
Bonds not to be callable prior to their
stated maturity, and (ii) for a premium to be payable on the redemption of
any Series 2013 Bonds calculated in a
manner to make the bondholder
whole for the loss of the investment or
calculated as a percentage in excess
of 100% of the principal amount
redeemed.
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the City may
have the option to purchase any Bond
which is redeemable by optional
redemption at a purchase price not
less than the redemption price that
would be payable if that Bond were
called for optional redemption on the
date of the proposed purchase. That
election shall be exercised as provided in the Fourth Supplement.
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the Series 2013
Bonds may be secured by a Debt Service Reserve Fund to be held by the
Trustee under the Indenture. The
principal amount of the Series 2013
Bonds may include provision for funding the Debt Service Reserve Fund
from the proceeds of the Bonds, subject to compliance with applicable
federal tax laws.

date set forth in the Note Certificate
of Award; shall be subject to redemption by the City at any time prior to

that a premium be paid on their prior
redemption; shall be designated “Public Facilities Improvement Bond
Anticipation Notes” or as otherwise

The provisions of Sections 9.98 to 9.983
of the Revised Code shall apply to the
Notes and pursuant to that authority
and this Ordinance, the Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award, based on the written
advice of a financial advisor, that the
City’s best interests will be served by
causing all or a portion of the Notes to
be obligations bearing interest at
variable rates. If the Director of
Finance so determines, then the
Director of Finance shall specify in
the Certificate of Award the method
and procedure by which the variable
rate of interest to be borne by the variable rate Notes shall be determined;
provided that the variable rate Notes
shall not bear interest at a rate in
excess
of
twenty-five
percent
(25.00%) per year. The Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into

38
agreements in connection with the
delivery of the variable rate Notes,
and from time to time thereafter so
long as the variable rate Notes are
outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support Instruments (as defined in
Section 11) and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance, based on the written advice
of a financial advisor, to be necessary
or appropriate to provide for the
method of determining the variable
interest rates, permitting holders the
right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support for the payment of
the variable rate Notes upon tender
for purchase or redemption, and providing for the repayment by the City
of any amounts drawn under the Credit Support Instrument. The Trustee
shall be the authenticating agent,
registrar, transfer agent and paying
agent for the Notes. The Notes shall
be signed by the officials of the City
and in the manner set forth in the
Indenture. The Notes shall first be
offered for purchase to the Trustees
of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by them, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased for
that Account, shall be sold at not less
than par and accrued interest to one
or more firms that have proposed to
underwrite the Notes and have been
selected by the Director of Finance
based on an evaluation of the qualifications of those firms (the “Note Purchaser”) in the principal amount set
forth in a certificate of award to be
executed by the Director of Finance
(the “Note Certificate of Award”).
The proceeds of such sale shall be
paid into the proper fund or funds set
forth in the Note Certificate of Award
and used for the purpose for which
the Notes are being issued under the
provisions of this Ordinance.
Section 9. Official Statement; Continuing Disclosure. If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a disclosure document (each, an “Official

Notes or the Series 2013 Bonds, the
Director of Finance is authorized to
prepare or cause to be prepared on
behalf of the City an Official Statement with respect to the Notes or the
Series 2013 Bonds, as the case may be,
and any necessary supplements and

respect to the Notes and the Series

specify certain terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for that
purpose, and thereby to implement
that agreement, including provisions
for enforcement, amendment and termination, the Director of Finance is
authorized and directed to prepare, or
cause to be prepared, and to sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of
the City, a continuing disclosure
agreement or certificate, which shall
constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Notes or the Series 2013
Bonds, as the case may be, in accordance with the SEC Rule. The performance of that agreement shall be subject to the availability of funds and
their annual appropriation to meet
costs the City would be required to
incur to perform it. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to
establish procedures in order to
ensure compliance by the City with
its continuing disclosure agreement,
including the timely provision of
information and notices.

actions that may be required of it for
the interest on the Tax-Exempt Bonds
to be and remain excluded from gross

be taken any actions that would
adversely affect that exclusion, and

the borrowing, (B) restrict the yield
on investment property, (C) make
timely and adequate payments to the
federal government, (D) maintain
books and records and make calculations and reports and (E)  refrain

Ohio Revised Code, the Charter of the
City, and this Ordinance for the purpose stated in Section  1. The Series
2013 Bonds shall be payable from and
secured by the income tax revenues of
the City on a basis subordinate to the
security given to the General Obligation Bonds of the City (“General
Obligation Bonds”) under Ordinance
No. 1749-80 passed by the Council on
October 8, 1980, as amended by Ordinance No. 1112-83 passed by the Council on May 6, 1983, and Ordinance No.

amended and as the same may further
be amended from time to time in
accordance with its provisions, is
referred to as the “General Bond Ordinance”). The debt service on the
Series 2013 Bonds shall be payable
from income tax collections remaining after depositing with the escrow
agent under the General Bond Ordinance the amount required for the
payment of debt service on the City’s
General Obligation Bonds issued and
outstanding, from time to time, under

Series 2013 Bonds shall be issued and
secured under the terms of the Trust
Indenture, dated as of April 1, 2008,
between the City and U.S. Bank
National Association, as trustee (the
“Trustee”), as amended by Section 6.1
of the Second Supplemental Trust
Indenture, dated as of June 1, 2010,
between the City and the Trustee
(together, the “Indenture”). The

40
Indenture currently secures five
series of Subordinate Lien Income
Tax Bonds issued on May 1, 2008 (collectively, the “Series 2008 Bonds”),
four series of Subordinate Lien
Income Tax Bonds issued on June 23,
2010 (collectively, the “Series 2010
Bonds”) and one series of Subordinate
Lien Income Tax Bonds issued on
November 29, 2012 (the “Series 2012
Bonds”) and permits the issuance of
additional bonds, from time to time,
subject to certain restrictions. The
Series 2008 Bonds, the Series 2010
Bonds, the Series 2012 Bonds, the
Series 2013 Bonds and any additional
bonds issued under the Indenture are
collectively referred to in this Ordinance as the “Bonds.”
Section 3. Pledge and Covenant to
Maintain Income Tax. So long as
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City pledges the
municipal income taxes of the City
and grants a lien thereon, subordinate to the lien granted in the General Bond Ordinance as security for the
General Obligation Bonds of the City
issued and outstanding under the
General Bond Ordinance, to the full
extent required to meet debt charges
payable on the Bonds issued and outstanding, from time to time, under the
Indenture. The City covenants to
appropriate
annually
sufficient
amounts from the income taxes to pay
all debt charges on the General Obligation Bonds, the Bonds outstanding
under the Indenture, any Parity
Obligations and the Unrestricted
Income Tax Obligations (each as
defined in the Indenture). The City
further covenants that so long as any
Bonds are outstanding under the
Indenture, the City shall not repeal or
amend, or suffer the repeal of, any
ordinance for the levy or collection of
its income taxes in any manner or to
such extent that the City would not be
able to meet its obligations to the
holders of the Bonds.
Section 4. Terms of the Series 2013
Bonds. The Series 2013 Bonds shall be
issued in fully registered form. The
Series 2013 Bonds may be issued in
one or more series or subseries. The
Series 2013 Bonds may be delivered
only in book-entry form, and if so
delivered, shall be registered in the
name of the Depository (as defined in
the Indenture) or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the
custody of the Depository, and shall
not be transferable or exchangeable
(except for transfer to another Depository or its nominee) without further
action by the City pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture and the
Fourth Supplement identified in Section 7. The Series 2013 Bonds shall be
designated “Parks and Recreation
Facilities Improvement Bonds, Series
2013” and may contain such further
designation as provided in the Certificate of Award identified below. The
Series 2013 Bonds shall be issued in
one lot as fully registered Series 2013
Bonds in denominations of $5,000 or
any whole multiple thereof. The
Series 2013 Bonds shall be numbered
as determined by the Director of
Finance. The Series 2013 Bonds shall
be signed by the officials of the City
and in the manner set forth in the
Indenture.
The Series 2013 Bonds shall be
dated the date of their issuance and
delivery or such other date specified
in the certificate of award providing
for the final terms of the Series 2013
Bonds and the sale of the Series 2013

The City Record
Bonds in accordance with this Ordinance (the “Certificate of Award”).
The Series 2013 Bonds shall bear
interest from their date until the principal amount is paid at the rate or
rates per year specified in the Certificate of Award, provided that the yield
(determined in accordance with the
arbitrage provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended) of
the Series 2013 Bonds shall not exceed
six per cent (6.00%) per year. Interest
on the Series 2013 Bonds shall be
payable semi-annually on April 1 and
October 1, or such other dates specified in the Certificate of Award (the
“Interest Payment Dates”).
The Series 2013 Bonds shall mature
in the years and principal amounts
set forth in the Certificate of Award,
provided that (i) each principal payment shall occur on an Interest Payment Date, and (ii) the final maturity
date of the Series 2013 Bonds shall be
no later than August  1, 2031. The
Series 2013 Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as serial
Series 2013 Bonds or as term Series
2013 Bonds payable prior to stated
maturity pursuant to sinking fund
redemption (the “Term Bonds”). The
Director of Finance shall determine
in the Certificate of Award whether
any of the Series 2013 Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates (the
“Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on
which the principal amount of the
Term Bonds shall be payable pursuant to mandatory sinking fund
installments rather than at stated
maturity and the amount of principal
to be paid on each Mandatory
Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements”). If any of the Series 2013
Bonds are issued as Term Series 2013
Bonds, the Term Bonds shall be
redeemed pursuant to the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to the
redemption date, on the Mandatory
Redemption Dates. The aggregate of
the moneys to be deposited with the
Trustee for payment of principal of
and interest on any Term Bonds shall
include amounts sufficient to redeem
on the Mandatory Redemption Dates
the principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided in
the Indenture and the Fourth Supplement).
The Series 2013 Bonds may be subject to redemption prior to maturity
by and at the option of the City, in
whole or in part on any date, in whole
multiples of $5,000, on the redemption
dates and at the redemption prices
specified in the Certificate of Award,
plus, in each case, accrued interest to
the redemption date. Based on the
written advice of a financial advisor,
the Director of Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that
it is in the best interests of the City
(i) for some or all of the Series 2013
Bonds not to be callable prior to their
stated maturity, and (ii) for a premium to be payable on the redemption of
any Series 2013 Bonds calculated in a
manner to make the bondholder
whole for the loss of the investment or
calculated as a percentage in excess
of 100% of the principal amount
redeemed.
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the City may

672

April 24, 2013
have the option to purchase any Bond
which is redeemable by optional
redemption at a purchase price not
less than the redemption price that
would be payable if that Bond were
called for optional redemption on the
date of the proposed purchase. That
election shall be exercised as provided in the Fourth Supplement.
If and to the extent provided in the
Certificate of Award, the Series 2013
Bonds may be secured by a Debt Service Reserve Fund to be held by the
Trustee under the Indenture. The
principal amount of the Series 2013
Bonds may include provision for funding the Debt Service Reserve Fund
from the proceeds of the Bonds, subject to compliance with applicable
federal tax laws.
Section 5. Sale of Series 2013 Bonds.
The Series 2013 Bonds shall first be
offered for purchase to the Trustees

For the purpose of raising money in
anticipation of the issuance of the
Series 2013 Bonds for the purpose set

may be issued in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed Six Million
One Hundred Thousand Dollars
($6,100,000) (the “Notes”) upon the

as shall be determined by the Director
of Finance of the City in the Note Certificate of Award; shall be dated their

not be redeemable prior to maturity or
that a premium be paid on their prior
redemption; shall be designated
“Parks and Recreation Facilities
Improvement
Bond
Anticipation
Notes” or as otherwise provided in the
Note Certificate of Award; shall be
issued in such numbers and denominations as may be requested by the
Note Purchaser (hereinafter defined);
and shall be issued in fully registered
form (which may be in a book entry
only system). The provisions of Sections 9.98 to 9.983 of the Revised Code
shall apply to the Notes and pursuant
to that authority and this Ordinance,
the Director of Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award,
based on the written advice of a financial advisor, that the City’s best interests will be served by causing all or a
portion of the Notes to be obligations
bearing interest at variable rates. If
the Director of Finance so determines, then the Director of Finance
shall specify in the Certificate of
Award the method and procedure by
which the variable rate of interest to
be borne by the variable rate Notes
shall be determined; provided that the
variable rate Notes shall not bear
interest at a rate in excess of twentyfive percent (25.00%) per year. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
enter into agreements in connection
with the delivery of the variable rate
Notes, and from time to time thereafter so long as the variable rate
Notes are outstanding, with providers
of Credit Support Instruments (as
defined in Section 11) and others as
may be determined by the Director of
Finance, based on the written advice
of a financial advisor, to be necessary
or appropriate to provide for the
method of determining the variable
interest rates, permitting holders the
right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support for the payment of
the variable rate Notes upon tender
for purchase or redemption, and providing for the repayment by the City
of any amounts drawn under the Credit Support Instrument. The Trustee
shall be the authenticating agent,
registrar, transfer agent and paying

673

41
agent for the Notes. The Notes shall
be signed by the officials of the City
and in the manner set forth in the
Indenture. The Notes shall first be
offered for purchase to the Trustees
of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by them, shall be offered to
the Treasury Investment Account for
purchase and, if not purchased for
that Account, shall be sold at not less
than par and accrued interest to one
or more firms that have proposed to
underwrite the Notes and have been
selected by the Director of Finance
based on an evaluation of the qualifications of those firms (the “Note Purchaser”) in the principal amount set
forth in a certificate of award to be
executed by the Director of Finance
(the “Note Certificate of Award”).
The proceeds of such sale shall be
paid into the proper fund or funds set
forth in the Note Certificate of Award
and used for the purpose for which
the Notes are being issued under the
provisions of this Ordinance.
Section 9. Official Statement; Continuing Disclosure. If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a disclosure document (each, an “Official
Statement”) is appropriate or necessary in connection with the sale of the
Notes or the Series 2013 Bonds, the
Director of Finance is authorized to
prepare or cause to be prepared on
behalf of the City an Official Statement with respect to the Notes or the
Series 2013 Bonds, as the case may be,
and any necessary supplements and
to authorize the use and distribution
of each Official Statement and any
supplements. The Director of Finance

City and in her official capacity each
Official Statement and any supplements approved by her. The Director
of Finance is authorized to sign and

City that such disclosure document is
“deemed final” by the City within the
meaning of Securities and Exchange
Commission Rule 15c2-12 the “SEC
Rule.” The Director of Finance is
authorized to contract for services for
the production and distribution of preliminary and final Official Statements, including by printed and electronic means.

beneficial owners from time to time of
the Notes or the Series 2013 Bonds, the
City agrees, in accordance with, and
as the only obligated person with
respect to the Notes and the Series
2013 Bonds under the SEC Rule, to
provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for that
purpose, and thereby to implement
that agreement, including provisions
for enforcement, amendment and termination, the Director of Finance is
authorized and directed to prepare, or
cause to be prepared, and to sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of
the City, a continuing disclosure
agreement or certificate, which shall
constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial

42
owners of the Notes or the Series 2013
Bonds, as the case may be, in accordance with the SEC Rule. The performance of that agreement shall be subject to the availability of funds and
their annual appropriation to meet
costs the City would be required to
incur to perform it. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to
establish procedures in order to
ensure compliance by the City with
its continuing disclosure agreement,
including the timely provision of
information and notices.

treated other than as bonds the interest on which is excluded from gross
income under Section 103 of the Code,
and (ii) the interest on the TaxExempt Bonds will not be an item of
tax preference under Section 57 of the

actions that may be required of it for
the interest on the Tax-Exempt Bonds
to be and remain excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, (ii) it will not take or authorize to
be taken any actions that would
adversely affect that exclusion, and

the borrowing, (B) restrict the yield
on investment property, (C) make
timely and adequate payments to the
federal government, (D) maintain
books and records and make calculations and reports and (E)  refrain
from certain uses of those proceeds,
and, as applicable, of property
financed with such proceeds, all in
such manner and to the extent necessary to assure such exclusion of that
interest under the Code.
(b) Further Actions. The Director

covenants and certifications of and on
behalf of the City, as may be appropriate to assure the intended tax status of the Series 2013 Bonds and any
