By Council Members Miller, Kelley,

(by
departmental request).
An emergency resolution declaring it necessary to relay and repair
sidewalks, (including adjustments
of castings, if necessary) encroaching upon the public right-of-way on
Clifton Boulevard from West 115th
Street to Lake Avenue.

The City Record
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That it is necessary and
conducive to the public health and
welfare that Clifton Boulevard from
West 115th Street to Lake Avenue
be improved by relaying and repairing sidewalks (including adjustments of castings, if necessary)
encroaching upon the public rightof-way or otherwise improving the
right-of-way
in
accordance
with
plans, specifications and profiles, at
the estimated cost of $276,111, prepared and placed in File No. 271-13A, in the Office of the Clerk of
Council, and supplemented by the
specifications contained in Codified
Ordinance Section 505.02 and division (a) of Codified Ordinance Section 505.12, which are incorporated
by reference, which plans, specifications and profiles are approved.
Section
2.
That
fifty
percent
(50%) of the cost and expense of

cost of intersections, as shall be
found to be a proper charge, shall

benefits which may result from the

Adopted March 25, 2013.
Effective March 28, 2013.

Res. No. 427-13.
By Council Members Pruitt, K.
Johnson, Miller, Dow, Mitchell, Brancatelli, Cleveland, Keane, Kelley,
Brady, Westbrook, Zone and Cummins.
An emergency resolution urging
Governor Kasich and the Ohio General Assembly to propose and pass
a budget that expands Medicaid eligibility in Ohio.
Whereas, Ohio policymakers have
a unique opportunity to expand Medicaid eligibility to cover people making up to 138% of the federal poverty level, which is $15,420 for an individual or $26,352 for a family of
three; and
Whereas,
such
an
expansion
would be supported by generous federal
funding
levels
that
have
already been set aside for that purpose under the Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act (ACA),
including an average of 95% of the
expansion cost through 2019; and
Whereas, by increasing access to
medical care this way, Ohio would
not only improve the health of
Ohioans, but invest in its economy
too; and
Whereas,
Ohio
Consumers
for
Health Coverage states that if Ohio
expands
Medicaid
eligibility,
at
least 600,000 low-income working
Ohioans who are currently uninsured will have access to health
care through Ohio’s Medicaid managed care plans, and seek more preventive care with better health outcomes as a result; and
Whereas, in addition to health
benefits, expanding Medicaid eligibility will help our economy with an
investment of $20 billion in federal
Medicaid dollars during the years
2014 through 2019 to pay for the
expansion; and
Whereas,
this
investment
will
stimulate the Ohio economy by
going directly into our health care
system, to hospitals, and doctors,
and other providers, and creating
additional jobs, attracting additional businesses, and raising state revenue through income and other
taxes; and
Whereas,
The
Ohio
Medicaid
Expansion Study found that expanding Medicaid eligibility would allow
$1.6 billion in state budget savings
during state fiscal years 2014-2022,
because certain categories of current Medicaid spending would qualify for higher federal matching
rates, letting the state reduce its
spending; also, non-Medicaid spending on health care for the poor and
near-poor
uninsured
would
be
replaced by federal Medicaid dol-

April 3, 2013
lars, allowing a reduction in state
general fund spending; and
Whereas,
expanding
Medicaid
would generate between 2.7 billion
and 2.8 billion in state revenue during state fiscal years 2014-2022 thorough 1) increased state’s managed
care sales and insurance tax revenue from increased enrollment; 2)
increased state’s receipt of rebates
from drug manufacturers covering
more Medicaid prescription drug
customers, and finally; 3) resulting
economic activity from the Ohio
health industry and businesses generating sales and income tax revenue; and
Whereas, an estimated $1.8 to 1.9
billion in net state budget gains
over this nine-year period studied by
The Ohio Medicaid Expansion Study
could be redirected to other priorities, including tax relief or education funding; and
Whereas, a Medicaid expansion
would affect Ohio residents during
2022, the final year studied, by
reducing the number of uninsured
Ohio residents by more than 450,000,
creating more than 27,000 Ohio jobs,
reducing health care costs for Ohio
employers and residents by $285 million and $1.1 billion, respectively,
and generating significant savings
and revenues for Ohio counties; and
Whereas,
without
a
Medicaid
expansion, the ACA would create
small, net budget losses during the
state fiscal years 2014-2022 period as
a whole; policymakers would need
to add the Medicaid expansion to
the remainder of the ACA for the
federal legislation to yield net state
budget gains; and
Whereas, if Ohio does not expand
Medicaid eligibility, local hospitals
that rely on decreasing Medicaid
uncompensated care dollars to help
them treat the uninsured will be atrisk of decreasing treatment or closing their doors; and
Whereas, this Council supports
expanding Medicaid eligibility as
the best choice for the health of
Ohioans, community hospitals, and
our economy; and
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
Governor Kasich and the Ohio General Assembly to propose and pass
a budget that expands Medicaid eligibility in Ohio.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
resolution to Governor John Kasich
and the Ohio General Assembly.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.

Permanent
Number
80036070300; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to

Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of

Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
