An emergency resolution supporting the efforts of the Northeast Ohio
Regional Sewer District to reinstate
its Regional Stormwater Management Program.

20
Whereas,
pursuant
to
Ohio
Revised Code Chapter 6119 and Title
V of the Code of Regulations enacted by the Northeast Ohio Regional
Sewer District (the “District”), the
District
established
a
regional
stormwater management program
which included fully the City of
Cleveland; and
Whereas, on June 28, 2012 Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas
Judge Thomas J. Pokorny issued his
final opinion in the case Northeast
Ohio Regional Sewer District v.
Bath Township, affirming the District’s authority to implement a
regional stormwater program and
determining that the fees are not
taxes; and
Whereas, on September 26, 2013,
the Eighth District Court of Appeals
for Cuyahoga County, reversed the
opinion of the Common Pleas Court
stating that the District has no
authority
to
enact
a
regional
stormwater management program
and is enjoined from implementing
Title
V
and
from
collecting
stormwater fees; and
Whereas,
the
decision
of
the
Eighth District Court of Appeals
threatens to leave the City of Cleveland and much of the rest of Northeast Ohio with no effective means
of
watershed
based,
regional
stormwater management; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has numerous stormwater management issues that can only be effectively addressed on a watershed
basis,
including
flooding
along
Euclid Creek and Big Creek that
has resulted in basements being
filled with stormwater and other
property damage, as well as the routine flooding of Martin Luther King
Drive by Doan Brook; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has several regional stormwater
management problems that it cannot
address within its capital budget,
including the Euclid Creek Concrete
Spillway Repair, the Euclid Creek
Flood Control Rehabilitation Project, the Big Creek Streambank Erosion at John Nagy Boulevard, and
the Doan Brook Stream Restoration
and Bank Stabilization, collectively
