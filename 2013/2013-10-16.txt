An emergency resolution opposing
that portion of House Bill 203 which
is the State of Ohio’s version of the
“stand your ground” law.
Whereas, H.B. 203, introduced in
the Ohio House of Representatives
on June 11, 2013, proposes amendments to Ohio’s carrying concealed
weapons law by expanding the circumstances under which a person
has no duty to retreat before using
lethal force in self-defense; and
Whereas, Ohio law currently contains what is known as the “castle
doctrine”, which states that an individual does not have a duty to
retreat from his or her home or vehicle; and

18
Whereas, H.B. 203 would make it
legal to fight back using deadly
force rather than encouraging citizens to retreat from potentially confrontational situations; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes

Whereas, a solution to the problems of pollution, congestion and

Whereas, bicycles take up less
space on the road and do less damage to the roads than cars, resulting in better conditions and streets
for all road users; and
Whereas, Cleveland is recognized
as a bronze level bicycle friendly
community and has a growing number of bicycle focused businesses;
and
Whereas, Bike Cleveland launched
the Ride Together campaign, a public awareness campaign to educate
the public on the rights of bicycles
on public roadways, to make our
street safer; and
Whereas, bicycle messengers are
ambassadors of goodwill for the
city; and
Whereas, bicycle messengers promote the bicycle as a viable form of
transportation and economic development; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council recognizes National Messenger Appreciation Day in Cleveland on October 9,
2013.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit a copy of this
