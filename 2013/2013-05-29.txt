Res. No. 19-11.
By Council Members Reed, Pruitt,
Polensek, Mitchell and Miller.
An emergency resolution urging
the General Assembly of the State of
Ohio
to
examine
and
possibly
increase the enhanced mandatory
prison terms for offenders who commit crimes with a firearm under Ohio
Revised
Code
Section
2929.14
(D)(1)(a).
Whereas, in 2005, 11,346 persons
were killed by firearm violence and
477,040 persons were victims of a
crime committed with a firearm,
according to the National Institute of
Justice; and
Whereas, in 2006, firearms were
used in 68 percent of murders, 42 percent of robbery offenses and 22 percent of aggravated assaults nationwide; and
Whereas, Ohio Revised Code Section 2929.14 (D)(1)(a) mandates
enhanced prison term sentences
imposed by courts, ranging from one
year to six years, to offenders who
commit crimes with a firearm or
while in possession of a firearm; and
Whereas,
increasing
these
enhanced mandatory prison terms
would have a deterrent effect on
crimes committed with a firearm; and
Whereas, this Council believes that
increasing the enhanced mandatory
prison terms for crimes committed
with a firearm is necessary for the
health and safety of Ohio citizens;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the General Assembly of the State of
Ohio
to
examine
and
possibly
increase the enhanced mandatory
prison terms for offenders who commit crimes with a firearm under Ohio
2929.14
Revised
Code
Section
(D)(1)(a).
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit two certified copies of this resolution to the
General Assembly of the State of
Ohio, the Speaker of the Ohio House of
Representatives, the Ohio Senate
President, the Ohio Legislative Black
Caucus, Governor Kasich, and Mayor
Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all

16
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted May 20, 2013.
Effective May 23, 2013.

Res. No. 211-13.
By Council Members Reed, Cleveland, Mitchell, Conwell, Westbrook,
Polensek and J. Johnson.
An emergency resolution supporting neutrality as the correct position
of the City’s leaders and affirming
the necessity to impartially review
the facts and circumstances of the
events of November 29, 2012.
Whereas, on February 5, 2013, the
Ohio
Attorney
General’s
report
blamed a police chase and shooting
on a “systemic failure” by the police
department; and
Whereas, there have been calls for
the resignation of the police chief
and the director of Public Safety;
and
Whereas, the Mayor, the Director
of Public Safety and the Chief of
Police could not continue or complete their investigation of the incident until the Attorney General’s
report itself was completed; and
Whereas, from the very beginning
of the investigation, the Mayor, the
Director of Public Safety and the
Chief of Police have committed to
remaining unbiased as they review
the facts of the November 29th incident; and
Whereas, it is impossible for the
City’s leaders to present an unbiased report if they take sides on the
issues prior to gathering all the
facts; and
Whereas, it is unreasonable to demand that the City’s leaders draw
conclusions that cause them to take
sides on an issue before they have
had a chance to analyze the facts
surrounding the incident;
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports neutrality as the correct position of the City’s leaders and affirming the necessity to impartially
review the facts and circumstances
of the events of November 29, 2012.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted May 20, 2013.
Effective May 23, 2013.

An emergency resolution urging
the United States Congress to pass
H.R. 1699 and S. 809, the Genetically Engineered Food Right-to-Know
Act to mandate labeling of all
genetically engineered food products.
Whereas, on April 24, 2013, the
Genetically Engineered Food Rightto-Know Act was introduced in the
United States Congress as H.R. 1699
and S. 809 that requires labeling of
all genetically engineered food products; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
recognizes that consumers want the
right to know accurate and thorough information about the food
they feed their families; and
Whereas, the potential long-term
risks to public health and the environment
from
genetically
engineered foods are unknown; and
Whereas, safety studies on genetically engineered foods are limited
biotechnology
companies
because
prohibit cultivation for research purposes in their seed licensing agreements; and
Whereas, some independent, peerreviewed research that has been
done
on
genetically
engineered
crops has revealed problems with
liver and kidney functions in rats,
deformities and neurological problems in vertebrates and lower nutrition content in Roundup Ready
crops; and

May 29, 2013
Whereas, it is the responsibility of
the United States Department of
Agriculture to ensure that genetically engineered crops are safe to
grow, the Environmental Protection
Agency to ensure that genetically
engineered products will not harm
the environment and the Food and
Drug Administration to ensure that
genetically engineered food is safe
to eat; and
Whereas, the patchwork of federal agencies that regulates genetically engineered crops and animals
in the United States has failed to
adequately
oversee
and
monitor
genetically engineered products; and
Whereas, farmers who produce
organic
or
non-genetically
engineered crops run the risk of crop
contamination from nearby genetically engineered crops; and
Whereas, farmers who unintentionally
grow
genetically
engineered-patented seeds or who harvest crops that are contaminated
with genetically engineered traits
could lose marketing options and
face costly lawsuits; and
Whereas, a 2008 CBS/New York
Times poll found that 87 percent of
U.S. consumers wanted all genetically ingredients to be labeled;
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the United States Congress to pass
H.R. 1699 and S. 809, the Genetically
Engineered Food Right-to-Know Act
to mandate labeling of all genetically
engineered food products.

Sherrod Brown and Robert Portman,
United States Senate, Representative
Marcia Fudge, United States House of
Representatives, and Food & Water
Watch.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed

Section 413.031 Use of Automated

(a) Civil Enforcement System
Established. The City of Cleveland
hereby adopts a civil enforcement
system for red light and speeding
offenders photographed by means of
an “automated traffic enforcement
camera system” as defined in division
(p). This civil enforcement system
imposes monetary liability on the

steady red light indication or for the
failure of an operator to comply with
a speed limitation.
(b) Red Light Offense – Liability

the traffic signal for that vehicle’s
direction is emitting a steady red
light.
(c) Speeding Offense – Liability
Imposed. The owner of a vehicle shall
be liable for the penalty imposed
under this section if the vehicle is
operated at a speed in excess of the
limitations set forth in Section 433.03.

Conviction. The imposition of liability under this section shall not be
deemed a conviction for any purpose

(e) Other Offenses and Penalties
Not Abrogated. Nothing in this section shall be construed as altering or
limiting Sections 433.03 or 413.03 of

to enforce those sections against any
offender observed by the officer violating either of those sections. Nothing in this section shall be construed
to limit the liability of an operator of
a vehicle for any violation of division
(b) or (c) of this section.
(f) Selection of Camera Sites. The
selection of the sites where automated cameras are placed and the
enforcement of this ordinance shall

The Director of Public Safety shall
cause the general public to be notified
by means of a press release issued at
least thirty (30) days before any
given camera is made fully-operational and is used to issue tickets to
offenders. Before a given camera
issues actual tickets, there shall be a
period of at least two (2) weeks,
which may run concurrently with the
thirty (30) day public-notice period,
during which only “warning” notices
shall be issued.
At each site of a red light or fixed
speed camera, the Director of Public
Works shall cause signs to be posted
to
apprise
ordinarily
observant
motorists that they are approaching
an area where an automated camera
is monitoring for red light or speed
violators. Mobile speed units shall be
plainly marked vehicles.
(h) Notices of Liability. Any ticket
for an automated red light or speeding system violation under this section shall:
(1) Be reviewed by a Cleveland
police officer;
(2) Be forwarded by first-class mail
or personal service to the vehicle’s
registered owner’s address as given
on the state’s motor vehicle registration, and
(3) Clearly state the manner in
which the violation may be appealed.
(i) Penalties. Any violation of division (b) or division (c) of this section
shall be deemed a noncriminal violation for which a civil penalty shall be
assessed and for which no points
authorized by RC 4507.021 (“Point system for license suspension”) shall be
assigned to the owner or driver of the
vehicle.
(j) Ticket Evaluation, Public Service, and Appeals. The program shall
include a fair and sound ticket-evaluation process that includes review by
the vendor and a police officer, a
strong customer-service commitment,
and an appeals process that accords
due process to the ticket respondent
and that conforms to the requirements of the Ohio Revised Code.
(k) Appeals. A notice of appeal
shall be filed with the Hearing Officer within twenty-one (21) days from
the date listed on the ticket. The failure to give notice of appeal or pay the
civil penalty within this time period
shall constitute a waiver of the right
to contest the ticket and shall be considered an admission.
Appeals shall be heard by the Parking Violations Bureau through an
administrative process established by
the Clerk of the Cleveland Municipal
Court. At hearings, the strict rules of
evidence applicable to courts of law

shall not apply. The contents of the
ticket shall constitute a prima facie
evidence of the facts it contains. Liability may be found by the hearing
examiner based upon a preponderance of the evidence. If a finding of
liability is appealed, the record of the
case shall include the order of the
Parking Violations Bureau, the ticket, other evidence submitted by the
respondent or the City of Cleveland,
and a transcript or record of the hearing, in a written or electronic form
acceptable to the court to which the
case is appealed.
Liability shall not be found where
the evidence shows that the automated camera captured an event that is
not an offense, including each of the
following events and such others as
may be established by rules and regulations issued by the Director of Public Safety under the authority of division (n) of this section:
(1) The motorist stops in time to
avoid violating a red light indication;
(2) The motorist proceeds through
a red light indication as part of funeral procession;
(3) The motorist is operating a
City-owned emergency vehicle with
its emergency lights activated and
proceeds through a red light indication or exceeds the posted speed limitation;
(4) The motorist is directed by a
police officer on the scene contrary to
the traffic signal indication.
Liability shall also be excused if a
vehicle is observed committing an
offense where the vehicle was stolen
prior to the offense and the owner has
filed a police report.
The Director of Public Safety, in
coordination with the Parking Violations Bureau, shall establish a
process by which a vehicle owner who
was not the driver at the time of the
alleged offense may, by affidavit,
name the person who the owner
believes was driving the vehicle at
the time. Upon receipt of such an affidavit timely submitted to the Parking
Violations Bureau, the Bureau shall
suspend further action against the
owner of the vehicle and instead
direct notices and collection efforts to
the person identified in the affidavit.
If the person named in the affidavit,
when notified, denies being the driver
or denies liability, then the Parking
Violations Bureau shall resume the
notice and collection process against
the vehicle owner, the same as if no
affidavit had been submitted, and if
the violation is found to have been
committed by a preponderance of evidence, the owner shall be liable for
any penalties imposed for the offense.
A decision in favor of the City of
Cleveland may be enforced by means
of a civil action or any other means
provided by the Ohio Revised Code.
(l) Evidence of Operation. It is
prima facie evidence that the person
registered as the owner of the vehicle
with the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles, or with any other state vehicle
registration office, or in the case of a
leased or rented vehicle, the “lessee”
as defined in division (p), was operating the vehicle at the time of the
offenses set out in divisions (b) and
(c) of this section.
(m) Program Oversight. The Director of Public Safety shall oversee the
program authorized by this section.
The Director of Public Works shall
oversee the installation and maintenance of all automated cameras. An
encroachment permit shall be autho-

1006

May 29, 2013
rized in the legislation in which locations are selected.
(n) Rules and Regulations. The
Director of Public Safety may issue
rules and regulations to carry out the
provisions of these sections, which
shall be effective thirty (30) days
after publication in the City Record.
(o) Establishment of Penalty. The
penalty imposed for a violation of
division (b) or (c) of this section shall
be follows:
413.031(b)  
All violations
413.031(c)  
Up to 24 mph over the
speed limit:

the speed limit:

(40) days from that date, another
($40.00)
shall
be
forty

imposed, for a total additional penalty in such a case of sixty dollars
($60.00).
