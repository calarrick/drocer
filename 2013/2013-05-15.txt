of a parcel at which an infraction has

occurred is liable to the City of Cleveland in the amounts established in
divisions (f) and (g).
(c) Noncriminal Offense; No Conviction. The infractions established by
this section are noncriminal. The
imposition of liability upon the
responsible parties under this section
shall not be deemed a conviction for
any purpose.
(d) Other Costs and Penalties Not
Abrogated. Nothing in this section
shall be construed as altering or limiting the effects of any other section
of these Codified Ordinances, the
criminal penalties imposed by any
such other section, or the ability of a
law enforcement officer to enforce
those sections.
(e) Tickets – Service; Contents. If a
violation of division (a) is observed

parties to be issued a ticket. The ticket shall be served by sending it via
regular U.S. mail, postage prepaid, to
the parcel owner(s) at the tax mailing address shown in the records of
the County Recorder.

shall be deemed to be the date of
issuance of the ticket. If the mailing
is unreturned, then it shall establish
that the respondents were given actual or constructive notice of the imposition of liability under this section.
The ticket shall identify the parcel
owner(s) as respondents. The ticket
shall state that the respondents are
responsible parties for the commission of a civil infraction under this
section.

appeal and the time frame for filing
it. The ticket shall state that failure
to appeal the ticket or pay the costs
imposed not later than twenty (20)
days from the date of issuance of the
ticket shall constitute a waiver of the
right to contest the ticket and shall be
considered an admission. The ticket
shall further state that if the ticket is
not appealed or paid in that time
frame, then a default finding of civil
liability shall be imposed upon
respondents for the costs established
in divisions (f) and (g).
The ticket may be in any format
that includes all of the elements
required by this section.

as
Parking
Bureau Administrator or otherwise,
in the manner described in the ticket.

constitute a waiver of the right to contest the ticket and shall be considered
an admission.
(i) Appeal – Process. The Director
shall establish an administrative
appeal process for persons to appeal
tickets issued under this section. The
administrative appeal process shall
allow the appellant the right to present appellant’s case in person and
may allow for evidence to be presented ex-parte. The strict rules of evidence applicable to courts of law
shall not apply in any administrative
hearing or ex-parte review. The ticket
charging the offense shall constitute
prima facie evidence that the offense
identified in the ticket occurred and
that the parcel owner(s) to whom the
ticket was mailed are the responsible
parties as defined in division (m) and
are liable to the City of Cleveland for
the costs imposed by this section.
If the Director finds by a preponderance of evidence that an appellant
is liable under this section for the
costs assessed, then the Director shall
dismiss the appeal and order the
appellant to pay the costs identified
in the ticket.
If the Director finds by a preponderance of evidence that an appellant
is liable under this section for the
costs assessed but that there are reasons for the commission of the infraction that mitigate the offense, then
the Director shall dismiss the appeal
and order the appellant to pay the
costs identified in the ticket, but may
in the interest of equity reduce the
costs assessed.
If the Director finds by a preponderance of evidence that the appellant is not liable under this section for
the costs assessed, then the Director
shall dismiss the ticket and grant the
appeal.

approve, modify or annul the finding
from which the appeal is taken.

by this section may be enforced and
collected by means of a civil action or
any other means provided for in these
Codified Ordinances or the Ohio
Revised Code.

An emergency resolution urging
the United States Congress to pass
HR 1213, the Common Sense Housing Investment Act of 2013, to enact
the goals of reforming the mortgage
interest deduction program and providing funding to the National Housing Trust in order to expand housing options and greater tax fairness.
Whereas, “Stable housing is the
foundation upon which people build
their lives – absent a safe, decent
and affordable place to live, it is
next to impossible to achieve good
health,
positive
educational
outcomes, or reach one’s economic
potential.” (U.S. Interagency Council
on Homelessness, Opening Doors:
Federal Strategic Plan to Prevent
and End Homelessness, 2010); and
Whereas, there are 42,000 extremely low income renter households in
Cuyahoga County who receive some
subsidy from the federal government to pay for rent; and
Whereas, 21% of renter households in Cuyahoga County pay more
than half of their incomes for rent;
and
Whereas, there is a shortage of
65,000 homes that are affordable and
available for extremely low income
renter households in Greater Cleveland based on request for vouchers
in the 2011 lottery; and
Whereas, this shortage of homes
that are affordable and available for
extremely low income renter households is a major contributing cause
of
homelessness
in
the
United
States; and
Whereas, Congress established the
National Housing Trust Fund in
2008 as a dedicated fund intended to
provide revenue to build, preserve,
rehabilitate and operate housing for
people with the lowest incomes,
including people who are homeless;
and

The City Record
Whereas, the National Housing
Trust Fund has not received any
dollars since it was created, despite
the growing need for rental housing
that extremely low income households can afford; and
Whereas, investing in the National Housing Trust Fund will create
jobs in the construction trades and
in property management; and
Whereas, the United States Congress is considering changes to the
mortgage interest deduction; and
Whereas, over three-quarters of
the benefit for the mortgage interest deduction goes to households
with income in the top fifth of all
taxpayers; and
Whereas, only slightly more than
half of homeowners who pay interest on their mortgages benefit from
the mortgage interest deduction;
and
Whereas, with modest modifications to the mortgage interest tax
expenditure, the number of homeowners with mortgages who get a
tax break could increase with most
of the expanded benefit going to
homeowners with mortgages with
incomes under $100,000 a year; and
Whereas, with modest modifications to the mortgage interest tax
expenditure,
its
cost
could
be
reduced,
freeing
up
federal
resources to direct to housing assistance to needy households; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
supports expanding mortgage interest tax benefits to more middle class
and lower income homeowners by
modifying the mortgage interest
deduction by converting the tax
deduction to a tax credit and by
reducing the maximum size of a
mortgage for which interest can be
deducted; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
urges
Congress
to
direct
sums
resulting from mortgage interest
deduction
modifications
to
the
National Housing Trust Fund to
preserve,
rehabilitate
and
build,
operate
rental
housing
that
is
affordable for extremely low income
households; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the United States Congress to pass
HR 1213, the Common Sense Housing
Investment Act of 2013, to enact the
goals of reforming the mortgage
interest deduction program and providing funding to the National Housing Trust in order to expand housing
options and greater tax fairness.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
resolution to the Office of Homeless
Services Advisory, the Northeast Ohio
Coalition for the Homeless, Representative Keith Ellison, Representative
Marcia Fudge, and Senator Sherrod
Brown.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from

By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency resolution designating May 20, 2013 as Expand Medicaid Eligibility in Ohio Day in
Cleveland.
Whereas, this Council passed resolutions on March 25, 2013 and April
15, 2013 urging Governor Kasich and
the Ohio General Assembly to propose
and
pass
a
budget
that
expands Medicaid eligibility in Ohio,
and to include Medicaid Expansion
in their budget bills; and
Whereas, the Ohio General Assembly has a unique opportunity to
expand Medicaid eligibility to cover
people making up to 138% of the
is
federal
poverty
level,
which
$15,420 for an individual or $26,352
for a family of three; and
Whereas,
such
an
expansion
would be supported by generous federal
funding
levels
that
have
already been set aside for that purpose under the Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act (ACA),
including an average of 95% of the
expansion cost through 2019; and
Whereas, Northeast Ohio hospitals, including the Cleveland Clinic,
University
Hospitals,
Sisters
of
Charity Health System and others,
along with the business community
and concerned Ohioans, are working
to
convince
lawmakers
that
Ohioans’ lives and the economy are
at stake; and
Whereas, it is estimated that if
Medicaid Expansion is approved in
Ohio at least 600,000 low-income
working Ohioans who are currently
uninsured will have access to health
care through Ohio’s Medicaid managed care plans, and seek more preventive care with better health outcomes as a result; and
Whereas, the nonpartisan Health
Policy Institute of Ohio’s countylevel study projects that in Cuyahoga County, about 46,000 uninsured
residents ages 19 to 64 would gain
coverage through Medicaid if expansion occurs; and
Whereas, larger urban areas like
Northeast Ohio may see as many as
4,300 new jobs, and because of the
higher employment, Cuyahoga County is projected to net an additional
$9 million in additional sales tax
revenues from Medicaid managed
care plans as well as general sales
tax, according to the Health Policy
Institute report; and
Whereas,
notwithstanding
the
health and economic benefits that
the passage of Medicaid Expansion
would bring, both the House of Representatives and the Senate have
chosen to remove Medicaid Expansion from consideration in Ohio’s
biennium budget; and
Whereas, recognizing the benefits
of the passage of Medicaid Expansion, consumer groups from across
Ohio are putting together activities
to highlight the need for Medicaid
Expansion and to urge Ohio Legislators to pass Medicaid Expansion
in Ohio; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,

May 15, 2013
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports Ohio’s consumer groups to get
Medicaid Expansion passed by the
Ohio General Assembly by designating May 20, 2013 as Expand Medicaid
Eligibility in Ohio Day in Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
resolution to Governor John Kasich
and the Ohio General Assembly.

By Council Members Brady, Kelley,

Cleveland, Miller, Mitchell, J. Johnson, Brancatelli, Sweeney, Conwell
and Cimperman.
An emergency resolution opposing
House Bills 151 and 152 and any socalled “right to work” laws and further opposing the “Workplace Freedom”
Constitutional
Amendment,
and supporting fair labor practices
for working families and the local
community.
Whereas, special interest groups
are promoting a so-called “right to
work” law called “Workplace Freedom” which is actually a corporatebacked attack on working families
and the middle-class; and
Whereas, “right to work” laws
give
multi-national
corporations
even more power to outsource jobs,
cut wages and reduce benefits at
the expense of workers, small businesses and the local economy; and
Whereas, workers in states with
such “right to work” laws have a
consistently lower quality of life
than in other states: lower wages,
higher poverty and infant mortality
rates, less access to health care and
poorer education for their children;
and
Whereas, these laws weaken the
voice of everyday heroes - nurses,
firefighters, police officers and first
responders - by making it harder to
bargain for safe staffing levels and
necessary equipment to keep citizens safe; and
Whereas, these laws will silence
whistleblowers who are counted on
to keep workplaces safe, protect
consumer goods, services and products and safeguard our natural
resources and environment; and
Whereas, the implementation of
“right to work” laws will erode the
tax base that supports vital services
in our communities, such as education, public safety, roads, and water;
and
Whereas, less than 2 weeks ago,
the Ohio House introduced House
Bills 151 and 152 which are purported “right to work” laws for both
private and public workers; and
Whereas, less than two years ago,
Ohio voters rejected a similar political attack on Ohio’s workers by vot-

The City Record
ing NO on Issue 2, thus expressing
the sentiment that the collective
bargaining rights of workers should
be protected; and
Whereas,
business
and
labor
should work together to create good
jobs and improve the economy; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes
House Bills 151 and 152 and any socalled “right to work” laws and further opposes the “Workplace Freedom” Constitutional Amendment, and
