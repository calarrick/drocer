Whereas, it is the duty of our local
leaders to respect the rights of, and
provide equal services to, all individuals regardless of national origin or
immigration status; and
Whereas, our nation’s immigration
policies are federal responsibilities
that are in desperate need of reform;
and
Whereas, a talented workforce
made up of both skilled and unskilled
labor is a key driver of our local economy; and
Whereas, there is a need for an
improved program that provides the
City's businesses the opportunity to
employ foreign workers, when necessary, to improve economic competitiveness; and
Whereas, family unity is a component of a strong economy, and re-unification of families has been a key
part of federal immigration policy for
almost fifty years; and

December 11, 2013
Whereas, there is broad support
and collaboration among both business and labor groups to promote comprehensive immigration reform that
provides sensible and effective solutions; and
Whereas, this Council believes that
any newly enacted comprehensive
immigration reform must:
1. Provide a path to citizenship for
the nearly 11 million undocumented
immigrants who live in the United
States today.
2. Establish an improved visa program, such as the proposed W-Visa, to
provide our businesses with the ability to hire certain categories of foreign
workers when legal residents are
unavailable or unwilling to fill jobs.
3. Create a methodology that accurately assesses labor market needs in
order to determine the number of foreign workers to be admitted for
employment purposes annually.
4. Increase efforts to advance workforce talent outreach internationally
and strengthen programs in domestic
science, technology, engineering,
arts, and mathematics (STEAM)
training, to improve ongoing economic competitiveness, while also promoting legal immigration opportunities.
5. Create a streamlined process to
resolve the backlog of existing visa
applications and develop methods to
ensure the efficient processing of
future immigration applications in a
timely manner, which will expedite
re-unification of families.
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports comprehensive immigration
reform and urges the U.S. Congress to
enact reforms that ensure economic
strength and promote stronger communities.
Section 2. That the Clerk of the
Council is directed to transmit copies
of this resolution to the President
Barack Obama, Speaker of the House
of Representatives John Boehner,
Majority Leader of the Senate Harry
Reid, and all Honorable Members of
the U.S. Congress representing the
City of Cleveland.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
