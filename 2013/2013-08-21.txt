Be it ordained by the Council of

Tires; Reporting
(a) Registration. No person, firm, or
corporation shall accept for disposal
more than five (5) automobile, truck,
motorcycle, or bicycle tires in any one
(1) calendar month in any one (1)
year unless and until the person, firm,
or corporation has registered with the
Commissioner of Assessments and
Licenses as a source of waste tires.
The Commissioner of Assessments
and Licenses shall furnish a registration form for the purposes of the registration, and, upon the payment of a

shall issue a certificate of registration, which may apply to all locations
at which the registrant does business.
Registrations shall be renewed annually. The form for registration shall

Whereas, the City’s real property

downtown applicants’ costs of doing
business and restricts these Applicants
by
eliminating
potential
employees who are unwilling or
unable to bear significant monthly
parking costs in the City; and 2)
handicap the City’s ability to attract
companies whose employees are
accustomed to free parking spaces
in their current suburban or rural
locations; and

forth in the Certificate of Award, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 5, and determined by the Director

advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
the amount necessary, together with
other funds available for the purpose
(i) to pay costs of the Project, including funding interest on the Bonds for

deposit to the Bond Service Reserve
Fund required under the Trust Indenture or any special reserve fund for
that series separate from the Bond
Service Reserve Fund, (iii) to fund

constitute Revenue Bonds for all purposes of the Trust Indenture.
This Council finds and determines
that the issuance of the Bonds for the
purpose provided in this Ordinance
serves a proper, public, municipal purpose by providing, maintaining and
improving air travel facilities serving the people of the City of Cleveland, thereby increasing and promoting commerce by providing necessary
transportation for individuals and
commercial enterprises purchasing
and selling services and products in
northeastern Ohio, and creating and
preserving jobs and employment
opportunities in the City and improving the economic welfare of the City.
Section 3. Authorization of Hedging
Arrangements.
This Council finds that by engaging in interest rate hedging arrangements with respect to the Bonds the
City may reduce its cost of borrowing
by optimizing the relative amounts of
fixed and variable rate obligations, or
minimizing the risk of variations in
its debt service costs, or obtaining
savings by confirming rates of interest on the Bonds in advance of their
issuance. To permit the City to have
the flexibility to undertake interest
rate swap, swaption, rate cap, rate
collar and other hedging transactions
from time to time, and to establish the
procedures for approving those transactions, this Council authorizes the
signing and delivery of one or more
agreements (each, a “Hedge Agreement”) and any related agreements

1333

21
necessary for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by
each Hedge Agreement. The authorizations in this Section 3 are supplemental to and not in derogation of any
authority provided by any other ordinance of this Council concerning
hedging arrangements.
Prior to entering into any Hedge
Agreement with respect to the Bonds
or any Credit Support Instrument
with respect to such Hedge Agreement, the Director of Finance shall
determine, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
(a) the Hedge Agreement or Credit
Support Instrument with respect to
such Hedge Agreement is (i) justified
by the corresponding benefit to the
City, (ii) commercially reasonable
based on then-current market conditions, and (iii) in the City’s best interests, and (b) the City will receive fair
value in return for entering into the
Hedge
Agreement,
considering,
among other things, the credit of the
City’s Airport System, the credit of
the counterparty and the terms and
conditions of the Hedge Agreement.
To the extent that any amounts to be
paid by the City in connection with
any such Hedge Agreement or any
Credit Support Instrument with
respect to such Hedge Agreement are
not paid from proceeds of the Bonds,
those amounts shall be paid from
Fund Nos. 60 SF 001, 60 SF 104, 60 SF
105, 60 SF 106 and 60 SF 141 and/or
passenger facility charges, as determined by the Director of Finance
after consultation with the Director
of Port Control.
The Director of Finance shall negotiate the terms of each Hedge Agreement. The Director of Finance shall
determine the terms and conditions of
the Hedge Agreement, including
without limitation, the time or times
and procedures for the exercise by the
counterparty or the City, as the case
may be, of any option under the
Hedge Agreement, whether the obligations of the City under the Hedge
Agreement shall be secured by a Credit Support Instrument, and the rates
to be paid by the counterparty to the
City or by the City to the counterparty
under the Hedge Agreement in the
event of the exercise of the option.
The approval of each interest rate
hedge transaction by the Director of
Finance shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery of
the applicable Hedge Agreement by
the Director of Finance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into an amendment,
modification or novation of any
Hedge Agreement or any Credit Support Instrument securing a Hedge
Agreement or to terminate any Hedge
Agreement, in whole or in part, if the
Director of Finance determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that (a) the
amendment, modification, novation or
termination is (i) justified by the corresponding benefit to the City, (ii)
commercially reasonable based on
then-current market conditions, and
(iii) in the City’s best interests, and
(b) the City received fair value in
return for entering into such amendment, modification, novation or termination, given the credit of the counterparty and the terms and conditions
of the amendment, modification,
novation or termination. To the

22
extent that any amounts to be paid by
the City in connection with any such
amendment, modification, novation or
termination are not paid from proceeds of the Bonds, those amounts
shall be paid from Fund Nos. 60 SF
001, 60 SF 104, 60 SF 105, 60 SF 106 and
60 SF 141 and/or passenger facility
charges, as determined by the Director of Finance after consultation with
the Director of Port Control.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from the Airport Revenues as defined
in the Trust Indenture and may be
payable also from other funds permitted by law to be used for the purpose,
as identified by the Director of
Finance in the Hedge Agreement.
Those payments may be secured by a
pledge of Airport Revenues, to the
extent permitted by the Trust Indenture, all as determined by the Director
of Finance and set forth in the Hedge
Agreement. The obligation of the City
to make payments under any Hedge
Agreement does not and shall not represent or constitute a general obligation, debt, bonded indebtedness or a
pledge of the faith and credit of the
City or the State of Ohio. Nothing
gives any party to any Hedge Agreement the right to have excises, ad valorem or other taxes levied by the City
or the State of Ohio for the payment of
any amounts due under any Hedge
Agreement.
In the event the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that it
is necessary to supplement or amend
the Trust Indenture or a Supplemental Indenture in connection with any
Hedge Agreement or any amendment,
modification, novation or termination
of any Hedge Agreement, then, subject to the requirements of Article
XIII of the Trust Indenture, the
Mayor and the Director of Finance
are authorized to sign and deliver a
Supplemental Indenture or amendment of an existing Supplemental
Indenture.
Section 4. Terms of Bonds.
The Bonds shall contain the terms
provided in or determined pursuant
to, the Trust Indenture, this Ordinance, the applicable Certificate of
Award and the applicable Supplemental Indenture. Each series of Bonds
may be secured by a separate Supplemental Indenture, or a single Supplemental Indenture may secure more
than one series of Bonds.
(a) General. The Bonds may be
issued as obligations bearing interest
at fixed or variable rates. The Bonds
may also be issued as obligations
under Federal or State programs that
provide for interest payment subsidies or other financial or credit support. In the event that the Director of
Finance, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, determines
that the City’s best interests will be
served by a series of Bonds bearing
interest at variable interest rates,
then provision shall be made in the
Supplemental Indenture applicable to
that series for the method and procedure by which the variable rate of
interest to be borne by the Bonds of
that series shall be determined
(whether by reference to a market
index, by a remarketing agent or otherwise); provided that no series of
variable rate Bonds shall bear interest at a rate in excess of twenty–five

The City Record
percent (25%) per year (including
any Bonds held by a provider of a
Credit Support Instrument). The
Director of Finance may determine
that the terms of a variable rate
series of Bonds may or may not permit the holders to tender their variable rate Bonds for purchase by the
City. If the Director of Finance designates any series of Bonds as variable
rate Bonds, and if the Holders of that
series of Bonds are to be entitled to
tender those Bonds for purchase, then
the Director of Finance may also designate for those variable rate Bonds
(and may designate others, from time
to time, in substitution therefor), the
tender agent or agents (which may be
the Trustee), the remarketing agent
or agents (which may be any of the
Original Purchasers) and the calculation agent or agents (which may be
any of the Original Purchasers or the
Trustee), which designations shall be
based on the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
that the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed to
provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into agreements with
others in connection with the delivery
of the Bonds, and from time to time
thereafter so long as the Bonds are
outstanding, as may be determined by
the Director of Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for (i)
the method of determining the variable interest rates, (ii) the rights and
procedures for tender, (iii) liquidity
or credit support, (iv) repayment by
the City of any amounts drawn under
the Credit Support Instrument, (v)
the direct purchase of tendered
Bonds, and (vi) other arrangements
in the best interests of the City. The
Director of Finance is further authorized to terminate any such agreements if the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the City’s best interests will be served
by such termination. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to enter
into agreements, from time to time so
long as the variable rate Bonds are
supplementing
or
outstanding,
amending the applicable Supplemental Indenture for a series of Bonds as
provided in Section 7. To the extent
that any fees and expenses associated
with agreements entered into or terminated pursuant to this Section are
not paid from proceeds of the Bonds,
those fees and expenses shall be paid
from Fund Nos. 60 SF 001, 60 SF 104,
60  SF  105, 60 SF 106 and 60 SF 141
and/or passenger facility charges, as

the
Director
of
determined

Director of Port Control.

All Bonds shall be issued in fully registered form. The Bonds initially may
be delivered in book-entry only form,
registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered
owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository, and not transferable or exchangeable (except for
transfer to another Depository or its
nominee) without further action by
the City pursuant to the provisions of
the Trust Indenture.

continue to act as a Depository for the
Bonds of any series held in a
book–entry system, the Director of
Finance and the Trustee may attempt

with another qualified Depository. If
the Director of Finance and the
Trustee do not or are unable to do so,

Trustee, after making provision for
notification of the beneficial owners
by the then Depository and any other
arrangements deemed necessary,

Section 413.031 Use of Automated

(a) Civil Enforcement System
Established. The City of Cleveland
hereby adopts a civil enforcement
system for red light and speeding
offenders photographed by means of
an "automated traffic enforcement
camera system" as defined in division
(p). This civil enforcement system
imposes monetary liability on the
"owner" of a vehicle as defined in
division (p) for failure of an operator
to stop at a traffic signal displaying a
steady red light indication or for the
failure of an operator to comply with
a speed limitation.
(b) Red Light Offense – Liability
Imposed. The owner of a vehicle shall
be liable for the penalty imposed
under this section if the vehicle cross-

34
es a marked stop line or the intersection plane at a system location when
the traffic signal for that vehicle's
direction is emitting a steady red
light
(c) Speeding Offense – Liability
Imposed. The owner of a vehicle shall
be liable for the penalty imposed
under this section if the vehicle is
operated at a speed in excess of the
limitations set forth in Section 433.03.
(d) Liability Does Not Constitute a
Conviction. The imposition of liability under this section shall not be
deemed a conviction for any purpose
and shall not be made part of the operating record of any person on whom
the liability is imposed.
(e) Other Offenses and Penalties
Not Abrogated. Nothing in this section shall be construed as altering or
limiting Sections 433.03 or 413.03 of
these Codified Ordinances, the criminal penalties imposed by those sections, or the ability of a police officer
to enforce those sections against any
offender observed by the officer violating either of those sections. Nothing in this section shall be construed
to limit the liability of an operator of
a vehicle for any violation of division
(b) or (c) of this section.
(f) Selection of Camera Sites. The
selection of the sites where automated cameras are placed and the
enforcement of this ordinance shall

The Director of Public Safety shall
cause the general public to be notified
by means of a press release issued at
least thirty (30) days before any
given camera is made fully operational and is used to issue tickets to
offenders. Before a given camera
issues actual tickets, there shall be a
period of at least two (2) weeks,
which may run concurrently with the
thirty (30) day public-notice period,
during which only "warning" notices
shall be issued.
At each site of a red light or fixed
speed camera, the Director of Public
Works shall cause signs to be posted
to
apprise
ordinarily
observant
motorists that they are approaching
an area where an automated camera
is monitoring for red light or speed
violators. Mobile speed units shall be
plainly marked vehicles.
(h) Notices of Liability. Any ticket
for an automated red light or speeding system violation under this section shall:
(1) Be reviewed by a Cleveland
police officer;
(2) Be forwarded by first-class mail
or personal service to the vehicle's
registered owner's address as given
on the state's motor vehicle registration, and
(3) Clearly state the manner in
which the violation may be appealed.
(i) Penalties. Any violation of division (b) or division (c) of this section
shall be deemed a noncriminal violation for which a civil penalty shall be
assessed and for which no points
authorized by RC 4507.021 ("Point
system for license suspension") shall
be assigned to the owner or driver of
the vehicle.
(j) Ticket Evaluation, Public Service, and Appeals. The program shall
include a fair and sound ticket-evaluation process that includes review by
the vendor and a police officer, a
strong customer-service commitment,
and an appeals process that accords
due process to the ticket respondent
and that conforms to the requirements of the Ohio Revised Code.

1346

August 21, 2013
(k) Appeals. A notice of appeal
shall be filed with the Hearing Officer within twenty-one (21) days from
the date listed on the ticket. The failure to give notice of appeal or pay the
civil penalty within this time period
shall constitute a waiver of the right
to contest the ticket and shall be considered an admission.
Appeals shall be heard by the Parking Violations Bureau through an
administrative process established by
the Clerk of the Cleveland Municipal
Court. At hearings, the strict rules of
evidence applicable to courts of law
shall not apply. The contents of the
ticket shall constitute a prima facie
evidence of the facts it contains. Liability may be found by the hearing
examiner based upon a preponderance of the evidence. If a finding of
liability is appealed, the record of the
case shall include the order of the
Parking Violations Bureau, the ticket, other evidence submitted by the
respondent or the City of Cleveland,
and a transcript or record of the hearing, in a written or electronic form
acceptable to the court to which the
case is appealed.
Liability shall not be found where
the evidence shows that the automated camera captured an event that is
not an offense, including each of the
following events and such others as
may be established by rules and regulations issued by the Director of Public Safety under the authority of division (n) of this section:
(1) The motorist stops in time to
avoid violating a red light indication;
(2) The motorist proceeds through
a red light indication as part of funeral procession;
(3) The motorist is operating a
City-owned emergency vehicle with
its emergency lights activated and
proceeds through a red lightindication or exceeds the posted speed limitation;
(4) The motorist is directed by a
police officer on the scene contrary to
the traffic signal indication.
Liability shall also be excused if a
vehicle is observed committing an
offense where the vehicle was stolen
prior to the offense and the owner has
filed a police report.
The Director of Public Safety, in
coordination with the Parking Violations Bureau, shall establish a
process by which a vehicle owner who
was not the driver at the time of the
alleged offense may, by affidavit,
name the person who the owner
believes was driving the vehicle at
the time. Upon receipt of such an affidavit timely submitted to the Parking
Violations Bureau, the Bureau shall
suspend further action against the
owner of the vehicle and instead
direct notices and collection efforts to
the person identified in the affidavit.
If the person named in the affidavit,
when notified, denies being the driver
or denies liability, then the Parking
Violations Bureau shall resume the
notice and collection process against
the vehicle owner, the same as if no
affidavit had been submitted, and if
the violation is found to have been
committed by a preponderance of evidence, the owner shall be liable for
any penalties imposed for the offense.
A decision in favor of the City of
Cleveland may be enforced by means
of a civil action or any other means
provided by the Ohio Revised Code.
(l) Evidence of Operation. It is
prima facie evidence that the person
registered as the owner of the vehicle
with the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehi-

have the Stager-Beckwith Mansion,
a prominent, historic, architecturally significant landmark, restored by
The Chesler Group, Inc. who specializes in historic restoration; and
Whereas,
located
along
Cleveland’s historic “Euclid Avenue Millionaire’s Row,” the Stager-Beckwith
Mansion at 3813 Euclid Avenue is
one of the few remaining grand
Row mansions that are still standing today; and
Whereas, after completion of the
originally 10,000 square foot masonry residence in 1868, Euclid Avenue
became internationally known for
its wealthy residents and unparalleled architecture, and the early yet
significant
example
of
Second

mansion, sold in 1913 to Cleveland’s
prominent

contributed
to
Euclid
greatly
Avenue’s prestigious status and reputation; and

first buildings in Cleveland to be
placed on the National Register of
Historic Places, highlighting its
importance as a major contributor to
the history and character of Cleveland; and

vacant since 2009; and
Whereas, The Chesler Group, Inc.
now plans to perform a complete
historic restoration of the interior

August 21, 2013
and exterior of the Stager-Beckwith
Mansion in compliance with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for
Rehabilitation of Historic Buildings
to be used for office and conference
space; and
Whereas, restoration of this highly significant structure will ensure
the Mansion’s continued existence
as one of the greatest, and last,
architectural testaments to this period of Cleveland’s history; and
Whereas, the completion of this
project will set a strong example of
the continued importance of the
revitalization of Cleveland’s neighborhoods, will positively stimulate
the local economy with skilled construction jobs and local investment,
and preserve a local landmark that
has received support from Cleveland
State University and the community
at large; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
supports The Chesler Group, Inc.’s
proposal for restoring the StagerBeckwith Mansion as a high priority initiative for future development
in the community for the benefit the
citizens of the City of Cleveland;

Res. No. 978-13.
By Council Members Cimperman
and Cummins.
An emergency resolution endorsing the continued existence of a
Healthy Cleveland through the second initiative of collaboration with
the Mayor and the four hospital systems in Cleveland that are lending
their staff, expertise, and research
efforts to reach this goal.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland and
Cleveland City Council are committed
to creating a Healthy Cleveland with
healthy neighborhoods and residents
who enjoy longer and healthier lives
and by combating chronic health conditions like chronic pulmonary disease, heart disease, diabetes, obesity
and behavioral health; and
Whereas, Cleveland is home to the
four best health care systems in the
United States; Cleveland Clinic,
MetroHealth, Sisters of Charity
Health System, and University Hospitals, and all four institutions support
the mission of creating a Healthy
Cleveland; and
Whereas, Cleveland is also home to
Federally Qualified Health Centers
(FQHC): NEON, Care Alliance, Free

The City Record
Clinic, and Neighborhood Family
Practice (NFP); and
Whereas, to be successful in creating a Healthy Cleveland, the Jackson
Administration, Cleveland City Council and the four health care institutions collaborated beginning in 2011
with the creation of the Healthy
Cleveland initiative with the adoption of Resolution No. 257-11 on March
28, 2011 and will continue to collaborate in this ongoing second initiative
to address nutrition and healthy eating, active living, mental health and
violence, health literacy, healthy
neighborhoods, and clean air and
smoking cessation; and
Whereas, the City has already
banned smoking on and in all City
Properties, including parks, playgrounds, cemeteries, garages, and
areas within 150 feet of any entrance
to any City building or facility,
including City Hall, Recreation Centers, and Public Health Centers, and
has worked to create voluntarilyadopted smoke free zones within the
entrances to privately-owned facilities; and
Whereas, by working collaboratively with local health institutions, we
are continuing to increase the accessibility of city-wide smoking cessation programs to help people quit
smoking; and
Whereas, in June, an Ohio Judge
found unconstitutional the state law
which sought to invalidate the City’s
law banning trans fats, thus allowing
the City law to stand; and
Whereas, along with the law banning trans fats, the City has worked
to encourage local restaurants and
vendors to remove trans-fats from
their menus and offer trans-fat free
products; and
Whereas, an established task force
with our health care partners and the
Cleveland Metropolitan School District is working to provide healthier
food options in our city schools, and
the Healthy Eating Committee is
working with CMSD to re-incorporate
school gardens in every new school
plan; and
Whereas, in collaboration with the
Cleveland Planning Commission the
Health Committee is working to
ensure the existence of a city garden
within walking distance of every citizen in Cleveland by 2019 with the support of the City Planning and Health
Committees; and
Whereas, the City developed a Complete Streets Policy to improve bike
and pedestrian access and improve
mobility on street, streetscape, bridge
improvement projects; and
Whereas, the Healthy Cleveland
Initiative 2.0 has formed subgroups to
continue this work, including Nutrition and Healthy Eating, Clean Air
and Smoking Cessation, Active Living, Healthy Neighborhoods, Mental
Health and Violence, and Health Literacy that have recommended legislative and programmatic initiatives to
reduce health disparities and improve
Clevelanders’ quality of life; and
Whereas, the Nutrition and Healthy
Eating subgroup recommends overall
1) developing healthy food guidelines
for food services provided by City of
Cleveland facilities and encouraging
adoption of guidelines by partners
throughout Cleveland; and 2) promoting the Healthy Corner Store Initiative which seeks to improve offerings
in corner and convenience stores by
giving incentives to store owners to
develop infrastructure and provide

1371

equipment
for
healthy
options,
improve appearance and safety at
stores, and offer Healthy Cleveland
branding and promotion opportunities; and
Whereas, more specific programmatic
recommendations
include
extending healthy food guidelines to
1) the Cleveland Metropolitan School
District by increasing collaboration
for wellness policies and healthy
school meals and partnerships with
the City’s Summer Youth Employment Program and Summer Sprout
Program, 2) early childcare and childhood education centers by implementing health best practices, and 3)
mobile food vendors, as well as corner
stores, by offering incentive programs to increase healthy food offerings; and
Whereas, the Clean Air and Smoking Cessation subgroup recommends
1) exploring a city-wide ban on the
sale of flavored tobacco products similar to legislation passed in New York
City; and 2) encouraging local
enforcement of the smoke-free Workplace Act, and researching federal
funding opportunities for smoking
prevention and cessation programs;
and
Whereas, this Council has already
adopted a resolution to defend and
protect Ohio’s Alternative Energy
Portfolio Standard, as recommended
by the Clean Air and Smoking Cessation subgroup; and
Whereas, the Active Living subgroup recommends 1) identifying
active living deserts in the City by
creating a comprehensive geographic
mapping that highlights parks, recreation centers, bike paths, and active
living programs to provide guidance
for plans to enhance accessible and
affordable active living opportunities
in Cleveland; and 2) creating and
maintaining a user-friendly website
and application focused on Active
Living opportunities and programs in
the City; and
Whereas, the Healthy Neighborhoods subgroup recommends overall
1) integrating health and equity considerations into planning and development processes; and 2) establishing
healthy community design criteria
along with a checklist to be used by
citywide design review committees
within the Department of City Planning, including adoption of community engagement standards; and
Whereas, more specific recommendations include 1) adopting a policy
that ensures continued capacity
building within City Hall to conduct
health impact assessments of policies, projects, and programs; and 2)
identifying evaluation metrics used
to measure the existing health status
of Cleveland neighborhoods and
departmental leadership of data collection activities through Cleveland
City Planning and Cleveland Department of Health and their partners;
and
Whereas, the Mental Health and
Violence subgroup recommends 1)
increasing the awareness and understanding of mental health and addiction to address societal stigma surrounding the illness; 2) informing the
community about agencies and partnering with those agencies who provide treatment services for those
diagnosed or displaying signs of mental illness and addiction; and 3) support funding for research and support
services for mental health wellness;
and

60
Whereas, finally, the Health Literacy subgroup recommends 1) establishing a brand identity for Healthy
Cleveland through the establishment
of a website and logo to reach the
neighborhoods; 2) connecting the
public to a “directory” Clevelanders
can access online, through a web
application or paper that can link
them to health promotion, prevention,
and management services; 3) training
individuals to engage, support, and
link resident to critical health
resources and coordinate programming and outreach efforts in the
neighborhoods; and 4) circulating
resources throughout the community
at the neighborhood level by partnering with libraries and community centers, faith based institutions, block
clubs, civic associations, and our
chamber of commerce; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland and
its Healthy Cleveland partners are
already implementing the recommendations of these Healthy Cleveland
2.0 subgroups in order to continue
efforts to improve the health of every
Clevelander; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council endorses the continued existence of a
Healthy Cleveland through the second initiative of collaboration with

The City Record
Whereas, restoration of this highly significant structure will ensure
the Mansion’s continued existence
as one of the greatest, and last,
architectural testaments to this period of Cleveland’s history; and

State University and the community
at large; and

The Director of Public Safety shall
cause the general public to be notified
by means of a press release issued at
least thirty (30) days before any
given camera is made fully operational and is used to issue tickets to
offenders. Before a given camera
issues actual tickets, there shall be a
period of at least two (2) weeks,
which may run concurrently with the
thirty (30) day public-notice period,
during which only "warning" notices
shall be issued.
At each site of a red light or fixed
speed camera, the Director of Public
Works shall cause signs to be posted
to
apprise
ordinarily
observant
motorists that they are approaching
an area where an automated camera
is monitoring for red light or speed
violators. Mobile speed units shall be
plainly marked vehicles.
(h) Notices of Liability. Any ticket
for an automated red light or speeding system violation under this section shall:
(1) Be reviewed by a Cleveland
police officer;
(2) Be forwarded by first-class mail
or personal service to the vehicle's
registered owner's address as given
on the state's motor vehicle registration, and
(3) Clearly state the manner in
which the violation may be appealed.
(i) Penalties. Any violation of division (b) or division (c) of this section
shall be deemed a noncriminal violation for which a civil penalty shall be

system for license suspension") shall
be assigned to the owner or driver of
the vehicle.
(j) Ticket Evaluation, Public Service, and Appeals. The program shall
include a fair and sound ticket-evaluation process that includes review by
the vendor and a police officer, a
strong customer-service commitment,

84
and an appeals process that accords
due process to the ticket respondent
and that conforms to the requirements of the Ohio Revised Code.
(k) Appeals. A notice of appeal
shall be filed with the Hearing Officer within twenty-one (21) days from
the date listed on the ticket. The failure to give notice of appeal or pay the
civil penalty within this time period
shall constitute a waiver of the right
to contest the ticket and shall be considered an admission.
Appeals shall be heard by the Parking Violations Bureau through an
administrative process established by
the Clerk of the Cleveland Municipal
Court. At hearings, the strict rules of
evidence applicable to courts of law
shall not apply. The contents of the
ticket shall constitute a prima facie
evidence of the facts it contains. Liability may be found by the hearing
examiner based upon a preponderance of the evidence. If a finding of
liability is appealed, the record of the
case shall include the order of the
Parking Violations Bureau, the ticket, other evidence submitted by the
respondent or the City of Cleveland,
and a transcript or record of the hearing, in a written or electronic form
acceptable to the court to which the
case is appealed.
Liability shall not be found where
the evidence shows that the automated camera captured an event that is
not an offense, including each of the
following events and such others as
may be established by rules and regulations issued by the Director of Public Safety under the authority of division (n) of this section:
(1) The motorist stops in time to
avoid violating a red light indication;
(2) The motorist proceeds through
a red light indication as part of funeral procession;
(3) The motorist is operating a
City-owned emergency vehicle with
its emergency lights activated and
proceeds through a red lightindication or exceeds the posted speed limitation;
(4) The motorist is directed by a
police officer on the scene contrary to
the traffic signal indication.
Liability shall also be excused if a
vehicle is observed committing an
offense where the vehicle was stolen
prior to the offense and the owner has
filed a police report.
The Director of Public Safety, in
coordination with the Parking Violations Bureau, shall establish a
process by which a vehicle owner who
was not the driver at the time of the
alleged offense may, by affidavit,
name the person who the owner
believes was driving the vehicle at
the time. Upon receipt of such an affidavit timely submitted to the Parking
Violations Bureau, the Bureau shall
suspend further action against the
owner of the vehicle and instead
direct notices and collection efforts to
the person identified in the affidavit.
If the person named in the affidavit,
when notified, denies being the driver
or denies liability, then the Parking
Violations Bureau shall resume the
notice and collection process against
the vehicle owner, the same as if no
affidavit had been submitted, and if
the violation is found to have been
committed by a preponderance of evidence, the owner shall be liable for
any penalties imposed for the offense.
A decision in favor of the City of
Cleveland may be enforced by means
of a civil action or any other means
provided by the Ohio Revised Code.
