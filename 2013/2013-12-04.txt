Res. No. 1640-13.
By Council Members Brady, Pruitt,
Cimperman, K. Johnson, Cleveland,
Mitchell, Dow, J. Johnson, Conwell,
Miller, Polensek, Brancatelli, Kelley,
Cummins, Zone, Westbrook, Sweeney
and Keane.
An emergency resolution supporting
comprehensive
immigration
reform and urging the U.S. Congress
to enact reforms that ensure economic
strength
and
promote
stronger communities.
Whereas, this Council recognizes
the economic, social and cultural contributions immigrants bring to our
communities and, in particular, to the
City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, since the City's founding
over 217 years ago, immigrants have
had a significant role in Cleveland’s
cultural and economic vitality; and
Whereas, the responsibility of
municipal leaders is to protect the
well-being and safety of all people
residing in their cities; and
Whereas, it is the duty of our local
leaders to respect the rights of, and
provide equal services to, all individuals regardless of national origin or
immigration status; and
Whereas, our nation’s immigration
policies are federal responsibilities
that are in desperate need of reform;
and
Whereas, a talented workforce
made up of both skilled and unskilled
labor is a key driver of our local economy; and
Whereas, there is a need for an
improved program that provides the
City's businesses the opportunity to
employ foreign workers, when necessary, to improve economic competitiveness; and
Whereas, family unity is a component of a strong economy, and re-unification of families has been a key
part of federal immigration policy for
almost fifty years; and
Whereas, there is broad support
and collaboration among both business and labor groups to promote comprehensive immigration reform that
provides sensible and effective solutions; and
Whereas, this Council believes that
any newly enacted comprehensive
immigration reform must:
1. Provide a path to citizenship for
the nearly 11 million undocumented
immigrants who live in the United
States today.

The City Record
2. Establish an improved visa program, such as the proposed W-Visa, to
provide our businesses with the ability to hire certain categories of foreign
workers when legal residents are
unavailable or unwilling to fill jobs.
3. Create a methodology that accurately assesses labor market needs in
order to determine the number of foreign workers to be admitted for
employment purposes annually.
4. Increase efforts to advance workforce talent outreach internationally
and strengthen programs in domestic
science, technology, engineering,
arts, and mathematics (STEAM)
training, to improve ongoing economic competitiveness, while also promoting legal immigration opportunities.
5. Create a streamlined process to
resolve the backlog of existing visa
applications and develop methods to
ensure the efficient processing of
future immigration applications in a
timely manner, which will expedite
re-unification of families.
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports comprehensive immigration
reform and urges the U.S. Congress to
enact reforms that ensure economic
strength and promote stronger communities.
Section 2. That the Clerk of the
Council is directed to transmit copies
of this resolution to the President
Barack Obama, Speaker of the House
of Representatives John Boehner,
Majority Leader of the Senate Harry
Reid, and all Honorable Members of
the U.S. Congress representing the
City of Cleveland.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption

By Council Members Cummins, Conwell, Polensek, Brady, Cleveland,

An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Senate to support Senate
Bill 83 that provides that there is no
period of limitation for the prosecution of an offense of rape and sexual battery.

December 4, 2013
Whereas, according to the National
Crime
Victimization
Survey,
232,960 women in the U.S. were
raped or sexually assaulted in 2006,
which is more than 600 women per
day; and
Whereas, a 2010 survey by the
National Center for Injury Prevention and Control affirmed that sexual violence against women remains
endemic in the United States where
nearly one in five women surveyed
revealed that they had been raped
at some point in their lives; and
Whereas, in a nationally representative survey conducted by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 37.4% of female rape victims were first raped between the
ages of 18 to 24, 29.9% were first
raped between the ages of 11 to 17,
while 12.3% of female rape victims
were first raped when they were
age 10 or younger; and
Whereas, the experience of rape
and sexual assault is so traumatizing to the female victims that many
of them often fail to come forward
to
file
charges
of
the
assault
against the perpetrators, allowing
the perpetrators free to commit more
acts of physical violence against
women; and
Whereas, new technologies such
as rape kits and DNA matching provide scientific evidence that can be
used by law enforcement agencies
to identify the perpetrators of these
crimes and bring them to justice,
and encourages more female victims
to come forward to seek justice; and
Whereas, many of these rape kits
can be used to provide evidence to
cold rape cases that occurred many
years ago, identifying serial predators and bringing them to justice;
and
Whereas, under current state law,
a prosecution for the offense of rape
or sexual battery is barred unless it
is commenced within 20 years after
the offense was committed; and
Whereas, this limitation on prosecution for the offenses of rape or
sexual battery hinders the overall
effectiveness of bringing sexual
predators to justice and fails to
keep communities safe from such
predators; and
Whereas, Senate Bill 83 provides
that there is no period of limitation
for the prosecution of an offense of
rape or sexual battery, thus increasing the opportunity to identify past
sexual predators and bring them to
justice, and by removing the 20 year
limitation by which a woman had to
bring charges, women will have
time to become less traumatized and
more likely to bring charges when
mentally able to do so; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio Senate to support Senate Bill
83 that provides that there is no period of limitation for the prosecution of
an offense of rape and sexual battery.
Section 2. That the Clerk of the
Council is directed to transmit copies
of this resolution to all members of
the Ohio Senate.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it

By Council Members Brancatelli,
Kelley and Cummins.
An emergency resolution opposing
the pending license application to
allow
future
operations
of
the
Bradley Road Landfill in the Old
Brooklyn neighborhood of the City.
Whereas, recently the owner/operators of the Bradley Road Landfill
applied to the City of Cleveland
Department of Health to allow for
future operations of the landfill; and
Whereas, the Landfill has not
been in use for several years, however, it has never been properly
capped and closed; and
Whereas, the Landfill is in violation of many of Ohio’s environmental laws and regulations, including
exposed waste, ponding and erosion,
leachate seeps, leachate discharges
to surface water bodies, and failing
slopes; and
Whereas, the current estimated
cost to cap and close the landfill is
$1,000,000; this cost will increase if
there is not action to bring the
Landfill into compliance with Ohio
laws; and
Whereas, without repair and proper capping and closure of the Landfill, conditions will continue to deteriorate, increasing human health
and safety concerns in an already
dismal health and safety situation;
and
Whereas, future operation of the
Landfill would in actuality be operation of a new facility, which is not
permitted under the City’s Zoning
Code; and
Whereas, a new facility is not permitted under Ohio law because the
Landfill’s license was revoked in
2003 as the facility was in substantial non-compliance with Ohio laws;
nothing has been done to correct
these violations, despite a consent
decree seven years ago calling for
all
violations
to
be
corrected;
instead,
the
facility
has
been
allowed to languish with no waste
having been dumped there for years,
the site rendered unusable with its
buildings torn down; and
Whereas, in order to preserve the
health, safety and welfare of the citizens of this Old Brooklyn neighborhood who have been living with
this abysmally maintained Landfill
for years, the City Health Department must not issue a license to
allow for future operations of the
Bradley Road Landfill; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby
opposes the pending license application to allow future operations of the
Bradley Road Landfill in the Old
Brooklyn neighborhood of the City.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit copies
of this resolution to the Chief of the

An emergency resolution opposing
the impending bank branch closing
of the PNC Bank East 185th – Monterey branch located at 609 East
185th Street.
Whereas, recently, PNC Bank notified customers by letter that it
intends to close the E. 185th – Monterey branch located at 609 East
185th Street, on the Euclid-Cleveland
border and in the middle of the East
185th Street business district; and
Whereas, the E. 185th – Monterey
branch has always been frequently
used and highly supported by the
residents of both Cleveland and
Euclid and businesses in the East
185th Street business district; and
Whereas, closing the E. 185th –
Monterey branch will mean that this
thriving business district and the
surrounding community will have
no close, convenient or easy way to
do banking at a PNC bank; and
Whereas, the East 185th Street
business district has other bank
branches in the district that will
benefit when customers have no
choice by to take their money out of
PNC and move it to another more
convenient location in the East
185th Street business district; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes
the impending bank branch closing of
the PNC Bank East 185th – Monterey
branch located at 609 East 185th
Street.
Section 2. That the Clerk of the
Council is directed to transmit copies
