FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 427-13.
By Council Members Pruitt, K.
Johnson, Miller, Dow, Mitchell, Brancatelli, Cleveland, Keane, Kelley,
Brady, Westbrook, Zone and Cummins.
An emergency resolution urging
Governor Kasich and the Ohio General Assembly to propose and pass
a budget that expands Medicaid eligibility in Ohio.
Whereas, Ohio policymakers have
a unique opportunity to expand Medicaid eligibility to cover people making up to 138% of the federal poverty level, which is $15,420 for an individual or $26,352 for a family of
three; and
Whereas,
such
an
expansion
would be supported by generous federal
funding
levels
that
have
already been set aside for that purpose under the Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act (ACA),
including an average of 95% of the
expansion cost through 2019; and
Whereas, by increasing access to
medical care this way, Ohio would
not only improve the health of
Ohioans, but invest in its economy
too; and
Whereas,
Ohio
Consumers
for
Health Coverage states that if Ohio
expands
Medicaid
eligibility,
at
least 600,000 low-income working
Ohioans who are currently uninsured will have access to health
care through Ohio’s Medicaid managed care plans, and seek more preventive care with better health outcomes as a result; and
Whereas, in addition to health
benefits, expanding Medicaid eligibility will help our economy with an
investment of $20 billion in federal
Medicaid dollars during the years
2014 through 2019 to pay for the
expansion; and
Whereas,
this
investment
will
stimulate the Ohio economy by
going directly into our health care
system, to hospitals, and doctors,
and other providers, and creating
additional jobs, attracting additional businesses, and raising state revenue through income and other
taxes; and
Whereas,
The
Ohio
Medicaid
Expansion Study found that expanding Medicaid eligibility would allow
$1.6 billion in state budget savings
during state fiscal years 2014-2022,
because certain categories of current Medicaid spending would qualify for higher federal matching
rates, letting the state reduce its
spending; also, non-Medicaid spending on health care for the poor and
near-poor
uninsured
would
be
replaced by federal Medicaid dollars, allowing a reduction in state
general fund spending; and
Whereas,
expanding
Medicaid
would generate between 2.7 billion
and 2.8 billion in state revenue during state fiscal years 2014-2022 thorough 1) increased state’s managed
care sales and insurance tax revenue from increased enrollment; 2)

447

9
increased state’s receipt of rebates
from drug manufacturers covering
more Medicaid prescription drug
customers, and finally; 3) resulting
economic activity from the Ohio
health industry and businesses generating sales and income tax revenue; and
Whereas, an estimated $1.8 to 1.9
billion in net state budget gains
over this nine-year period studied by
The Ohio Medicaid Expansion Study
could be redirected to other priorities, including tax relief or education funding; and
Whereas, a Medicaid expansion
would affect Ohio residents during
2022, the final year studied, by
reducing the number of uninsured
Ohio residents by more than 450,000,
creating more than 27,000 Ohio jobs,
reducing health care costs for Ohio
employers and residents by $285 million and $1.1 billion, respectively,
and generating significant savings
and revenues for Ohio counties; and
Whereas,
without
a
Medicaid
expansion, the ACA would create
small, net budget losses during the
state fiscal years 2014-2022 period as
a whole; policymakers would need
to add the Medicaid expansion to
the remainder of the ACA for the
federal legislation to yield net state
budget gains; and
Whereas, if Ohio does not expand
Medicaid eligibility, local hospitals
that rely on decreasing Medicaid
uncompensated care dollars to help
them treat the uninsured will be atrisk of decreasing treatment or closing their doors; and
Whereas, this Council supports
expanding Medicaid eligibility as
the best choice for the health of
Ohioans, community hospitals, and
our economy; and
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
Governor Kasich and the Ohio General Assembly to propose and pass
a budget that expands Medicaid eligibility in Ohio.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
resolution to Governor John Kasich
and the Ohio General Assembly.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.

of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the

respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good

Whereas, this objection is based

The City Record
Whereas, on March 23, 2013, the

the world will come together to
make a bold statement about their
concern for climate change by turning off their lights for one hour
between the 8:30 pm and 9:30 pm;
and
Whereas, in the United States, participants will turn off their lights,
sending a clear message that we
want to “turn out the lights” on
dirty air, dangerous dependency on
foreign
oil
and
costly
climate
change
impacts,
and
make
the
switch to cleaner air, a strong economic future and a more secure
nation; and
Whereas, since its inception six
years ago, Earth Hour has become
a global phenomenon; and
Whereas, more than 6950 cities
and towns in 152 countries worldwide switched off their lights for
Earth Hour 2012, sending a powerful message for action on climate
change; also in 2012, more than
individuals
accepted
an
200,000
Hour
challenge
at
Earth
YouTube.com/EarthHour; and
Whereas, as in years past, during
Earth Hour 2013, iconic buildings
and landmarks from Asia Pacific to
Europe and Africa to the Americas
will be switched off; people across
the world from all walks of life will
turn off their lights and come
together in celebration and contemplation of the one thing we all have
in common — our planet; and
Whereas, in past years, landmarks
from around the world went dark
for
Earth
Hour,
including:
the
Empire State Building; the Brooklyn
Bridge;
Broadway
Theater
Marquees; the Las Vegas Strip; United
Nations Headquarters; the Golden

Whereas,
all
Northeast
Ohio
municipalities, businesses and citizens should pledge to participate in
this year’s Earth Hour; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
local area municipalities, public and

By Mayor Jackson and Council
Members Keane and Pruitt.
An emergency resolution supporting
the
Cleveland
Metropolitan
School District’s application to the
Ohio Board of Education for a waiver from the requirement regarding
the appointment of an Academic
Distress Commission for Cleveland
schools.
Whereas, Mayor Frank Jackson,
in
collaboration
with
business,
labor, education philanthropic and
community leaders, in order to facilitate the improvement of the academic achievement of the students of
the Cleveland Municipal School District (“CMSD”), proposed the Cleveland Education Plan (“the Cleveland
Plan”) to the Ohio General Assembly; and
Whereas, the Ohio General Assembly passed, and Governor John
Kasich signed, Substitute House Bill
525, which amended State law as it
relates to the CMSD and provides
for additional oversight of the CMSD
by the Ohio Department of Education; and
Whereas, CMSD recently received
a letter from the Ohio Department
of Education informing CMSD that
as the district is in Academic Emergency and it has failed to make adequate yearly progress for four or
more consecutive school years, an
Academic
Distress
Commission
would
be
appointed
to
oversee
CMSD; and
Whereas, because the Cleveland
Plan contains such extraordinary
reform efforts and clearly articulated
accountability
measures
for
CMSD, and Ohio law provides that a
municipal school district may apply
for a waiver from certain rules
adopted under Title 33 of the
Revised Code; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public health, welfare, and
safety in that the CMSD Board has
voted to file the necessary application with the Ohio Board of Education to request a waiver from State
appointment of an Academic Distress Commission and this Council
supports the waiver; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the Cleveland Metropolitan
School District’s application to the
Ohio Board of Education for a waiver from the requirement regarding
the appointment of an Academic
Distress Commission for Cleveland
schools.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to send a copy of this resolution to the Ohio Board of Education.
Section 3. That this resolution is
declared to be an emergency measure
and, provided it receives the affirma-

March 27, 2013
tive vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take
effect and be in force immediately

Section 2. Authorized Principal
Amount and Purpose. This Council
finds and determines that it is necessary and proper and in the best
interests of the City to authorize the
issuance of Refunding Bonds as
Additional Bonds under the Trust
Indenture for the purpose of refunding one or more series of Outstanding Bonds, or designated portions
thereof, to obtain aggregate net present value debt service savings of
at least three percent (3%), or to
eliminate or modify covenants that
are unduly restrictive, or to obtain
a more favorable debt service structure or more favorable terms under
Credit Support Instruments. With
respect to Outstanding Bonds that
are short-term or variable-rate obligations, this Council authorizes the
City to issue Refunding Bonds to
refund such Outstanding Bonds, or
designated portions thereof, for any
of the foregoing purposes or for the
purpose that the Director of Finance
has determined, based on the written advice of a Financial Advisor,
that such Outstanding Bonds are
subjecting the City to undesirably
high rates of interest or undesirable
fluctuations in rates of interest or
risks or expenses associated with
Credit
Support
Instruments
or
Hedge Agreements that can economically be avoided or mitigated
through refunding. The principal
amount of each series of Refunding
Bonds is to be the amount set forth
in the Certificate of Award authorized in Section 4 and shall be the
amount determined by the Director
of Finance, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
necessary (i) to refund the Refunded Bonds, (ii) to fund any interest
on the Refunding Bonds, (iii) to
fund any deposit to a reserve fund,
(iv) to pay costs of any Credit Support Instruments, and (v) to pay
costs of issuing the Refunding
Bonds and refunding the Refunded
Bonds. The proceeds from the sale
of the Refunding Bonds shall be
deposited and applied as provided in
the Supplemental Indenture for the
Refunding Bonds and for the purposes stated in this Ordinance, and
those proceeds are appropriated for
those purposes.
Separate
series
of
Refunding
Bonds may be issued at the same or
Refunding
different
times.
The
Bonds of each series shall be designated as provided in the applicable Certificate of Award. A separate
Certificate of Award and a separate
Supplemental
Indenture
may
be
delivered for each series. The proceeds from the sale of each series
of Refunding Bonds shall be allo-

481

43
cated, deposited and applied as provided in the applicable Supplemental Indenture. The Refunding Bonds
shall constitute Bonds for all purposes of the Trust Indenture.
Section 3. Terms of Refunding
Bonds. The Refunding Bonds shall
contain the terms provided in or
determined pursuant to, the Trust
Indenture,
this
Ordinance,
the
applicable Certificate of Award and
the applicable Supplemental Indenture. Each series of Refunding
Bonds may be secured by a separate
Supplemental Indenture, or a single
Supplemental Indenture may secure
more than one series of Refunding
Bonds.
(a) General. The Refunding Bonds
may be issued as obligations bearing interest at fixed or variable
interest rates. In the event that the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, determines that the City’s best
interests will be served by a series
of Refunding Bonds bearing interest
at variable interest rates, then provision shall be made in the Supplemental Indenture applicable to that
series for the method and procedure
by which the variable rate of interest to be borne by the Refunding
Bonds of that series shall be determined (whether by reference to a
market index, by a remarketing
agent or otherwise); provided that
no series of variable rate Refunding
Bonds shall bear interest at a rate
in excess of twenty-five percent
(25%) per year (including any
Refunding Bonds held by a provider
of a Credit Support Instrument). The
Director of Finance may determine
that the terms of a variable rate
series of Refunding Bonds may or
may not permit the holders to tender their variable rate Refunding
Bonds for purchase by the City. If
the Director of Finance designates
any series of Refunding Bonds as
variable rate Refunding Bonds, and
if the Holders of that series of
Refunding Bonds are to be entitled
to tender those Refunding Bonds for
purchase,
then
the
Director
of
Finance shall also designate for
those variable rate Refunding Bonds
(and may designate others, from
time to time, in substitution therefor), the tender agent or agents
(which may be the Trustee) and the
remarketing agent or agents (which
may be any of the Original Purchasers), which designations shall
be based on the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the parties so designated
possess the requisite resources and
experience to provide the services
required of them and that the terms
on which the designated parties
have agreed to provide such services are fair and commercially reasonable.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into agreements with
others in connection with the delivery of the Refunding Bonds, and
from time to time thereafter so long
as the Refunding Bonds are outstanding, as may be determined by
the Director of Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for
(i) the method of determining the
variable interest rates, (ii) the
rights and procedures for tender,
(iii) liquidity or credit support, (iv)
repayment by the City of any
amounts drawn under the Credit

44
Support Instrument, (v) the direct
purchase of Refunding Bonds, and
(vi) other arrangements in the best
interests of the City. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to terminate any such agreements if the
Director
of
Finance
determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the City’s
best interests will be served by such
termination.
The
Director
of
Finance is further authorized to
enter into agreements, from time to
time so long as the variable rate
Refunding Bonds are outstanding,
supplementing
or
amending
the
applicable Supplemental Indenture
for a series of Refunding Bonds as
provided in Section 9. To the extent
that any fees and expenses associated with agreements entered into
or terminated pursuant to this Section are not paid from proceeds of

expenses shall be paid from Program Funds and Nontax Revenues
appropriated for the purpose.
(b) Form; Exchange and Transfer.
All Refunding Bonds shall be issued
in fully registered form. If so provided in the applicable Supplemental Indenture, the Refunding Bonds
may be delivered in book entry
form. The Director of Finance is
authorized to enter into any agreements determined by the Director to
be necessary in connection with a
book-entry system for the Refunding
Bonds, after determining that those
agreements will not endanger the
funds or securities of the City under
the Trust Indenture (as evidenced
by the Director’s signing of those
agreements).
(c) Dates; Denominations. The
Refunding Bonds of each series
shall be dated as of the date or
dates provided in the Certificate of
Award for that series. The Refunding Bonds of each series shall be
issued in the denominations permitted in the Supplemental Indenture
for that series.
(d) Interest and Place of Payment. The Refunding Bonds of each
series shall bear interest at their
respective interest rates specified in
the Certificate of Award or, in the
case of variable rate Refunding
Bonds, determined pursuant to the
Supplemental Indenture for that
series. Refunding Bonds of the same
series and same maturity may bear
interest at different interest rates.
The Refunding Bonds of each series
shall bear interest from the most
recent date to which interest has
been paid or duly provided for or, if
no interest has been paid or duly
provided for, from their date. The
principal and any redemption premium and the interest payable on
each series of Refunding Bonds
shall be payable at the times, to the
persons and in the manner set forth
in, or referenced by, the applicable
Supplemental Indenture.
(e) Maturities. The Refunding
Bonds of each series shall mature
on the dates and in the respective
principal amounts provided in the

be subject to redemption prior to
maturity at the option of the City,
if and to the extent so provided in
the Certificate of Award for that
series. Any Refunding Bonds so

The City Record
determined to be subject to optional
redemption and maturing by their
stated
terms
after
the
earliest
optional redemption date shall be
subject to redemption at the option
of the City on or after the earliest
optional redemption date in whole
or in part on any date at the
redemption prices provided in the
Certificate of Award and in accordance with the applicable Supplemental Indenture and the Trust
Indenture. The Refunding Bonds
may
be
subject
to
mandatory
redemption prior to maturity on the
dates, or upon the occurrence of
events, and at the redemption prices
as determined and provided in the
Certificate of Award and applicable
Supplemental Indenture, including
without limitation, mandatory sinking fund redemption of term bonds
on each mandatory redemption date
in the aggregate amount of the
sinking fund installment to be paid
on such mandatory redemption date.
(g)

Lieu
of
Redemption. The Refunding Bonds
of each series may be subject to purchase by the City in lieu of optional redemption if and to the extent
provided in the Certificate of Award
and the applicable Supplemental
Indenture.
(h) Signing. The Refunding Bonds
shall be signed by the Mayor and
the
Director
of
Finance,
and
approved as to form by the Director
of Law. Any or all of the signatures
of those officials may be facsimiles.
The Refunding Bonds shall bear the
corporate seal of the City or a facsimile thereof.
(i) Numbering. The Refunding
Bonds shall be numbered as determined by the Director of Finance.
Section 4. Award and Sale of
Refunding Bonds.
The Director of Finance shall sign
and deliver a Certificate of Award
for the Refunding Bonds. In the
event the Refunding Bonds are
issued in more than one series sold
at different times, a separate Certificate of Award shall be signed
and delivered for each separately
delivered series. The sale of the
Refunding Bonds shall be awarded
to the Original Purchaser selected
by the Director of Finance and identified in the Certificate of Award. In
the case of Refunding Bonds to be
underwritten in a public offering,
the Director of Finance shall select
the Original Purchaser based on her
evaluation, in consultation with a
Financial Advisor, of the qualifications and relevant experience of
firms that have proposed to underwrite the Refunding Bonds. Alternatively, the Director of Finance
may determine, in consultation with
a Financial Advisor, that more
advantageous terms for the Refunding Bonds may be obtained by the
private placement of the Refunding
Bonds with an investor or investors
(including
financial
institutions)
purchasing for their own account
and not for resale, in which case the
Director of Finance may designate
such investor or investors as the
Original
Purchaser.
In
addition,
each Certificate of Award shall
determine the following, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, consistent with this Ordinance and the Trust Indenture:
(a)
the
aggregate
principal
amount of Refunding Bonds issued;

482

March 27, 2013
(b) the purchase price to be paid
to the City by the Original Purchaser, which amount shall be not
less than: (i) 97% of the amount
determined by adding to the aggregate
principal
amount
of
the
Refunding Bonds any aggregate
original issue premium and subtracting from that amount any
aggregate original issue discount,
plus (ii) any accrued interest on the
Refunding Bonds from their date to
the date of their delivery to the
Original Purchaser;
(c) whether any Refunding Bonds
are to be subject to redemption prior
to maturity, and, if so, the redemption date or the event causing the
prior redemption for those Refunding Bonds and the redemption price,
which may be determined as a percentage of the principal amount
redeemed or by a formula intended
to make the bondholder whole for
the loss of the investment resulting
from the early redemption or by
other methodology;
(d) the dates on which principal
of the Refunding Bonds is to be
paid, which shall be not later than
thirty (30) years from their respective dates of issuance, with an identification of whether the payment is
due by stated maturity or by mandatory sinking fund redemption of
Refunding Bonds of a particular
maturity;
(e) the interest rates to be borne
by Refunding Bonds bearing interest at fixed rates, the weighted
average of which shall not exceed
eight percent (8%), or the method
by which the interest rate is to be
determined for Refunding Bonds
bearing interest at variable rates,
consistent with Section 3;
(f) the particular Outstanding
Bonds or portions thereof to be
Refunded Bonds;
(g) the title and series designation for the Refunding Bonds;
(h) whether the Refunding Bonds
are to be secured by a reserve fund
and, if so, the amount and source of
money to be deposited in the reserve
fund;
(i) the Paying Agent; and
(j) whether any Refunding Bonds
are to be secured by or payable from
a Credit Support Instrument.
It is determined that the terms of
the Refunding Bonds as so determined within the limitations set
forth in this Ordinance and as so
specified and set forth in the Certificate of Award will be in the best
interest of the City and consistent
with all legal requirements.
The Director of Finance may
enter into one or more Bond Purchase Agreements with the Original
Purchasers of Refunding Bonds setting forth the conditions for delivery of the Refunding Bonds that are
consistent with this Ordinance, the
Certificate of Award, and the Trust
Indenture and that are determined
by the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, to be customary for bonds
of similar credit worthiness and tax
status issued by governmental entities, including, without limitation,
representations as to the accuracy
and completeness of information
contained in the Official Statement
of the City described in Section 10.
Section 5. Security for the Refunding Bonds. The Refunding Bonds
shall be special obligations of the
City, and the debt charges on the

March 27, 2013
Refunding Bonds shall be payable
solely from the Net Project Revenues and the Nontax Revenues.
The payment of debt charges on the
Refunding Bonds is secured by a
pledge of and lien on the Bond Fund
held by the Trustee under the Indenture and by any reserve fund for
which provision is made in the
applicable Supplemental Indenture.
The Refunding Bonds are not and
shall not be secured by an obligation or pledge of any money raised
by taxation. The Refunding Bonds
do not and shall not represent or
constitute a debt or pledge of the
faith and credit or taxing power of
the City, and the owners thereof
have and shall have no right to
have taxes levied by the City for the
payment of debt charges thereon.
The Refunding Bonds shall contain
a statement to that effect and to the
effect that the Refunding Bonds are
payable solely from the Net Project
Revenues and the Nontax Revenues
and are not secured by an obligation or pledge of any money raised
by taxation.
The City covenants and agrees
that while the Refunding Bonds are
outstanding, it will appropriate and
maintain Nontax Revenues at such
times and in such amounts as will
be sufficient, together with the Net
Project Revenues and any other
funds available for the purpose, to
pay the debt charges on the Bonds
and will so restrict other obligations
payable from Nontax Revenues prior
to or on a parity with the Bonds as
will ensure the continuing availability for appropriation of sufficient Nontax Revenues to pay debt
charges when due.
Section
6.
Payment
of
Debt
Charges on the Refunding Bonds.
Nothing herein shall be construed as
requiring the City to use or apply to
the payment of debt charges on the
Refunding Bonds any funds or revenues from any source other than
Net Project Revenues and the Nontax
Revenues.
Subject
to
the
requirements of Revised Code Section 176.04, nothing herein, however,
shall be deemed to prohibit the City,
of its own volition, from using, to
the extent that it is authorized by
law to do so, any other resources for
the fulfillment of any of the terms,
conditions or obligations of this
Ordinance or of the Refunding
Bonds.
The City will, solely from the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds or
from the Net Project Revenues or
the Nontax Revenues, pay or cause
to be paid the debt charges on the
Refunding Bonds on the dates, at
the places and in the manner provided herein and in the Refunding
Bonds. For that purpose, in each
year while the Refunding Bonds are
outstanding, this Council, after providing for the payment of debt
charges payable on the City’s general obligation securities in that
year from sources available for that
purpose, will appropriate Nontax
Revenues required to pay, and for
the purpose of paying, the debt
charges due in that year on the
Bonds (less other money available
for the purpose) and any outstanding parity obligations payable from
Revenues.
Further,
this
Nontax
Council will give effect to such
appropriations in all ordinances it
passes thereafter in that year appropriating money for expenditure and

The City Record
encumbrance and limit the other
appropriations of Nontax Revenues
in that year to the amount available
after deducting the amount required
for the payment of debt charges
payable on the City’s general obligation securities and to pay those
debt charges. The City covenants
that, so long as any of the Refunding Bonds are outstanding, it shall
not issue any additional obligations
payable from the Nontax Revenues
on a parity with the Bonds and any
other outstanding parity obligations
payable
from
Nontax
Revenues,
unless, prior to passage of the ordinance authorizing such parity obligations, the Director of Finance shall
have certified to this Council that
the Nontax Revenues during the preceding calendar year, adjusted to
reflect, if necessary, changes in the
rates or charges resulting in the
Nontax
Revenues,
aggregate
in
amount not less than 100% of the
highest amount of (a) debt charges
on the Bonds and (b) required payments on such proposed parity obligations and any other outstanding
parity obligations due in any succeeding calendar year.
obligation
of
the
City
Each
required to be undertaken pursuant
to this Ordinance and the Refunding
Bonds is binding upon the City, and
upon each officer or employee of the
City as may from time to time have
the authority under law to take any
action on behalf of the City as may
be necessary to perform all or any
part of such obligation, as a duty of
the City and of each of those officers and employees resulting from
an office, trust or station within the
meaning of Section 2731.01 of the
Revised Code, providing for enforcement by writ of mandamus.
Section 7. Authorization of Supplemental Indentures. The Director
of Finance is authorized, in the
name and on behalf of the City, to
sign and deliver to the Trustee, in
trust for the holders of the Refunding Bonds, one or more Supplemental Indentures, approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, not inconsistent with this Ordinance or the Certificate of Award,
and not substantially adverse to the
City as may be approved by the
Director of Finance. The determination by the Director of Finance that
a Supplemental Indenture is not substantially adverse to the City shall
be conclusively evidenced by the
signing and delivery of that Supplemental Indenture by the Director
of
Finance.
Any
Supplemental
Indenture may contain amendments
to the Trust Indenture, as theretofor
amended, or amend and restate the
Trust Indenture, to permit increased
flexibility for the use of financial or
credit structures and techniques
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
in the best interests of the City.
Section 8. Escrow Agreement. The
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign and deliver, in the name and
on behalf of the City, an escrow
agreement between the City and the
Trustee, as escrow trustee, providing for, among other matters: the
investment and holding in escrow of
the
proceeds
of
the
Refunding
Bonds to be applied to the refunding of Refunded Bonds; the application of the moneys derived from
those investments to the payment of

483

45
the debt service charges on the
Refunded Bonds; and the irrevocable
call for redemption of the Refunded
Bonds. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the escrow agreement from
proceeds of the Refunding Bonds to
the extent available and then from
Program Funds and Nontax Revenues appropriated for that purpose.
Provision shall be made in the
escrow
agreement
to
give
the
Trustee
any
written
notice
of
redemption required under the Trust
Indenture or applicable Supplemental
Indenture.
The
Director
of
Finance and other appropriate City
officials shall sign all documents
and take all other actions necessary
or appropriate on the part of the
City to effect such refunding in
accordance with the Trust Indenture
or applicable Supplemental Indenture and to cause the Refunded
Bonds to be deemed paid and discharged, including without limitation, the retention of an independent
firm of accountants to verify the
mathematical accuracy of the calculations relating to the escrow.
Section 9. Conversion and Remarketing. In the event that the Director of Finance determines, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, that it is advantageous to
the City to convert the interest on
any
Outstanding
Bonds
bearing
interest at variable rates to fixed
interest rates for a period of time or
to maturity, or to convert the interest on any Outstanding Bonds to a
different variable rate period or
mode, or to terminate or take other
actions with respect to any existing
Credit Support Instrument that will
require a tender and remarketing of
any Outstanding Bonds under the
Trust Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture for that series of Outstanding Bonds (such conversion or
other actions and the tender and
remarketing being collectively referred to in this Section as “remarketing”), the City shall undertake
the remarketing in accordance with
the Trust Indenture and the Supplemental Indenture for that series of
Outstanding Bonds. In connection
with any remarketing of Bonds, the
Director of Finance is authorized to
take such actions that she determines, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, will facilitate the remarketing of the Bonds
or otherwise be in the best interests
of the City, including without limitation, obtaining one or more Credit Support Instruments, terminating
any Credit Support Instrument, and
entering into agreements with one
or more purchasers for their direct
purchase of the remarketed Bonds
in lieu of a public offering of the
Bonds by a remarketing agent. In
the event the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
it is necessary to supplement or
amend the Supplemental Indenture
applicable to a series of Bonds to be
remarketed in order to address current market conditions or to permit
the use of or to terminate a Credit
Support Instrument or otherwise
obtain
financing
arrangements
advantageous to the City, the Director of Finance is authorized to sign
and deliver an amendment of that
Supplemental
Indenture,
or
an

46
amended and restated Supplemental
Indenture, approved as to form by
the Director of Law, subject to the
Trust Indenture.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized to satisfy any requirement for a reserve fund for any
Bonds then outstanding under the
Trust Indenture by the deposit of a
Credit Support Instrument in lieu of
cash, as provided in the Trust Indenture and applicable Supplemental
to
apply
cash
Indenture,
and
released from a reserve fund to the
payment of costs of remarketing the
Bonds for which the interest rate
has been converted from variable
rates of interest to fixed rates of
interest. To the extent the costs of
remarketing are not paid from any
cash released from a reserve fund,
those costs shall be paid from Program Funds and Nontax Revenues
appropriated for that purpose.
The Director of Finance is authorized to prepare one or more disclosure documents in connection with
any conversion and remarketing
under the same terms and conditions
as set forth in Section 10 of this
Ordinance with respect to Refunding Bonds. The Director of Finance
and other City officials, as appropriate under the Charter, are authorized to sign and deliver such
instruments, certificates and documents as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions
authorized by this Section. The
Director of Finance and other City
officials, as appropriate under the
Charter, are authorized to make the
necessary arrangements on behalf
of the City to establish the date,
location, procedure and conditions
for the conversion and remarketing
of any series of Outstanding Bonds
and to take all actions necessary to
effect the conversion and remarketing of any series of Outstanding
Bonds under the terms of this Ordinance, the Trust Indenture and the
Supplemental Indenture for that
series of Outstanding Bonds. The
Clerk of Council shall furnish the
Remarketing Agent a true transcript of proceedings certified by
the Clerk or other official, of all proceedings had with reference to the
conversion and remarketing of any
series of Outstanding Bonds along
with
such
information
for
the
records as is necessary to determine
the validity of the conversion and
remarketing.
Section 10. Official Statements;
Continuing Disclosure. The Director
of Finance is authorized, on behalf
of the City and in her official capacity, to (i) prepare or cause to be prepared, and make or authorize modifications, completions or changes of
or supplements to, disclosure documents in the form of a preliminary
official statement relating to the
issuance of the Refunding Bonds,
and (ii) determine, and certify or
otherwise represent, when the preliminary official statement as so
prepared is a “deemed final” official
statement
(except
for
permitted
omissions) by the City as of its date
for
purposes
of
Securities
and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Rule
15c2-12(b)(1). The distribution and
use of a preliminary official statement is authorized and approved.
The Director of Finance is also
authorized, on behalf of the City
and in her official capacity, to complete the preliminary official state-

The City Record
ment
with
such
modifications,
changes and supplements as the
Director of Finance shall approve or
authorize for the purpose of preparing and determining, and to certify
or otherwise represent, that the official statement as so revised is a
final official statement for purposes
of SEC Rule 15c2-12(b) (3) and (4).
The Director of Finance is further
authorized to use and distribute, or
authorize the use and distribution
of, a final official statement and
supplements thereto in connection
with the original issuance of the
Refunding Bonds as may, in her
judgment, be necessary or appropriate. The Director of Finance is further authorized to sign and deliver,
on behalf of the City and in her official capacity, a final official statement and such certificates in connection with the accuracy of the preliminary official statement and the
final official statement and any
amendments thereto as may, in their
judgment, also be necessary or
appropriate. The Director of Finance
is authorized to contract for services
for the production and distribution
of preliminary and final official
statements, including by printed and
electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Refunding Bonds, the City
agrees, in accordance with, and as
an obligated person with respect to
the Refunding Bonds under, SEC
Rule 15c2 12, to provide or cause to
be provided such financial information and operating data and notices,
in such manner, as may be required
for purposes of SEC Rule 15c2 12. In
order to describe and specify certain
terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for that purpose,
and
thereby
to
implement
that
agreement, including provisions for
enforcement, amendment and termination, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare, or cause to be
prepared, and to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
a continuing disclosure agreement
or certificate, which shall constitute
the continuing disclosure agreement
made by the City for the benefit of
the holders and beneficial owners of
the Refunding Bonds in accordance
with SEC Rule 15c2 12. The performance of that agreement shall be
subject to the availability of funds
and their annual appropriation to
costs
the
City
would
be
meet
required to incur to perform it.
Section 11. Ratings; Credit Enhancement. If, in the judgment of
the Director of Finance, based on
written advice of a Financial Advisor, the filing of an application for
a rating on the Bonds of any series
by one or more nationally recognized rating agencies is in the best
interests of the City, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare
and submit those applications and to
provide to each such agency such
information as may be required for
the
purpose.
The
Director
of
Finance is authorized to contract,
from time to time, for one or more
Credit Support Instruments for any
series of Bonds or any Hedge Agreement if the Director determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the Credit
Support Instrument will result in
savings to the City, will stabilize
interest rates or minimize the risk
of increased interest expense or

484

March 27, 2013
increased risks, burdens, or other
costs
associated
with
hedging
arrangements or relating to Bonds
or reserve requirements. The Director of Finance is further authorized
to agree to the amendment, replacement, assignment or termination of
any Credit Support Instrument if the
of
Finance
determines,
Director
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the City’s
best interests will be served by such
amendment,
replacement,
assignment or termination. In the event
the Director of Finance determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that it is necessary to supplement or amend the
Trust Indenture or a Supplemental
Indenture in order to permit the use
of, or to amend, replace, assign or
terminate, a Credit Support Instrument, the Director of Finance is
authorized to sign and deliver a
Supplemental Indenture amending
the Trust Indenture or an amendment of a Supplemental Indenture,
approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law. The costs of
obtaining credit ratings and the
costs
of
amending,
replacing,
assigning or terminating each Credit Support Instrument, except to the
extent paid from proceeds of Bonds
shall be paid from Program Funds
and Nontax Revenues appropriated
or to be appropriated for that purpose.
Section 12. Authorization of Hedging
Arrangements.
This
Council
finds that by engaging in interest
rate hedging arrangements with
respect to Bonds the City may
reduce its cost of borrowing by optimizing the relative amounts of fixed
and variable rate obligations, or
minimizing the risk of variations in
its debt service costs, or obtaining
savings by confirming rates of interest on Bonds in advance of their
issuance. To permit the City to have
the flexibility to undertake interest
rate swap, swaption, rate cap, rate
collar and other hedging transactions, from time to time, and to
establish the procedures for approving those transactions, this Council
authorizes the signing and delivery
of one or more agreements (each, a
“Hedge Agreement”) and any related agreements necessary for the
consummation of the transactions
contemplated by each Hedge Agreement. The authorizations in this Section are supplemental to and not in
derogation of any authority provided by any other ordinance of this
Council concerning hedging arrangements.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is to the financial advantage of the City and in the City’s
best
interests
that
a
hedging
arrangement be undertaken by the
City with respect to any Bonds
issued or to be issued under the
Trust Indenture, the Director of
Finance may authorize one or more
interest rate hedge transactions in
the
applicable
accordance
with
Hedge Agreement; provided that the
term of each hedge transaction shall
not exceed the final maturity of the
Bonds to which the hedge relates.
The Director of Finance shall
negotiate the terms of each Hedge
Agreement. The City shall receive a
written opinion of a Financial Advisor that the payments made or to be

March 27, 2013
made by the counterparty to the
City, or by the City to the counterparty, shall be fair value for the
Hedge
Agreement,
considering,
among other things, the credit of
the City, the credit of the counterparty and the terms and conditions
of the Hedge Agreement. The Director of Finance shall determine the
terms and conditions of the Hedge
Agreement, including without limitation, the time or times and procedures for the exercise by the counterparty or the City, as the case may
be, of any option under the Hedge
Agreement, whether the obligations
of the City under the Hedge Agreement shall be secured by a Credit
Support Instrument, and the rates to
be paid by the counterparty to the
City and by the City to the counterparty under the Hedge Agreement in the event of the exercise of
the option. The approval of each
interest rate hedge transaction by
the Director of Finance shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing
and
delivery
of
the
applicable
Hedge Agreement by the Director of
Finance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into an amendment,
modification or novation of any
Hedge Agreement or any Credit Support Instrument securing a Hedge
Agreement or to terminate any
Hedge Agreement, in whole or in
part, if the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
(a) the amendment, modification,
novation or termination is (i) justified by the corresponding benefit to
the City, (ii) commercially reasonable based on then-current market
conditions, and (iii) in the City’s
best interests, and (b) any payments
made or to be made by the counterparty to the City, or by the City to
the counterparty, are fair value for
such amendment, modification, novation or termination, given the credit of the counterparty and the terms
and conditions of the amendment,
modification, novation or termination. To the extent that any amounts
to be paid by the City in connection
with any such amendment, modification, novation or termination are
not paid from proceeds of Refunding Bonds, those amounts shall be
paid from Program Funds and Nontax Revenues appropriated for the
purpose.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from Net Project Revenues and Nontax Revenues. The obligation of the
City to make payments under any
Hedge Agreement does not and
shall not represent or constitute a
general obligation, debt, bonded
indebtedness or a pledge of the faith
and credit of the City or the State.
Nothing gives any party to any
Hedge Agreement the right to have
excises, ad valorem or other taxes
levied by the City or the State for
the payment of any amounts due
under any Hedge Agreement.
In the event the Director of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is necessary to supplement or amend the Trust Indenture
or a Supplemental Indenture in connection with any Hedge Agreement
or any amendment, modification,
novation or termination of any
Hedge Agreement, the Director of
Finance is authorized to sign and

The City Record
deliver a Supplemental Indenture or
amendment of an existing Supplemental Indenture.
Section 13. Financial Advisor. The
Director of Finance may obtain the
services of one or more Financial
Advisors, from time to time, to
assist the Director of Finance in
making any of the determinations
required by this Ordinance to be
determined
by
the

Ord. No. 313-13.
By Council Member Kelley (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the refunding of outstanding
stadium nontax revenue bonds.
Whereas, the City issued nontax
revenue
obligations
in
2004
to
refund obligations issued in 1999 to
pay a portion of the costs of constructing Cleveland Browns Stadium, and those obligations are currently outstanding in the principal
amount of $10,575,000 (the “Prior
Bonds”); and
Whereas, the City seeks to obtain
debt service savings by refunding
the Prior Bonds by the obligations
authorized in this Ordinance (the
“Bonds”); and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of the City, has certified to this Council that the estimated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be refinanced with
the proceeds of the Bonds is at least
five (5) years and the maximum
maturity of the Bonds is August 1,
2029; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department and providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that authorizing the
refunding of the Prior Bonds is necessary to enable the City to respond
to market conditions on a timely
basis to achieve debt service savings; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. This Council
finds and determines that it is necessary and proper and in the best
interests of the City to authorize the
issuance of Bonds for the purpose of
refunding the Prior Bonds, or des-

48
ignated portions thereof, to obtain
aggregate net present value debt
service savings of at least three percent (3%). The principal amount of
the Bonds is to be set forth in the
Certificate of Award (defined in Section 2) and shall be the amount
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor (defined in Section 14), to be necessary
(i) to refund the Prior Bonds being
refunded, (ii) to fund any interest
on the Bonds, (iii) to fund any
deposit to a reserve fund, (iv) to
pay costs of any credit support
instruments, and (v) to pay costs of
issuing the Bonds and refunding the
Prior Bonds.
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the Constitution and laws of the
state of Ohio, the Charter of the City
and this Ordinance in the principal
amount and for the purpose stated
in Section 1. The Bonds shall be designated “Nontax Revenue Refunding
Bonds” and may bear such further
designation as may be determined
by the Director of Finance. The
Bonds shall be issued in one lot as
fully registered Bonds in denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. The Bonds shall be
numbered as determined by the
Director of Finance.
The Bonds shall be dated the date
of their delivery or such other date
specified in the certificate of the
Director of Finance providing for
the final terms of the Bonds and the
sale of the Bonds in accordance
with this Ordinance (the “Certificate
of Award”). The Bonds may be
issued as obligations the interest on
which
is
excluded
from
gross
income for federal income tax purposes (“Tax-Exempt Obligations”)
or as obligations the interest on
which is included in gross income
for federal income tax purposes
(“Taxable Obligations”), as determined by the Director of Finance.
The Bonds shall bear interest at the
rate or rates per year specified in
the Certificate of Award; provided
that the weighted average interest
rate (taking into account the principal amount and maturity of each
Bond to which a rate applies) shall
not exceed six percent (6%) per
year if the Bonds are issued as TaxExempt Obligations or eight percent
(8%) per year if the Bonds are
issued as Taxable Obligations. Interest on the Bonds shall be payable,
until the principal amount is paid,
semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year or on such other
dates specified in the Certificate of
(the “Interest Payment Dates.
The Bonds shall mature on December 1 in the years and amounts set
forth in the Certificate of Award,
provided that (i) each principal payment shall occur on an Interest Payment Date, (ii) the final maturity
date of the Bonds shall be no later
than August 1, 2029, and (iii) the
principal amount payable in any fiscal year shall not exceed $2,000,000.
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the “Mandatory Redemption Dates”)

The City Record
on which the principal amount of
the Term Bonds shall be payable
pursuant to mandatory sinking fund
installments rather than at stated
maturity and the amount of principal to be paid on each Mandatory
Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements”).
Section 3. Redemption. The Bonds
shall be subject to redemption prior
to stated maturity as follows:
(a) Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and
to
pursuant
shall
be
redeemed
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption
price of 100 percent of the principal
amount
redeemed,
plus
interest
accrued to the redemption date, on
the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to be
deposited in the Debt Service Fund
(as defined in Section 7) for payment of principal of and interest on
any
Term
Bonds
shall
include
amounts sufficient to redeem on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates the
principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided
below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 4) for cancellation any
Term Bonds in any aggregate principal amount and to receive a credit against the Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements (and
corresponding mandatory redemption obligations) of the City for
such Term Bonds. A credit against
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligations) also shall be received
by the City for any Term Bonds
which
prior
thereto
have
been
redeemed (other than through the
operation of the Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements) or
purchased for cancellation and canceled by the Registrar, to the extent
not applied theretofore as a credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation. On or before the fortyfifth
(45th)
day
preceding
the
applicable Mandatory Redemption
Date, the City shall furnish a certificate to the Registrar, signed by
the Director of Finance, setting
forth the years and respective principal amounts of the credit to be
applied with respect to the Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements. If the certificate is
not timely furnished to the Registrar, the credit shall be applied to
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligations) in inverse order of
maturity. Each Term Bond so delivered, or previously redeemed, or purchased and canceled, shall be credited by the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of the principal amount thereof against the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligations) set forth in
the certificate of the Director of
Finance.
(b)
Optional
Redemption.
The
Bonds may be subject to redemption
prior to maturity by and at the

486

March 27, 2013
option of the City, in whole or in
part on any date, in integral multiples of $5,000, on the optional
redemption dates and at the redemption prices specified in the Certificate of Award, plus, in each case,
accrued interest to the redemption
date. The redemption price may be
determined as a percentage of the
principal amount redeemed or by a
formula intended to make the bondholder whole for loss of the investment
resulting
from
the
early
redemption or by other methodology.
The Director of Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award
that it is in the best interests of the
City for the Bonds not to be callable
prior to their stated maturity.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar. That notice shall specify
the redemption date and the principal amount of each maturity of
Bonds to be redeemed, and shall be
given at least thirty (30) days prior
to the redemption date or such shorter period as shall be acceptable to
the
Registrar.
There
shall
be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date funds
sufficient to redeem at the redemption price all of the redeemable
Bonds for which notice of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Bonds by lot when Bonds of
denominations greater than $5,000
are then outstanding, each $5,000
unit of principal thereof shall be
treated as though it were a separate
Bond of the denomination of $5,000.
If it is determined that one or more,
but not all of the $5,000 units of
principal amount represented by a
Bond are to be called for redemption, then upon notice of redemption
of a $5,000 unit or units, the registered owner of that Bond shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i)
for payment of the redemption price
of the $5,000 unit or units called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption and any
premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.

March 27, 2013
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least twenty (20) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph, the Bonds and portions
thereof called for redemption shall
become due and payable on the
redemption date, and, upon presentation and surrender at the place or
places specified in that notice, shall
be paid. If money for the redemption of all of the Bonds and portions
thereof to be redeemed, including
interest accrued to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, and, if notice of
redemption has been deposited in
the mail, then from and after the
redemption date those Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall cease to bear interest and
no longer shall be considered to be
outstanding. If that money shall not
be so available on the redemption
date, or that notice shall not have
been deposited in the mail, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held by the Registrar for the redemption of particular Bonds shall
be held in trust for the account of
the registered owners and shall be
paid to them, respectively, upon presentation and surrender of those
Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar as paying agent. Principal
shall be payable when due upon preand
surrender
of
the
sentation
Bonds at the principal corporate
trust office of the Registrar. Interest on a Bond shall be paid on each
Interest Payment Date by check or
draft mailed to the person in whose
name the Bond was registered, and
to that person’s address appearing,
on the Bond Register (as defined in
Section 4) at the close of business
on the date provided in the Agreement authorized in Section 4 (the
“Record Date”).
Section 4. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agent. The Bonds
shall express upon their faces the
purpose for which they are issued

The City Record
and that they are issued pursuant to
this Ordinance. The Bonds shall be
signed by the Mayor and by the
Director of Finance. Either or both
of those signatures may be a facsimile. The Bonds shall bear the
seal of the City, which may be a facsimile. The Director of Law shall
evidence approval of the form and
correctness of the Bonds by her
manual or facsimile signature.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating agent, bond registrar, transfer
agent and paying agent for the
Bonds (the “Registrar”). The Director of Finance shall sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
the
Registrar
Agreement
City,
between the City and the Registrar
(the “Agreement”) in substantially
the form as is now on file with the
Clerk of Council in File No. 313-13A. The Agreement is approved, together with any changes or amendments that are not inconsistent with
this Ordinance and not substantially adverse to the City and that are
approved by the Director of Finance
on behalf of the City, all of which
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Agreement or
amendments to the Agreement by
the Director of Finance. The Director of Law shall determine and
approve the form and correctness of
the Agreement. The Director of
Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and
for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Agreement
from the proceeds of the Bonds to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its designated corporate
trust office all books and records
necessary
for
the
registration,
exchange and transfer of Bonds as
provided in this Section (the “Bond
Register”). Subject to the provisions
of Section 5 with respect to beneficial owners, the person in whose
name a Bond is registered on the
Bond Register shall be regarded as
the absolute owner of that Bond for
all purposes of this Ordinance. Payment of or on account of the debt
charges on any Bond shall be made
only to or upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall be affected by any notice
to the contrary, but the registration
may be changed as provided in this
Section. All such payments shall be
valid and effectual to satisfy and
discharge the City’s liability upon
the Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Bond at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
legally
owner
or
by
a
person
empowered to do so in a form sat-

487

49
isfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Bonds
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
Ordinance, as the Bonds surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized: (i) the
Bonds may be issued in the form of
a single, fully registered Bond representing each maturity and regis-

50
tered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the beneficial
owners in book entry form shall
have no right to receive Bonds in
the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for
transfer to another Depository or to
another nominee of a Depository,
without further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Bonds from the Depository,
and the Registrar shall authenticate
and deliver bond certificates in registered form to the assigns of the
Depository or its nominee, all at the
cost and expense (including any
costs of printing), if the event is not
the result of City action or inaction,
of those persons requesting such
issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
authorized
and
directed
to
the
extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 5. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking
Fund and, if not purchased by them,
shall be offered to the Treasury
Investment Account for purchase
and, if not purchased for that
Account, shall be sold to one or
more underwriters or other firms or
persons selected by the Director of
Finance and identified in the Certificate of Award (the “Original Purchaser”). The Certificate of Award
shall specify the final terms of the
Bonds in accordance with law, the
provisions of this Ordinance, the
written advice of a Financial Advisor (defined in Section 14), and the
Original Purchaser’s offer to purchase the Bonds, including: the principal amount of the Bonds, the purchase price (which shall be not less
than 97% of the principal amount
plus accrued interest to their date of
delivery), the interest rate or rates,
the amounts and years in which
principal is payable (at stated maturity or pursuant to Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements), the Interest Payment Dates
and the date of the Bonds (if different from those set forth in Section 2) and any other matters
required in this Ordinance to be set
forth in that Certificate.

The City Record
The
Mayor,
the
Director
of
Finance, the Director of Law and
other City officials, as appropriate
under the Charter, are, and each of
them is, authorized to take such
actions as are necessary, appropriate and in the best interest of the
City to establish the terms and
requirements for delivery of the
Bonds and to make such arrangements as are necessary with the
Original Purchaser in order to establish the date, location, and procedure, and conditions for the delivery
of the Bonds to the Original Purchaser,
to
give
all
appropriate
notices and certificates, to cause a
true transcript of proceedings with
reference to the issuance of the
Bonds to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Director of Finance may
enter into a bond purchase agreement with the Original Purchaser on
behalf of the City (the “Bond Purchase Agreement”), approved as to
form and correctness by the Director of Law, setting forth the terms
and conditions on which the City
agrees to sell the Bonds and the
Original Purchaser agrees to buy
the Bonds on terms consistent with
this Ordinance and that are determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, to be customary
for bonds of similar credit worthiness and tax status issued by governmental entities. It is determined
that the terms of the Bonds, as provided in this Ordinance and as may
be provided in or pursuant to the
Certificate of Award, are in the best
interest of the City and in compliance with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an Official
Statement is appropriate or necessary in connection with the original
issuance of the Bonds, the Director
of Finance is authorized to prepare
or cause to be prepared on behalf of
the City an Official Statement and
any necessary supplements and to
authorize the use and distribution of
that Official Statement and any supplements. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign and deliver on
behalf of the City and in her official capacity the Official Statement
and such certificates in connection
with the accuracy of the Official
Statement and any supplements as
may, in her judgment, be necessary
or appropriate. She is also authorized to determine and certify on
behalf of the City that such disclosure document is “deemed final” by
the City within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission
Rule 15c2-12 (the “SEC Rule”). The
Director of Finance is authorized to
contract for services for the production and distribution of preliminary
and final official statements, including by printed and electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with the SEC Rule as
the only obligated person with

488

March 27, 2013
respect to the Bonds, to provide or
cause to be provided such financial
information and operating data and
notices, in such manner, as may be
required for purposes of the SEC
Rule. In order to describe and specify certain terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
and directed to prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Bonds in accordance
with the SEC Rule. The performance
of that Agreement shall be subject
to the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it. The Director of
Finance is further authorized and
directed to establish procedures in
order to ensure compliance by the
City with its continuing disclosure
agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices.
Section 6. Source of Payment of
the Bonds. The Bonds shall be special obligations of the City, and the
debt charges on the Bonds shall be
payable solely from moneys of the
City which are not moneys raised by
taxation, to the extent available for
the purpose of paying debt charges
on the Bonds, including, but not limited to the following: (a) grants
from the United States of America
and the state of Ohio (the “State”);
(b) payments in lieu of taxes now
or hereafter authorized by State
statute; (c) fines and forfeitures
which are deposited in the City’s

which are deposited in the City’s
General Fund; (h) gifts and donations; and (i) all rental payments
which are deposited in the City’s
General
Fund
(collectively,
the
“Nontax Revenues”). The Bonds are
not and shall not be secured by an
obligation or pledge of any money
raised by taxation. The Bonds do
not and shall not represent or constitute a debt or pledge of the faith
and credit or taxing power of the
City, and the owners thereof have
and shall have no right to have
taxes levied by the City for the payment of debt charges thereon. The
Bonds shall contain a statement to
that effect and to the effect that the
Bonds are payable solely from the
Revenues
and
are
not
Nontax
secured by an obligation or pledge
of any money raised by taxation.
The City covenants and agrees
that while the Bonds are outstanding, it will appropriate and maintain
Nontax Revenues at such times and
in such amounts as will be sufficient, together with any other funds
available for the purpose, to pay the
debt charges on the Bonds and will
so restrict other obligations payable
from Nontax Revenues prior to or on

March 27, 2013
a parity with the Bonds as will
ensure the continuing availability
for appropriation of sufficient Nontax Revenues to pay debt charges
when due.
Section 7. Debt Service Fund; Payment of Debt Charges on the Bonds.
There is created by the City a separate fund or account designated as
the “Nontax Revenue Refunding
Bonds (Cleveland Stadium Project)
Debt Service Fund” (referred to in
this Ordinance as the “Debt Service
Fund”). There shall be deposited in
the Debt Service Fund, on or prior
to the date debt charges on the
Bonds are due, Nontax Revenues in
an amount sufficient to pay those
debt charges. Money in the Debt Service Fund shall be invested in accordance with the City’s investment
policies then in effect. The payment
of debt service on the Bonds is
secured by a pledge of and lien on
the Debt Service Fund. The City
shall not be required to use or apply
to the payment of debt charges on
the Bonds any funds or revenues
from any source other than the Nontax Revenues. However, the City, of
its own volition, is not prohibited
from using, to the extent that it is
authorized by law to do so, any
other resources for the fulfillment of
any of the terms, conditions or obligations of this Ordinance or of the
Bonds.
The City will, solely from the proceeds of the Bonds or from the Nontax Revenues, pay or cause to be
paid the debt charges on the Bonds
on the dates, at the places and in
the manner provided in this Ordinance and in the Bonds. For that
purpose, in each year while the
Bonds are outstanding, this Council,
after providing for the payment of
debt charges payable on the City’s
general obligation securities in that
year from sources available for that
purpose, will appropriate Nontax
Revenues required to pay, and for
the purpose of paying, the debt
charges due in that year on the
Bonds (less other money available
for the purpose) and any outstanding parity obligations payable from
Nontax
Revenues.
Further,
this
Council will give effect to such
appropriations in all ordinances it
passes thereafter in that year appropriating money for expenditure and
encumbrance and limit the other
appropriations of Nontax Revenues
in that year to the amount available
after deducting the amount required
for the payment of debt charges
payable on the City’s general obligation securities and to pay those
debt charges. The City covenants
that, so long as any of the Bonds
are outstanding, it shall not issue
any additional obligations payable
from the Nontax Revenues on a parity with the Bonds and any outstanding parity obligations payable
from Nontax Revenues, unless, prior
to passage of the ordinance authorizing such parity obligations, the
Director of Finance shall have certified to this Council that the Nontax Revenues during the preceding
calendar year, adjusted to reflect, if
necessary, changes in the rates or
charges resulting in the Nontax
Revenues, aggregate in amount not
less than 100% of the highest
amount of (a) debt charges on the
Bonds and (b) required payments on
such proposed parity obligations
and any outstanding parity obliga-

The City Record
tions due in any succeeding calendar year.
Each
obligation
of
the
City
required to be undertaken pursuant
to this Ordinance and the Bonds is
binding upon the City, and upon
each officer or employee of the City
as may from time to time have the
authority under law to take any
action on behalf of the City as may
be necessary to perform all or any
part of such obligation, as a duty of
the City and of each of those officers and employees resulting from
an office, trust or station within the
meaning of Section 2731.01 of the
Revised Code, providing for enforcement by writ of mandamus.
Section 8. Refunding of Prior
Escrow
Agreement.
The
Bonds;
Director of Finance is authorized to
sign and deliver, in the name and
on behalf of the City, an escrow
agreement between the City and the
registrar for the Prior Bonds, as
escrow trustee, providing for, among
other matters: the investment of the
proceeds of the Bonds in direct
obligations of the United States of
America and the holding in escrow
of the proceeds of the Bonds and
such investments to be applied to
the refunding of Prior Bonds; the
application of the moneys derived
from those investments to the payment of the debt service charges on
the Prior Bonds; and the irrevocable
call for redemption of the Prior
Bonds. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the escrow agreement from
proceeds of the Bonds to the extent
available and then from Nontax
Revenues appropriated for that purpose. Provision shall be made in the
escrow agreement to give written
notice of redemption of the Prior
Bonds in accordance with their
terms. The Director of Finance and
other appropriate City officials shall
sign all documents and take all
other actions necessary or appropriate on the part of the City to effect
such refunding and to cause the
Prior Bonds to be deemed paid and
discharged, including without limitation, the retention of an independent firm of accountants to verify
the mathematical accuracy of the
calculations relating to the escrow.
Section 9. Application of Proceeds
of Bonds. The proceeds of the Bonds
shall be applied as follows: (i) an
amount determined by the Director
of Finance to be sufficient to provide for the payment of debt service
on the Prior Bonds when due and on
prior redemption shall be deposited
with the escrow trustee under the
escrow agreement authorized in Section 8, (ii) any amount determined
by the Director of Finance to be
applied to payment of interest on
the Bonds shall be deposited in the
Debt Service Fund created in Section 7 of this Ordinance, and (iii)
the balance of the proceeds shall be
used to pay financing costs within
the meaning of Section 133.01(K) of
the Revised Code, including the cost
of any credit support with respect to
the Bonds.
Section 10. Defeasance of the
Bonds.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or make provision for
payment of the principal, any premium and interest on all the outstanding
Bonds,
this
Ordinance

489

51
(except for Sections 3 and 10(b))
shall cease to be of further effect,
and the covenants, agreements and
other obligations of the City under
this Ordinance shall be discharged
and satisfied.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 10(a), if:
(i) the Paying Agent shall hold in
trust for and irrevocably committed
solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Paying Agent shall hold
in trust for, and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations of, or obligations guaranteed
as to payment by, the United States
of America certified by an independent firm of national reputation to
be of such maturities and interest
payment dates and to bear such
interest, without further investment
or reinvestment of either the principal amount thereof or the interest
earnings therefrom (likewise to be
held in trust and committed, except
as hereinafter provided), as will be
sufficient, together with moneys referred to in (i) above, for the payment, at their maturities or redemption dates, of all debt charges on the
Bonds to their date of maturity or
redemption, as the case may be, or
if default in such payment shall
have occurred on such date then to
the date of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds
are to be redeemed prior to the
maturity thereof, notice of such
redemption shall have been duly
given or irrevocable provision satisfactory to the Registrar shall have
been duly made for the giving of
such notice. Any moneys held by the
Paying Agent in accordance with
the provisions of this Section may
be invested in direct obligations of,
or obligations guaranteed as to payment by, the United States of America maturing, or redeemable at the
option of the holder, at times and in
amounts sufficient to meet payment
of debt charges on the Bonds, as
directed by the Director of Finance.
Section 11. Ratings and Credit
Enhancement. If, in the judgment of
the Director of Finance, based on
written advice of a Financial Advisor, the filing of an application for
a rating on the Bonds by one or
more nationally recognized rating
agencies, or the obtaining of a credit support instrument for the Bonds
is in the best interest of, and financially advantageous to, the City, the
Director of Finance is authorized to
prepare and submit those applications and to obtain that credit support instrument. The cost of obtaining each rating and any credit support instrument, except to the extent
paid by the Original Purchaser in
accordance with the Bond Purchase
Agreement, shall be paid from the
proceeds of the Bonds. The Director
of Finance may enter into any written agreements she determines are
necessary to obtain a credit support
instrument,
consistent
with
this
Ordinance. The form and correctness
of any such agreement shall be
determined and approved by the
Director of Law.
Section 12. Federal Tax Covenants. The provisions of this Section
shall apply to the Bonds if the
Bonds are issued as Tax-Exempt
Obligations. The City covenants that

52
it will use, and will restrict the use
and investment of, the proceeds of
the Bonds in such manner and to
such extent as may be necessary so
that (a) the Bonds will not (i) constitute private activity bonds, arbitrage bonds or hedge bonds under
Sections 141, 148 or 149 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) or (ii) be treated
other than as bonds to which Section 103(a) of the Code applies, and
(b) the interest thereon will not be
treated as an item of tax preference
under Section 57 of the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the Bonds
to be and to remain excluded from
gross income for federal income tax
purposes, (b) it will not take or
authorize to be taken any actions
that would adversely affect that
exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting for it, will, among other acts of
compliance, (i) apply the proceeds
of the Bonds to the governmental
purpose
of
the
borrowing,
(ii)
restrict the yield on investment
property acquired with those proceeds, (iii) make timely and adequate payments to the federal government, (iv) maintain books and
records and make calculations and
reports, and (v) refrain from certain
uses of those proceeds, and, as
applicable,
of
property
financed
with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the extent necessary to
assure such exclusion of that interest under the Code.
Each covenant made in this section with respect to the Bonds is
also made with respect to all issues
any portion of the debt service on
which is paid from proceeds of the
Bonds (and, if different, the original
issue and any refunding issues in a
series of refundings), to the extent
such compliance is necessary to
assure exclusion of interest on the
Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes, and the officers identified above are authorized
to take actions with respect to those
issues as they are authorized in this
Section to take with respect to the
Bonds.
The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer of
the City having responsibility for
issuance of the Bonds is authorized
(a) to make or effect any election,
selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or waiver on behalf
of the City with respect to the
Bonds as the City is permitted or
required to make or give under the
federal income tax laws, including,
without limitation thereto, any of
the elections provided for in Section
148(f)(4)(C) of the Code or available under Section 148 of the Code,
for the purpose of assuring, enhancing or protecting favorable tax
treatment or status of the Bonds or
interest thereon or assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose, reducing the burden or expense of such compliance, reducing
the rebate amount or payments or
penalties, or making payments of
special amounts in lieu of making
computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as rebate, or
obviating those amounts or payments, as determined by that officer,
which action shall be in writing and
signed by the officer, (b) to take

The City Record
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf
of the City, as may be appropriate
to assure the exclusion of interest
from gross income and the intended
tax status of the Bonds, and (c) to
give one or more appropriate certificates of the City, for inclusion in
the transcript of proceedings for the
Bonds, setting forth the reasonable
expectations of the City regarding
the amount and use of all the proceeds of the Bonds, the facts, circumstances and estimates on which
they are based, and other facts and
circumstances relevant to the tax
treatment of the interest on and the
tax status of the Bonds.
Section 13. Interest Rate Hedges
and Other Arrangements. For the
purpose of achieving the optimal
available debt structure for the
Bonds, the Director of Finance may,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, enter into one or
more agreements in anticipation of,
in connection with or subsequent to
the issuance of the Bonds for an
interest rate swap, an interest rate
cap or other arrangements to lower
the effective interest rate on the
obligations of the City or to hedge
the exposure of the City against
fluctuations in prevailing interest
rates or to optimize the City’s cash
flow (a “Hedge Agreement”) provided, however, that: (i) no such
agreement or arrangement shall
purport to entitle the counterparty
or provider to payment by the City
from any source other than the
sources of payment for the Bonds as
described in this Ordinance; and (ii)
the terms of the agreements or
arrangements shall have been determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, to be justified by
the corresponding benefit to the
City and to be commercially reasonable based on then current market conditions.
The Director of Finance shall
negotiate the terms of each Hedge
Agreement. The City shall receive a
written opinion of a Financial Advisor that the payments made or to be
made by the counterparty to the
City, or by the City to the counterparty, shall be fair value for the
Hedge Agreement, considering, among
other things, the City’s credit, the
credit of the counterparty and the
terms and conditions of the Hedge
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall determine the terms and conditions of the Hedge Agreement,
including without limitation, the
time or times and procedures for the
exercise by the counterparty or the
City, as the case may be, of any
option under the Hedge Agreement,
whether the obligations of the City
under the Hedge Agreement shall be
secured by a credit support instrument, and the rates to be paid by
the counterparty to the City and by
the City to the counterparty under
the Hedge Agreement in the event
of the exercise of the option. The
approval of each interest rate hedge
transaction
by
the
Director
of
Finance shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery
of the applicable Hedge Agreement
by the Director of Finance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into an amendment,

490

March 27, 2013
modification or novation of any
Hedge Agreement or any credit support instrument securing a Hedge
Agreement or to terminate any
Hedge Agreement, in whole or in
part, if the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
(a) the amendment, modification,
novation or termination is (i) justified by the corresponding benefit to
the City, (ii) commercially reasonable based on then-current market
conditions, and (iii) in the City’s
best interests, and (b) any payments
made or to be made by the counterparty to the City, or by the City to
the counterparty, are fair value for
such amendment, modification, novation or termination, given the credit of the counterparty and the terms
and conditions of the amendment,
modification, novation or termination. To the extent that any amounts
to be paid by the City in connection
with any such amendment, modification, novation or termination are
not paid from proceeds of the Bonds,
those amounts shall be paid from
Nontax Revenues appropriated for
the purpose.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from Nontax Revenues. The obligation of the City to make payments
under any Hedge Agreement does
not and shall not represent or constitute a general obligation, debt,
bonded indebtedness or a pledge of
the faith and credit of the City or
the State. Nothing gives any party
to any Hedge Agreement the right
to have excises, ad valorem or other
taxes levied by the City or the State
for the payment of any amounts due
under any Hedge Agreement. The
form and correctness of any agreement entered into under authority of
this Section shall be approved by
the Director of Law.
Section 14. Financial Advisor. The
Director of Finance may obtain the
services of one or more financial
advisory firms (each a “Financial
Advisor”), from time to time, to
assist the Director of Finance in
making any of the determinations
required by this Ordinance to be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance or to negotiate any Hedge
Agreements. The Director of Finance
may rely on the written advice of
any Financial Advisor so retained.
Any Financial Advisor or consultant
employed under the authority of this
Ordinance shall be disinterested in
the transaction and be independent
of the underwriters or counterparties and any other party interested
in the transaction
Section 15. Open Meeting Determination. It is found and determined
that all formal actions of this Council and any of its committees concerning and relating to the passage
of this Ordinance were taken, and
that all deliberations of this Council and of any of its committees that
resulted in those formal actions
were held, in meetings open to the
public in compliance with all legal
requirements,
including,
without
limitation, Section 121.22 of the Revised Code.
Section 16. Findings and Recitals
of Validity. It is hereby determined,
represented and recited that all acts,
conditions and things necessary to
be done precedent to and in the issuing of the Bonds in order to make

March 27, 2013

been exceeded in the issuance of the
Bonds. It is further found and determined, and is represented and recited, that this Ordinance was passed
in compliance with all applicable
provisions of the City’s Charter and
the rules of this Council.
Section 17. Delivery to County Fiscal Officer. The Director of Finance
is authorized and directed to forward a certified copy of this Ordinance and of the Certificate of
Award for the Bonds to the County
Fiscal Officer of Cuyahoga County.
Section 18. Severability. Each section and each part of each section
of this Ordinance is declared to be
an independent section or part of a
section and, notwithstanding any
other evidence of legislative intent,
it is declared to be the controlling
legislative intent that if any such
section or part of a section or any
provision thereof, or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the
remaining sections or parts of sections and the application of such
provisions to any other person or
circumstance, other than those as to
which it is held invalid, shall not be
affected thereby, and it is declared
to be the legislative intent that the
other provisions of this Ordinance
would have been passed independently of such section, or parts of a
section, so held to be invalid.
Section 19. Legislative Intent. All
terms,
conditions,
pledges,
covenants or agreements on the part
of the City provided for in this Ordinance are made by the voluntary act
of the City under its lawful authority, including its authority under its
Charter and Article XVIII of the
Constitution of Ohio. Nothing in this
Ordinance is intended to, and no provision hereof shall be applied in any
manner as would, impair the obligation of contract of the City with
respect to any outstanding bonds,
notes, certificates of indebtedness,
other obligations, trust indentures,
trust agreements, or other agreements or contracts made or entered
into by the City and for which consideration was duly received by the
City prior to the passage of this
Ordinance.
Section 20. Sunset of Authorization. The authority granted by this
Ordinance to issue Bonds to refund
the Prior Bonds shall expire three
years from the effective date of this
Ordinance. If a preliminary official
statement with respect to the Bonds
is distributed under the authority of
this Ordinance at any time within
the three-year period following its
effective date, then the authority
granted by this Ordinance shall not
expire as to those Bonds. The Director of Finance shall notify the
Chairman of the Finance Committee
and the Clerk of this Council of the
initiation of the issuance of any
Bonds under the authority of this
Ordinance.
Section 21. Emergency Measure.
This ordinance is declared to be an
