ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 322-13.
By Council Member Johnson.
An emergency resolution supporting the application of Cleveland
State University to the Ohio Development Services Agency for Ohio
Historic Preservation Tax Credits
for the restoration of the Mather
Mansion located at 2605 Euclid
Avenue.
Whereas, each year the State of
Ohio through the Ohio Development
Services Agency allocates Ohio Historic Preservation Tax Credits to encourage private investment in historically significant buildings throughout Ohio using a competitive proposal process; and
Whereas, the Cleveland City Council has recognized the need to maintain historic buildings in Cleveland’s neighborhoods, and desires to
have the Mather Mansion, a prominent, historic, architecturally significant landmark, restored; and
Whereas, located
along
Cleveland’s historic “Euclid Avenue Millionaire’s Row,” the Mather Mansion
at 2605 Euclid Avenue is one of the
few remaining grand Row mansions
that are still standing today; and
Whereas, at the time of the mansion’s completion in 1910, this elmlined section of Euclid Avenue was
internationally
known
for
its
wealthy residents and unparalleled
architecture, and the substantial
44,520 square foot masonry residence, designed by Cleveland architect Charles F. Schweinfurt, is an
early yet significant example of his
Tudor Revival style; and
Whereas, in 1973, the Mather Mansion became the first building in
Cleveland to be placed on the
National Register of Historic Places,
highlighting its importance as a
major contributor to the history and
character of Cleveland; and
Whereas, in 1967, Cleveland State
University purchased the building
for office and conference space, and
used the space until 2011; and
Whereas, Cleveland State University now plans to cause a complete
historic restoration of the interior
and exterior of the Mather Mansion
in compliance with the Secretary of
the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation of Historic Buildings to be
used
for
office
and
conference
space; and
Whereas, restoration of this highly significant structure will ensure
the Mansion’s continued existence
as one of the greatest, and last,

384

March 13, 2013
architectural testaments to this period of Cleveland’s history; and
Whereas, the completion of this
project will set a strong example of
the continued importance of the
revitalization of Cleveland’s neighborhoods, will positively stimulate
the local economy with skilled construction jobs and local investment,
and preserve a local landmark that
has received support from Cleveland
State University and the community
at large; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
supports the restoration of the Mather Mansion as a high priority initiative for future development in the
community for the benefit the citizens of the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the application of Cleveland
State University to the Ohio Development Services Agency for Ohio
Historic Preservation Tax Credits
for the restoration of the Mather
Mansion located at 2605 Euclid Avenue.

An emergency resolution urging
the president of Charter One Bank
to reconsider the closing of two
Charter One branches located at
13709 Lorain Avenue and 11623
Clifton Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio in
order to maintain convenient banking opportunities for neighborhood
residents as demonstrated by the
current assets of each respective
branch office and further urging
Charter One to work with the community to help maintain vibrant
neighborhoods by offering favorable
lease terms and alternative banking
services, such as ATMs.
Whereas, Charter One Bank has

bank branch located at 13709 Lorain
Avenue on May 15, 2013 and its bank
branch located at 11623 Clifton
Avenue on May 16, 2013; and
Whereas, losing these bank branches in the Jefferson and Cudell/Edgewater neighborhoods, will diminish
convenient banking opportunities for
both residents and businesses; and
Whereas, both neighborhoods include a large concentration of residential units as well as merchants

their banking needs and closing
these branches will cause unnecessary hardship to them; and
Whereas, both branches are located in middle income neighborhoods

will disrupt the character of the
respective commercial districts; and
Whereas, Charter One Bank maintains significant customer deposits,
which include $29.7 million in the
Lorain Avenue branch and $27.6 million in the Clifton Avenue branch;
and
Whereas, the City is making significant improvements to the public

neighborhoods; and
