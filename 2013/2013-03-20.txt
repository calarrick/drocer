An emergency resolution supporting the City’s initiative to establish
a Sustainable Municipal Building
Policy which will incorporate green
building practices into the siting,
design,
construction,
remodeling,
repair, maintenance, operation and
deconstruction of all City facilities.
Whereas, in August, 2009, the
Mayor, in partnership with members
of this Council, initiated Sustainable
Cleveland 2019, a 10-year plan to
engage people from all walks of life
to work together to design and
develop a thriving and resilient
Cleveland region using “sustainable”
or “green” methods and practices;
and
Whereas, in May, 2012, the City
joined the Cleveland 2030 District,
which works to create a coalition of
building owners, service professionals and community stakeholders
working together to rapidly transform the building environment of
the city through large-scale reductions in energy use, water use and
greenhouse gas emissions; and
Whereas, also in May 2012, the
City joined the Better Buildings
Challenge,
a
White
House
and
Department of Energy initiative; as
part of the Challenge, the city has
committed to publicly share its energy data and reduce its building
energy usage 20% from 2010 levels
by 2020; and
Whereas, data shows that the City
spends more than $50 million dollars
annually on energy and utilities for
its municipal operations; and
Whereas, through its use of federal funding from the Energy Efficiency
and
Conservation
Block
Grant program, the City has initiated several energy and sustainability projects for city buildings and
the community; and
Whereas, the City has recently
completed three new construction
projects that were constructed to
meet Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design (LEED) certification
standards:
Collinwood
Recreation
Center,
the
Kirtland
Pump Station and the Bike Rack;
and
Whereas, most recently the City
adopted a Sustainable Municipal
Building Policy which outlines minimum requirements that City departments and divisions must take when
siting,
designing,
constructing,
remodeling, repairing, maintaining,
operating and deconstructing city
facilities; and
Whereas, the Policy mandates
that all occupied City-owned new
construction and major renovations
over 10,000 square feet, including
building additions, and entering the
design phase after January 1, 2013,
shall achieve LEED Silver certification or higher and meet certain listed minimum performance levels; and
Whereas, the Policy further mandates that all city-owned new construction under 10,000 square feet
shall strive to achieve LEED Silver
certification or higher, as well as
meet certain listed minimum performance levels; and

March 20, 2013
Whereas, green building is a
proactive way to guard against the
rising costs of materials, construction, waste removal and energy, and
studies have shown that reasonable
levels of sustainable design can be
incorporated
into
most
building
types at little or no additional cost;
and
Whereas, the Policy states that
the City shall seek financing from
federal, state and local sources in
order to facilitate projects at a level
suitable to meet Policy standards;
and
Whereas, this Council, as a strong
supporter of this Policy, has asked
that
the
administration
provide
annual progress reports regarding
the execution of the Policy; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the City’s initiative to establish a Sustainable Municipal Building Policy which will incorporate
green building practices into the siting, design, construction, remodeling, repair, maintenance, operation
and deconstruction of all City facilities.

the members elected to Council, it

Whereas, on March 23, 2013, the

make a bold statement about their
concern for climate change by turning off their lights for one hour

Whereas, in the United States, participants will turn off their lights,
sending a clear message that we
want to “turn out the lights” on
dirty air, dangerous dependency on
foreign
oil
and
costly
climate
change
impacts,
and
make
the
switch to cleaner air, a strong economic future and a more secure
nation; and
Whereas, since its inception six
years ago, Earth Hour has become
a global phenomenon; and

Hour
challenge
at

Whereas, as in years past, during
Earth Hour 2013, iconic buildings
and landmarks from Asia Pacific to
Europe and Africa to the Americas
will be switched off; people across

The City Record
the world from all walks of life will
turn off their lights and come
together in celebration and contemplation of the one thing we all have
in common – our planet; and
Whereas, in past years, landmarks
from around the world went dark

Broadway
Theater
Marquees; the Las Vegas Strip; United
Nations Headquarters; the Golden

Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
local area municipalities, public and

An emergency resolution supporting
the
Cleveland
Metropolitan
School District’s application to the
Ohio Board of Education for a waiver from the requirement regarding
the appointment of an Academic
Distress Commission for Cleveland
schools.
Whereas, Mayor Frank Jackson,
in
collaboration
with
business,
labor, education philanthropic and
community leaders, in order to facilitate the improvement of the academic achievement of the students of
the Cleveland Municipal School District (“CMSD”), proposed the Cleveland Education Plan (“the Cleveland
Plan”) to the Ohio General Assembly; and

408

March 20, 2013
Whereas, the Ohio General Assembly passed, and Governor John
Kasich signed, Substitute House Bill
525, which amended State law as it
relates to the CMSD and provides
for additional oversight of the CMSD
by the Ohio Department of Education; and
Whereas, CMSD recently received
a letter from the Ohio Department
of Education informing CMSD that
as the district is in Academic Emergency and it has failed to make adequate yearly progress for four or
more consecutive school years, an
Academic
Distress
Commission
would
be
appointed
to
oversee
CMSD; and
Whereas, because the Cleveland
Plan contains such extraordinary
reform efforts and clearly articulated
accountability
measures
for
CMSD, and Ohio law provides that a
municipal school district may apply
for a waiver from certain rules
adopted under Title 33 of the
Revised Code; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public health, welfare, and
safety in that the CMSD Board has
voted to file the necessary application with the Ohio Board of Education to request a waiver from State
appointment of an Academic Distress Commission and this Council
supports the waiver; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the Cleveland Metropolitan
School District’s application to the
Ohio Board of Education for a waiver from the requirement regarding
the appointment of an Academic
Distress Commission for Cleveland
schools.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to send a copy of this resolution to the Ohio Board of Education.
Section 3. That this resolution is
declared to be an emergency measure
and, provided it receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take
effect and be in force immediately
upon its adoption and approval by the
Mayor; otherwise it shall take effect
and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.
