parties as defined in division (m) and
are liable to the City of Cleveland for
the costs imposed by this section.

If the Director finds by a preponderance of evidence that an appellant
is liable under this section for the
costs assessed, then the Director shall
dismiss the appeal and order the
appellant to pay the costs identified
in the ticket.
If the Director finds by a preponderance of evidence that an appellant
is liable under this section for the
costs assessed but that there are reasons for the commission of the infraction that mitigate the offense, then

and order the appellant to pay the
costs identified in the ticket, but may
in the interest of equity reduce the
costs assessed.

the costs assessed, then the Director
shall dismiss the ticket and grant the
appeal.

adverse decision of the Director may
appeal that decision to the Board of

approve, modify or annul the finding
from which the appeal is taken.

by this section may be enforced and
collected by means of a civil action or
any other means provided for in these
Codified Ordinances or the Ohio

appeals, the Director of Public Works
or his or her designee.

Res. No. 978-13.
By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency resolution endorsing the continued existence of a
Healthy Cleveland through the second initiative of collaboration with
the Mayor and the four hospital systems in Cleveland that are lending
their staff, expertise, and research
efforts to reach this goal.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland and
Cleveland City Council are committed
to creating a Healthy Cleveland with
healthy neighborhoods and residents
who enjoy longer and healthier lives
and by combating chronic health conditions like chronic pulmonary disease, heart disease, diabetes, obesity
and behavioral health; and
Whereas, Cleveland is home to the
four best health care systems in the
United States; Cleveland Clinic,
MetroHealth, Sisters of Charity
Health System, and University Hospitals, and all four institutions support
the mission of creating a Healthy
Cleveland; and
Whereas, Cleveland is also home to
Federally Qualified Health Centers
(FQHC): NEON, Care Alliance, Free
Clinic, and Neighborhood Family
Practice (NFP); and
Whereas, to be successful in creating a Healthy Cleveland, the Jackson
Administration, Cleveland City Council and the four health care institutions collaborated beginning in 2011
with the creation of the Healthy
Cleveland initiative with the adoption of Resolution No. 257-11 on February 28, 2001, and will continue to collaborate in this ongoing second initiative to address nutrition and healthy
eating, active living, mental health
and violence, health literacy, healthy
neighborhoods, and clean air and
smoking cessation; and
Whereas, the City has already
banned smoking on and in all City
Properties, including parks, playgrounds, cemeteries, garages, and
areas within 150 feet of any entrance
to any City building or facility,
including City Hall, Recreation Centers, and Public Health Centers, and
has worked to create voluntarilyadopted smoke free zones within the
entrances to privately-owned facilities; and
Whereas, by working collaboratively with local health institutions, we
are continuing to increase the accessibility of city-wide smoking cessation programs to help people quit
smoking; and
Whereas, in June, an Ohio Judge
found unconstitutional the state law
which sought to invalidate the City’s
law banning trans fats, thus allowing
the City law to stand; and
Whereas, along with the law banning trans fats, the City has worked
to encourage local restaurants and
vendors to remove trans-fats from
their menus and offer trans-fat free
products; and
Whereas, an established task force
with our health care partners and the
Cleveland Metropolitan School District is working to provide healthier
food options in our city schools, and
the Healthy Eating Committee is
working with CMSD to re-incorporate

24
school gardens in every new school
plan; and
Whereas, in collaboration with the
Cleveland Planning Commission the
Health Committee is working to
ensure the existence of a city garden
within walking distance of every citizen in Cleveland by 2019 with the support of the City Planning and Health
Committees; and
Whereas, the City developed a Complete Streets Policy to improve bike
and pedestrian access and improve
mobility on street, streetscape, bridge
improvement projects; and
Whereas, the Healthy Cleveland
Initiative 2.0 has formed subgroups to
continue this work, including Nutrition and Healthy Eating, Clean Air
and Smoking Cessation, Active Living, Healthy Neighborhoods, Mental
Health and Violence, and Health Literacy that have recommended legislative and programmatic initiatives to
reduce health disparities and improve
Clevelanders’ quality of life; and
Whereas, the Nutrition and Healthy
Eating subgroup recommends overall
1) developing healthy food guidelines
for food services provided by City of
Cleveland facilities and encouraging
adoption of guidelines by partners
throughout Cleveland; and 2) promoting the Healthy Corner Store Initiative which seeks to improve offerings
in corner and convenience stores by
giving incentives to store owners to
develop infrastructure and provide
equipment
for
healthy
options,
improve appearance and safety at
stores, and offer Healthy Cleveland
branding and promotion opportunities; and
Whereas, more specific programmatic
recommendations
include
extending healthy food guidelines to
1) the Cleveland Metropolitan School
District by increasing collaboration
for wellness policies and healthy
school meals and partnerships with
the City’s Summer Youth Employment Program and Summer Sprout
Program, 2) early childcare and childhood education centers by implementing health best practices, and 3)
mobile food vendors, as well as corner
stores, by offering incentive programs to increase healthy food offerings; and
Whereas, the Clean Air and Smoking Cessation subgroup recommends
1) exploring a city-wide ban on the
sale of flavored tobacco products similar to legislation passed in New York
City; and 2) encouraging local
enforcement of the smoke-free Workplace Act, and researching federal
funding opportunities for smoking
prevention and cessation programs;
and
Whereas, this Council has already
adopted a resolution to defend and
protect Ohio’s Alternative Energy
Portfolio Standard, as recommended
by the Clean Air and Smoking Cessation subgroup; and
Whereas, the Active Living subgroup recommends 1) identifying
active living deserts in the City by
creating a comprehensive geographic
mapping that highlights parks, recreation centers, bike paths, and active
living programs to provide guidance
for plans to enhance accessible and
affordable active living opportunities
in Cleveland; and 2) creating and
maintaining a user-friendly website
and application focused on Active
Living opportunities and programs in
the City; and

The City Record
Whereas, the Healthy Neighborhoods subgroup recommends overall
1) integrating health and equity considerations into planning and development processes; and 2) establishing
healthy community design criteria
along with a checklist to be used by
citywide design review committees
within the Department of City Planning, including adoption of community engagement standards; and
Whereas, more specific recommendations include 1) adopting a policy
that ensures continued capacity
building within City Hall to conduct
health impact assessments of policies, projects, and programs; and 2)
identifying evaluation metrics used
to measure the existing health status
of Cleveland neighborhoods and
departmental leadership of data collection activities through Cleveland
City Planning and Cleveland Department of Health and their partners;
and
Whereas, the Mental Health and
Violence subgroup recommends 1)
increasing the awareness and understanding of mental health and addiction to address societal stigma surrounding the illness; 2) informing the
community about agencies and partnering with those agencies who provide treatment services for those
diagnosed or displaying signs of mental illness and addiction; and 3) support funding for research and support
services for mental health wellness;
and
Whereas, finally, the Health Literacy subgroup recommends 1) establishing a brand identity for Healthy
Cleveland through the establishment
of a website and logo to reach the
neighborhoods; 2) connecting the
public to a “directory” Clevelanders
can access online, through a web
application or paper that can link
them to health promotion, prevention,
and management services; 3) training
individuals to engage, support, and
link resident to critical health
resources and coordinate programming and outreach efforts in the
neighborhoods; and 4) circulating
resources throughout the community
at the neighborhood level by partnering with libraries and community centers, faith based institutions, block
clubs, civic associations, and our
chamber of commerce; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland and
its Healthy Cleveland partners are
already implementing the recommendations of these Healthy Cleveland
2.0 subgroups in order to continue
efforts to improve the health of every
Clevelander; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council endorses the continued existence of a
Healthy Cleveland through the second initiative of collaboration with
the Mayor and the four hospital systems in Cleveland that are lending
their staff, expertise, and research
efforts to reach this goal.
Section 2. That this resolution is

measure and, provided it receives the

By Council Member Kelley (by
departmental request).
An emergency resolution reaffirming Ordinance No. 73-84, passed
January 23, 1984, in order to continue to pick-up employee contributions
to the Police and Fire Pension Fund
under new rates; and to repeal Ordinance No. 467-04, passed March 29,
2004.
Whereas, under Ordinance No. 7384, passed January 23, 1984, this
Council authorized a plan for Cleveland to assume and pay employee
contributions to the Police and Fire
Pension Fund (“OP&F”); and
Whereas, under the current plan
authorized by this Council, the City
“picks-up” all of the ten percent
(10%)
mandatory
contributions
required under Section 742.31 of the
Ohio Revised Code for participating
employees who are members of the
OP&F; and
Whereas, in Ordinance No. 467-04,
passed March 29, 2004, the City
implemented new procedures for
reporting picked-up contributions in
order to properly prepare 1099-R
forms for its members; and
Whereas, OP&F member rates will
increase over the next three years;
and
Whereas, this Council reaffirms
Ordinance No. 73-84, passed January
23, 1984, which states at Section 1,
“Pursuant
to
this
‘pick
up’
of
employee contributions by the City
of Cleveland, the gross salary of
each person described in Section 2
herein [sworn members of the division of Police and Fire of the City
of Cleveland who are members of
the Police and Firemen’s Disability
and Pension Fund] shall be reduced
by the full amount of the statutorily required employee contribution. .
. .The employee contributions so
‘picked up’ shall also be included in
‘compensation’ for purposes of the
fixing, by the appointing authorities, of salaries and compensation of
officers and employees in the service of the City, within the schedules of compensation established by
Council pursuant to Charter Section
191.” and repeals Ordinance No. 46704, passed March 29, 2004, and
adopts the new OP&F member rates;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure provid-

1201

59
ing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That, effective on the passage date of this ordinance, the City
of Cleveland shall continue to pick-up
all mandatory contributions by the
employees who are members of the
OP&F through a payroll reduction as
follows:
July 8, 2013
July 7, 2014
July 6, 2015

10.75%
11.50%
12.25%

The picked-up contributions paid
through a payroll reduction, even
though designated as employee contributions for state law purposes, are
being paid by the City of Cleveland in
lieu of the contributions by the
employee. The picked-up contributions will not be included in the gross
income of the employees for tax
reporting purposes, that is, for federal
or state income tax withholding
taxes, until distributed from the
OP&F. The picked-up contributions
will be included in the gross income
of the employees, for employment tax
purposes, as the contributions are
made to the OP&F. The employees
shall not be entitled to any option of
choosing to receive the contributed
amounts directly instead of having
them paid by the City of Cleveland to
the OP&F.
Section 2. That Ordinance No. 73-84,
passed January 23, 1084, is reaffirmed
and Ordinance No. 467-04, passed
March 29, 2004, is repealed.
Section 3. That the Director of
Finance and the Commissioner of
Accounts are directed to implement
the provisions of this ordinance.
