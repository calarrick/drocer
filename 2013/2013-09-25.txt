By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency resolution supporting
comprehensive
immigration
reform that addresses earned legalization with a path to citizenship,
updated future immigration of families and workers and improved
immigration enforcement and border
security that is consistent with
national values.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland’s
identity is defined by its promise of
equality, esteem for diversity and
commitment to innovation; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
and the United States have pros-

pered because of the contributions
of hardworking and aspiring citizens; and
Whereas, this Council supports
the value of human dignity of all
Cleveland residents, regardless of
immigration status, and recognizes
the
importance
of
immigrants'
many contributions to the social and
economic fabric of the City; and
Whereas, becoming a citizen in
the United States means taking a
solemn oath to uphold the United
States Constitution; and
Whereas, citizenship is an important symbol of full membership and
participation in society that should
be encouraged, not barred; and

1525

Whereas, keeping families together not only is the right thing to do,
but also is good for the economy
because families provide a base of
support that increases worker productivity and spurs entrepreneurship; and
Whereas,
immigration
enforcement will be much more efficient
and effective once the number of
undocumented
immigrants
is
reduced due to immigration reform;
and
Whereas, the nation's current
immigration system is dysfunctional, harms the economy and does not
reflect our values as a city; and

20
Whereas, overseeing immigration
is a federal responsibility, and a
comprehensive approach to reforming the immigration system would
strengthen the economy and free
aspiring citizens to make even
greater contributions to their communities; and
Whereas,
the
Federal
Government's inability to enact immigration reform has created severe economic, cultural and political strains
in the City and in communities
across the United States; and
Whereas,
immigration
reform
must occur in a comprehensive,
thoughtful manner that builds the
strength and unity of working people and guarantees the same rights,
obligations and basic fairness for
all workers, no matter where they
come from; and
Whereas, comprehensive immigration reform must include a realistic
pathway to citizenship for all hardworking and taxpaying aspiring citizens who live in the United States
if they meet reasonable requirements; and
Whereas, comprehensive immigration reform must provide a mechanism for those citizens who have
grown up in this country to become
citizens and be able to fully contribute to our joint future; and
Whereas, comprehensive immigration reform must update the immigration system so that the future
flow of immigrant workers more
realistically matches our nation's
labor needs and is structured to protect the wages and working conditions of citizen and immigrant workers; and
Whereas, any new worker visa
program must provide for strict compliance with United States labor
standards and wage and hour standards, portability of visas so that
workers can change jobs and the
ability for workers to petition for
permanent residency; and
Whereas, comprehensive immigration reform must limit the wait
times and rules that keep families
separated from their loved ones; and
Whereas, comprehensive immigration reform enforcement provisions
must restore respect for law by promoting
strict
adherence
to
our
nation's
values,
including
due
process, civil and human rights,
accountability and proportionality;
and
Whereas, internal and border law
enforcement should focus on preventing criminals, drug cartels and
other negative and harmful elements from entering the United
States or engaging in criminal activities; and
Whereas, this Council supports a
comprehensive immigration reform
bill that keeps families together,
upholds national values, promotes
economic growth and provides a
long-term solution to the immigration system; and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
that businesses should be allowed to
hire the workers they need to grow
the
economy
and
immigration
reform should address the highskilled worker shortage faced by
businesses, especially in the hightech and healthcare sectors; and
Whereas, elected officials must
create an immigration process that
strengthens our nation's economy

The City Record
and lets aspiring citizens continue
their contributions to their communities; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby
supports comprehensive immigration
reform that addresses earned legalization with a path to citizenship,
updated future immigration of families and workers and improved immigration enforcement and border security that is consistent with national
values.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to forward copies
of this resolution to President Barack
Obama and all members of the United
States Congress.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
