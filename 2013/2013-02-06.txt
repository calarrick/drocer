streetscape component of any street
reconstruction project. For purposes
of
calculating
project
cost
for
streetscape projects only, the project
cost shall include costs covered by
funds from which public art is
excluded as an object of expenditure.
Section 186.03 Public Art Requirement
(a) Required Funding. One and
one-half percent (1.5%) of the cost
of an applicable project shall be
devoted to provision of public art.
The calculation of project cost
shall include construction costs,
including construction management
costs, but shall exclude costs for
land, interior fixtures and furnishings, architectural fees, engineering fees, and costs covered by
funds from which public art is
excluded as an object of expenditure. The cost of an applicable project shall be calculated based on
the amounts of the executed applicable construction and construction
management contracts.
(b) Qualifying Public Art Projects. Public art required by the regulations of this chapter may take
the form of a discrete object of visual art, such as a sculpture or mural,
permanent or temporary in nature,
or may take the form of artistdesigned functional elements of a
project. An artist shall collaborate
on the public art required by the
regulations of this chapter.
(c) Location of Public Art. Public
art required by the regulations of
this chapter, shall be placed on the
site of the applicable project. If the
City Planning Commission, in consultation with the Public Art Committee, determines that placement of
public art on the applicable project
site would be inappropriate due to
inadequate public visibility or public access, the Commission shall consult with applicable City departments and thereafter may select an
alternate site to locate the public
art.
(d) Aggregation of Funds. If the
City Planning Commission, in consultation with the Public Art Committee, determines that the purposes of this chapter will best be met
by combining the public art funds
from two (2) or more applicable projects, the Commission may authorize
the execution of a single public art
project using the funding from multiple projects.
(e) Ownership of Public Art. All
art located on City property and
acquired under the requirements of
this chapter shall be owned by the
City of Cleveland, unless other ownership is specified in an ordinance
pertaining to a particular public art
project.

By Council Members Reed, J.
Johnson, Zone, Sweeney, Mitchell,
Brancatelli, Pruitt, Cleveland, Kelley, Cummins, Conwell, Westbrook,
Brady, Polensek, Keane, Dow, K.
Johnson, Miller and Cimperman.
An emergency resolution requesting the U.S. Congress to direct the
Centers for Disease Control to take
specific actions, to address violence
among
young
African-American
males.
Whereas, young men generally,
and African-American males specifically, are dying at an alarming rate
due to homicides, which is the number two cause of death for all males,
and the number one cause of death
for 15-24 year old African-American
males; and
Whereas, research documents that
daily exposure to violence among
men generally, and African-American males specifically, impacts traumatically and forever changes the
lives of these youths; and

The City Record
Whereas, the August 2007 Special
Report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the October 2009 National Survey of Children’s Exposure to
Violence by the U.S. Department of
Justice
document
that
violence
among young men generally, and
African-American males specifically,
constitutes a public health epidemic, with as many as 9,000 AfricanAmerican males murdered annually,
more than all of the U.S. soldiers
killed in the wars in Afghanistan
and Iraq, combined; and
Whereas, the loss of AfricanAmerican males in the community
as a result of homicide and high
rates of incarceration further impacts the community by reducing
the number of males who may serve
as role models for young AfricanAmerican males; and
Whereas, only increased federal,
state and local attention to this matter can help reduce the violence that
plagues many young males generally,
and
African-American
males
specifically; and
Whereas, the primary responsibilities of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) are to monitor public
health, detect and investigate health
problems, foster safe and healthy
environments and implement prevention strategies; and
Whereas, this Council believes the
CDC must develop a holistic intervention designed to address the
health related aspects and implications of violence among young
males generally, and young AfricanAmerican males specifically; and
Whereas, this Council believes the
CDC must develop short- and longterm health care strategies to bring
back health to the African-American
community in a way that promotes
the longevity of African-American
males; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
requests that the U.S. Congress
direct the Centers for Disease Control to take specific actions to
address
violence
among
young
African-American males.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to forward copies of
this resolution to Ohio Senators

Bonds
shall
constitute
Revenue
Bonds for all purposes of the Trust
Indenture.
This Council finds and determines
that the issuance of the Refunding
Bonds for a purpose provided in this
Ordinance serves a proper, public,
municipal purpose by reducing or
stabilizing costs of air travel facilities serving the people of the City
of Cleveland, thereby increasing and
promoting commerce by providing
necessary transportation for individuals and commercial enterprises
purchasing and selling services and
products in northeastern Ohio, and
creating and preserving jobs and
employment opportunities in the
City and improving the economic
welfare of the City.
Section 3. Authorization of Hedging Arrangements.
This Council finds that by engaging
in
interest
rate
hedging
arrangements with respect to Revenue Bonds the City may reduce its
cost of borrowing by optimizing the
relative amounts of fixed and variable rate obligations, or minimizing
the risk of variations in its debt service costs, or obtaining savings by
confirming rates of interest on Revenue Bonds in advance of their
issuance. To permit the City to have
the flexibility to undertake interest
rate swap, swaption, rate cap, rate
collar and other hedging transactions, from time to time, and to
establish the procedures for approving those transactions, this Council
authorizes the signing and delivery
of one or more agreements (each, a
“Hedge Agreement”) and any related agreements necessary for the
consummation of the transactions
contemplated by each Hedge Agreement. The authorizations in this Section 3 are supplemental to and not
in derogation of any authority provided by any other ordinance of this
Council
concerning
hedging
arrangements.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is to the financial advantage of the City and in the City’s best
interests that a hedging arrangement
be undertaken by the City with
respect to any Revenue Bonds issued
or to be issued under the Trust Indenture, the Director of Finance may
authorize one or more interest rate
hedge transactions in accordance
with the applicable Hedge Agreement; provided that the term of each
hedge transaction shall not exceed
the final maturity of the Revenue
Bonds to which the hedge relates.
The Director of Finance shall
negotiate the terms of each Hedge
Agreement. The City shall receive a
written opinion of a Financial Advi-

The City Record
sor that the payments made or to be
made by the counterparty to the
City, or by the City to the counterparty, shall be fair value for the
Hedge
Agreement,
considering,
among other things, the credit of
the City’s Airport System, the credit of the counterparty and the terms
and conditions of the Hedge Agreement. The Director of Finance shall
determine the terms and conditions
of the Hedge Agreement, including
without limitation, the time or times
and procedures for the exercise by
the counterparty or the City, as the
case may be, of any option under
the Hedge Agreement, whether the
obligations of the City under the
Hedge Agreement shall be secured
by a Credit Support Instrument, and
the rates to be paid by the counterparty to the City and by the City to
the counterparty under the Hedge
Agreement in the event of the exercise of the option. The approval of
each interest rate hedge transaction
by the Director of Finance shall be
conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery of the applicable
Hedge Agreement by the Director of
Finance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into an amendment,
modification or novation of any
Hedge Agreement or any Credit Support Instrument securing a Hedge
Agreement or to terminate any
Hedge Agreement, in whole or in
part, if the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
(a) the amendment, modification,
novation or termination is (i) justified by the corresponding benefit to
the City, (ii) commercially reasonable based on then-current market
conditions, and (iii) in the City’s
best interests, and (b) any payments
made or to be made by the counterparty to the City, or by the City to
the counterparty, are fair value for
such amendment, modification, novation or termination, given the credit of the counterparty and the terms
and conditions of the amendment,
modification, novation or termination. To the extent that any amounts
to be paid by the City in connection
with any such amendment, modification, novation or termination are
not paid from proceeds of Revenue
Bonds, those amounts shall be paid
from Fund Nos. 60SF 001, 60 SF 104,
60 SF 105, 60 SF 106 and 60 SF 141
and/or passenger facility charges,
as determined by the Director of
Finance after consultation with the
Director of Port Control.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from
the
Airport
Revenues
as
defined in the Trust Indenture and
may be payable also from other
funds permitted by law to be used
for the purpose, as identified by the
Director of Finance in the Hedge
Agreement. Those payments may be
secured by a pledge of Airport Revenues, to the extent permitted by
the Trust Indenture, all as determined by the Director of Finance
and set forth in the Hedge Agreement. The obligation of the City to
make payments under any Hedge
Agreement does not and shall not
represent or constitute a general

165

37
obligation, debt, bonded indebtedness or a pledge of the faith and
credit of the City or the State of
Ohio. Nothing gives any party to
any Hedge Agreement the right to
have excises, ad valorem or other
taxes levied by the City or the State
of Ohio for the payment of any
amounts due under any Hedge
Agreement.
In the event the Director of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is necessary to supplement or amend the Trust Indenture
or a Supplemental Indenture in connection with any Hedge Agreement
or any amendment, modification,
novation or termination of any
Hedge Agreement, the Mayor and
the Director of Finance are authorized to sign and deliver a Supplemental Indenture or amendment of
an existing Supplemental Indenture.
Section 4. Terms of Refunding
Bonds.
The Refunding Bonds shall contain the terms provided in or determined pursuant to, the Trust Indenture, this Ordinance, the applicable
Certificate of Award and the applicable Supplemental Indenture. Each
series of Refunding Bonds may be
secured by a separate Supplemental
Indenture, or a single Supplemental
Indenture may secure more than one
series of Refunding Bonds.
(a) General. The Refunding Bonds
may be issued as obligations bearing interest at fixed or variable
interest rates. In the event that the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, determines that the City’s best
interests will be served by a series
of Refunding Bonds bearing interest
at variable interest rates, then provision shall be made in the Supplemental Indenture applicable to that
series for the method and procedure
by which the variable rate of interest to be borne by the Refunding
Bonds of that series shall be determined (whether by reference to a
market index, by a remarketing
agent or otherwise); provided that
no series of variable rate Refunding
Bonds shall bear interest at a rate
in excess of twenty-five percent
(25%) per year (including any
Refunding Bonds held by a provider
of a Credit Support Instrument). The
Director of Finance may determine
that the terms of a variable rate
series of Refunding Bonds may or
may not permit the holders to tender their variable rate Refunding
Bonds for purchase by the City. If
the Director of Finance designates
any series of Refunding Bonds as
variable rate Refunding Bonds, and
if the Holders of that series of
Refunding Bonds are to be entitled
to tender those Refunding Bonds for
purchase,
then
the
Director
of
Finance shall also designate for
those variable rate Refunding Bonds
(and may designate others, from
time to time, in substitution therefor), the tender agent or agents
(which may be the Trustee) and the
remarketing agent or agents (which
may be any of the Original Purchasers), which designations shall
be based on the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the

38
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that the parties so designated
possess the requisite resources and
experience to provide the services
required of them and that the terms
on which the designated parties
have agreed to provide such services are fair and commercially reasonable.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into agreements with
others in connection with the delivery of the Refunding Bonds, and
from time to time thereafter so long
as the Refunding Bonds are outstanding, as may be determined by
the Director of Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for
(i) the method of determining the
variable interest rates, (ii) the
rights and procedures for tender,
(iii) liquidity or credit support, (iv)
repayment by the City of any
amounts drawn under the Credit
Support Instrument, (v) the direct
purchase of tendered Refunding
Bonds, and (vi) other arrangements
in the best interests of the City. The
Director of Finance is further authorized to terminate any such agreements if the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the City’s best interests will be
served by such termination. The
Director of Finance is further authorized to enter into agreements, from
time to time so long as the variable
rate Refunding Bonds are outstanding, supplementing or amending the
applicable Supplemental Indenture
for a series of Refunding Bonds as
provided in Section 8. To the extent
that any fees and expenses associated with agreements entered into
or terminated pursuant to this Section are not paid from proceeds of
Revenue Bonds, those fees and
expenses shall be paid from Fund
Nos. 60 SF 001, 60 SF 104, 60 SF 105,
60 SF 106 and 60 SF 141 and/or passenger facility charges, as determined by the Director of Finance
after consultation with the Director
of Port Control.
(b) Form; Exchange and Transfer.
All Refunding Bonds shall be issued
in
fully
registered
form.
The
Refunding Bonds initially shall be
delivered only in book-entry form,
shall be registered in the name of
the Depository or its nominee, as
registered owner, and immobilized
in the custody of the Depository,
and shall not be transferable or
exchangeable (except for transfer to
another Depository or its nominee)
without further action by the City
pursuant to the provisions of the
Trust Indenture.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Refunding Bonds of any
series for use in a book entry system, the Director of Finance and the
Trustee may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance and the Trustee do not or
are unable to do so, the Director of
Finance and the Trustee, after making provision for notification of the
beneficial
owners
by
the
then
Depository and any other arrangements deemed necessary, shall per-

The City Record
mit withdrawal of the Refunding
Bonds of any series from the Depository, and authenticate and deliver
registered Bond certificates to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of action
or inaction of the City, of those persons requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into any agreements
determined by the Director to be
necessary in connection with the
book entry system for the Refunding Bonds, after determining that
those agreements will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
under the Indenture (as evidenced
by the Director’s signing of those
agreements).
(c) Dates; Denominations. The

shall bear interest from the most
recent date to which interest has
been paid or duly provided for or, if

each series of Refunding Bonds
shall be payable at the times, to the

limitation, provisions thereof permitting special arrangements for
payments to the Depository.
(e) Maturities. The Refunding

and deliver a Certificate of Award
for the Refunding Bonds. In the
event the Refunding Bonds are
issued in more than one series sold
at different times, a separate Certificate of Award shall be signed
and delivered for each separately
delivered series. The sale of the
Refunding Bonds shall be awarded

costs
associated

hedging
arrangements or relating to Revenue Bonds or reserve requirements.

Mayor and the Director of Finance
are authorized to sign and deliver a

Ord. No. 69-13.
By Council Member Kelley (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing actions to manage Existing
Hedge Agreements and authorizing
and approving related matters.
Whereas, in past years, the City,
from time to time, entered into
Hedge Agreements, defined in Section 1, to achieve what were then
determined to be optimal debt service structures with respect to certain bonds issued by the City, and
certain
of
those
agreements,
referred to as the Existing Hedge
Agreements
and
more
fully
described in Section 1, remain in
effect; and
Whereas, in order to effectively
manage the Existing Hedge Agreements in response to changes in the
credit quality of financial institutions serving as counterparties to
Hedge Agreements and changes in
the financial markets, it is necessary, from time to time, to enter into
amendments, modifications, or terminations of Hedge Agreements,
including the novation from one
counterparty to another counterparty; and
Whereas, the number and credit
quality
of
financial
institutions
available as counterparties to Hedge
Agreements has generally diminished, and recent federal regulations
have imposed certain responsibilities on providers of Hedge Agreements toward their counterparties
which are expected to further affect
the availability of counterparties
and the terms of Hedge Agreements;
and
Whereas, in order to respond to
market conditions on a timely basis
to stabilize interest rates or to minimize risks of increased interest
expense or to avoid or minimize bur-

170

February 6, 2013
dens or risks or costs or other
expenses associated with the Existing Hedge Agreements or related
Support
Instruments,
as
Credit
defined in Section 1, this Council
has determined to authorize the
amendment, modification, novation
or termination of any of the Existing Hedge Agreement as provided in
this Ordinance; and
Whereas, this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department and providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that authorizing the
restructuring of outstanding Hedge
Agreements and related agreements
is necessary to enable the City to
respond to market conditions on a
timely basis for the benefit of the
City; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

Section 2. Authorization of Actions
to Manage Existing Hedge Agreements. Notwithstanding and as an
exception to any contrary provision
in any other ordinance of the City,
the Director of Finance is authorized to take actions to manage
Existing Hedge Agreements as provided in this Ordinance. To permit
the City to minimize risks, burdens
or costs associated with, and to have
the flexibility to manage the continuing
obligations
under,
each
Existing Hedging Agreement, any
related Credit Support Instrument,
or any other related agreement necessary for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by each
Existing Hedge Agreement (in each
case, including without limitation,
managing actual or expected collateral
requirements,
protecting
against the risk of counterparty
default, minimizing the risk of variations or increases in financing
costs,
ensuring
compliance
with
applicable law), this Council authorizes the Director of Finance to
enter into amendments, modifications or novations of, or to terminate, in whole or in part, any Existing Hedge Agreement or any Credit Support Instrument if the Director of Finance determines, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, that (a) the amendment,
modification, novation or termination is (i) justified by the corresponding benefit to the City, (ii)
commercially reasonable based on
then-current market conditions, and
(iii) in the City’s best interests, and
(b) any payments made or to be
made by the counterparty to the
City, or by the City to the counterparty, are fair value for such amendment, modification, novation or termination, given the credit of the
counterparty and the terms and conditions of the amendment, modification, novation or termination.

procedures for the exercise by the
counterparty or the City, as the case
may be, of any option under the
Hedge Agreement, and whether the
obligations of the City under the
Hedge Agreement shall be secured
by a Credit Support Instrument and,
if so, the terms and conditions of
such Credit Support Instrument. The
approval of each amendment, modification, novation or termination of
an Existing Hedge Agreement by
the Director of Finance shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing
and
delivery
of
the
applicable
instrument
by
the
Director
of
Finance.
Any payments owed by the City
upon such amendment, modification,
novation or termination may be paid
from money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose. The obligation of
the City to make payments under
any Hedge Agreement does not and
shall not represent or constitute a
general obligation, debt, bonded
indebtedness or a pledge of the faith
and credit of the City or the State
of Ohio. Nothing gives any party to
any Hedge Agreement the right to
have excises, ad valorem or other
taxes levied by the City or the State
of Ohio for the payment of any
amounts due under any Hedge
Agreement.
Section 3. Financial Advisors. The
Director of Finance may obtain the
services of one or more Financial
Advisors, from time to time, to
assist the Director of Finance in
making any of the determinations
required by this Ordinance to be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance or to negotiate any amendment, modification, novation or termination of any Existing Hedge
Agreement. Any Financial Advisor
employed under the authority of this
Ordinance shall be disinterested in

of the counterparties and any other
party interested in the transaction.
The Director of Finance may rely on
the written advice of any Financial
Advisor so retained.

Section References. The captions
and headings in this Ordinance are
solely for convenience of reference
and in no way define, limit, or
describe the scope or intent of any
sections,
subsections,
paragraphs,
subparagraphs, or clauses hereof.
Reference to a Section means a section of this Ordinance unless otherwise indicated.
Section 5. Interpretation. Any provisions of the Codified Ordinances
of the City which are inconsistent
with the provisions of this Ordinance shall not apply to the matters
authorized herein. Nothing in this
Ordinance is intended to, and no provision hereof shall be applied in any
manner as would, impair the obligation of contract of the City with
respect to any outstanding Hedge
Agreement, bonds, certificates of

171

43
indebtedness,
other
obligations,
indentures, or other agreements or
