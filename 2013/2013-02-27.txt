By Council Member K. Johnson.
An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting
new Sections 635.01, 635.02, and
635.03 thereof, relating the sale of
energy drinks to minors.
Whereas, highly caffeinated “energy drinks” like Red Bull, Rockstar,
Monster Energy, Full Throttle and 5
Energy
are
very
popular
Hour
among teenagers and young adults;
and
Whereas, these unregulated beverages are sold side by side with
sodas and fruit juices in gas stations, rest stops, pharmacies and
grocery stores and are marketed to
improve energy, weight loss, stamina, athletic performance and concentration; and
Whereas, energy drinks contain
caffeine, taurine, vitamins, herbal
supplements and sugar or sweeteners, with caffeine being the main
active
ingredient;
many
energy
drinks contain 70 to 80 mg of caffeine per 8 ounce serving, which is
three times the caffeine in cola
drinks;
Whereas, energy drinks often contain additional amounts of caffeine
through additives, the caffeine content of which is not required to be
listed; thus the actual caffeine dose
in a single serving of an energy
drink may exceed the amount listed
on the can or bottle; and
Whereas, energy drink manufacturers may be able to circumvent
Food and Drug Administration regulations on the amount of caffeine
in sodas by claiming their drinks
are “natural dietary supplements”;
thus, there are no requirements for
testing, warning labels or restriction against sales or consumption by
minors; and
Whereas, in 2011, a 14 year-old
girl died after drinking two, 24ounce Monster Energy drinks in 24
hours; an autopsy found that she
died of cardiac arrhythmia due to
caffeine toxicity that impeded her
heart’s ability to pump blood; and
Whereas, in October 2012, the
Food and Drug Administration announced its investigation into reports that since 2009, five people
had died and one person had a nonfatal heart attack after drinking
Monster Energy drink; and
Whereas, research has reported
that energy drinks have no therapeutic benefit and the American
Academy of Pediatrics has stated
that
unless
research
establishes
energy-drink safety in children and
adolescents, it is “prudent” to regulate such drinks, similar to the way
tobacco, alcohol and prescription
medications are regulated; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
hereby supplemented by enacting

February 27, 2013
new Sections 635.01, 635.02, and
635.03 thereof, to read as follows:
Section 635.01 Findings
This Council finds that the popularity of highly caffeinated “energy
drinks” has increased among teenagers and young adults. This Council further finds that these energy
drinks are often unregulated, sold
side by side with sodas and fruit
juices, and are marketed to improve
energy, weight loss, stamina athletic performance and concentration.
Nonetheless, researchers have found
that these energy drinks contain
high levels of caffeine and warn of
dangerous, even life threatening,
effects on blood pressure, heart rate
and brain function in children and
young adults. Moreover, a recent
article from the American Academy
of Pediatrics cautions that: energydrink consumption by children, adolescents and young adults has potentially dangerous consequences; safe
levels of consumption have not been
established; and heavy use may be
harmful or interact with medications and cause unfortunate adverse
effects. Therefore, this Council finds
it necessary to establish regulations
regarding such energy drinks in an
effort to eliminate the ability of
and
young
adults
to
teenagers
obtain these potentially dangerous
beverages.
Sale of Energy
Section 635.02
Drinks to Minors Prohibited
(a) “Energy drink” means a canned or bottled beverage (1) that
either (A) contains an amount of
caffeine exceeding or equal to 140
milligrams per 4 fluid ounce or
larger container, or (B) contains an
amount of caffeine exceeding or
equal to 80 milligrams per 0.8 fluid
ounce to 3 fluid ounce container;
and (2) that contains Taurine (2aminoethanesulfonic acid) or Guarana.
(b) No person shall give, sell, distribute or otherwise furnish any
energy drink to any person under 18
years of age.
(c) No person shall sell or offer
for sale energy drinks by or from a
vending machine except in the following locations:
(1) An area either:
A. Within a factory, business, office, or other place not open to the
general public; or
B. To which persons under the
age of eighteen (18) years are not
generally permitted access;
(2) In any other place not identified in division (c)(1) of this section, upon all of the following conditions:
A. The vending machine is located within the immediate vicinity,
plain view, and control of the person who owns or operates the place,
or an employee of such person, so
that all beverage purchases from
the vending machine will be readily observed by the person who owns
or operates the place or an employee of such person. For the purpose
of this section, a vending machine
located in any unmonitored area,
including an unmonitored coatroom,
restroom, hallway, or outer waiting
area, shall not be considered within
the immediate vicinity, plain view,

Section 635.03 Penalty
Whoever violates section 635.02 is
guilty of illegal distribution of an
energy drink, a misdemeanor of the
fourth degree. If the offender has
previously been convicted of a violation of this section, then illegal
distribution of an energy drink is a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
Each sale is considered one violation of section 635.02.
Section 2. That this ordinance is

St.
Clair

Whereas, this Council wishes to

and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of

Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

By Council Members Westbrook,
Sweeney, Pruitt, Zone, Cummins,
Kelley, Polensek, Reed, Brady, Miller, Dow, Mitchell, Brancatelli, Cimperman, K. Johnson, J. Johnson,
Cleveland, Conwell and Keane.
An emergency resolution urging
Governor Kasich and the Ohio General Assembly to restore cuts to
local municipal funds that are burdening already dwindling municipal
budgets, and to implement a more
equitable funding policy that will
allow Ohio’s municipalities to cover
the costs of providing city services.
Whereas, an overwhelming number of State cuts and policy changes
in recent years have burdened local
municipal budgets that are already
dwindling; and
Whereas, Governor Kasich has cut
the annual Local Government Fund
to municipalities across the state,
and to the City of Cleveland by over
40%,
from
$47,268,239
in
2010’s
budget to only $28,586,079 in 2013;
and
Whereas, the reduction in the
Local Government Fund has greatly
hurt cities and smaller communities

February 27, 2013
across Ohio that have relied on this
funding source for the past eighty
years to assist in covering the cost
of providing city services; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
will lose an estimated $28,078,228 in
total tax revenues and local government funds that will negatively
impact the City’s financial health;
and
Whereas, estate taxes to the City
of Cleveland have decreased from
$3,351,022 in 2010 to a projected
1,500,000 in 2013, and will be eliminated completely in 2014 due to
State policy; and
Whereas, tangible personnel property tax has fallen from $928,684 in
2010 to a projected $14,663 in 2013
and 2014; and
Whereas, the CAT tax has also
decreased from $5,661,517 in 2010 to
only a projected $101,701 in 2013 and
2014 budgets; and
Whereas, despite already dwindling resources for local municipal
budgets, Representatives Grossman
and Henne introduced House Bill 5
in the Ohio General Assembly on
January
30,
2013
that
proposes
sweeping changes to administration
and revenue generating capabilities
of the municipal income tax; and
Whereas, this Council opposes HB
5 along with the Ohio Municipal
League, as numerous areas of the
bill will result in significant revenue loss to local municipalities and
promote state administration over
local control; and
Whereas, Governor Kasich is promoting such policies at a time when
local governments around the state
are being forced to reduce basic services, lay off safety personnel, raise
taxes, and sell off assets just to
compensate for the reductions in
state funding; and
Whereas, recognizing the burden
placed on local municipalities by
recent state policies, Representatives Cera and Gerberry, along with
Northeastern Ohio cosponsors Foley,
Antonio,
and
Hagan
introduced
House Bill 17 in the Ohio General
Assembly also on January 30, 2013
that proposes restoring to the Local
Government Fund the same proportion of state tax revenue that the
Fund received in the fiscal year
2005 for the fiscal year 2014 and
each fiscal year thereafter; and
Whereas, this Council supports
HB 17 and urges the Ohio General
Assembly to pass this bill to restore
needed revenue to local municipal
budgets for the benefit of local tax
payers; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
Governor Kasich and the Ohio General Assembly to restore cuts to
local municipal funds that are burdening already dwindling municipal
budgets, and to implement a more
equitable funding policy that will
allow Ohio’s municipalities to cover
the costs of providing city services.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit certified
copies of this resolution to members
of the Northeast Ohio delegation,
Governor John Kasich, and members
of the Ohio General Assembly.
