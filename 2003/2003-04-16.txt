An emergency resolution supporting Issue 2, and encouraging voters
to vote for Issue 2 on May 6th, in
order to maintain, enrich, enhance,
and preserve the Cleveland Public
Library System.

822

April 16, 2003
Whereas, the Cleveland Public
Library system plays a vital role in
our community by providing access
to people of all ages to a world of
information; and
Whereas, the Cleveland Public
Library is committed to providing
library materials and programs for
all ages at the Main Library downtown as well as at the 28 branches
located throughout Cleveland; and
Whereas, the Cleveland Public
Library system contains a Library
for the Blind and Physically Handicapped, a Mobile Library and Public
Administration Library; and
Whereas, computer access, electronic services and instructional
classes are available at all branches and the Main Library; and
Whereas, the Cleveland Public
Library is currently undertaking a
Neighborhood Library Services Initiative, a comprehensive strategic
planning process the goal of which
is to integrate the best trends for
urban library systems with the
needs of Cleveland neighborhoods;
and
Whereas, the cost to maintain and
enhance the above mentioned services is great and the Library System is in need of increasing its revenue stream in order to ensure the
continuation of such services; and
Whereas, Issue 2 is a 5.8 mill levy
that would cost an owner of a
$50,000 home approximately $88 per
year; and
Whereas, the benefits of supporting Issue 2 are immeasurable: continued free and equitable access to
worldwide information; preservation
of
the
28
neighborhood
libraries, the Main Library and the
special libraries; increased hours of
service at neighborhood libraries,
including
year-round
Saturday
hours; more computers and computer training; special services for
youth;
additional
services
for
seniors; and programs for the Hispanic community and new Americans; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,

By Council Member Sweeney (by
request).
An emergency resolution declaring the intention to vacate portions
of Brydsale Avenue S.W., Midvale

Whereas, this Council; is satisfied

Street, as hereinafter described; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure in that
the same provides for the usual

Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That it hereby declares
its intention to vacate the following

Council
Members
Jackson,
Sweeney, Jones, White, Reed, Johnson, Britt, Lewis, Pierce Scott, Conwell, Coats, Polensek, Rybka, Cimperman, Cintron, Gordon, O’Malley,
Zone, Westbrook, Brady and Dolan.
An emergency resolution acknowledging the importance of the many
human service and social programs
provided by Cuyahoga County and
declaring this Council’s support of
the Health and Human Services levy
appearing on the May 6, 2003 ballot.
Whereas, Cuyahoga County’s human services agencies, in partnership with community, governmental
and faith-based organizations, provide the social safety net that
ensures the health, safety and welfare of our community’s children,
families, and senior citizens; and
Whereas, Cuyahoga County has
incurred the loss of significant funding from the State of Ohio over the
last several years; and
Whereas, this funding is used to
support programs to help move people from poverty to self sufficiency,
programs that help abused and
neglected children, programs that
help abused and neglected seniors,
programs that help nursing home
eligible seniors remain in their
homes,
programs
that
help
the
development of infants and programs that provide early education
to children; and
Whereas, Cuyahoga County’s funding from the State for human services was cut by $100 million in 2002
and 2003 and additional cut of $9
million in state funding is proposed
in Governor Taft’s 2004-2005 budget;
and
Whereas, programs to train people
on welfare and provide job placement services have been cut by $10
million a year and this cut results
in a reduction in job search and job
readiness programs in Cuyahoga
County; and
Whereas, an additional $38 million
of money designed to assist people
with job placement was cut by the
State of Ohio; and
Whereas, such money has been
successfully used in the past to fund
the following: job retention services
helping people resolve personal and
workplace issues; outreach efforts
with churches and community agencies to inform their clients and members of the availability of healthcare, childcare, and other benefits;
constructive after-school youth programs with education for children
too old to use daycare; housing
assistance for families on the verge
of eviction to assist such families in
retaining stable housing and providing counseling to accomplish better budgeting; parent support programs to educate parents on the
need for more involved parenting
and
participation
in
children’s
schooling and activities; and Safety
Net strategies to work with families
with children who are vulnerable
due to the termination of time-limited cash assistance; and
Whereas, the Cuyahoga County
Early Childhood Initiative, one of
the top 25 early childhood programs
in
the
country,
which
provides
extensive home visiting programs

The City Record
for teens and new mothers, quality
daycare for special needs children,
and other programs which improve
developmental outcomes for children
and help prepare them for school,
was cut by almost $5 million in the
last state budget and faces yet
another potential reduction by the
state in the upcoming budget; and
Whereas, the local childcare system was cut by $1.3 million by the
State for parent support services
which provide daycare services for
families, parent education services
relating to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, first aid, CPR, behavior management,
gang
prevention;
and
street management; and
Whereas, the State is considering
a proposal that will roll back the
subsidized daycare eligibility levels
and could force the working families of 3,200 children to make choices between caring for their children
and continuing to work or forcing
parents to choose to leave children
with older siblings or even acquaintances in order to continue to go to
work; and
Whereas, the State is considering
a proposal that could cut several
categories
of
Medicaid
eligible
working poor adults and disabled
persons, leaving an additional 6,000
more people in our community without healthcare, many of whom are
parents of children who retain their
benefits, but only if the parents can
understand that their loss of benefits does not include the child’s loss
of benefits; and
Whereas, the funds to protect
abused and neglected children have
been cut by the state in the last
biennium budget by $2.75 million
and an additional cut of $1.9 million
is proposed in Governor Taft’s 20042005 budget; and
Whereas, these funds are used by
the County to train foster parents,
recruit adoptive parents, serve children transitioning out of foster care,
and work with schools to help support families and children; and
Whereas, the State of Ohio has
proposed to completely cut the funds
providing for protective services for
vulnerable seniors in our community; and
Whereas, these funds are used to
investigate allegations of abuse and
neglect; and
Whereas, the State of Ohio also
proposes to cut funding for nursing
home eligible seniors, funding that
allows seniors to remain in their
homes and receive less costly nursing services than those provided by
a nursing home; and
Whereas, the State of Ohio proposes to cut funding for unemployed
an dislocated workers, services that
in
a
lagging
economy
provide
invaluable training and retooling
for adults and young people; and
Whereas, the partnership between
Cuyahoga County and the State of
Ohio to adequately maintain the
social safety net of human services
has been severely eroded by the
reductions in funding provided by
the State of Ohio; and
Whereas, the Board of County
Commissioners of Cuyahoga County,
Ohio, has determined that it is necessary to enhance the support provided locally for vital human services; and
Whereas, the Board of County
Commissioners of Cuyahoga County,
Ohio has declared it necessary, in
order to continue to serve the citizens of Cuyahoga County with vital
human services, to replace the cur-

850

April 16, 2003
rent 3.1 mill Human Services Levy
and enhance it by adding an additional 1.8 mills; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby acknowledges the importance of
the many human service and social
programs provided by Cuyahoga
County and declares its support of
the Health and Human Services
Levy appearing on the May 6, 2003
ballot.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
