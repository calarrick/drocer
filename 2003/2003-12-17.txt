An emergency resolution calling
on eBay to conduct a simple technical modification of its search engine
to eliminate the use of racially
derogative terms from their marketing and promotion systems and take
steps to move in a more positive and
socially acceptable way to promote
its products and services.
Whereas, the present structure of
the eBay search engine, brought to
the attention of Cleveland City
Council by the National Black Caucus of Local Elected Officials and
the National League of Cities, allows for the use of racially insensitive terms to be used to identify
products associated with AfricanAmericans such as: Black Nigger
Tobacco Marbles, 1930 Nigger Head
Oysters, Jolly Nigger Head Banks
and many others; and
Whereas,
corporations
have
a
social responsibility to respect the
cultural history and diversity of all
citizens of the United States; and in
doing so, it is vital that racially
derogatory terms be eliminated from
the flow of American commerce,
while maintaining the values associated with the constitutional right
to freedom of speech; and
Whereas, the National League of
Cities has challenged its members
and all municipal officials to take
action against racism of all forms;
and
Whereas, this Council is committed to upholding fundamental principles of tolerance, equality and the
rule of law and condemn acts of
bias, bigotry and racism against
anyone; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby calls on eBay to conduct a simple technical modification of its
search engine to eliminate the use
of racially derogative terms from
their marketing and promotion systems and take steps to move in a

An emergency resolution urging
the U.S. Congress to support the Metropolitan Congestion Relief Act and
to include the Metropolitan Congestion Relief Act in the reauthorization of the Transportation Equity
Act for the 21st Century.
Whereas, America’s cities rely on
transportation infrastructure to keep
their economies competitive in the
world marketplace; and
Whereas, many cities are facing
the need to build, rebuild, or repair
major segments of their transportation infrastructure to stimulate economic growth and ensure safe travel; and
Whereas, the current federal aid
highway program that places the
state departments of transportation
in the role of innovator and manager of urban transportation programs has not solved congestion,
which has dramatically increased in
the past ten years in most metropolitan areas; and
Whereas, the Metropolitan Congestion Relief Act (HR 3611) contains a multi-part approach to urban
congestion; and
Whereas, this multi-part approach
to urban congestion creates a new
urban congestion program, which
could be used for so called “megaprojects”; and
Whereas, this multi-part approach
to urban congestion targets more
funding that can be used for building, repairing, and rebuilding transportation segments to metropolitan
areas from existing programs; and
Whereas, this multi-part approach
to urban congestion creates a new
Incident Management Program to
combat one or the major causes of
urban congestion; and
Whereas, the “Metropolitan Congestion Relief Act” would empower
local and regional governments to
manage their transportation programs and make planning and funding decisions to address urban congestion; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
strongly urges the U.S. Congress to
support the Metropolitan Congestion
Relief Act and to include the Metropolitan Congestion Relief Act in the
reauthorization of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21).

provide
temporary

Whereas, the supportive services

that homeless individuals in the
Cuyahoga County region are provided with adequate, appropriate,

effective use of taxpayer dollars
and private contributions; and
Whereas,
proper
planning
of
homeless shelters requires the creation and development of shelters
that are able to meet the needs of
all the homeless individuals in the
Cuyahoga County region; and
Whereas, a lack of planning in
the past has resulted in the development of homeless shelters that
lack the space and capacity to provide
adequate
housing
to
the
region’s homeless individuals; and
Whereas, it is the responsibility of
the region to develop a plan and
strategy that meets the needs of the
region’s homeless individuals, including housing services and supportive
services
throughout
the
region; and
Whereas, the successful development of such plan involves the cooperation and resources of the region’s

and
Whereas, it is imperative that the

An emergency resolution declaring this Council’s insistence that
any future construction, creation,
and development of new homeless
shelters include a plan ensuring the
new shelter will be able to meet current needs of the homeless population to be served by the shelter;
declaring this Council’s support of
downtown Councilmember in his
efforts to develop a comprehensive
plan addressing the needs of the
region’s homeless individuals; declaring this Council’s support of the
use of Aviation High School as
emergency shelter overflow space;
declaring this Council’s support of
the use of the basement or lower
level of City Hall as an overflow
shelter for homeless men in the
event that the use of Aviation High
School is not feasible; and encouraging the region’s governmental
entities, private sector, public service agencies, neighborhood groups,
and businesses to work together to
ensure the implementation of homeless plans that address the needs of
the region’s homeless individuals
and ensure the efficient and effective expenditure of taxpayer dollars
and private contributions.

The City Record
Whereas, this Council is committed
to working with the private sector
and other governmental entities to
develop a regional consortium of services that provide temporary emergency shelters for homeless individuals, transitional housing for homeless individuals, and supportive services for homeless individuals; and
Whereas, the goal of this regional consortium of services is to provide homeless individuals with the
necessary skills and resources to
live self sufficiently; and
Whereas, the supportive services
component includes access to job
training, health care, child care services, educational counseling, legal
assistance and other necessary services; and
Whereas, the development of this
regional
consortium
of
services
requires proper planning to ensure
that homeless individuals in the
Cuyahoga County region are provided with adequate, appropriate,
and helpful services, including supportive housing, and efficient and
effective use of taxpayer dollars
and private contributions; and
Whereas,
proper
planning
of
homeless shelters requires the creation and development of shelters
that are able to meet the needs of
all the homeless individuals in
Cuyahoga County; and
Whereas, approximately one hundred (100) women and children currently receive temporary housing
services in the downtown Cleveland
area; and
Whereas, the current proposal for
creation
and
development
of
a
women’s and children’s homeless
shelter in the downtown Cleveland
area
would
provide
shelter
for
approximately
seventy-five
(75)
homeless women and children; and
Whereas, this current proposal is
inadequate as it would fail to provide housing services to the current
number of homeless women and children seeking shelter; and
Whereas, as a result of this failure, more than twenty-five (25)
homeless women and children will
be turned away from the shelter
each night; and
Whereas, the shelter currently
proposed will not be available for
use until after this winter season;
and
Whereas, this Council feels it is a
gross disservice to Cuyahoga County’s homeless women and children
and that it is the irresponsible and
inappropriate use of dollars allocated for homeless services to create
and develop a shelter for women
and children that, at its opening,
will fail to provide shelter for the
current population of women and
children currently receiving such
assistance; and
Whereas, the current shelter proposal requires the use of property
that is currently providing homeless
assistance services and it is unclear
what effect the shelter proposal will
have on the provision of these services; and
Whereas, the Council with representatives from the homeless service
provider community is developing a
comprehensive
plan
to
address
homeless issues and provide a consortium of services to homeless individuals; and

2797

23
Whereas, one of the goals of the
plan is to provide housing and supportive services to the region’s
homeless individuals in a medical
arts building that takes into account
the mental and physical needs of
our homeless community; and
Whereas, another goal of the plan
is meet the housing needs of the
region’s homeless women and children in a manner that would not
require overflow housing; and
Whereas, the Council looks forward to working with the Mayor,
Cuyahoga County, the private sector, public service agencies, neighborhood groups and businesses to
ensure the development and implementation of a comprehensive plan
that provides appropriate, adequate,
and helpful services to the region’s
homeless individuals and the efficient and effective expenditure of
taxpayer dollars and private contributions; and
Whereas, this Council supports
the Councilmember representing the
downtown area in his efforts to
develop
a
comprehensive
plan
addressing the needs of the region’s
homeless individuals; and
Whereas, this Council is concerned about and troubled by the
current need for additional emergency shelter space to house homeless men in Cuyahoga County; and
Whereas, there is currently a shortage of emergency shelter space for
more than seventy homeless men; and
Whereas, these homeless men are
forced to sleep on the region’s public streets and sidewalks in the bitter cold; and
Whereas, this Council is committed to working with the Salvation
Army to address this shelter shortage; and
Whereas, such commitment includes the use of General B.O. Davis
Jr. Aviation High School (“Aviation
High School”) on North Marginal
Road as emergency shelter overflow
space; and
Whereas, in the event that such
use of Aviation High School is not
feasible, this Council supports the
use of the basement or lower level
of City Hall as an overflow shelter
for homeless men; and
Whereas, such use will provide
temporary shelter to approximately
one hundred (100) homeless men;
and
Whereas, such use will reflect the
City’s commitment to addressing
homeless issues and to working
with current entities that provide
shelter to homeless individuals; and
Whereas, the region’s homeless
individuals primarily live in the
downtown area and homeless individuals turned away from homeless
shelters because of capacity issues
may often be found sleeping in locations near and around City Hall; and
Whereas, in light of this fact and
the bitter cold weather upon the
Cleveland area, this Council supports the use of the basement or
ground floor of City Hall as an overflow shelter for homeless individuals in the event that the use of Aviation High School as emergency
shelter overflow space is not feasible; and
Whereas, the Councilmember representing the downtown area has
indicated the need and importance

The City Record

of including the region’s governmental entities, the private sector,
public service agencies, neighborhood groups, and local businesses in
discussions addressing the region’s
homeless issues; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby declares its insistence that any
future construction, creation, and
development of new homeless shelters include a plan ensuring the new
shelter will be able to meet current
needs of the homeless population to
be served by the shelter and, thereby, eliminate the need for immediate overflow shelter space.
Section 2. That this Council hereby declares its support of the downtown Councilmember in his efforts
to develop a comprehensive plan
addressing the needs of the region’s
homeless individuals.
Section 3. That this Council hereby declares its support of the use of
Aviation High School as emergency
shelter overflow space for homeless
individuals.
Section 4. That this Council hereby declares, in the event that the
use of Aviation High School as
emergency shelter overflow space is
not feasible, its support of the use
of the basement or lower level of
City Hall as overflow shelter for
homeless men.
Section 5. That this Council encourages the region’s governmental
entities, private sector, public service agencies, neighborhood groups,
and businesses to work together to
ensure the implementation of homeless plans that address the needs of
the region’s homeless individuals
and ensure the efficient and effective expenditure of taxpayer dollars
and private contributions.
Section 6. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 2409-03.
By Council Members Coats, Pierce
Scott, Zone, Westbrook, Lewis, Cimperman, Sweeney, Conwell, Britt,
White, Brady and Jones.
An emergency resolution requesting Cleveland Public Power to immediately issue a moratorium on all
electric disconnections until April
15, 2004 and urging The Illuminating Company and Dominion East
Ohio Gas to adopt a moratorium on
all electric and gas disconnections
for its customers this winter.
Whereas, temperatures have begun to fall as Cleveland residents
brace for another bitterly cold winter; and
Whereas, many residents have
been fighting a weak economy and
rising energy costs, while struggling to pay their utility bills; and
Whereas, some families are forced
to choose between paying their utility bills, buying food for their families, or seeking medical help; and
Whereas, no resident, especially
our children and seniors, should face
this winter without heat or light; and
Whereas, utility companies serving Cleveland residents should place
the health, safety, and welfare of
their customers above their bottomline during our coldest months of
the year; and
Whereas, this Council requests
that any residents who have had
their utilities disconnected on or
after November 15, 2003 be allowed
to reconnect their service at no cost;
and any residents whose utilities
were disconnected on November 1,
2003 and up to November 15, 2003 be
able to reconnect their service for a
minimal fee; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council requests Cleveland Public Power to
immediately issue a moratorium on
all electric disconnections until April
15, 2004 and urges The Illuminating
Company and Dominion East Ohio
Gas to adopt a moratorium on all
electric and gas disconnections for its
customers this winter.
Section 2. The Clerk is directed to
transmit copies to the Director of
Public Utilities, the Director of
Cleveland Public Power, the Commissioners for the Public Utilities
Commission of Ohio, and representatives from the Illuminating Company and Dominion East Ohio Gas.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives

The City Record
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted December 1, 2003.
Effective December 11, 2003.
