An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio legislature to restore to the
state budget the $850,000 that was
eliminated by the Ohio House from
the Urban University Program.

921

21
Whereas, the Urban University
Program (UUP) was created in 1979
as a program of the Ohio General
Assembly and the Ohio Board of
Regents; and
Whereas, the UUP is a unique network linking the resources of eight
urban universities in Ohio with the
communities
and
students
they
serve
in
cooperative
efforts
to
improve the state’s urban regions;
and
Whereas, eight highly regarded
center units at the University of
Akron, Cleveland State University,
Kent State University, The Ohio
State University, The University of
Toledo, Wright State University,
Youngstown State University, and
the University of Cincinnati, provide
research and service to Ohio’s urban
areas; and
Whereas, the Maxine Goodman
Levin College of Urban Affairs is
the flagship of this partnership; and
Whereas, over the past several
years,
the
UUP
has
performed
invaluable services for our communities, and has successfully leveraged $2 from private foundations
and other sources for every $1
invested by the State of Ohio; and
Whereas, recently, the Ohio House
passed a budget that reduces the
financial support for the UUP by
almost 25%; and
Whereas, in contrast, the current
House budget proposal increased
funding to the Agricultural Extension Programs by 5.3%; and
Whereas, the importance of the
UUP for the future development of
Ohio’s metropolitan regions is equivalent to the critical role played by
the extension service for the agricultural community; and
Whereas, it is essential to recognize the important work performed
by the UUP and the success of the
participating eight universities in
securing external dollars for Ohio’s
economy; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the Ohio legislature to
restore to the state budget the
$850,000 that was eliminated by the
Ohio House from the Urban University Program.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby directed to transmit certified
copies of this resolution to Governor
Bob Taft, the appropriate members
of the Ohio House and Senate, and
Dean Mark Rosentraub of the Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban
Affairs.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

Res. No. 714-03.
By Mayor Campbell and Council
Members Jackson, Britt, Zone, Scott,
Gordon, Sweeney, Westbrook, Polensek and Jones.
An emergency resolution opposing
passage of the Electronic Government Services Act.
Whereas, the Ohio House of Representatives has passed an omnibus
piece of legislation including certain amendments to the Revised
Code originally introduced as the
“Electronic
Government
Services
Act” (H.B. No. 95; Proposed Revised
Code
Sections
1306.25
through
1306.29); and
Whereas, the legislation is now
before the Ohio Senate as a part of
the Biennial Budget Act of 2003; and
Whereas, the proposed Electronic
Government Services Act purports to
prohibit municipalities and other
local governments from providing
information
technology-based
services if they are also available from
private enterprise; and
Whereas, the proposed Electronic
Government
Services
Act
would
destroy the benefits and efficiencies
now enjoyed by local government
and made possible by means of electronic
communications
such
as
municipal websites or fiber-optic
networks; and
Whereas, the proposed Electronic
Government Services Act would prevent innovation and stifle the synergistic partnerships between local
governments and others that are
key to the success of the state’s
Third Frontier initiative and the
City of Cleveland’s Strong, Safe, and
Smart
Information
Technology
Strategic Initiatives, which were
designed to make state-of-the-art
information and electronic-government
services
(“e-government”)
available throughout the state and
City; and
Whereas, adoption of the proposed
Electronic Government Services Act
in the context of the state’s biennial budget patently violates the Single Subject Rule contained in Article II, §15 of the Ohio Constitution,
imperiling the validity of the entire
biennial budget; and
Whereas, the proposed Electronic
Government Services Act would violate the Home Rule powers guaranteed to municipalities under Article
XVIII, §3, of the Ohio Constitution
and
would
potentially
prohibit
municipalities from providing many
services that they currently provide
over the Internet through websites
or fiber-optic networks, which services are a proper public purpose
and a substantial benefit to the public and the municipalities; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the public peace, property,
health, or safety in that the proposed Electronic Government Services Act, if adopted, would seriously impair the ability of local governments to enter the Information
Age, would stop the deployment of
e-government services, and would
prevent efforts to make government
more accessible to citizens and more
cost efficient; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes passage of the Electronic Government Services Act on the basis
that it is unconstitutional and contrary to the public interest.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to send a copy of this
resolution to all members of the
Ohio Senate, to the President of the

The City Record
Ohio Senate, to the Minority Leader
of the Ohio Senate, to the members
of the Ohio Senate Finance Committee, to Ohio Attorney General Jim
Petro, and to Ohio Governor Bob
Taft.
Section 3. That this resolution is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

By Council Members Zone, Jackson, Britt, Brady, Jones and Dolan.
An emergency resolution declaring this Council’s support of Senate
Bill 28 and encouraging the Ohio
General Assembly to pass legislation creating a “do-not-call” registry.
Whereas, legislation was recently
introduced in the Ohio Senate to create an Ohio “Do-Not-Call” registry;
and
Whereas, Senate Bill 28 would
give Ohio the option to either use a
national registry that is currently
being developed by the Federal
Trade Commission or to develop its
own “do-not-call registry”; and
Whereas, either option, will help
residential consumers avoid unwanted telemarketing calls by enabling
residential consumers to place their
home, cell phone and fax numbers
on a “do-not-call” list; and
Whereas, this “do-not-call” list
would be maintained by the Attorney General and the proposed legislation provides for investigation and
enforcement by the Attorney General; and
Whereas, a “do-not-call” registry
will help prevent unsolicited telephone calls and will help citizens
avoid potentially fraudulent telemarketing calls; and
Whereas, Senate Bill 28 is supported by the Ohio AARP and the
Ohio Consumers’ Counsel; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that residents have a right to privacy in their homes; and
Whereas, this Council supports
Senate Bill 28 and encourages the
Ohio General Assembly to pass legislation creating a “do-not-call” registry; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby declares its support of Senate
Bill 28 and encourages the Ohio General Assembly to pass legislation
creating a “do-not-call” registry.

copies of this resolution to Governor
Bob Taft, the President of the Ohio
Senate, the Speaker of the Ohio
House of Representatives, and to all
members of the Ohio Senate and

Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
