derogative terms from their marketing and promotion systems and take

Whereas, the present structure of

An emergency resolution urging
the U.S. Congress to support the Metropolitan Congestion Relief Act and
to include the Metropolitan Congestion Relief Act in the reauthorization of the Transportation Equity
Act for the 21st Century.
Whereas, America’s cities rely on
transportation infrastructure to keep
their economies competitive in the
world marketplace; and
Whereas, many cities are facing
the need to build, rebuild, or repair
major segments of their transportation infrastructure to stimulate economic growth and ensure safe travel; and
Whereas, the current federal aid
highway program that places the
state departments of transportation
in the role of innovator and manager of urban transportation programs has not solved congestion,
which has dramatically increased in
the past ten years in most metropolitan areas; and
Whereas, the Metropolitan Congestion Relief Act (HR 3611) contains a multi-part approach to urban
congestion; and
Whereas, this multi-part approach
to urban congestion creates a new
urban congestion program, which
could be used for so called “megaprojects”; and
Whereas, this multi-part approach
to urban congestion targets more
funding that can be used for building, repairing, and rebuilding transportation segments to metropolitan
areas from existing programs; and
Whereas, this multi-part approach
to urban congestion creates a new
Incident Management Program to
combat one or the major causes of
urban congestion; and
Whereas, the “Metropolitan Congestion Relief Act” would empower
local and regional governments to
manage their transportation programs and make planning and funding decisions to address urban congestion; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,

development of new homeless shelters that are able to meet the needs
of current homeless individuals in
the Cuyahoga County region; expressing this Council’s support of
the downtown Councilmember in his
efforts to develop a comprehensive
plan addressing the region’s homeless issues; and extending this
Council’s gratitude and appreciation
to entities and individuals in Cuyahoga County that are currently
working with homeless individuals
to provide emergency shelter, transitional housing, and supportive services.
Whereas, this Council is committed to working with the private sector and other governmental entities
to develop a regional consortium of
services
that
provide
temporary
emergency shelters for homeless
individuals, transitional housing for
homeless individuals, and supportive services for homeless individuals; and
Whereas, the goal of this regional consortium of services is to provide homeless individuals with the
necessary skills and resources to
live self sufficiently; and
Whereas, the supportive services
component includes access to job
training, health care, child care services, educational counseling, legal

assistance and other necessary services; and
Whereas, the development of this
regional consortium of services requires proper planning to ensure
that homeless individuals in the
Cuyahoga County region are provided with adequate, appropriate,
and helpful services, including supportive housing, and efficient and
effective use of taxpayer dollars
and private contributions; and
Whereas,
proper
planning
of
homeless shelters requires the creation and development of shelters
that are able to meet the needs of
all the homeless individuals in the
Cuyahoga County region; and
Whereas, a lack of planning in
the past has resulted in the development of homeless shelters that
lack the space and capacity to provide
adequate
housing
to
the
region’s homeless individuals; and
Whereas, it is the responsibility of
the region to develop a plan and
strategy that meets the needs of the
region’s homeless individuals, including housing services and supportive
services
throughout
the
region; and
Whereas, the successful development of such plan involves the cooperation and resources of the region’s
governmental entities, the private
sector, and public service agencies;
and
Whereas, it is imperative that the
development of such plan incorporate suggestions and resolve concerns of individuals that reside, and
business that operate, near entities
that provide homeless assistance;
and
Whereas, the region’s homeless
individuals primarily live in the
downtown area and the downtown
area is home to several homeless
shelters and transitional housing
units; and
Whereas, the Councilmember representing the downtown area is committed to working with all stakeholders to develop and implement a
comprehensive
homeless
service
plan that meets the needs of the
region’s homeless individuals and
respects the concerns of neighborhoods; and
Whereas, the Councilmember representing the downtown area is
looking to develop a comprehensive
plan,
in
conjunction
with
the
region’s local governments, the private sector, and public service agencies, to address homeless issues and
to provide a consortium of services
to homeless individuals; and
Whereas, this plan would provide
housing and supportive services to
the region’s homeless individuals in
a medical arts building; and
Whereas, this plan would meet the
housing needs of the region’s homeless individuals and would not
require overflow housing; and
Whereas, this Council supports
the downtown Councilmember in his
efforts to develop a plan that
ensures that the Cuyahoga County
region’s homeless individuals are
provided with appropriate, adequate,
and helpful services in Cleveland
and throughout the region; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

Res. No. 2467-03.
By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency resolution declaring this Council’s insistence that
any future construction, creation,
and development of new homeless
shelters include a plan ensuring the
new shelter will be able to meet current needs of the homeless population to be served by the shelter;
declaring this Council’s support of
downtown Councilmember in his
efforts to develop a comprehensive
plan addressing the needs of the
region’s homeless individuals; declaring this Council’s support of the
use of Aviation High School as
emergency shelter overflow space;
declaring this Council’s support of
the use of the basement or lower
level of City Hall as an overflow
shelter for homeless men in the
event that the use of Aviation High
School is not feasible; and encouraging the region’s governmental
entities, private sector, public service agencies, neighborhood groups,
and businesses to work together to
ensure the implementation of homeless plans that address the needs of
the region’s homeless individuals
and ensure the efficient and effective expenditure of taxpayer dollars
and private contributions.

December 24, 2003
Whereas, this Council is committed
to working with the private sector
and other governmental entities to
develop a regional consortium of services that provide temporary emergency shelters for homeless individuals, transitional housing for homeless individuals, and supportive services for homeless individuals; and
Whereas, the goal of this regional consortium of services is to provide homeless individuals with the
necessary skills and resources to
live self sufficiently; and
Whereas, the supportive services
component includes access to job
training, health care, child care services, educational counseling, legal
assistance and other necessary services; and
Whereas, the development of this
regional
consortium
of
services
requires proper planning to ensure
that homeless individuals in the
Cuyahoga County region are provided with adequate, appropriate,
and helpful services, including supportive housing, and efficient and
effective use of taxpayer dollars
and private contributions; and
Whereas,
proper
planning
of
homeless shelters requires the creation and development of shelters
that are able to meet the needs of
all the homeless individuals in
Cuyahoga County; and
Whereas, approximately one hundred (100) women and children currently receive temporary housing
services in the downtown Cleveland
area; and
Whereas, the current proposal for
creation
and
development
of
a
women’s and children’s homeless
shelter in the downtown Cleveland
area
would
provide
shelter
for
approximately
seventy-five
(75)
homeless women and children; and
Whereas, this current proposal is
inadequate as it would fail to provide housing services to the current
number of homeless women and children seeking shelter; and
Whereas, as a result of this failure, more than twenty-five (25)
homeless women and children will
be turned away from the shelter
each night; and
Whereas, the shelter currently
proposed will not be available for
use until after this winter season;
and
Whereas, this Council feels it is a
gross disservice to Cuyahoga County’s homeless women and children
and that it is the irresponsible and
inappropriate use of dollars allocated for homeless services to create
and develop a shelter for women
and children that, at its opening,
will fail to provide shelter for the
current population of women and
children currently receiving such
assistance; and
Whereas, the current shelter proposal requires the use of property
that is currently providing homeless
assistance services and it is unclear
what effect the shelter proposal will
have on the provision of these services; and
Whereas, the Council with representatives from the homeless service
provider community is developing a
comprehensive
plan
to
address
homeless issues and provide a consortium of services to homeless individuals; and
Whereas, one of the goals of the
plan is to provide housing and supportive services to the region’s

The City Record
homeless individuals in a medical
arts building that takes into account
the mental and physical needs of
our homeless community; and
Whereas, another goal of the plan
is meet the housing needs of the
region’s homeless women and children in a manner that would not
require overflow housing; and
Whereas, the Council looks forward to working with the Mayor,
Cuyahoga County, the private sector, public service agencies, neighborhood groups and businesses to
ensure the development and implementation of a comprehensive plan
that provides appropriate, adequate,
and helpful services to the region’s
homeless individuals and the efficient and effective expenditure of
taxpayer dollars and private contributions; and
Whereas, this Council supports
the Councilmember representing the
downtown area in his efforts to
develop a comprehensive plan addressing the needs of the region’s
homeless individuals; and
Whereas, this Council is concerned about and troubled by the
current need for additional emergency shelter space to house homeless men in Cuyahoga County; and
Whereas, there is currently a shortage of emergency shelter space for
more than seventy homeless men; and
Whereas, these homeless men are
forced to sleep on the region’s public streets and sidewalks in the bitter cold; and
Whereas, this Council is committed to working with the Salvation
Army to address this shelter shortage; and
Whereas, such commitment includes the use of General B.O. Davis
Jr. Aviation High School (“Aviation
High School”) on North Marginal
Road as emergency shelter overflow
space; and
Whereas, in the event that such
use of Aviation High School is not
feasible, this Council supports the
use of the basement or lower level
of City Hall as an overflow shelter
for homeless men; and
Whereas, such use will provide
temporary shelter to approximately
one hundred (100) homeless men;
and
Whereas, such use will reflect the
City’s commitment to addressing
homeless issues and to working
with current entities that provide
shelter to homeless individuals; and
Whereas, the region’s homeless
individuals primarily live in the
downtown area and homeless individuals turned away from homeless
shelters because of capacity issues
may often be found sleeping in locations near and around City Hall; and
Whereas, in light of this fact and
the bitter cold weather upon the
Cleveland area, this Council supports the use of the basement or
ground floor of City Hall as an overflow shelter for homeless individuals in the event that the use of Aviation High School as emergency
shelter overflow space is not feasible; and
Whereas, the Councilmember representing the downtown area has
indicated the need and importance
of including the region’s governmental entities, the private sector,
public service agencies, neighborhood groups, and local businesses in
discussions addressing the region’s
homeless issues; and
