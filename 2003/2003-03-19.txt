FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES REFERRED
Ord. No. 420-03.
By Council Member Jackson (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the purchase by one or more
requirement contracts of first aid
supplies, for the various divisions of
City government, for a period not to
exceed two years.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Finance is authorized to make one
or more written requirement contracts under the Charter and the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, for the requirements for
the period of two years of the necessary items of first aid supplies,
in the approximate amount as purchased during the preceding term,
to be purchased by the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies
upon a unit basis for the various

divisions of City government. Bids
shall be taken in a manner that
permits an award to be made for
all items as a single contract, or by
separate contract for each or any
combination of the items as the
Board of Control determines. Alternate bids for a period less than two
years may be taken if deemed
desirable by the Commissioner of
Purchases and Supplies until provision is made for the requirements
for the entire term.
Section 2. That the costs of the
contract
or
contracts
shall
be
charged against the proper appropriation accounts and the Director
of Finance shall certify the amount
of the initial purchase, which purchase, together with all later purchases, shall be made on order of
the Commissioner of Purchases and
Supplies
under
a
requisition
against the contract or contracts
certified
by
the
Director
of
Finance. (RL 104748)
Section 3. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Referred to Directors of Finance,
Law; Committee on Finance.

An emergency resolution urging
the United States Congress to support a new national holiday “American Heroes Day” to recognize and
pay tribute to our public servants
and citizens who exemplify the
American Spirit.
Whereas, the events of September
11, 2001 is indelibly etched in the
minds of all Americans as well as
every citizen throughout the world;
and
Whereas, the President of the
United States George W. Bush has
put forth the notion to commemorate
a special day known as “Patriots
Day” in order to remember the
events of September 11, 2001; and
Whereas, the events of September
11, 2001 should not end with the oneyear anniversary of grief and sorrow, but as a constant reminder of
the many men and women in public
service who were very instrumental
on that day in keeping citizens safe
in the face of serious danger and
harm as a result of the terrorist
attack; and
Whereas, the American people
came together as one to show support to the many public servants
who risk their lives daily to keep
our citizens and communities safe
from those conditions that can be a
threat to the general safety and welfare of the general public; and
Whereas, since our public servants are in fact worthy of hero status because of what they do on a
daily basis, which earns the recognition, honor and appreciation of all
citizens; and
Whereas, many of our citizens
have also exemplified the American
Spirit of heroism and have demonstrated acts of courage or unity during moments of great challenges to
our country; and
Whereas, it would be more appropriate to call this special day of September 11, 2001 as “American Heroes
Day” to honor and pay tribute to our
public servants and anyone else who
has displayed acts of courage and
community service that exemplifies
the great American Spirit; and
Whereas, this special day will
enable us to honor those American
heroes who are presently serving in
our local public safety forces and
those citizens that have displayed
acts of courage under extreme circumstances or acts of unity and
community service; and
Whereas, this special day will
also enable us to remember those
victims of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on our country as well
as the public servants who sacrificed their lives while in the line of
duty to protect and maintain the
safety and welfare of the general
public; now therefore,

county commission which has organized a county public defender commission may contract with any

Whereas, it is the recommendation
of the Cleveland Municipal Court,
the district of which encompasses
Bratenahl and the City of Cleveland,

provided by the Cuyahoga County
Public Defender Commission, who
will in turn, enter into an agreement
with the Legal Aid Society of Cleveland to provide these services; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

for the period of one year beginning
January 1, 2003, at an estimated cost
of $1,300,000. (RL 128133)

of any payment received by the City
and/or Cleveland Municipal Court

Whereas, under Ordinance No. 94895, passed June 19, 1995, this Council designated an area which is in
the City of Cleveland and described
in File No. 948-95-A, as the Cleveland
Area Enterprise Zone (the “Zone”)
under Chapter 5709 of the Ohio
Revised Code; and
Whereas, in August, 1995, the
Director of Development of the State
of Ohio determined that the Zone
contains the characteristics in Section
5709.61(A) of the Revised Code and
certified the area as an “Urban Jobs
and Enterprise Zone” under Chapter
5709 of the Revised Code; and
Whereas, Minolta Business Solutions, Inc. (the “Enterprise”) has proposed to make leasehold improvements and to acquire furniture and
fixtures for their new facility located
in the Cleveland Business Park in the
Cleveland Area Enterprise Zone; and
Whereas, the Enterprise has certified to the City that, it would be
at a competitive disadvantage operating at this location if taxes on
inventory, personal property, and
real property improvements were
not abated; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, safety, property, and welfare and that its enactment is a necessary prerequisite to
providing immediate assistance to
create and preserve job opportunities and advance and promote commercial and economic development
in the City of Cleveland, and the
assistance is immediately necessary
or jobs will be lost; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
approves the application of the Enterprise for enterprise zone incentives
on the basis that the Enterprise is
qualified by financial responsibility
and business experience to create
and preserve employment opportunities in the Cleveland Area Enterprise
Zone and to improve the economic climate of the City of Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Director of
Economic Development is authorized to enter into an Enterprise
Zone Agreement with the Enterprise
to provide for a ten year sixty percent (60%) tax abatement on inventory, personal property, and real
property improvements necessary to
assist with leasehold improvements
and the acquisition of furniture and
fixtures at the new facility located
in the Cleveland Business Park in
the Cleveland Area Enterprise Zone;
the abatement shall be subject to
annual review of the Tax Incentive
Review Council.
Section 3. That the terms of the tax
abatement shall be in accordance
with the terms in the Summary contained in File No. 379-03-A.
These
terms shall not be amended, nor shall
the tax abatement be assignable or

634

March 19, 2003
transferrable to any entity, without
the prior legislative authorization by
Cleveland City Council.
Section 4. That the Director of
Economic Development is authorized to charge and accept fees in
an amount not to exceed the maximum allowable under Chapter 5709
of the Revised Code and the funds
are appropriated for the purposes
listed in Chapter 5709 of the Revised
Code.
The fees shall be deposited
to and expended from Fund No. 17
SF 305, Loan Fees Fund.
Section 5. That the Director of
Law shall prepare and approve the
agreement and that the agreement
shall contain the terms and provisions the director deems necessary
to protect the City’s interest.
Section 6. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
