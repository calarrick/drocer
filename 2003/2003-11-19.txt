By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency resolution objecting to the transfer of ownership of

John Avenue.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Department of Liquor
Control of an application for the
transfer of ownership of a D5 and
D6 Liquor Permit from LDJ Foods,
Inc., 1st & 2nd Floors and Basement
and Patio, 4114 John Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44113, Permanent Number

DBA Two Bridges Tavern, Inc., 1st
& 2nd Floors and Basement and

Ohio
44113,
Permanent
Number
9122325; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based on
other legal grounds as set forth in
Revised Code Section 4303.292; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of
notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of

An emergency resolution opposing
the Free Trade Area of the Americas trade agreement.
Whereas, the Free Trade Area of
the Americas (“FTAA”) is an effort
to unite the economies of the Western Hemisphere into a single Free
Trade Zone; and
Whereas, the FTAA is an expansion of the North American Free
Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”); and
Whereas, negotiations surrounding the FTAA have not occurred in
a forum that provides for effective
public evaluation and input; and
Whereas, like NAFTA, the FTAA
contains an investment clause that
provides corporations the right to
sue foreign governments for compensation if they believe corporate
investments have been harmed by
“regulatory takings”; and
Whereas, this provision and other
provisions in the FTAA will threaten clean air, clean water, and the
preservation of ecosystems; and
Whereas, the FTAA does not protect the right of employees to organize and bargain collectively; and
Whereas, trade ministers from
thirty-four nations are scheduled to
meet in Miami, Florida to negotiate
the FTAA on November 20th and
November 21st; and
Whereas, demonstrations are being
planned
by
organized
labor
in
Miami to express growing opposition to the FTAA; and
Whereas, rallies and marches are
being planned throughout the United
States to support fair trade, not the
FTAA; and
Whereas, the Cleveland AFL-CIO
and other groups will hold one such
rally and march in Public Square in
Cleveland on Thursday, November
20th; and
Whereas, free trade agreements
should ensure decent wages and
working conditions, affordable services, and adequate enforcement of
environmental, health, and safety
laws for all workers; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council is
opposed to the proposed Free Trade
Area of the Americas trade agreement.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to President

An emergency resolution encouraging the Bush Administration to
continue the protective steel tariffs
and allow the protective steel tariffs
to operate through their original
three year term.
Whereas, the proud tradition of
steelmaking is a vital part of our
community’s history and identity,
and our local economy is still largely linked to the steel industry as a
provider of quality jobs; and
Whereas, a thorough Section 201
investigation by the International
Trade Commission (“ITC”) concluded that American steel companies,
communities, families and other nonsteel manufacturing operations were
injured as a result of illegallydumped foreign steel, and the ITC
recommended immediate action by
the U.S. Department of Commerce to
curb the illegal dumping of foreign
steel in U.S. markets; and
Whereas, after receiving the ITC’s
report and carefully considering a
number of remedies, the Department
of Commerce and the Bush Administration instituted limited tariffs on
specific steel products for a period
of three years; and
Whereas, the World Trade Organization has determined that these
limited tariffs violate global trade
rules; and
Whereas, the World Trade Organization ruling becomes final in
December; and
Whereas, the Bush Administration
has not yet decided whether or not
to lift the tariffs; and
Whereas, enactment of the tariffs
has slowed the illegal dumping of
foreign steel and allowed American
steelmakers and their employees to
partially recover from the crises
sparked in 1998 by illegally dumped
foreign steel; and
Whereas, if the steel industry is
to survive, recovery must be able to
continue; and
Whereas, the American steel industry is currently in a state of widescale restructuring and consolidation
that
will
eventually
enable
the
remaining American steel companies
to compete effectively in an increasingly global marketplace; and
Whereas, this Council supports
the continuation of these protective
tariffs through their original three
year term; and

2595

19
Whereas, premature ending of
these protective tariffs will have
devastating consequences in the
Cleveland area as many individuals,
families, and business rely on the
steel manufacturing industry and
related industries for jobs and business; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council hereby encourages the Bush Administration to continue the protective
steel tariffs and allow the protective
steel tariffs to operate through their
original three year term.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to President
George W. Bush and the United
States Secretary of Commerce.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of

it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

An emergency resolution urging
the state legislature, when considering Sub. H.B. No. 218 regarding
the state coastal management program, to ensure that any project or
activity affecting the coastal area of
Lake Erie comply with any legally
applicable regulations of the local
municipal authority.
Whereas, on November 13, 2003,
the state House of Representatives
introduced substitute House Bill 218;
and
Whereas, Sub. H.B. 218 speaks to
the state’s coastal management program and its effect on the rights of
property owners on Lake Erie relative to construction of permanent
structures on such property; and
Whereas, the use of all property
fronting Lake Erie is of great interest and concern to local municipalities located on the lake; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the state legislature, when
considering Sub. H.B. No. 218 regarding the state coastal management
program, to ensure that any project
