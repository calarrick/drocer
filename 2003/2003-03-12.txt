ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS

Res. No. 325-03.

An emergency resolution supporting O.C.D.S. Limited Partnership in
its efforts to develop affordable
housing units in Wards 13, 14, and
17 in the City of Cleveland through
the use of housing tax credits from
the Ohio Housing Finance Agency.
Whereas, each year the Ohio
Housing Finance Agency allocates
housing credits for affordable housing developments throughout Ohio
using
a
competitive
proposal
process; and
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland has recognized the
need to maintain affordable housing
in our neighborhoods; and
Whereas, O.C.D.S. Limited Partnership is proposing to develop up

6501-6515 Detroit Avenue; and
Whereas, eighty-five percent (85%)
of these housing units will be occupied by low income families, with
fifteen percent (15%) being market
rate units; and
Whereas, twenty percent (20%) of
these housing units will serve a specific
needs
population,
namely
households whose annual income is
below thirty-five (35%) of the area
of median income; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the

Res. No. 326-03.
By Council Members Coats and
Polensek.
An emergency resolution designating March 4th of each year as
“School Safety Day” in Cleveland.

The City Record
Whereas, on March 4, 1908, 172
children, two teachers, and one rescue worker died in a fire at the former Lakeview Elementary School in
the Village of Collinwood; and
Whereas, this tragic fire started
shortly after 9:00 a.m. when an overheated pipe came in contract with
dry wood joists and the fire spread
quickly to the front stairs; and
Whereas, despite desperate yet
valiant efforts by families and railroad workers, the fire spread in less
than 30 minutes and only 194 of the
366 students enrolled were able to
escape the fire and many children
were trapped inside the rear firstfloor exit; and
Whereas, a report on the fire concluded that the children’s failure to
escape resulted from their own
panic and from the fleeing children
be wedged tightly on the stairs
behind a set of inner vestibule doors
which were narrower than the outer
doors; and
Whereas, the horror of this fire
resulted in numerous school inspections across the country and the
world and resulted in stricter fire
safety standards; and
Whereas,
disaster
management
officials to this day use the principles, standards and errors of this
tragic day to establish fire safety
standards; and
Whereas, it is appropriate for the
City of Cleveland to remember this
tragic event and others and reflect
on the importance of school safety
on March 4th of each year; and
Whereas, this Council wishes to
designate March 4th of each year as
“School Safety Day” in the City of
Cleveland; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby designates March 4th of each
year as “School Safety Day” in the
City of Cleveland.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
