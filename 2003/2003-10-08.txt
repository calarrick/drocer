Whereas, the Administration recently decided to reinstate two
employees with back pay; and
Whereas, the back pay to be provided to each employee is more
than
$360,000
for
at
total
of
$720,000; and
Whereas, this reinstatement occurred after the Administration’s
decision to withdraw an appeal of
an arbitrator’s decision ordering
reinstatement of the employees; and
Whereas, this Council is concerned about this decision, and any
future settlement decisions, as these
decisions affect the City’s budget;
and
Whereas, this Council is concerned about any similar settlements being negotiated or under
consideration by the Administration;
and
Whereas, this Council and the
Administration must work together
to balance the budget and address
budget deficit issues; and
Whereas, in order to do so, it
would be appropriate for this Council to receive notice of proposed settlement agreements; and
Whereas, this Council is concerned that further settlement of
cases, including labor cases involving termination for residency violations, will only enhance the City’s
current financial difficulties and
increase the likelihood of layoffs;
and
Whereas, this Council, for the reasons stated in this resolution, finds
it necessary to request that the
Administration
carefully
consider
the appropriateness of settling current litigation and requests that the
Administration provide Council with
notice of proposed settlement agreements; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council expresses its commitment to working
with the Administration to balance
the budget in a manner that is beneficial to the citizens and taxpayers
of the City of Cleveland.
Section 2. That this Council hereby encourages the Administration,
when considering settlement agreements, to consider what is morally
correct and in the best interests of
the citizens and taxpayers of the
City.

Section 3. That this Council hereby requests that the Administration provide Council with notice of
any and all settlement agreements

Whereas, the Board of Education’s
web-site encourages parents and the
community to attend Board meetings; and
Whereas, the Board of Education

recently changed its meetings schedule; and
Whereas,

Whereas, the date and week of a

from month to month; and
Whereas, the Board of Education

and
Whereas, the previous Board of

more convenient for the community
and parents and thereby provided an
opportunity for the public input; and
Whereas, this Council is concerned that the meeting schedule
recently approved by the Board of

of Education’s meetings; and
Whereas, this Council encourages

its meeting schedule to a schedule
that is similar to the previous schedule; and
Whereas, this Council also encourages the Board of Education to
provide copies of the Board meeting

Board of Education; and
Whereas, advance notice of agenda items will increase public awareness and the opportunity for public
participation; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
