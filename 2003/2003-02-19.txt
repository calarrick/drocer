balance budgets; and
Whereas, this rule would place an
unreasonable burden on the City of

effect in the middle of a fiscal year
and would not allow public employers to budget and appropriately plan
for the catch up provision of the

would provide for enhanced penalty
provisions when employer contributions are not submitted in a timely
manner; and

By Council Members Cimperman,
Sweeney, Zone and Jones.
An emergency resolution urging
the Federal Highway Administration to review the Detroit-Superior
Bridge Project and all factors relating to safety and access and upon
conclusion of such review to grant
an exception to the Federal Highway Administration’s criteria for
width of lane designations as the
Project is consistent with highway
safety; and urging the Federal
Highway Administration to fund
and support the Detroit-Superior
Bridge Project.
Whereas,
the
Detroit-Superior
Bridge was constructed in 1917 and,
at the time of its construction and
today, serves to connect the East
Side and West Side of Cleveland;
and
Whereas,
the
Detroit-Superior
Bridge is a unique historic bridge;
and
Whereas, the current condition of
the Detroit-Superior Bridge fails to
provide adequate and safe space for
pedestrian and bike travel; and
Whereas, as a result of this failure, many pedestrians and bicyclists
choose to travel in lanes designated
for motor vehicle travel; and
Whereas, the current condition of
the Detroit-Superior Bridge requires
federal, state, and local governmental
entities
to
develop
a
plan
addressing necessary repairs and
safety issues; and
Whereas, after three years of
planning and design review by the
Cuyahoga County Engineer, the City
of Cleveland Department of Public
Service, and the Northeast Ohio
Areawide Coordinating Agency, construction was scheduled to being
this summer on the Detroit-Superior
Bridge; and
Whereas, the planned construction
project
for
the
Detroit-Superior
Bridge was developed with the cooperation of the Ohio City Near West
Development Corporation, the Historic Gateway Development Corporation, the Historic Warehouse Development Corporation, the Downtown Cleveland Partnership, and
ParkWorks; and
Whereas, the planned construction
project
for
the
Detroit-Superior
Bridge was also created with citizen
and resident input as there were
numerous public meetings and block
club discussions on the Detroit-Superior Bridge Project; and

22
Whereas, the planned construction
project
for
the
Detroit-Superior
Bridge was created and reviewed in
a manner that invited and included
participation by residents, businesses, non-profit entities, and governmental agencies; and
Whereas, this planned construction project for the Detroit-Superior
Bridge creates wider sidewalks and
new bike lanes on the Detroit-Superior Bridge; and
Whereas, wider sidewalks and
new bike lanes were included in the
design
of
the
Detroit-Superior
Bridge Project in order to address
transportation needs of residents of
Ohio City and downtown Cleveland;
and
Whereas,
this
Detroit-Superior
Bridge Project is receiving funding
from
the
federal
government’s
Transportation Enhancement Funding Program and the primary purpose of such Program is to fund projects that balance the safety and
transportation
access
needs
of
pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists; and
Whereas, the United States Department of Transportation’s policy
statement indicates that “bicycle
and pedestrian ways shall be established in new construction and
reconstruction projects in all urbanized areas”; and
Whereas, the United States Department of Transportation policy
statement also indicates that “there
is no question that conditions for
bicycling and walking need to be
improved in every community in the
United States; it is no longer acceptable that 6,000 bicyclists and pedestrians are killed in traffic every
year, that people with disabilities
cannot travel without encountering
barriers, and that two desirable and
efficient modes of travel have been
made difficult and uncomfortable”;
and
Whereas, the United States Department of Transportation policy
statements also states that “every
transportation
agency
has
the
responsibility and the opportunity to
make a difference to the bicycle
friendliness and walkability of our
communities. The design information to accommodate bicyclists and
pedestrians is available, as is the
funding. The United States Department of Transportation is committed
to doing all it can to improve conditions for bicycling and walking
and to make them safer ways to
travel”; and
Whereas, the design of the Detroit-Superior Bridge Project fully
reflects the policy statement of the
United States Department of Transportation in that it incorporates the
needs of pedestrians, bicyclists, and
motorists; and
Whereas,
the
Detroit-Superior
Bridge Project was designed in a
manner that ensures the safety of
all users of the Detroit-Superior
Bridge; and
Whereas,
the
Detroit-Superior
Bridge Project improves highway
safety by providing dedicated space
for non-motorized users; and
Whereas, safety of all users of the
Detroit-Superior Bridge, motorists,
truckers, bicyclists, and pedestrians,
was a concern at all times during
design
of
the
Detroit-Superior

The City Record
Bridge Project and was a factor in
finalizing the design; and
Whereas,
the
Detroit-Superior
Bridge is a critical link between the
East Side and West Side of Cleveland; and
Whereas, the neighborhoods on
each side of the Detroit-Superior
Bridge are some of the most diverse
communities in the State of Ohio; and
Whereas, this project, upon completion, will continue to link the
East Side of Cleveland with the
West Side of Cleveland, as well as
downtown
Cleveland
with
Ohio
City, and will enable all citizens to
utilize the Detroit-Superior Bridge,
in a safe manner, regardless of
their selected mode of transportation; and
Whereas, the Federal Highway
Administration is threatening to
revoke support and funding for this
project because of an issue with
respect to lane width and designation; and
Whereas, the Federal Highway
Administration’s
criteria
indicate
that a route must consist of lanes
designated to be a width of twelve
feet or more or must otherwise be
consistent with highway safety; and
Whereas,
the
Detroit-Superior
Bridge Project is consistent with
highway safety and the federal government can grant an exception in
this type of circumstance; and
Whereas, failure to grant an
exception will deny safe passage on
the Detroit-Superior Bridge for many
citizens of Cleveland; and
Whereas, in addition to being
consistent
with
highway
safety
standards, the unique historic features of the Detroit-Superior Bridge
and its connection from downtown
to the Ohio City neighborhood, render the Detroit Superior Bridge
Project worthy of special consideration; and
Whereas, this Council urges the
Federal Highway Administration to
review the Detroit-Superior Project
and all factors relating to safety
and access; and
Whereas, this Council is confident
that upon conclusion of such review,
the
Federal
Highway
Administration will conclude that the current design of the Detroit-Superior
Bridge is consistent with highway
safety; and
Whereas, this Council urges the
Federal Highway Administration to
fund and support the Detroit-Superior Bridge Project; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Federal Highway Administration to review the Detroit-Superior
Bridge Project and all factors relating to safety and access and upon
conclusion of such review to grant
an exception to the Federal Highway Administration’s criteria for
width of lane designations as the
project is consistent with highway
safety.

An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Economic Development to enter into an Enterprise
Zone Agreement with HS Processing
Limited Partnership and Heidtman
Steel Products, Inc. to provide for a
ten year seventy-five percent abatement
for
certain
real
property
improvements,
personal
property,
and inventory as an incentive to
acquire and construct a steel processing and distribution facility to
be located east of the Cuyahoga

Whereas, pursuant to Ordinance
No. 948-95, passed June 19, 1995, this
Council designated an area which is

Cleveland
and
described in File No. 948-95-A, as the
Cleveland
Area
Enterprise
Zone
(the “Zone”) pursuant to Chapter

The City Record
5709 of the Ohio Revised Code; and
Whereas, in August, 1995, the

Revised Code; and
Whereas, HS Processing Limited
Partnership and Heidtman Steel
Products, Inc. (the “Enterprise”)
have proposed to acquire and construct a steel processing and distribution facility to be located east of
the Cuyahoga River in the Cleveland Area Enterprise Zone; and
Whereas, the Enterprise has certified to the City that, but for abatement of real property improvements,
personal property, and inventory the
Enterprise would be at a competitive disadvantage by operating at
this location; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure in that
the same provides for the immediate
preservation of the public peace,
safety, property, and welfare and
for the further reason that its enactment is a necessary prerequisite to
providing immediate assistance to
create and preserve job opportunities and advance and promote commercial and economic development

Economic Development is authorized to enter into an Enterprise
Zone Agreement with the Enterprise
to provide for a ten year seventyfive percent (75%) abatement of
