No. 1773-A-76, the “Original Indenture”) between the City and J.P.

Whereas, this Council has determined to authorize the issuance of

the Outstanding Revenue Bonds and
to provide definitive financing for a

mature on November 17, 2003 (the
“Project”); and
Whereas, this Council has determined to authorize the City to enter
into interest rate swap, swaption
and other hedging arrangements

The City Record
with respect to the Outstanding Revenue Bonds and the Additional Revenue Bonds as provided in this Ordinance; and
Whereas, the City may obtain debt
service savings with respect to certain of the Outstanding Revenue
Bonds by entering into a certain
type of hedging arrangement (referred to in this Ordinance as a
“Swaption”) with a financial institution as counterparty having terms
that provide for an upfront payment
to the City by the counterparty in
consideration of the City’s giving
the counterparty the option to make
effective at a future date an interest rate exchange transaction with
the City in which the City will make
payments to the counterparty at a
fixed rate and the counterparty will
make payments to the City at a variable rate, in each case calculated in
reference to an amount equal to the
principal amount outstanding, from
time to time, of refunding obligations (referred to in this Ordinance
as the “Swaption Refunding Bonds”)
to be issued by the City to refund
those Outstanding Revenue Bonds
maturing on and after the later of
the date of exercise of the option
granted to the counterparty by the
Swaption or the date on which those
Outstanding Revenue Bonds may be
optionally redeemed by the City
(referred to in this Ordinance as the
“Swaption Refunded Bonds”); and
Whereas, this Ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department and providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that authorizing the
Additional Revenue Bonds is necessary to provide definitive financing
for the Project prior to the maturity of the outstanding notes and to
enable the Airport System to take
advantage of current favorable market
conditions

and “Bond Legislation”.
Section 2. Authorization of the
Series 2003 Bonds.
This Council finds and determines
it is necessary and proper and in
the best interest of the City to issue
the Series 2003 Bonds for the purpose of paying costs of the Project
and refunding one or more series of
the Outstanding Revenue Bonds, or
designated maturities thereof. The
principal amount of each series of
Series 2003 Bonds is to be the
amount set forth in the Certificate
of Award authorized in Section 6.
The aggregate principal amount of
Series 2003 Bonds issued shall not
exceed $215,000,000 and shall be the
amount determined by the Director
of Finance, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
necessary (i) to retire the interim
notes issued to pay costs of the Project, (ii) to refund the Outstanding
Revenue Bonds to obtain debt service savings and/or to restructure
Bond service charges, (iii) to fund
any deposits to the Special Funds
under the Indenture, including any
capitalized interest, (iv) to pay
costs of any Credit Support Instruments, (v) to pay amounts owed
under Hedge Agreements, and (vi)
to pay costs of issuing the Series
2003 Bonds and refunding the Outstanding Revenue Bonds designated
in the Certificate of Award. The
proceeds from the sale of each
series of Series 2003 Bonds shall be

The City Record
allocated, deposited and applied as
provided in Section 7 of this Ordinance.
The Series 2003 Bonds may be
issued in one or more separate
series, each bearing a distinctive
designation, provided that the Series
2003 Bonds of each series satisfy the
requirements of this Ordinance and
the Indenture. Separate series of
Series 2003 Bonds may be issued at
the same or different times. The
Series 2003 Bonds of each series
shall be designated as provided in
the applicable Certificate of Award
and, if issued after December 31,
2003, shall refer to the year in which
issued instead of 2003. A separate
Certificate of Award and a separate
Supplemental
Indenture
may
be
delivered for each series. In each
case there shall be included in the
costs funded the costs of issuance of
the Series 2003 Bonds and any
required deposits to the Special
Funds attributable to the Series 2003
Bonds. The Series 2003 Bonds shall
constitute Revenue Bonds for all
purposes of the Indenture.
This Council finds and determines
that the issuance of the Series 2003
Bonds to finance or refinance costs
of Airport System facilities serves
proper, public, municipal purposes
by providing air travel facilities
needed by the people of the City of
Cleveland. The Project advances the
economic welfare of the City by providing for future expansion of the
Airport System when circumstances
so warrant, thereby increasing and
promoting commerce by providing
necessary transportation for individuals and commercial enterprises
purchasing and selling services and
products in northeastern Ohio, and
the Project thereby creates and preserves jobs and employment opportunities in the City and improves
the economic welfare of the City.
Section 3. Authorization of Hedging Arrangements.
This Council finds that by engaging
in
interest
rate
hedging
arrangements, from time to time, the
City can, in effect, convert interest
on all or a portion of the Revenue
Bonds under the Indenture from a
fixed rate to a variable rate, or from
a variable rate to a fixed rate, and
thereby may reduce its cost of borrowing by optimizing the relative
amounts of fixed and variable rate
obligations from time to time and
minimizing the risk of variations in
its debt service costs. To permit the
City to have the flexibility to undertake interest rate swap, swaption,
rate cap, rate collar and other hedging transactions from time to time,
and to establish the procedures for
approving those transactions, this
Council authorizes the signing and
delivery of one or more agreements
(each, a “Hedge Agreement”) and
any related agreements necessary
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by each Hedge
Agreement. The authorizations in
this Section 3 are supplemental to
and not in derogation of any authority provided by any other ordinance
of this Council concerning hedging
arrangements.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that it is to the financial advantage of the City and in the City’s
best
interests
that
a
hedging
arrangement be undertaken by the
City with respect to any Revenue
Bonds issued or to be issued under

1275

7
the
Indenture,
the
Director
of
Finance may authorize one or more
interest rate hedge transactions in
accordance
with
the
applicable
Hedge Agreement; provided that (a)
the maximum aggregate notional
amount of interest rate swap or
other
hedging
transactions
outstanding at any one time, net of offsetting interest rate swap or other
hedging
transactions,
shall
not
exceed twenty percent (20%) of the
aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Revenue Bonds (as defined
in the Original Indenture), (b) the
counterparty shall be rated at the
time of signing the Hedge Agreement not lower than A+ or A1 by
at least one rating agency or its
obligations under the Hedge Agreement shall be guaranteed or insured
by an entity rated at the time of
signing the Hedge Agreement not
lower than A+ or A1 by at least one
rating agency, and (c) the term of
each hedge transaction shall not
exceed the final maturity of the
Revenue Bonds to which the hedge
relates or (in the case of an option)
will relate.
The Director of Finance shall
negotiate the terms of each Hedge
Agreement with a counterparty satisfying the credit criteria in this
Ordinance. In the case of any Hedge
Agreement involving a Swaption,
the City shall receive a written opinion of a Financial Advisor that the
upfront payment to be made by the
counterparty to the City, or by the
City to the counterparty, shall be in
an amount that is fair value for the
Hedge Agreement, given the credit
of the counterparties and the terms
and conditions of the Hedge Agreement. The Director of Finance shall
determine the terms and conditions
of the Hedge Agreement, including
without limitation, the time or times
and procedures for the exercise by
the counterparty or the City, as the
case may be, of its option under the
Hedge
Agreement,
whether
the
obligations of the City under the
Hedge Agreement shall be secured
by a Credit Support Instrument, and
the rates to be paid by the counterparty to the City and by the City to
the counterparty under the Hedge
Agreement in the event of the exercise of the option. The approval of
each interest rate hedge transaction
by the Director of Finance shall be
conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery of the applicable
Hedge Agreement by the Director of
Finance.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from the Airport Revenues and may
be payable also from other funds
permitted by law to be used for the
purpose, as identified by the Director of Finance in the Hedge Agreement.
Those
payments
may
be
secured by a pledge of Airport Revenues, to the extent permitted by
the Indenture, all as determined by
the Director of Finance and set
forth in the Hedge Agreement. The
obligation of the City to make payments under any Hedge Agreement
does not and shall not represent or
constitute a general obligation, debt,
bonded indebtedness or a pledge of
the faith and credit of the City or
the State of Ohio. Nothing gives any
party to any Hedge Agreement the
right to have excises, ad valorem or
other taxes levied by the City or the
State of Ohio for the payment of any
amounts due under any Hedge
Agreement.

8
Section 4. Authorization of Swaption Refunding Bonds.
In the event that the City enters
into a Hedge Agreement under
authority of this Ordinance that
involves
a
Swaption
or
other
arrangement requiring the City to
issue Revenue Bonds upon the exercise by the counterparty to the
Hedge Agreement of an option, the
City shall issue Swaption Refunding
Bonds for the purpose of refinancing the Swaption Refunded Bonds
identified in the Hedge Agreement.
The aggregate principal amount of
Swaption Refunding Bonds to be
issued shall not exceed $80,000,000
and shall be the amount determined
in the Certificate of Award by the
Director of Finance to be the aggregate principal amount of Swaption
Refunding Bonds that are required
to be issued, taking into account
any other funds available to the
City for the purpose, in order to
refund
the
Swaption
Refunded
Bonds, to establish any reserves
required under the Indenture, to pay
costs of any Credit Support Instruments, to pay expenses relating to
the
refunding
of
the
Swaption
Refunded Bonds and the issuance of
the Swaption Refunding Bonds and
otherwise to effect the purpose for
which
the
Swaption
Refunding
Bonds are to be issued. Notwithstanding that limitation, the maximum aggregate principal amount of
Swaption Refunding Bonds may be
increased to include the amount of
any termination payment and related incremental costs of any reserves
required under the Indenture, costs
of any Credit Support Instruments
and costs of issuance in the event
that that Director of Finance determines, based on the written advice
of a Financial Advisor, that it is to
the financial advantage of the City
and in the City’s best interests to
terminate the Hedge Agreement.
This Council finds and determines
that the issuance of the Swaption
Refunding Bonds to refund the
Swaption Refunded Bonds serves
proper, public, municipal purposes
by optimizing financing arrangements for air travel facilities needed by the people of the City of
Cleveland.
Section 5. Terms of Additional
Bonds.
The Authorized Additional Bonds
shall contain the terms provided in
or
determined
pursuant
to,
the
Indenture,
this
Ordinance,
the
applicable Certificate of Award and
the applicable Supplemental Indenture. Each series of Authorized
Additional Bonds may be secured by
a separate Supplemental Indenture
or a single Supplemental Indenture
may secure more than one series of
Authorized Additional Bonds.
(a) General. In the event that the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, determines that the City’s best
interests will be served by causing
a series of Authorized Additional
Bonds to be obligations bearing
interest at variable interest rates,
then the Director of Finance is
authorized to so specify in the Certificate of Award for that series. If
the Director of Finance so determines, then the method and procedure by which the variable rate of
interest to be borne by the Authorized Additional Bonds of that series
shall be determined as provided in
the applicable Supplemental Indenture, whether by auction, by refer-

The City Record
ence to a market index, by a remarketing agent or otherwise; provided
that no series of variable rate
Authorized Additional Bonds shall
bear interest at a rate in excess of
fifteen percent (15%) per year.
Notwithstanding that limitation, a
series
of
Authorized
Additional
Bonds held by a provider of a Credit Support Instrument may bear
interest at a rate not in excess of
twenty-five percent (25%) per year
as provided in the agreement with
the provider of the Credit Support
Instrument. The Director of Finance
may determine that the terms of a
variable rate series of Authorized
Additional Bonds may or may not
permit the holders to tender their
variable rate Authorized Additional
Bonds for purchase by the City. If
the Director of Finance designates
any series of Authorized Additional
Bonds as variable rate Authorized
Additional Bonds, and if the Holders of that series of Authorized
Additional Bonds are to be entitled
to tender those Authorized Additional Bonds for purchase, then the
Director of Finance shall also designate for those variable rate Authorized Additional Bonds (and may
designate others, from time to time,
in substitution therefor), the tender
agent or agents and the remarketing agent or agents, which designations shall be based on the determination of the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the parties
so designated possess the requisite
resources and experience to provide
the services required of them and
that the terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide
such services are fair and commercially reasonable. The Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements in connection with the
delivery of the Authorized Additional Bonds, and from time to time
thereafter so long as the Authorized
Additional Bonds are outstanding,
with providers of Credit Support
Instruments, tender agents (which
may be the Trustee), remarketing
agents (which may be any of the
Original Purchasers) and others as
may be determined by the Director
of Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the method of
determining the variable interest
rates, permitting holders the right
of tender and providing for payment
of the purchase price of, or debt service on, the variable rate Authorized
Additional Bonds. In the event the
variable rate Authorized Additional
Bonds are issued as auction rate
obligations, the Director of Finance
is authorized to enter into agreements, from time to time, with auction agents and others, or to cause
the Trustee to enter into those
agreements, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor that
the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed
to provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of
any series of Authorized Additional
Bonds, and regardless of whether
that series of Authorized Additional
Bonds bears interest at variable or
fixed rates, is authorized to contract
for a Credit Support Instrument, and
to pay the costs of it from proceeds
of the Authorized Additional Bonds,
if he determines, based on the writ-

1276

June 11, 2003
ten advice of a Financial Advisor,
that the Credit Support Instrument
will result in a savings in the cost
of the financing to the City.
(b) Form; Exchange and Transfer.
All
Authorized Additional
Bonds
shall be issued in fully registered
form. The Authorized Additional

“Tax-Exempt
Bonds”).
The
City
covenants that it will use, and will
restrict the use and investment of,
the proceeds of the Tax-Exempt
Bonds in such manner and to such
extent as may be necessary so that
(a) the interest on the Tax-Exempt
Bonds will be excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, and (b) in the case of any
Tax-Exempt Bonds qualifying as
bonds, the interest on which is not
treated as an item of tax preference
under Section 57 of the Code (“NonAMT Bonds”), such Tax-Exempt
Bonds will be treated as Non-AMT
Bonds.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required of
it for the interest on the Tax-Exempt
Bonds to be and to remain excluded
from gross income for federal income
tax purposes, (b) it will not take or
authorize to be taken any actions
that would adversely affect that
exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting for it, will, among other acts of
compliance, (i) apply the proceeds of
the Tax-Exempt Bonds to the governmental purposes of the borrowing,
(ii) restrict the yield on investment
property, (iii) make timely and adequate payments to the federal government, (iv) maintain books and
records and make calculations and
reports, and (v) refrain from certain
uses of those proceeds and, as applicable, of property financed with such
proceeds, all in such manner and to
the extent necessary to assure such
exclusion of that interest under the
Code.
The Director of Finance, or any
other officer of the City having
responsibility for issuance of the
Tax-Exempt Bonds, is hereby authorized (a) to make or effect any election, selection, designation, choice,
consent, approval, or waiver on
behalf of the City with respect to
the Tax-Exempt Bonds as the City
is permitted or required to make or
give under the federal income tax
laws, including, without limitation
thereto, any of the elections provided for in Section 148(f)(4)(C) of the
Code or available under Section 148
of the Code, for the purpose of
assuring, enhancing or protecting
the favorable tax treatment or status of the Tax-Exempt Bonds or
interest thereon or assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose,
reducing
the
burden
or
expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or payments
of penalties, or making payments of
special amounts in lieu of making
computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as rebate, or
obviating those amounts or payments, as determined by that officer,
which action shall be in writing and
signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf
of the City, as may be appropriate
to assure the exclusion of interest
from gross income and the intended
tax status of the Tax-Exempt Bonds,
and (c) to give one or more appropriate certificates of the City, for
inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Tax-Exempt Bonds,
setting forth the reasonable expectations of the City regarding the
amount and use of all the proceeds
of the Tax-Exempt Bonds, the facts,
circumstances
and
estimates
on

June 11, 2003
which they are based, and other
facts and circumstances relevant to
the tax treatment of the interest on
and the tax status of the TaxExempt Bonds.
Each covenant made in this Section with respect to the Tax-Exempt
Bonds is also made with respect to
all issues any portion of the debt service on which is paid from proceeds
of the Tax-Exempt Bonds (and, if
different, the original issue and any
refunding issues in a series of
refundings), to the extent such compliance is necessary to assure exclusion of interest on the Tax-Exempt
Bonds from gross income for federal
income tax purposes, and the officers
identified above are authorized to
take actions with respect to those
issues as they are authorized in this
Section to take with respect to the
Tax-Exempt Bonds.

an application on the form provided
by the Director. This application
shall set forth and include the location, kinds and extent of the pavement desired to be taken up and the

actual size of the excavation in
accordance with the fee schedule
fixed by the Board of Control.
(c) In the event that a street
opening permit is not issued or is
revoked before an excavation has
been made, the entire fee shall be
refunded to the applicant, except for

by the Board of Control to cover the
city’s cost of processing the application.

(g) In an emergency, a person
may make an excavation or opening
or remove pavement in any highway, lane, road, street or alley of
they City, provided that the person

shall
accompany the application. Any person failing to notify the Director as
provided in this division (g) shall
be charged the regular permit fee
plus an additional fee of two hundred dollars ($200.00) to cover the
City’s administrative costs of identifying and inspecting the street
opening made without a permit. As

within the time designated in the
street opening permit, the permit
may be revoked by the Commissioner of Engineering and Construction.
(2) If the work has been started
but not completed within the time
designated in the street opening permit, the permit may be revoked by
the Commissioner of Engineering
and Construction. If the permit is
revoked, the Director may charge
all accrued restoration charges to
the permittee. Should the permittee
fail to pay all accrued restoration
charges within thirty (30) calendar
days of receipt of notice, the Director may draw, from the permittee’s
performance bond, funds sufficient
to restore the highway, lane, road,
street, or alley according to the
Director’s regulations.
(3) If a street opening permit is
revoked by the Commssioner of
Engineering and Construction, a
new permit must be secured before
any further work can proceed.
(i) A permittee, in accepting and
acting under a street opening permit, agrees to assume full responsibility for injury and damage to persons and property incurred because
of any settlement of a restored area,
and further agrees to pay all costs
involved
in
reconditioning
such
areas.
If
any
settlement
in
a
restored area occurs within a period
of one year from date of completion
of the permanent restoration, it

June 11, 2003

work authorized by the permit in
such manner as to cause a minimum
of interference with traffic. The permittee shall use a traffic control

Section 3. Terms of Temporary
Bonds. The Temporary Bonds shall
be dated the date of issuance or such
other date as is designated in the
Certificate of Award but not later
than October 30, 2003. The Temporary Bonds shall mature on a date
to be determined by the Director of
Finance in the Certificate of Award
in accordance with the Director of
Finance’s determination of the best
interest of and financial advantages
to the City, provided that such date
shall not be later than five years
from the date of issuance of the
Temporary Bonds. The Temporary
Bonds shall bear interest from their
date at the rate or rates per annum
set forth in the Certificate of Award,
or if any Temporary Bonds bear
interest at a variable rate, at the
rate determined pursuant to the
method set forth in the Certificate of
Award. Interest on the Temporary
Bonds shall be payable on the dates
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance in the Certificate of Award
and until the principal amount is
paid or payment is provided for. If
any Temporary Bonds bear interest
at a fixed rate or rates, those rates
shall not exceed eight percent (8%)
per year (computed on the basis of
a 360-day year consisting of twelve
30-day months) and interest shall be
payable not more often than every
six months and at maturity or at any
earlier redemption date. If any Temporary Bonds bear interest at a variable rate or rates, those rates shall
not exceed that set forth below, and
interest shall be payable not more
often than once a month and following purchase and at maturity or
at any earlier redemption date.
In the event that the Director of
Finance based on the written advice
of the Financial Advisor determines
that the City’s best interests will be
served by causing all or a portion of
the Temporary Bonds to be obligations bearing interest at variable
rates, redeemable by the City without penalty or premium on interest
adjustment dates, then the Director
of Finance is authorized to so specify in the Certificate of Award. If the
Director of Finance so determines,
then the Director of Finance shall
specify in the Certificate of Award
the method and procedure by which
the variable rate of interest to be
borne by the variable rate Temporary Bonds shall be determined,
whether by reference to a market
index, by a remarketing agent or
otherwise; provided that the variable
rate Temporary Bonds shall not bear
interest at a rate in excess of sixteen percent (16%) per annum; provided further that the maximum
interest rate for variable rate Temporary Bonds during any period
those Temporary Bonds are held by
a provider of a Credit Support Instrument because they could not be
remarketed shall be twenty-five percent (25%). Holders of variable rate
Temporary Bonds may be given the
right to tender their variable rate
Temporary Bonds for purchase by
the City at the times, on the terms,
and subject to the conditions set
forth in the Certificate of Award and
any tender agreement; provided that
tender rights shall be exercisable
only at such times as a Credit Support Instrument is in place that pro-

The City Record
vides for the payment of the purchase price payable to the tendering
holder of a variable rate Temporary
Bond. If the Director of Finance designates any Temporary Bonds as
variable rate Temporary Bonds, and
if the holders of the variable rate
Temporary Bonds are to be entitled
to tender the variable rate Temporary Bonds for purchase, then the
Director of Finance shall also designate in the Certificate of Award for
those variable rate Temporary Bonds
the provider or providers for any
Credit Support Instrument, the tender
agent or agents and the remarketing
agent or agents, which designations
shall be based on the determination
of the Director of Finance that the
parties so designated possess the requisite resources and experience to
provide the services required of them
and that the terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide such services are fair and commercially reasonable. The Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements in connection with the
delivery of the variable rate Temporary Bonds, and from time to time
thereafter so long as the variable
rate Temporary Bonds are outstanding with providers of Credit Support
Instruments, tender agents (which
may be the Registrar), remarketing
agents (which may be the Original
Purchaser), and others as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the method of
determining the variable interest
rates permitting holders the right of
tender, providing for liquidity or
credit support for the payment of the
variable rate Temporary Bonds upon
tender for purchase or redemption,
and providing for the repayment by
the City of any amounts drawn under
the Credit Support Instrument.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of
the Temporary Bonds, and regardless of the Temporary Bonds bearing interest at variable or fixed
rates, is authorized to contract for a
Credit Support Instrument and to
pay the costs of it from proceeds of
the Temporary Bonds, if the Director of Finance based on the written
advice of the Financial Advisor
determines that the Credit Support
Instrument will result in a savings
in the cost of this financing to the
City.
Section
4.
Payment
of
Debt
Charges on the Temporary Bonds.
The debt charges on the Temporary
Bonds shall be payable in lawful
money of the United States of America, or in Federal Reserve funds of
the United States of America as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance in the Certificate of Award,
and shall be payable, without deduction for the services of the Registrar as the City’s paying agent. If
agreed to by the Original Purchaser, the Temporary Bonds shall be
subject to redemption without penalty or premium at the option of the
City in whole or in part at any time
prior to maturity as provided in this
Ordinance and the Certificate of
Award.
If fewer than all of the Temporary Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Temporary Bonds of that maturity
to be redeemed, or portions thereof
in amounts of the minimum authorized denomination (as set forth in
Section 8 hereof) or any integral
multiple thereof, shall be made by
lot in a manner determined by the

1293

25
Registrar. In the case of a partial
redemption of Temporary Bonds by
lot
when
Temporary
Bonds
of
denominations greater than the minimum authorized denomination are
then outstanding, each unit of principal thereof in the amount of the
minimum authorized denomination
shall be treated as if it were a separate Temporary Bond of the denomination of the minimum authorized
denomination. If it is determined
that one or more, but not all, of the
units of principal amount in the
amount of the minimum authorized
denomination represented by a Temporary Bonds are to be called for
redemption, then, upon notice of
redemption of such unit or units, the
registered owner of that Temporary
Bond shall surrender the Temporary
Bond to the Registrar (i) for payment of the redemption price of such
unit or units of principal amount
called for redemption (including,
without
limitation,
the
interest
accrued
to
the
date
fixed
for
redemption), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner, of a new Temporary Bond or
Temporary Bonds of any authorized
denomination or denominations in
an
aggregate
principal
amount
equal to the unmatured and unredeemed portion of, and bearing
interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date as, the Temporary Bond surrendered.
The notice of the call for redemption of Temporary Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers, or other distinguishing marks,
the Temporary Bonds or portions
thereof to be redeemed, (ii) the
redemption price to be paid, (iii) the
date fixed for redemption, and (iv)
the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least 30
days prior to the date fixed for
redemption, to the registered owner
of each Temporary Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Register (as defined
in Section 5) maintained by the Registrar at the close of business on the
15th day preceding that mailing.
Failure to receive notice by mail or
any defect in that notice regarding
any Temporary Bond, however, shall
not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any
Temporary Bond.
In the event that notice of redemption shall have been given by the
Registrar to the registered owners
as provided above, there shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, moneys
that, in addition to any other moneys available therefor and held by
the Registrar, will be sufficient to
redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus accrued interest to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Temporary Bonds for
which notice of redemption has been
given. Notice having been mailed in
the manner provided in the preceding paragraph hereof, the Temporary Bonds and portions thereof
called for redemption shall become
due and payable on the redemption
date, and, upon presentation and surrender thereof at the place or places
specified in that notice, shall be paid
at the redemption price, plus accrued
interest to the redemption date. If
moneys for the redemption of all of
the Temporary Bonds and portions

26
thereof to be redeemed, together
with accrued interest thereon to the
redemption date, are held by the
Registrar on the redemption date, so
as to be available therefor on that
date and, if notice of redemption has
been deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from
and
after
the
redemption date those Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall cease to bear interest and
no longer shall be considered to be
outstanding. If those moneys shall
not be so available on the redemption date, or that notice shall not
have been deposited in the mail as
aforesaid, those Temporary Bonds
and portions thereof shall continue
to bear interest, until they are paid,
at the same rate as they would have
borne had they not been called for
redemption. All moneys held by the
Registrar for the redemption of particular Temporary Bonds shall be
held in trust for the account of the
registered owners thereof and shall
be paid to them, respectively, upon
presentation and surrender of those
Temporary Bonds.
Section 5. Registrar. The Director
of Finance shall designate a bank
or trust company to act as the
authenticating
agent,
registrar,
transfer agent and paying agent for
the Temporary Bonds after determining that the payment at that
bank or trust company will not
endanger the funds or securities of
the City and that proper procedures
and safeguards are available for
that purpose (the “Registrar”). The
Director of Finance shall sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, a registrar agreement or
agreements between the City and
the Registrar (the “Registrar Agreement”) substantially in the form
contained in file no. 1181-03-A, with
such changes as approved by the
Director of Law. In the event that a
trust agreement secures the Temporary Bonds, as provided in Section
10, the Registrar Agreement may be
incorporated in such trust agreement. The Director of Finance shall
provide for the payment of the services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant
to the Registrar Agreement from the
proceeds of the Temporary Bonds to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose.
The Temporary Bonds shall be
issued only as fully registered Temporary Bonds. Principal on the Temporary Bonds shall be payable when
due upon presentation and surrender
of the Temporary Bonds at the designated office of the Registrar designated in the Registrar Agreement.
Interest on each Temporary Bond
shall be paid on each interest payment date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Temporary Bond was registered,
and to that person’s address appearing on the Register (defined below
in this Section) at the close of business on the 15th day of the calendar month next preceding that interest payment date or such other date
established in the Certificate of
Award if variable rate Temporary
Bonds are issued. The City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange,
and transfer of Temporary Bonds as
provided in this Section (the “Register”) so long as any of the Temporary Bonds remain outstanding.
Subject to the provisions of this Sec-

The City Record
tion, the person in whose name a
Temporary Bond is registered on the
Register shall be regarded as the
absolute owner of that Temporary
Bond for all purposes of the Proceedings (except as may otherwise
be required with respect to the
City’s continuing disclosure agreement pursuant to the Rule). Payment of or on account of the debt
charges on any Temporary Bond
shall be made only to or upon the
order of that person; neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be
affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Temporary Bond, including interest,
to the extent of the amount or
amounts so paid.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
and so long as the Temporary Bonds
are issued in a book entry system,
principal of and interest on the Temporary Bonds shall be payable in
the manner provided in any agreement entered into by the Director of
Finance, in the name and on behalf
of the City, in connection with the
book entry system.
Section 6. Transfer and Exchange
of Certain Temporary Bonds. Temporary Bonds may be exchanged for
Temporary Bonds of any authorized
denomination upon presentation and
surrender at the office designated
by the Registrar, together with a
request for exchange signed by the
registered owner or by a person
legally empowered to do so in a
form satisfactory to the Registrar. A
Temporary Bond may be transferred
only on the Register, upon presentation and surrender of the Temporary Bond at the office designated
by the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner
or
by
a
person
legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer, the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate, and
deliver a new Temporary Bond or
Temporary Bonds, of any authorized
denomination or authorized denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Temporary Bond surrendered and bearing interest at the same rate and
maturing on the same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Temporary Bonds only
after the new Temporary Bonds are
signed by the authorized officers of
the City. In all cases of Temporary
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Temporary Bonds in accordance with the
provisions of the Proceedings. The
exchange or transfer shall be without charge to the owner, except that
the City and Registrar may make a
charge sufficient to reimburse them
for any tax or other governmental
charge required to be paid with
respect to the exchange or transfer.
The City or the Registrar may
require that those charges, if any,
be paid before the procedure is
begun for the exchange or transfer.
All Temporary Bonds issued and
authenticated upon any exchange or
transfer shall be valid special obligations of the City, evidencing the
same obligation, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under the
proceedings,
as
the
Temporary

1294

June 11, 2003
Bonds
surrendered
upon
that
exchange or transfer. Neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be
required to make any exchange or
transfer of a Temporary Bond during the period beginning at the
opening of business 15 days before
the day of the mailing of a notice
of redemption of Temporary Bonds
and ending at the close of business
on the day of such mailing or to
transfer or exchange any Temporary Bond selected for redemption in
whole or in part.
Section 7. Book Entry. Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this Ordinance, if it is determined
by the Director of Finance to be in
the best interest of and financially
advantageous to the City, the Temporary Bonds may be issued in book
entry form in accordance with the
provisions of this Section.
The Temporary Bonds may be
issued to a Depository for use in a
book entry system and, if and as
long as a book entry system is utilized, (i) the Temporary Bonds may
be issued in the form of a single,
fully registered Temporary Bond
representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered
owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository; (ii) the book
entry interest owners of Temporary
Bonds in book entry form shall have
no
right
to
receive
Temporary
Bonds in the form of physical securities or certificates; (iii) ownership
of book entry interests in book
entry form shall be shown by book
entry on the system maintained and
operated by the Depository and its
participants, and transfers of the
ownership of book entry interests
shall be made only by book entry
by the Depository and its Participants;
and
(iv)
the
Temporary
Bonds as such shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for
transfer to another Depository or to
another nominee of a Depository,
without further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Temporary Bonds for use in
a book entry system, the Director of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Director of Finance, after
making provision for notification of
the book entry interest owners by
the then Depository and any other
arrangements
deemed
necessary,
shall permit withdrawal of the Temporary Bonds from the Depository,
and authenticate and deliver certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance also is
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the Temporary Bonds, after determining
that the signing thereof will not
endanger the funds or securities of
the City and after the approval of
the form of any such agreement by
the Director of Law.
Section 8. Execution of Temporary
Bonds. Temporary Bonds shall be
signed by the Mayor and the Direc-

June 11, 2003
tor of Finance, in the name of the
City and in their official capacities,
provided that either or both of those
signatures may be a facsimile, and
shall bear the seal of the City or a
facsimile thereof; provided that no
Temporary Bond shall be valid or
obligatory for any purpose or shall
be entitled to any security or benefit under the Proceedings unless and
until the certificate of authentication printed on the Temporary Bond
is signed by the Registrar as
authenticating agent, and authentication by the Registrar shall be conclusive evidence that the Temporary
Bond so authenticated has been duly
issued, signed and delivered under
and is entitled to the security and
benefit of the Proceedings. The certificate of authentication may be
signed by any authorized officer or
employee of the Registrar or by any
other person acting as an agent of
the Registrar and approved by the
Director of Finance on behalf of the
City. The same person need not sign
the certificate of authentication on
all of the Temporary Bonds.
Pursuant to Section 83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
shall prepare the Temporary Bonds
and
shall
endorse
thereon
his
approval of the form and correctness
thereof by his manual or facsimile
signature. The Temporary Bonds
shall be issued in the denominations
as requested by the Original Purchaser and approved by the Director
of Finance, in conformity with this
Ordinance.
The
entire
principal
amount may be represented by a single bond certificate and may be
issued as fully registered securities
and in book entry or other uncertificated form if it is determined by
the
Director
of
Finance
that
issuance of fully registered securities in that form will facilitate the
sale and delivery of the Temporary
Bonds. The Temporary Bonds may
be issued in the authorized denominations of either (a) $100,000 each
or in any denomination that is the
sum of (i) $100,000 and (ii) $5,000 or
any integral multiple thereof, and
not exchangeable for other Temporary Bonds in denominations less
than $100,000, or (b) $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, as determined by the Director of Finance in
the Certificate of Award to be in the
best interest of the City. The Temporary Bonds shall not have coupons
attached, shall be numbered as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance and shall express upon
their faces the purpose, in summary
terms, for which they are issued and
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 9. Sale of Temporary
Bonds. The Temporary Bonds shall
be sold at not less than 97% of par
plus accrued interest at private sale
by the Director of Finance to the
Original Purchaser in accordance
with law and the provisions of this
Ordinance. If, in the reasonable
opinion of the Director of Finance,
an underwriter is incapable of fully
performing its duties or meeting its
obligations in its capacity as Original Purchaser with respect to the
Temporary Bonds, the Director of
Finance is hereby authorized and
directed, in the name of and on
behalf of the City, to take whatever action may be necessary to terminate that underwriter’s standing
as Original Purchaser. The Director
of Finance shall sign the Certificate
of Award referred to in this Ordinance, evidencing that sale to the

The City Record
Original Purchaser, cause the Temporary Bonds to be prepared, and
have the Temporary Bonds signed
and delivered, together with a true
transcript of proceedings with reference to the issuance of the Temporary Bonds if requested by the
Original Purchaser, to the Original
Purchaser upon payment of the purchase price. The Director of Finance
is authorized to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
a bond purchase agreement between
the City and the Original Purchaser, or representative thereof (the
“Purchase Agreement”), in substantially the form contained in the file
referenced above with such changes
therein not inconsistent with the
terms of this Ordinance and not substantially adverse to the City as
approved by the Director of Finance
and Director of Law, such approval
to be conclusively evidenced by the
execution of the Purchase Agreement by such officers. The Director
of Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and
for
reimbursement
of
expenses
incurred pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement from the proceeds of the
Temporary Bonds to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or as may be appropriated
for that purpose. The Mayor, the
Director of Finance, the Clerk of
Council, the Director of Law, and
other City officials, as appropriate,
are each authorized and directed to
sign
any
transcript
certificates,
financial statements and other documents and instruments and to take
such actions as are necessary or
appropriate
to
consummate
the
transactions contemplated by this
Ordinance.
Section 10. Security for the Temporary Bonds. The Temporary Bonds
shall be special obligations of the
City, and the debt charges on the
Temporary Bonds shall be payable
solely from the Revenues and the
Nontax Revenues. The Payment of
debt charges on the Temporary
Bonds is secured by a pledge of and
lien on (i) the Revenues and (ii) the
Nontax Revenues which are on
deposit in the Urban Renewal Debt
Retirement Fund created below. The
Temporary Bonds are not and shall
not be secured by an obligation or
pledge of any money raised by taxation. The Temporary Bonds do not
and shall not represent or constitute
a debt or pledge of the faith and
credit or taxing power of the City,
and the owners thereof have and
shall have no right to have taxes
levied by the City for the payment
of debt charges thereon. The Temporary Bonds shall contain a statement to that effect and to the effect
that
the
Temporary
Bonds
are
payable solely from the Revenues
and the Nontax Revenues and are
not secured by an obligation or
pledge of any money raised by taxation.
The City covenants and agrees
that while the Temporary Bonds are
outstanding, it will appropriate and
maintain Nontax Revenues at such
times and in such amounts as will
be sufficient, together with the Revenues and any other funds available
or to be available for the purpose
(including proceeds of refunding
obligations),
to
pay
the
debt
charges on the Temporary Bonds
and will so restrict other obligations
payable from Nontax Revenues prior
to or on a parity with the Temporary Bonds as will ensure the con-

1295

27
tinuing availability for appropriation of sufficient Nontax Revenues
to pay debt charges when due,
which Nontax Revenues are hereby
selected by the City pursuant to Section 725.05(C) 725.07 of the Revised
Code as moneys that are not raised
by taxation.
There is hereby created by the
City a separate fund or account designated as the “Urban Renewal Debt
Retirement Fund” (the “Debt Retirement Fund”) into which shall be
deposited (i) the Revenues upon
receipt, and (ii) other Nontax Revenues, and any other funds available for the purpose, on or prior to
the date debt charges on the Temporary Bonds are due, in an amount
sufficient to pay those debt charges.
Any Revenues remaining after payment or provision for payment, of
all debt charges on the Temporary
Bonds shall be deposited to the
extent not otherwise pledged or
encumbered in the Housing Trust
Fund (Fund No. 14 SF 027).
Nothing herein shall be construed
as requiring the City to use or apply
to the payment of debt charges on
the Temporary Bonds any funds or
revenues from any source other than
the Revenues and the Nontax Revenues.
Nothing
herein,
however,
shall be deemed to prohibit the City,
of its own volition, from using, to
the extent that it is authorized by
law to do so, any other resources for
the fulfillment of any of the terms,
conditions or obligations of this
Ordinance or of the Temporary
Bonds.
The City will, solely from the proceeds of the Temporary Bonds or
from the Revenues or the Nontax
Revenues, pay or cause to be paid
the debt charges on the Temporary
Bonds on the dates, at the places
and in the manner provided herein
and in the Temporary Bonds. For
that purpose, in each year while the
Temporary Bonds are outstanding,
this Council, after providing for the
payment of debt charges payable on
the City’s general obligation securities in that year from sources available for that purpose, will appropriate Nontax Revenues required to
pay, and for the purpose of paying
the debt charges due in that year on
the Temporary Bonds and any outstanding parity obligations payable
from Nontax Revenues. Further, this
Council will give effect to such
appropriations in all ordinances it
passes thereafter in that year appropriating money for expenditure and
encumbrance and limit the other
appropriations of Nontax Revenues
in that year to the amount available
after deducting the amount required
for the payment of debt charges
payable on the City’s general obligation securities and to pay those
debt charges. The City covenants
that, so long as any of the Temporary Bonds are outstanding, it shall
not issue any additional obligations
payable from the Nontax Revenues
on a parity with the Temporary
Bonds and any outstanding parity
obligations payable from Nontax
Revenues, unless, prior to passage
of the ordinance authorizing such
parity obligations, the Director of
Finance shall have certified to this
Council that the Nontax Revenues
during the preceding calendar year,
adjusted to reflect, if necessary,
changes in the rates or charges
resulting in the Nontax Revenues,
aggregate in amount not less than
100% of the highest amount of (a)
debt charges on the Temporary
Bonds to be paid from Nontax Rev-

28
enues and (b) required payments on
such proposed parity obligations
and any outstanding parity obligations due in any succeeding calendar year.
Each
obligation
of
the
City
required to be undertaken pursuant
to this Ordinance and the Temporary Bonds is binding upon the City,
and upon each officer or employee
of the City as may from time to time
have the authority under law to
take any action on behalf of the
City as may be necessary to perform
all or any part of such obligation as
a duty of the City and of each of
those officers and employees resulting from an office, trust or station
within
the
meaning
of
Section
2731.01 of the Revised Code, providing for enforcement by writ of mandamus.
In the event that the interest on
the Temporary Bonds is to be provided for from Temporary Bond proceeds, or if in the judgment of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of the Financial
Advisor, a debt service reserve to
secure the Temporary Bonds is in
the best interest of and financially
advantageous to the City, the City
shall enter into a trust agreement
with the bank or trust company
serving as Registrar for the Temporary Bonds and providing for the
Debt Retirement Fund or a debt service reserve fund, as applicable, to
be held by that bank or trust company, in its capacity as trustee, and
such fund or funds are hereby
authorized. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, the trust
agreement in a form consistent with
this Ordinance and approved by the
Director of Law. The Mayor and the
Director of Finance and other City
officials, as appropriate, are authorized to take such actions as are
necessary or appropriate to consummate such additional security for
the Temporary Bonds. The City
hereby covenants and agrees to
appropriate annually from the Revenues and the Nontax Revenues into
any such funds amounts sufficient
to maintain the balances required
by the trust agreement and to
restore any deficiency therein.
Section 11. Deposit of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Temporary Bonds are appropriated
and shall be used for the purpose
for which the Temporary Bonds are
being issued. The proceeds from the
sale of the Temporary Bonds (exclusive of amounts to be used to pay
Financing Costs which shall be
deposited in a separate Costs of
Issuance Account) shall be deposited in the Debt Retirement Fund to
be used to refund the Prior Bonds
Series 2002 and, if applicable, to pay
interest on the Temporary Bonds;
provided that any portion of the proceeds of the Temporary Bonds to be
used to make a required deposit to
a debt service reserve fund shall be
paid into the debt service reserve
fund created pursuant to Section 10.
Any premium not used to pay costs
of issuance and accrued interest
received from the sale of the Temporary Bonds shall be deposited in
the Debt Retirement Fund.
Section 12. Disclosure. If, in the
judgment of the Director of Finance,
after consultation with the Financial Advisor and the Original Purchaser, an official statement or
other disclosure document is appropriate relating to the initial offering

The City Record
of the Temporary Bonds, the Director of Finance, on behalf of the City
and in that officer’s official capacity, is authorized to (i) cooperate
with the Original Purchaser in the
preparation of, and the making of
modifications,
completions
or
changes of or supplements to, such
a disclosure document, (ii) determine, and to certify or otherwise
represent, when the disclosure document is to be deemed final or is
final, (iii) authorize the use and distribution of that disclosure document and any supplements thereto
in connection with the initial offering of the Temporary Bonds, (iv)
notwithstanding the requirements
of, and as an exception to, Codified
Ordinance 177.01(a), contract with a
printer to print the Official Statement, and (v) sign certificates,
statements or other documents in
connection with the finality, accuracy, and completeness of that disclosure document.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Temporary Bonds, the City
agrees, as the only obligated person
with
respect
to
the
Temporary
Bonds under the Rule, to provide or
cause to be provided such financial
information
and
operating
data,
audited financial statements and
notices, in such manner as may be
required for purposes of paragraph
(b)(5)(i) of the Rule. In order to
describe and specify certain terms
of the City’s continuing disclosure
agreement for that purpose and
thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment, and termination, the Director of Finance is
authorized and directed to sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, and if required under
the Rule, a Continuing Disclosure
Certificate or Certificates in conformance
with
the
reporting
requirements of the Rule. The agreement formed collectively, by this
paragraph and that Certificate, shall
be the City’s continuing disclosure
agreement for purposes of the Rule,
and its performance shall be subject
to the annual appropriation of any
funds that may be necessary to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of the
occurrence of any other events, the
Director of Finance shall consult
with, as appropriate, the legal counsel and bond or other qualified independent special counsel to the City.
The Director of Finance, acting in
the name and on behalf of the City,
shall be entitled to rely upon any
legal advice provided by any such
counsel in determining whether a
filing should be made.
Section 13. Ratings, Insurance,
and Other Credit Enhancement. If,
in the judgment of the Director of
Finance after consultation with the
Financial Advisor, the filing of an
application for a rating on the Temporary Bonds by one or more nationally recognized rating agencies or a
Credit Support Instrument is in the
best interest of, and financially
advantageous to the City, the Director of Finance is authorized to prepare and submit those applications,
to provide to each such agency, com-

1296

June 11, 2003
pany or credit provider such information as may be required for the
purpose. The cost of obtaining each
rating and Credit Support Instrument, except to the extent paid by
the Original Purchaser in accordance with the Purchase Agreement,
shall be paid from the proceeds of
the Temporary Bonds.
Section 14. Interest Rate Swaps,
Hedges and Caps. For the purpose
of achieving the optimal available
debt structure for the Temporary
Bonds, the Director of Finance may,
based on the written advice of the
Financial Advisor, enter into one or
more agreements in connection with
or subsequent to the issuance of the
Temporary Bonds for an interest
rate swap, an interest rate cap or
other such arrangement to lower the
effective interest rate on the obligation to the City or, to hedge the
exposure of the City against fluctuations in prevailing interest rates,
provided, however, that: (i) the debt
structure that is simulated through
the combination of the Temporary
Bonds with any such agreements
shall comply with the restrictions of
this Ordinance on the terms of and
security for the Temporary Bonds
applied to that structure as though
it consisted solely of Temporary
Bonds; (ii) the counterparty to any
swap agreement and the provider of
any interest rate cap shall have a
rating of at least “A” by either
Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard & Poor’s Corporation; (iii)
no such agreement shall purport to
entitle
the
counterparty
to
the
agreement to payment by the City
from any source other than the
sources which secure the Temporary
Bonds as described in this Ordinance; and (iv) the cost of obtaining any such interest rate cap or
other such arrangement shall have
been determined by the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of the Financial Advisor, to
be justified by the corresponding
benefit to the City and to be commercially reasonably based on then
current
market
conditions.
The
notional amount on which any such
agreement is based shall not be subject to the limitations set forth herein
on
the
maximum
principal
amount of the Temporary Bonds.
Section 15. Covenants. In the event
that
the
Temporary
Bonds
are
issued and sold as obligations bearing interest that is excluded from
gross income for federal income tax
purposes, the covenants in this Section 15 shall govern. However, if the
Temporary Bonds are issued and
sold as obligations bearing interest
that is included in gross income for
federal income tax purposes, the
City shall not be bound by the
covenants
of
this
Section
with
respect to the Temporary Bonds.
Subject to the foregoing, the City
covenants that it will use and will
restrict the use and investment of,
the proceeds of the Temporary
Bonds in such manner and to such
extent as may be necessary so that
(a) the Temporary Bonds will not
(i) constitute private activity bonds,
arbitrage bonds or hedge bonds
under Sections 141, 148 or 149 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”) or (ii) be
treated other than as bonds to which
Section 103(a) of the Code applies,
and (b) the interest on the Temporary Bonds will not be treated as an
item of tax preference under Section
57 of the Code. The City further
covenants that (a) it will take or

June 11, 2003
cause to be taken such actions that
may be required of it for the interest on the Temporary Bonds to be
and remain excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will not take or authorize to be taken any actions that
would adversely affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting
for it, will, among other acts of compliance, (i) apply the proceeds of
the Temporary Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing,
(ii) restrict the yield on investment
property, (iii) make timely and adequate payments to the federal government, (iv) maintain books and
records and make calculations and
reports, and (v) refrain from certain
uses of those proceeds, and, as
applicable,
of
property
financed
with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the extent necessary to
assure such exclusion of that interest under the Code.
The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer of
the City having responsibility for
issuance of the Temporary Bonds is
hereby authorized (a) to make or
effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or
waiver on behalf of the City with
respect to the Temporary Bonds as
the City is permitted to or required
to make or give under the federal
income tax laws, including, without
limitation thereto, any of the elections
provided
for
in
Section
148(f)(4)(C) of the Code or available under Section 148 of the Code,
for the purpose of assuring, enhancing or protecting the favorable tax
treatment or status of the Temporary Bonds or interest thereon or
assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose, reducing the
burden or expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or
payments or penalties, or making
payments of special amounts in lieu
of making computations to determine, or paying excess earnings as
rebate, or obviating those amounts
or payments, as determined by that
officer, which action shall be in
writing and signed by the officer,
(b) to take any and all other
actions, make or obtain calculations,
make payments, and make or give
reports, covenants and certifications
of and on behalf of the City, as may
be appropriate to assure the exclusion of interest from gross income
and the intended tax status of the
Temporary Bonds, and (c) to give
one or more appropriate certificates
of the City, for inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Temporary Bonds, setting forth the reasonable expectations of the City
regarding the amount and use of all
the proceeds of the Temporary
Bonds, the facts, circumstances and
estimates on which they are based
and other facts and circumstances
relevant to the tax treatment of the
interest on and the tax status of the
Temporary Bonds.

Sections, subsections, paragraphs,
subparagraphs, or clauses hereof.
Reference to a Section means a section of this Ordinance unless otherwise indicated.
Section 17. Interpretation. Any provisions of the Codified Ordinances of
the City which are inconsistent with

The City Record
the provisions of this Ordinance shall
not apply to the Temporary Bonds
authorized herein. Nothing in this
Ordinance is intended to, and no provision hereof shall be applied in any

Bonds,

indentures,
trust
agreements,
or
other agreements or contracts made
or entered into by the City.

all acts and conditions necessary to
be done or performed by the City or
to have been met precedent to and
in the issuing of the Temporary
Bonds in order to make them legal,
valid, and binding special obligations of the City have been performed and have been met, or will
at the time of deliver of the Temporary Bonds have been performed
and have been met, in regular and
due form as required by law, and
that no limitation of indebtedness or
taxation, either statutory or constitutional,
is
applicable
to
the

FIRST READING ORDINANCE
READ IN FULL AND PASSED
Ord. No. 2031-A-02 (as a Substitute
for Ordinance No. 2031-02).
By Council Members Lewis, Sweeney, Polensek, Jackson, Brady and
O’Malley.
An ordinance to supplement the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, by enacting new Chapter
188 relating to employment of City
residents for certain public improvement contracts.

The City Record

54
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland believes strongly in
employment opportunities for Cleveland residents; and
Whereas, there are Cleveland residents who possess the skills and
training required for work on construction projects; and
Whereas, despite, the expenditure
of millions of dollars in the City of
Cleveland on projects recently completed or currently under construction, few of the employment opportunities arising from those projects
have gone to Cleveland residents;
and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has a higher unemployment rate
and higher poverty rate than Cuyahoga County and many surrounding
communities; and
Whereas, the employment of City
residents on construction projects
funded, in part or in whole, with
City assistance will help alleviate
unemployment and poverty in the
City; and
Whereas, Council Member Fannie
M. Lewis serves as Chairperson of
the Employment, Affirmative Action, and Training Committee and
has conducted hearings on this matter for over one year; and
Whereas, it is appropriate to
honor Council Member Lewis’ service and dedication by naming the
Cleveland
Resident
Employment
Law the “Fannie M. Lewis Cleveland
Resident Employment Law”; now,
therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That, notwithstanding
and as an exception to any provision of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, to the contrary, the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are hereby
supplemented

all Construction Contracts shall contain a provision that requires that
Residents of the City perform twenty percent (20%) of the total Construction Worker Hours (“Resident
Construction Worker Hours”) and
shall contain a provision detailing
the penalties for failure to do so,

1322

June 11, 2003
which penalties are set forth in Section 188.05. Additionally, where not
otherwise
prohibited
by
federal,
state or local law or the terms of

Worker
Hours are performed by persons
who qualify as Low Income Persons.

Trade Workers at the time that
work on a Construction Contract

(“UCIP-ASAP”) who are working for
the

(b) The percentage levels set
forth in Section 188.02(a) are intended as minimum requirements for use
of Residents of the City of Cleveland under Construction Contracts
and shall not be construed as limiting or deferring the full use of Residents of the City beyond this
numerical level.
(c) Prior to the commencement of
work, each Contractor and Subcontractor(s) shall complete and submit
to the Director a work force table.
This document shall identify the
estimated work force requirements
for the duration of the job, broken
down by trade and month. This document shall be revised as required,
but not less than once a month.
Section 188.03 Standards, Reductions and No Waiver
(a) The Director, consistent with
the provisions of this Chapter, shall
establish standards and procedures,
as the Director deems proper and
necessary, to effectively administer
the intent and purpose of this Chapter. In creating these standards and
procedures and in creating any subsequent modifications thereof, the
Director shall work with the Chairperson of the Employment, Affirmative Action and Training Committee.
The standards and exceptions shall
be effective thirty (30) days after
publication in the City Record.
However, at least ten (10) days
prior to publication in the City
Record, the Director shall provide
the President of City Council and
the Chairperson of the Employment,
Affirmative Action and Training
Committee with a copy of the proposed standards and procedures.
(b) Such standards and procedures shall specify that the employment of the minimum percentage of
Residents may be reduced prior to

June 11, 2003
or during construction only when a
Contractor or potential Contractor
can demonstrate the high impracticality of complying with this percentage level for particular contracts or classes of employees. The
Director shall apply the standard of
“efforts to the greatest extent feasible” to the Contractor’s or Subcontractor’s efforts when evaluating
requests for reduction. A reduction
may be deemed appropriate by the
Director if a Contractor or potential
Contractor
has
unsuccessfully
solicited a sufficient number of Residents of the City to perform the
work identified in the bid specifications and has documented such
effort to the satisfaction of the
Director. In addition, such standards
and procedures shall require that a
Contractor or potential Contractor
seeking a reduction shall have provided timely notice of the need for
Residents of the City to an appropriate source(s) of referrals, as
determined by the Director, which
source(s) shall be entitled to comment on any reduction application.
If the Director determines that a
lesser percentage of Residents is
appropriate with respect to a potential Construction Contract for which
bids will be solicited, bid specifications shall include a statement of
the revised standards. The standards established by the Director
shall also provide for a reduction
during construction based on petition by the Contractor demonstrating
serious
unforeseen
circumstances, such as new governmental
regulations, national or natural disasters, war and/or other disastrous
events or high impracticality.
(c) The Director shall file his
determination on all reductions, and
the reasons for the reduction, with
the Clerk of City Council, the President of City Council, and the Chairperson of the Employment Affirmative Action and Training Committee,
within five (5) working days of
making a determination.
(d) The Director shall not waive
the Resident Construction Worker
Hours of this chapter.
Section 188.04 Monitoring by Director: Reporting by Contractor, and
Advisory Committee to the Director
(a) The Director shall separately
monitor the use of Residents of the
City on all applicable projects in
Skilled and Unskilled Construction
Trade Worker positions, and shall
report his findings in writing to the
Clerk of City Council, the President
of City Council, and to the Employment Affirmative Action and Training Committee of this Council on a
bi-monthly basis.
(b) The Contractor shall provide
for the maintenance of all records
documenting that Residents of the
City are employed in pursuance of
the Construction Contract. The Contractor and Subcontractor(s) shall
maintain copies of personnel documents supportive of every Resident
employee’s actual record of residence.
(c) The Contractor shall designate
a principal officer of its firm to be
responsible for administering the
Resident requirements for the Contractor and all of its Subcontractor(s) pursuant to the requirements

The City Record
detailed in this Chapter. This officer shall meet regularly, or as may
be required, with the Director or his
designee to ensure compliance with
the Resident requirements set forth
herein. Primary responsibility for
meeting
established
goals
shall
remain with the Contractor. Certified payroll reports (U.S. Department of Labor form WH-347 or
equivalent) in a format specified by
the Director shall be submitted
monthly to the Director for applicable construction contracts and shall
identify clearly the actual residence
of every employee on each submitted certified payroll. The first time
an employee’s name appears on a
payroll, a hire date for the employee should be included after the
employee’s name.
(d) Full access to the Contractor(s’) and Subcontractor(s’) employment
records
that
document
information that relates to the requirements of this Chapter shall be
granted to the Director, his designated agents, the Chief of Police, or
any duly authorized representative
thereof. The Contractor and Subcontractor(s) shall maintain all relevant personnel data in records for a
period of at least three (3) years
after final completion of work. This
retention period may be extended in
writing by the Director based upon
audit irregularities.
(e) The Director may require affidavits and other supporting documentation from the Contractor and/or
Subcontractor(s) to verify or clarify
that an employee is a Resident when
doubt or lack of clarity has arisen.
(f) There shall be established a
Residency
Construction
Advisory
Committee to the Director with the
charge of furthering the intent and
purpose of this Chapter. Membership
shall consist of one representative
appointed by the Mayor, one representative appointed by the President
of City Council, one representative
appointed by the Executive Director
of the Cleveland Building and Construction Trade Council, one representative appointed by the Executive Director of the Construction
Employers Association or its delegate and one representative jointly
appointed by the Mayor and the
President of City Council who is not
affiliated with Cleveland Building
and Construction Trade Council or
the Construction Employers Association or its delegate. This Committee may establish one (1) or more
advisory
subcommittees
to
help
achieve the goals established pursuant to this legislation.
Section 188.05 Violation and Penalty
(a) When work under a Construction Contract is completed, and in the
event that the Director determines
that the Contractor has failed to fulfill the requirements contained in
Section 188.02 concerning Construction Worker Hours performed by Residents of the City or has failed to submit reports as required in Sections
188.02 and 188.04, the City is deemed
to have been damaged. Good faith
efforts on the part of the Contractor
or Subcontractor to provide employment to Residents of the City shall

An emergency resolution acknowledging “Matricula Consular” as personal
identification
for
Mexican
nationals living in Cleveland, and
urging Mayor Campbell’s administration and local financial institutions to do the same.
Whereas, the government of Mexico issues to its nationals living
abroad a form of Consular identification known as “Matricula Consular”; and
Whereas, the Matricula Consular
is a personal identification which is
valid for five years; and
Whereas, the Mexican Consulate
issues the Matricula Consular as a
form of personal identification in
about 46 cities across the country to
Mexican nationals residing in the
United States for a least six months
who submit a birth certificate, proper photo identification and fingerprints; and
Whereas, the acceptance of Consular I.D. cards as legal identification in Cleveland will provide Mexican nationals living in our city the
assurance that they need not pay

1325

57
exorbitant fees for sending money
home to their relatives, or fear to call
the police and report a crime; and
Whereas,
financial
institutions
across the Midwest have agreed to
accept the Matricula Consular as a
form of identification; and
Whereas, because of the large
Hispanic population in and around
Cleveland, the City Council deems it
in the public interest to permit the
Matricula Consular to be used as a
form of identification in dealings
between the public and City government and between the public and
local financial institutions; and
Whereas, this first formal understanding between the City and the
government of Mexico is only the
beginning of ongoing dialogue for
mutual economic interests; and

immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

Whereas, the Federal Communications Commission is charged with
regulating interstate and international
communications

Whereas, the Federal Communications Commission is expected to
approve new rules governing media
ownership, consolidation, and control of the nation’s newspapers and
radio and television stations; and
Whereas, it has been reported that
these new rules will allow media
companies to own more TV stations
in local markets, will eliminate the
rule prohibiting a daily newspaper
owner from owning a radio or TV
station, and will allow TV broadcasters to own two stations in certain markets; and
Whereas, the current ownership
limits were established to keep any
one company from controlling too
much of the information disseminated over public airways; and

would limit diversity in media ownership, including local and community based ownership and minority
based ownership; and

would diminish the quantity and
quality of local news and entertainment; and

ownership and control over cultural,
