Whereas, in light of the events of
September 11, 2001 and the potential

times, because of similar emergency

environmental health, nursing, and
other public health services readily

Whereas, Section 5502.29 of the Revised Code permits political subdivisions, in collaboration with other
public and private agencies within
the state, to develop mutual aid

adopted under Section 5502.25 of the
Revised Code, for reciprocal emergency management aid and assistance in case of any hazard too great
to be dealt with unassisted; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of

Public Health’s ability to provide
the proper level of services to its
own constituency. In addition, no
funds shall be paid to reciprocating
political subdivisions of the State
for the performance of mutual aid
services by them to the City, and
each participating political subdivision shall hold the City immune
from liability for any mutual aid
rendered under the agreement or
agreements. The Director of Law

with the City’s interests.

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 1943-03.
By Council Member Conwell.
An emergency resolution designating October 6th through October
10th, 2003 as “Disability Awareness
Week”.
Whereas, October is National Disability Awareness Month; and
Whereas, Murtis H. Taylor Center
of Cleveland is working with chairs
Mayor Jane Campbell, Council member Kevin Conwell, and Commissioner Peter Lawson Jones to organize the City of Cleveland’s second
annual “Disability Awareness Week”
to be held from October 6th through
October 10th of this year; and
Whereas, the purpose of this event
is to sensitize and educate the community about people with disabilities, to link caregivers and disabled
persons with community resources,
to promote awareness of children
and adults with special needs; to
foster respect and empathy throughout the community for those living
with special needs and to acknowledge community leaders who have
overcome challenging life circumstances to make our community a
better place; and
Whereas, the events will include
three
community
education
and
awareness forums, a youth education art contest and a youth education essay contest; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby designates October 6th through
10th, 2003 as “Disability Awareness
Week” in the City of Cleveland.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted October 6, 2003.
Effective October 8, 2003.

Res. No. 1944-03.
By Council Member Reed.
An emergency resolution expressing this Council’s commitment to
working with the Administration to
balance the budget; encouraging the
Administration to consider what is
morally correct and in the best
interests of the citizens of Cleveland
when considering settlement agreements; and requesting that the
Administration provide Council with
notice of any and all settlement
agreements before execution of such
agreements.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland is
encountering lower than expected
tax revenues; and

Whereas, the Finance Director is
projecting a $3.2 million dollar budget deficit this year; and
Whereas, the Finance Department
is projecting a $50 million dollar
budget deficit next year; and
Whereas, while budget considerations are important in considering
and negotiating settlement agreements, the Administration should
also consider what is morally correct and in the best interests of the
citizens; and
Whereas, such consideration requires the Administration to review
and evaluate the effect a proposed
settlement agreement may have on
the neighborhoods of the City and
the citizens who live in the neighborhoods; and
Whereas, such consideration requires the Administration to carefully review the factual circumstances of each case to determine if
settlement is an appropriate option
and furthers the City’s obligation to
provide efficient services to the citizens of the City; and
Whereas, the Administration recently decided to reinstate two
employees with back pay; and
Whereas, the back pay to be provided to each employee is more
than
$360,000
for
at
total
of
$720,000; and
Whereas, this reinstatement occurred after the Administration’s
decision to withdraw an appeal of
an arbitrator’s decision ordering
reinstatement of the employees; and
Whereas, this Council is concerned about this decision, and any
future settlement decisions, as these
decisions affect the City’s budget;
and
Whereas, this Council is concerned about any similar settlements being negotiated or under
consideration by the Administration;
and
Whereas, this Council and the
Administration must work together
to balance the budget and address
budget deficit issues; and
Whereas, in order to do so, it
would be appropriate for this Council to receive notice of proposed settlement agreements; and
Whereas, this Council is concerned
that further settlement of cases,
including labor cases involving termination for residency violations,
will only enhance the City’s current
financial difficulties and increase
the likelihood of layoffs; and
Whereas, this Council, for the reasons stated in this resolution, finds
it necessary to request that the
Administration
carefully
consider
the appropriateness of settling current litigation and requests that the
Administration provide Council with
notice of proposed settlement agreements; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council expresses its commitment to working
with the Administration to balance
the budget in a manner that is beneficial to the citizens and taxpayers
of the City of Cleveland.

2378

October 15, 2003

correct and in the best interests of
the citizens and taxpayers of the
City.
Section 3. That this Council hereby requests that the Administration provide Council with notice of
any and all settlement agreements
before execution of such agreements.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted October 6, 2003.
Effective October 16, 2003, without
the signature of the Mayor.
