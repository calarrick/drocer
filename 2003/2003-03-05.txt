FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS REFERRED
Res. No. 321-03.
By Council Members Conwell, Pierce
Scott, Westbrook, White, and Zone.
An emergency resolution opposing
the proposed state budget cuts that
adversely affect those with the least
left to lose — the poor, disabled,
unemployed, homeless, and hospitalized.
Whereas, Governor Taft has proposed cuts to the state budget that
would have gravely adverse affects
on those Ohioans who can least
afford it; and
Whereas, the governor’s proposed
budget relies on $468 million in
state cuts to Medicaid, which would
cost the program $1.1 billion overall
for two years, including lost federal matching funds; and
Whereas, the cuts include $47 million from freezing reimbursements
to hospitals, doctors and others who
treat Medicaid patients and $46 million from eliminating dental, vision,
chiropractic, podiatric and psychological services now covered under
Medicaid; and
Whereas, the governor’s proposed
budget also proposes cutting up to
$10.2 million in emergency and transitional housing for the homeless;
and
Whereas, the governor’s proposed
budget also proposes cutting up to
$61 million to a program for those
who are out of work due to physical and mental impairments; and
Whereas, the governor’s proposed
budget further proposes cutting up
to $259 million in state child-care
subsidies, mostly to single mothers;
and
Whereas, these cuts adversely
affect those who are already struggling to keep jobs, homes, or who
have mental illness or physical ailments; and
Whereas, the governor’s proposed
budget cuts mean that Medicaid will
no longer pay for the root canal of
a mother of four who cannot work
due to a disability; and
Whereas, the governor’s proposed
budget cuts mean that someone in a
state sponsored drug treatment program for low-income and unemployed people with a physical or
mental disability will not receive a
monthly $115 check to pay for participation in the program and other
necessities; and
Whereas, the governor’s proposed
budget cuts mean that a mother of
three working for a non-profit organization will no longer receive
vouchers to help send her three children to day care; and
Whereas, the governor’s proposed
budget cuts mean that homeless
shelters would have to compete with
other housing programs for state
money, thereby calling into question
the continued existence of some
emergency and transitional housing
for the homeless; and
Whereas, the governor’s proposed
budget cuts mean that hospitals
across the state would not be reimbursed the full Medicaid rates,
which costs at University Hospitals
will outpace the state reimbursements by $4.8 million this year
alone; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

The City Record
Section 1. That this Council hereby opposes the proposed state budget cuts that adversely affect those
with the least left to lose — the
poor, disabled, unemployed, homeless, and hospitalized.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby directed to transmit certified

Bob Taft and to the appropriate

it shall take effect and be in force

An emergency resolution encouraging the State of Ohio to enact legislation
requiring
all
companies
doing business with the State of
Ohio to disclose any and all records
of any investments or profits of
insurance policies issued by insurers
or any predecessor corporation during the slave era.
Whereas, recent investigations by
governmental and private entities
have suggested that many early
American industries substantially
profited from the commerce generated by the uncompensated labor of
enslaved Americans; and
Whereas, such industries include
the insurance industry, the financial
industry, the textile industry, the
tobacco industry, the railroad industry, the shipping industry, the rice
industry, and the sugar industry; and
Whereas, insurance policies from
the slavery era have recently been
discovered in the archives of several insurance companies; and
Whereas, such insurance policies
document insurance coverage to
slaveholders for bodily injury or
death of their slaves and these policies were issued by predecessor
insurance companies; and
Whereas, these insurance documents provide evidence of ill-gotten
profits from slavery and these illgotten profits in part capitalized
businesses whose successors remain
in existence today; and
Whereas, this Council encourages
the State of Ohio to enact legislation requiring all companies doing
business with the State of Ohio to
disclose any and all records of any
investments or profits of insurance
policies issued by insurers or any
predecessor corporation during the
slave era to the Ohio Department of
Insurance or another proper State of
Ohio agency; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby encourages the State of Ohio to
enact legislation requiring all companies doing business with the State
of Ohio to disclose any and all

462

March 5, 2003
records of any investments or profits of insurance policies issued by
insurers or any predecessor corporation during the slave era to the
Ohio Department of Insurance or
another proper State of Ohio agency.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Ohio Governor Bob Taft, all members of the
Ohio Senate and Ohio House of Representatives representing the City of
Cleveland and the Director of the
Ohio Department of Insurance.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

RENT ADJUSTMENT
Any rental rate stated in Schedules I – IV above may be adjusted
by the Director of Parks, Recreation
and Properties, (“The Director”,)
based upon the determination of the
Commissioner for a particular event
upon compliance with all of the following requirements:
(a) Adjustment Limits. No rental
rate may be increased or decreased
by a percentage greater than sixty
percent (60%) of the rental rate
stated in the applicable Schedule.
(b) Standards for Rent Increases
or Decreases. In adopting this Rent
Schedule Resolution, the Board of
Control understands that a proposed
Convention Center event will provide
direct and indirect benefits to the
City of Cleveland in addition to the
rent collected for use of the facility.
These
benefits
include
revenues
from food and beverage concessions,
revenues from the transient occupancy tax assessed pursuant to
Chapter 193 of the C.O., revenues
from novelty sales, and revenues
from event services provided by City
of Cleveland staff and outside contractors
(collectively,
“Additional
Benefits”). The rates set forth in
Schedule I – IV above assume the
event will generate an average level
of Additional Benefits. However, if
the Commissioner determines, and
the Director concurs, that an event
will generate Additional Benefits
substantially less than or substantially greater than the Additional
Benefits generated by an average
Convention Center event, the Director may adjust the event rental rate
accordingly. For example, if by
reducing the rental rate the Director
is able to attract an event which
would yield substantial Additional
Benefits the Director may reduce the
rental rate within the range set
forth in paragraph (a) above. By
contrast, if a proposed event will
yield minimal Additional Benefits,
the Director may increase the rental
rate within range set forth in paragraph (a) above.
(c) Required Approvals for Rental
Increases or Decreases. Rent adjustments shall require the additional
approval of the Director of Law or
his/her designee. These additional
approvals may be evidenced by
these
parties’
execution
and/or
approval of the event contract, as
applicable, provided that a brief justification for the adjustments is set
forth in an “Additional Provisions”
section completed by the Commissioner at the end of the contract
immediately above these parties’
signature lines.
(d) Rent Adjustment Recordkeeping. The Commissioner shall keep
detailed records of all rent adjustments. The Commissioner shall submit to the Office of the Mayor, the
Director of Parks, Recreation and
Properties, and the Director of Law,
a written report summarizing all
rent adjustments made during that

The City Record
calendar year, on or before January
15 of the following year.
Be it further resolved that Resolution No. 356-96, adopted by the Board
of Control on May 29, 1996, is hereby
rescinded as of the effective date of
the rental rates set forth herein.
Be it further resolved that not
withstanding any provisions of this
or any prior Board of Control resolution, the rental rates, terms and
conditions set forth in this resolution shall apply only to concession,
agreements executed and event rate
quotations made in writing on or
after the adoption date of this resolution, without regard to the effective date of rental rates, terms and
conditions herein.

will be occupied by low income
elderly families with no market rate
units; and

Res. No. 258-03.
By Council Members Coats and
Jones.
An emergency resolution strongly
urging the President of the United
States to provide additional funding
assistance to urban cities throughout the country to ease their fiscal
burden of providing homeland security.
Whereas, a terrorist attack in any
of the major urban population centers could cause catastrophic damage to urban infrastructure, buildings and people; and
Whereas, a terrorist attack could
cause serious disruptions to the
United States economy as was experienced after the September 11, 2001
attacks on the World Trade Center
Towers; and
Whereas, in response to the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001 the federal government has instituted a homeland
security program to safeguard this
country against further acts of terrorism; and
Whereas, the homeland security
initiatives of the United States federal government have placed an
increased emphasis on protecting
the health and safety of the general public by urban cities throughout
the country; and
Whereas, urban cities throughout
the country are preparing themselves for homeland security measures by mobilizing safety force personnel to monitor and safeguard
public buildings, infrastructure and
various institutions from possible
terrorist attacks; and
Whereas, many urban cities are
facing severe fiscal stress, which is
forcing many of them to reduce services to the public due to lack of
funds; and
Whereas,
urban
communities
across the country must incur additional expenses because of the additional deployment of police, fire and
emergency medical services personnel for the effective implementation
of homeland security measures; and
Whereas, many urban cities need
additional funding from the federal
government to help ease the fiscal
burden of providing homeland security to the general public; and
Whereas, funding assistance from
the federal government will help
cities to effectively provide homeland security measures to prevent a
possible terrorist attack; and,
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council strongly urges the President of the United
States to provide additional funding
to major urban cities across the country in order to ease the fiscal burden
of providing homeland security.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
certified copy of this resolution to the
President of the United States and the
Ohio Congressional delegation.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall be in force immediately
upon its adoption and approval by
the Mayor; otherwise it shall take
effect and be in force from and after
the earliest period allowed by law.

An emergency resolution strongly
urging the Governor of Ohio, the
Ohio State Legislature, and the Ohio
Attorney General to work together
to establish and implement a constitutional school funding system.
Whereas, in the last eleven years,
the Ohio Supreme Court has ruled
three times that State of Ohio’s
school funding system is unconstitutional; and
Whereas, the Court found that the
current system favors wealthy districts over poor districts; and
Whereas, the current funding system of public education in Ohio
results in an uneven “playing field”
of rich school districts versus very
poor school districts; and
Whereas, the Ohio Supreme Court
has ordered state lawmakers to find
an efficient way to pay for the public school education of Ohio’s 1.8 million children; and,
Whereas, the State of Ohio needs
to act immediately on this mandate
by the Ohio Supreme Court; and
Whereas, every child in every
school district in this state has the
right to a free and appropriate public education in an economically stable school system; and
Whereas, it is the State’s explicit
responsibility to establish the means
by which these rights are guaranteed; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,

March 5, 2003
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby strongly urges the Governor of
Ohio, the Ohio State Legislature, and

copy of this resolution to Governor
Bob Taft, to the chair persons of
