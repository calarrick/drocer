An emergency resolution opposing
the promulgation of a rule requiring
public employers to make employer
contributions to the Ohio Public
Employees Retirement System on a
monthly basis.
Whereas, the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System (“PERS”)
provides retirement, disability, and
survivor benefits programs for public employees throughout the State
of Ohio; and
Whereas, PERS receives its funding from three main sources:
(1)
employee contributions; (2) employer contributions; and (3) return on
investments; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland, a
public employer, is required by Ohio
law to make employer contributions
to PERS; and

The City Record
Whereas, these employer contributions are currently required to be
made on a quarterly basis; and
Whereas, PERS is considering
promulgating a rule that would
require employer contributions to be
made each month; and
Whereas, PERS would like this
rule to go into effect July 1, 2003;
and
Whereas, if this rule is promulgated, public employers, in order to
catch up to the new schedule, would
need to pay fourteen months of contributions in one year; and
Whereas, if this rule is promulgated, it is estimated that the City
of Cleveland would have to pay an
additional $5.5 million to meet its
obligations under the rule; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
and political subdivisions throughout Ohio are encountering difficult
financial times and struggling to
balance budgets; and
Whereas, this rule would place an
unreasonable burden on the City of
Cleveland and other public employers at a challenging economic time;
and
Whereas, this rule would take
effect in the middle of a fiscal year
and would not allow public employers to budget and appropriately plan
for the catch up provision of the
rule; and
Whereas, PERS is also considering requesting the passage of legislation by the Ohio Legislature that
would provide for enhanced penalty
provisions when employer contributions are not submitted in a timely
manner; and
Whereas, the Ohio PERS Retirement Board is the governing body
of PERS; and
Whereas, this Council opposes the
promulgation of a rule requiring
public employers to make employer
contributions on a monthly basis;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council, on
behalf of the City of Cleveland’s
approximate 10,000 employees, opposes the promulgation of a rule
requiring public employers to make
employer contributions to the Ohio
Public Employees Retirement System on a monthly basis.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit

Res. No. 199-03.
By Council Members Cimperman,
Sweeney, Zone and Jones.
An emergency resolution urging
the Federal Highway Administration to review the Detroit-Superior
Bridge Project and all factors relating to safety and access and upon
conclusion of such review to grant
an exception to the Federal Highway Administration’s criteria for
width of lane designations as the
Project is consistent with highway
safety; and urging the Federal
Highway Administration to fund
and support the Detroit-Superior
Bridge Project.
Whereas,
the
Detroit-Superior
Bridge was constructed in 1917 and,
at the time of its construction and
today, serves to connect the East
Side and West Side of Cleveland;
and
Whereas,
the
Detroit-Superior
Bridge is a unique historic bridge;
and
Whereas, the current condition of
the Detroit-Superior Bridge fails to
provide adequate and safe space for
pedestrian and bike travel; and
Whereas, as a result of this failure, many pedestrians and bicyclists
choose to travel in lanes designated
for motor vehicle travel; and
Whereas, the current condition of
the Detroit-Superior Bridge requires
federal, state, and local governmental
entities
to
develop
a
plan
addressing necessary repairs and
safety issues; and
Whereas, after three years of
planning and design review by the
Cuyahoga County Engineer, the City
of Cleveland Department of Public
Service, and the Northeast Ohio
Areawide Coordinating Agency, construction was scheduled to being
this summer on the Detroit-Superior
Bridge; and
Whereas, the planned construction
project
for
the
Detroit-Superior
Bridge was developed with the cooperation of the Ohio City Near West
Development Corporation, the Historic Gateway Development Corporation, the Historic Warehouse Development Corporation, the Downtown Cleveland Partnership, and
ParkWorks; and
Whereas, the planned construction
project
for
the
Detroit-Superior
Bridge was also created with citizen
and resident input as there were
numerous public meetings and block
club discussions on the Detroit-Superior Bridge Project; and
Whereas, the planned construction
project
for
the
Detroit-Superior
Bridge was created and reviewed in
a manner that invited and included
participation by residents, businesses, non-profit entities, and governmental agencies; and
Whereas, this planned construction project for the Detroit-Superior
Bridge creates wider sidewalks and
new bike lanes on the Detroit-Superior Bridge; and
Whereas, wider sidewalks and
new bike lanes were included in the
design
of
the
Detroit-Superior
Bridge Project in order to address
transportation needs of residents of
Ohio City and downtown Cleveland;
and
Whereas,
this
Detroit-Superior
Bridge Project is receiving funding
from
the
federal
government’s
Transportation Enhancement Funding Program and the primary purpose of such Program is to fund pro-

The City Record
jects that balance the safety and
transportation
access
needs
of
pedestrians,
bicyclists,
and
motorists; and
Whereas, the United States Department of Transportation’s policy
statement indicates that “bicycle
and pedestrian ways shall be established in new construction and
reconstruction projects in all urbanized areas”; and
Whereas, the United States Department of Transportation policy
statement also indicates that “there
is no question that conditions for
bicycling and walking need to be
improved in every community in the
United States; it is no longer acceptable that 6,000 bicyclists and pedestrians are killed in traffic every
year, that people with disabilities
cannot travel without encountering
barriers, and that two desirable and
efficient modes of travel have been
made difficult and uncomfortable”;
and
Whereas, the United States Department of Transportation policy
statements also states that “every
transportation
agency
has
the
responsibility and the opportunity to
make a difference to the bicycle
friendliness and walkability of our
communities. The design information to accommodate bicyclists and
pedestrians is available, as is the
funding. The United States Department of Transportation is committed
to doing all it can to improve conditions for bicycling and walking
and to make them safer ways to
travel”; and
Whereas, the design of the Detroit-Superior Bridge Project fully
reflects the policy statement of the
United States Department of Transportation in that it incorporates the
needs of pedestrians, bicyclists, and
motorists; and
Whereas,
the
Detroit-Superior
Bridge Project was designed in a
manner that ensures the safety of
all users of the Detroit-Superior
Bridge; and
Whereas,
the
Detroit-Superior
Bridge Project improves highway
safety by providing dedicated space
for non-motorized users; and
Whereas, safety of all users of the
Detroit-Superior Bridge, motorists,
truckers, bicyclists, and pedestrians,
was a concern at all times during
design
of
the
Detroit-Superior
Bridge Project and was a factor in
finalizing the design; and
Whereas,
the
Detroit-Superior
Bridge is a critical link between the
East Side and West Side of Cleveland; and
Whereas, the neighborhoods on
each side of the Detroit-Superior
Bridge are some of the most diverse
communities in the State of Ohio; and
Whereas, this project, upon completion, will continue to link the
East Side of Cleveland with the
West Side of Cleveland, as well as
downtown
Cleveland
with
Ohio
City, and will enable all citizens to
utilize the Detroit-Superior Bridge,
in a safe manner, regardless of
their selected mode of transportation; and
Whereas, the Federal Highway
Administration is threatening to
revoke support and funding for this
project because of an issue with
respect to lane width and designation; and
Whereas, the Federal Highway
Administration’s
criteria
indicate

285

13
that a route must consist of lanes
designated to be a width of twelve
feet or more or must otherwise be
consistent with highway safety; and
Whereas,
the
Detroit-Superior
Bridge Project is consistent with
highway safety and the federal
government can grant an exception
in this type of circumstance; and
Whereas, failure to grant an
exception will deny safe passage on
the Detroit-Superior Bridge for many
citizens of Cleveland; and
Whereas, in addition to being consistent with highway safety standards, the unique historic features
of the Detroit-Superior Bridge and
its connection from downtown to the
Ohio City neighborhood, render the
Detroit Superior Bridge Project worthy of special consideration; and
Whereas, this Council urges the
Federal Highway Administration to
review the Detroit-Superior Project
and all factors relating to safety
and access; and
Whereas, this Council is confident
that upon conclusion of such review,
the
Federal
Highway
Administration will conclude that the
current design of the Detroit-Superior Bridge is consistent with highway safety; and
Whereas, this Council urges the
Federal Highway Administration to
fund and support the Detroit-Superior Bridge Project; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Federal Highway Administration to review the Detroit-Superior
Bridge Project and all factors relating to safety and access and upon
conclusion of such review to grant

safety.

(e) All projections and all encroachments shall be kept and maintained in a safe, sound and non-hazardous
condition and in conformity with the provisions of this chapter or, where applicable, with the provisions of Chapter 3113. All corrodible materials shall be kept protected from corrosion by painting or shall be otherwise protected as approved by the Commissioner. All conditions which are declared unsafe or in violation of this chapter

projections beyond the street or alley line shall apply also to projections on a public park or other permanent
open public space provided, however, that the provisions of this chapter permitting underground installations

the streets, parks, or public grounds of the City or elsewhere; or if by reason of the nature of the proposed parade
or procession or of the character and type of the objects to be promoted or for the following reasons:
(1) The time, place, size, or conduct of the parade including the assembly areas and route of march
would unreasonably interfere with the public convenience and safe use of the streets and highways.
(2) The parade would require the diversion of so great a number of police officers to properly police
the line of movement, assembly areas, and areas contiguous so as to deny normal police protection to the City.
(3) The parade route of march or assembly areas would unreasonably interfere with the movement of
police vehicles, fire-fighting equipment, or ambulance service to other areas of the City.
(4) The parade would unreasonably interfere with another parade for which a permit has been issued.

accommodating, or decreasing traffic congestion.
(3) The proposed zone is presently a restricted parking area, unless the investigation of the Commissioner of Traffic Engineering reveals that it is desirable to lift or change the restriction.
(e) The establishment of a zone under this section shall be effective ten (10) days after publication of a notice

dropping off or picking up children enrolled at a given day care center or centers. If a zone is so restricted, the
signs required by division (e) of this section shall apprise motorists of the restriction.
(h) No person shall stand or park a vehicle in a zone established for valet parking or passenger drop off/pick

Planning Commission, if the barriers are equally effective to the purposes of this division and are appropriate
in design, as determined by the Director.
For peddling conducted under a short-term peddling permit, the clear zone required by this division shall be

be violated by issuance of the permit, including without limitation, the following:

(2) use restrictions;

Zoning Code that require that a specified number of parking spaces be available for the use of particular business.

not be required if the peddler is proposing to peddle under a short-term peddling permit.
(1) In reviewing the application, the City Planning Commission or Landmarks Commission, as applicable, shall determine the appropriateness of any vending devices proposed to be used with respect to the following factors:
A. physical condition and state or repair;
B. compatibility with nearby structures in terms of color, placement, heights, and general design;
C. obstructions to or conflicts with vehicular or pedestrian traffic;

any designated local design review advisory committee.

less, the Commissioner may issue a short-term peddling permit, except that if any person or persons have obtained
a short-term peddling permit for a particular location on two prior occasions in a given permit year, which shall
commence August 1 and end July 31 of the following year, then no person shall be issued a third or subsequent
short-term peddling permit for the same location in that permit year. As used in this division, a “particular location” shall mean a property or group of contiguous or noncontiguous properties, whether or not under common
ownership, which are under a common street address, both as to house or building number and street name.
