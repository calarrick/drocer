the
approximate
amount as purchased during the preceding term, to be purchased by the
Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies on a unit basis for the Division
of Information Technology and Services, Department of Finance. Bids
shall be taken in a manner that permits an award to be made for all
items as a single contract, or by
separate contract for each or any
combination of the items as the
Board of Control determines. Alternate bids for a period less than two
years may be taken if desired by
the Commissioner of Purchases and
Supplies until provision is made for
the requirements for the entire term.
Section 2. That the costs of the
contract
or
contracts
shall
be
charged against the proper appropriation accounts and the Director
of Finance shall certify the amount
of the initial purchase, which purchase, together with all later purchases, shall be made on order of
the Commissioner of Purchases and
Supplies under a requisition against
the contract or contracts certified by
the Director of Finance. (RL 21543)

September 10, 2003

declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the

Control determines. Alternate bids
for a period less than a year may

until provision is made for the
requirements for the entire term.

for the heavy duty vehicles and

Section 1 of this ordinance, provided that: (I) the Director of Finance
determines that it is in the best
interest of the City to enter into
that
lease-purchase
arrangement,
(II) the maximum term of any
lease-purchase
arrangement
does
not exceed ten (10) years, (III) the
aggregate principal obligation of
the City under the lease-purchase
arrangement
does
not
exceed
$7,000,000, (IV) if the lease-purchase
arrangement provides that the lease
payments are to have a principal
component and an interest component, the maximum interest rate for
the interest component does not
exceed seven percent (7%) per
annum, (V) the obligations of the
City under that lease-purchase arrangement for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2003 are
subject to annual appropriations
being made by the City sufficient to
pay the lease payments and to meet
the other obligations of the City
under that lease-purchase arrangement in each of these fiscal years,

a principal component and an interest component and that the interest
component is to be excluded from
gross income for federal income tax
purposes. In that event, the Director of Finance and other City officials, as appropriate, are authorized
to covenant on behalf of the City
that (I) the City will use and will
restrict the use of the vehicles and
apparatus leased by the City under
the lease-purchase agreement and
will use, and will restrict the investment of, any proceeds of the leasepurchase agreement in such manner
and to such extent as may be necessary so that the lease-purchase
agreement will not constitute a private activity bond, an arbitrage
bond or a hedge bond under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”), or be treated
other than as an obligation to
which Section 103(a) of the Code
applies, and (II) the City will take
or cause to be taken such actions
that may be required of it for the
interest component of the lease payments to be and to remain excluded from gross income for federal
income tax purposes and the City
will not take or authorize to be
taken
any
actions
that
would
adversely affect that exclusion. In
the event that the City enters into
such a lease-purchase arrangement,
the Director of Public Service may
assign to the lessor under the leasepurchase arrangement, or the lessor’s designee, the rights of the City
under the contracts for purchase of
the vehicles and apparatus authorized in Section 1 of this ordinance.
The Director of Law, Clerk of Council and other appropriate officials of
the City are authorized to sign and
deliver any documents, certificates
and other instruments as the Director of Law determines are necessary and appropriate to carry out
the transactions authorized by this
ordinance.
Section 4. That it is found and
determined that all formal actions
of this Council concerning and
relating to the passage of this Ordinance where adopted in open meetings of this Council, and any of its
committees that resulted in such
formal action were in meetings
open to the public in compliance
