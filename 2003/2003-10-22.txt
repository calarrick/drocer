FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES REFERRED
Ord. No. 2019-03.
By Council Member Jackson (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the purchase by one or more
requirement contracts of fasteners,

Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Finance is authorized to make one
or more written requirement contracts under the Charter and the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, for the requirements for
the term of one year or two years
for the necessary items of fasteners
in the approximate amount as purchased during the preceding term,
purchased by the Commissioner of

Purchases and Supplies on a unit
basis for the various divisions of
City government.
Bids shall be
taken in a manner that permits an
award to be made for all items as
a single contract, or by separate
contract for each or any combination of the items as the Board of
Control determines.
Alternate bids
for a period less than the specified
term may be taken if desired by the
Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies until provision is made for the
requirements for the entire term.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into one or more contracts with a term of two years
instead of one year when there is a
financial advantage to the City. For
purposes of this ordinance, a financial advantage shall be determined
by the Director of Finance by comparing the bids received for both
terms.
Section 2. That the costs of the
contract
or
contracts
shall
be
charged against the proper appropriation accounts and the Director
of Finance shall certify the amount
of the initial purchase, which purchase, together with all later purchases, shall be made on order of
the Commissioner of Purchases and
Supplies under a requisition against
the contract or contracts certified by
the Director of Finance.
(RL
104769)
Section 3. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the

Ord. No. 1852-03.
By Mayor Campbell.
An emergency ordinance authorizing the continuation of City-provided group health and life insurance
coverage, under the same terms and
conditions currently in effect, and
further authorizing a continuation
of military leave with pay to all
City employees who would otherwise lose such benefits as a result
of a call to active military duty.
Whereas, due to world events,
City employees who are in the
reserve military forces have been
called to active military service; and
Whereas, under the Codified Ordinances and relevant collective bargaining agreements and management compensation plans, the City
provides certain military leave with
pay when an employee is called to
active military duty at the direction
of the President or the Governor;
and
Whereas, the possible discontinuation of City-provided group health
and life insurance and the limitation
on military leave with pay under
the Codified Ordinances could cause
economic and procedural hardships
for affected employees and their
families; and
Whereas, the City desires to support and assist those City employees
who have been called to active military duty and their families who
have been financially burdened by
the employees’ call to active military duty; and
Whereas, Ordinance No. 2188-02,
passed December 16, 2002, provided
for certain salary payments and the
continuation of group health and
life insurance benefits for City
employees who are members of the
reserve military forces who are
called to active duty; and
Whereas, the provision of group
health and life insurance benefits
under Ordinance No. 2188-02 expires
on December 16, 2003, and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That, notwithstanding
and as an exception to the Codified
Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
all employees of the City who are
in the reserve military forces of the
United States and who are now serving or may in the future serve as
part of the active military forces of
the United States shall be paid by
the City throughout such employee’s
active military service the difference in money between the employee’s City pay and the employee’s
military pay so long as the employee’s
military
pay
is
less
than
employee’s City pay for the same
time period.
Section 2. That, notwithstanding
and as an exception to the Codified
Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
the group health and life insurance
benefits currently provided to all
City employees pursuant to the Codified Ordinances and the City’s collective bargaining agreements, shall
remain in full force and effect for
those City employees otherwise eligible for such benefits, who are in
the reserve military forces of the
United States and who are now serving or may in the future serve as
part of the active military forces of

The City Record
the United States. Such benefits
shall continue for the duration of
such employees’ active military service, but in no event shall such benefits continue beyond one year from
December 16, 2003.
Section 3. That to continue the
group health insurance benefits in
full force and effect, the employee
shall be responsible for paying any
contributions to the health care premium that the employee is required
to pay as an employee.
Section 4. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
