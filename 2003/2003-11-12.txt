a municipal department; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Finance is authorized to employ by
contract or contracts one or more

The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into one or more contracts with a term of two years

An emergency ordinance authorizing the execution and delivery of an
Amendment
and
Restatement
of
Cooperative Agreement in connection with the refinancing of revenue
bonds issued by the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority to
finance costs of construction of the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and
Museum,
and
authorizing
and
approving related matters.

2542

November 12, 2003
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
(the “City”), the County of Cuyahoga (the “County”), the ClevelandCuyahoga County Port Authority
(the “Port Authority”) and the Rock
and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum,
Inc. (the “Museum”) entered into a
Cooperative Agreement dated as of
February 26, 1993 (the “Cooperative
Agreement”) pursuant to special
state legislation to provide for the
ownership, financing, construction,
maintenance and operation of the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (the
“Rock Hall”) as a Port Authority
educational and cultural facility to
be owned by the Port Authority and
leased to the Museum; and
Whereas, pursuant to that Cooperative Agreement, the Port Authority issued $38,995,000 Revenue Bonds
(Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and
Museum Project) (the “Series 1993
Bonds”) which were issued and
delivered on May 20, 1993 to finance
a portion of the costs of construction of the Rock Hall and were subsequently refunded by the Port
Authority
by
the
issuance
of
$34,855,000
Refunding
Revenue
Bonds, Series 1997 (Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame and Museum Project)
(the “Series 1997 Refunding Bonds”
and collectively with the Series 1993
Bonds, the “Bonds”) to establish a
fixed interest rate for the financing;
and
Whereas, pursuant to the Cooperative Agreement and the Trust
Indentures entered into in connection with the Bonds (individually, a
“Trust Indenture” and collectively,
the “Trust Indentures”), provision
was made for payment of the principal of, premium, if any and interest on the Bonds (“Bond Service
Charge”) through the levy by the
County of an additional bed tax of
1-1/2% on transactions by which
lodging by a hotel is or is to be furnished to transient guests within
the County (the “Bed Tax”); and
Whereas, the payment of Bond
Service Charges was further secured
by a pledge by the Museum to
charge an admissions surcharge of
3% on all admissions to the Museum to be paid by the Museum to the
Trustee under the Trust Indentures
(and, in any event, in a minimum
annual
aggregate
amount
of
$224,000) and also to pay to that
Trustee the proceeds of any corporate sponsorships entered into by
the Museum in connection with the
operation of the Rock Hall; and
Whereas, the Museum has requested the City, the County and the Port
Authority to refund the Series 1997
Refunding Bonds and to amend the
Cooperative Agreement because the
Bed Tax collections are sufficient to
pay Bond Service Charges on the
Bonds without the Museum’s admissions surcharge and corporate sponsorships and because the Museum
needs the revenue derived from the
admissions surcharge and corporate
sponsorships to pay operation, maintenance and capital costs of the
Rock Hall; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health or safety
in that authorizing and executing

November 12, 2003
the Amendment and Restatement of
Cooperative Agreement and refunding the Series 1997 Refunding Bonds
at the earliest possible time will
strengthen an important cultural
and economic development facility
within the City by providing additional revenue necessary to pay
operation, maintenance and capital
costs of the Rock Hall; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Determinations.
This Council finds and determines
that it is necessary and proper and
in the best interests of the City to
amend the Cooperative Agreement
entered into in 1993 in connection
with the construction of the Rock
Hall to permit the refinancing of the
Series 1997 Refunding Bonds in such
a way that additional funds will be
made available to the Museum to
provide additional revenue for the
operation, maintenance, and capital
costs of the Rock Hall, an important
cultural and economic development
facility within the City.
Section 2. Authorization.
Any one or more of the Mayor, the
Director of Finance, the Director of
