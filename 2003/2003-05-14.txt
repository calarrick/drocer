Board of Control. Subletting, if permitted, shall not relieve the contractor or his surety of any of his
or its obligations under the contract.
(b) Failure by the contractor to

May 14, 2003
(c) The contractor shall be and
remain solely responsible to the City
for the acts or faults of his subcontractor and of such subcontractor’s
officers, agents and employees, each
of whom shall, for this purpose, be
deemed to be the agent or employee of the contractor to the extent of
his subcontract.
The contractor
shall promptly, on request of the
City file a conformed copy of the
subcontract with prices deleted, as
a
condition
precedent
to
the
approval of a subcontractor.
The
contractor and subcontractor shall
jointly and severally agree that subcontracting does not obligate the
City to pay, or to see to the payment
of any sums to any subcontractor.
Section 187.03 Goals of Contracting Departments; Bid and Contract
Provisions
(a) In accordance with the City’s
goal of increasing the level of MBE
and FBE participation in City contracts, each contracting department
shall use its best efforts to utilize
certified MBEs and FBEs as contractors or subcontractors for all
contracts in excess of ten thousand
dollars ($10,000). The Director shall
determine the appropriate annual
City-wide goal for MBE and FBE
participation for each type of City
contract, such as construction, services, professional services, supplies
and concessions, and for each type
of work to be performed in a particular contract, based on the availability of certified MBEs and FBEs
in the Cleveland contracting market
and within the following range of
annual goals fixed by the Council:
(1) The annual goals for MBE
participation shall range from fifteen percent (15%) to thirty percent
(30%);
(2) The annual goals for FBE participation shall range from five percent (5%) to twenty percent (20%).
The goal for MBE and FBE participation in a particular contract
shall be fixed by the Director in consultation
with
the
contracting
department based on the annual
City-wide goals for each type of City
contract and for each type of work
to be performed in the contract and
the availability of certified MBEs
and FBEs within the Cleveland contracting market, provided however
that the goal for a particular contract may exceed the range of goals
fixed by the Council in order to
assist the contracting department in
meeting the annual City-wide goal
for the type of contract to be awarded.
(b) Contracting departments shall
consider
utilization
of
certified
MBEs and FBEs when recommending a lowest and best or lowest
responsible bid in order to meet the
specified annual goals.
However,
these goals are not intended as quotas. It shall be the responsibility of
each
contracting
department
to
ensure that bids or proposals emanating from that department adhere
to the procedures and provisions in
this chapter.
(c) MBE and FBE participation
shall be counted toward meeting
MBE and FBE goals under the following provisions:
(1) Only expenditures to certified
MBEs and FBEs that perform commercially useful functions in the
implementation or performance of a
contract may be counted toward
meeting MBE and FBE goals.
A
MBE or FBE is considered to perform a commercially useful function
when it is responsible for executing

The City Record
a distinct element of the work in
carrying out its responsibilities by
actually performing, managing, and
supervising the work involved. To
determine whether a MBE or FBE
is performing a commercially useful
function, the City will evaluate the
amount of the contractor’s work
which is subcontracted, industry
practices, and other relevant factors.
(2) A contractor or subcontractor
who qualifies as both a MBE and
FBE may obtain certification as
both a MBE and FBE.
The total
dollar value of a particular contract
with such contractor or subcontractor may be counted toward either
the minority goal or the goal for
females, but not toward both. The
contractor must choose the category
to which the contract value should
be applied.
(3) A portion of the total dollar
value of the contract with a joint
venture equal to the percentage of
certified MBE or FBE participation
in the joint venture may be counted
toward meeting MBE and FBE
goals.
The MBE or FBE must be
responsible for performance of a
clearly defined portion of the work
to be performed, of equal proportion
to its share in the ownership, control,
management,
responsibility,
risk, and profits of the joint venture.
(4) The entire amount of expenditure to a certified MBE or FBE
manufacturer (i.e., a supplier that
produces goods from raw materials
or substantially alters them before
resale) may be counted toward
meeting MBE and FBE goals.
(5) Twenty percent (20%) of
expenditures to certified MBE or
FBE suppliers that are not manufacturers may be counted toward
meeting MBE and FBE goals, provided that the MBE or FBE supplier perform a commercially useful
function in the supply process.
A
firm will be considered a supplier
performing a commercially useful
function in the supply process when
it:
A. assumes the actual and contractual responsibility for furnishing the supplies or materials; and
B. is recognized as a distributor
by the industry involved in the contracted supplies and materials; and
C. owns or leases a warehouse,
yard, building, or whatever other
facilities are customary in the industry in supplying such supplies or
materials; and
D. distributes, delivers, and services products primarily with its
own staff and/or equipment.
(6) MBE or FBE subcontractors
who intend to subcontract services
to be performed under the contract
to non-minority business enterprises
and non-female business enterprises
may not be counted toward meeting
MBE and FBE goals.
This provision does not apply to subcontractor’s contracts for the purchase of
materials, equipment, or supplies
which are incident to the performance of services under the contract.
(d) In order to fulfill the purposes of the MBE and FBE goals, contractors using MBEs and FBEs shall
use them in a way which preserves
meaningful ownership, control and
performance of the work or other
contract obligations by the MBE or
FBE. Failure to do so may subject
the contractor to criminal prosecution, decertification, and other sanctions.
(e)
Notwithstanding
any
goal
established by the Director pursuant
to division (a) of this section, the

989

15
Council may increase or decrease
the percentage goals in any legislation considered by said body.
(f) In furtherance of the efforts
by the contracting departments to
achieve the annual goals for MBE
and FBE participation in City contracts as determined by the Director
pursuant to division (a) of this section, the director of a contracting
department in consultation with the
Director may elect to solicit bids or
proposals from only MBEs and
FBEs for a particular contract, provided that the estimated cost of the
contract does not exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000).
The contracting department shall furnish
the Director with a copy of the bid
invitation or request for proposals
for such contract and the Director
shall provide the contracting department with a list of certified MBEs
and FBEs which can be solicited to
submit bids or proposals for the contract. The Council shall be notified
in writing whenever the director of
a contracting department has elected to solicit bids or proposals from
only MBEs and FBEs pursuant to
this division (f).
(g) Except for contracts solicited
in accordance with division (f) of
this section, contracts for a dollar
amount in excess of ten thousand
dollars ($10,000) shall be awarded
and
administered
in
accordance
with the following standards and
procedures:
(1) Bid invitations, requests for
proposals and all other specifications for contracts, shall require bidders to include in their bid or proposal such documentation and schedules as required by the Director in
which the bidder identifies the bidder’s efforts to utilize minority and
female business enterprises in a percentage which equals or exceeds the
applicable goal.
All bidders shall
make every effort to subcontract to
certified minority and female business enterprises.
All bidders shall
keep such records of such efforts
adequate to permit a determination
of compliance with the requirements
of this division (g) as are required
by the Director. MBE and FBE utilization shall be considered in determining the lowest and best or lowest responsible bid or determining
the best proposal.
(2) If the bid invitation or request
for proposal contains alternates, the
percentage of MBE and FBE participation will be computed with reference to the total dollar amount of
the award, including the cost of any
alternates to be awarded.
(3) It is the responsibility of the
bidder to ensure that all MBEs and
FBEs proposed to be used by the
bidder in the performance of the
contract have been certified by the
City prior to the bid opening.
(4) If a bidder is unable to
achieve the goal established by the
Director for a particular contract
pursuant to division (a) of this section, the bidder shall submit a
request for exception pursuant to
division (a) of Section 187.031.
(5) Prior to execution of a contract, a bidder shall submit to the
City such contract documents as is
specified by the Director which
shall identify the particular minority and female business enterprises
and other subcontractors to be utilized in performing the contract, and
shall specify for each subcontractor
the dollar value of the participation,
the type of work to be performed
and such information as may reasonably be required to determine

16
whether the minority and female
business
enterprise
participation
goals have been satisfied.
(6) All contracts shall contain the
following requirements:
A. The contractor shall utilize certified MBEs and FBEs in the performance of the contract in accordance with the participation identified in the contractor’s bid or proposal, subject only to the substitution and waiver provisions contained in division (b) of Section
187.031. Failure to utilize certified
MBEs and FBEs as identified in the
bid or proposal shall constitute a
material breach of the contract.
B. The contractor shall make
every effort to utilize minority and
female business enterprises during
performance of the contract.
C. The contractor shall maintain
such records as are required by the
Director to demonstrate compliance
with this chapter and the requirements of the contract relating to
minority and female business enterprise participation.
D. The provisions of this chapter
shall be incorporated into the contract by reference and any failure
of the contractor or any subcontractor to comply with the provisions of
this chapter shall constitute a material breach of the contract.
E.
Whenever
the
contract
is
amended or any change order or
subsidiary is authorized and the
total dollar amount of the contract
is increased by more than ten (10)
percent of the dollar value of the
original
contract,
the
contractor
shall comply with the provisions of
this chapter with respect to the
work to paid for through such
amendment, change order or subsidiary and ensure that any work
which is subcontracted is performed
with the same percentage of MBE
and FBE participation contained in
the contractor’s bid or proposal.
(7) In order to be considered best
or responsible, a bidder shall disclose annually such information as
is required by the Director which
demonstrates the extent to which, in
contracts that are not affected by
this chapter, the bidder has awarded subcontracts to minority and
female business enterprises.
(h) Contracts or other agreements
between the City of Cleveland and
other governmental agencies, quasi
governmental agencies, public corporations, or third-party contractors,
whereby such agencies or corporations receive money from or through
the City for the purpose of contracting with businesses to perform
public works, shall require such
agencies or corporations to comply
with the provisions of this chapter
in awarding and administering such
contracts.
(i) Participation of MBEs and
FBEs in joint ventures is encouraged. In the case of a certified joint
venture, only that portion of the
total dollar value of the contract
equal to the percentage of participation of the minority or female
partner in the joint venture will be
counted toward the applicable goal.
(j) The Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies and each contracting department hereby is directed
to:
(1) Make every effort to increase
the level of participation of MBEs
and FBEs in contracts of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less;
(2) Develop lists of MBEs and
FBEs experienced in the various
types of services, products or property typically contracted for;

subcontracts awarded in the previous quarter to MBEs and FBEs;
C. For each contracting department, the degree to which the goals
set forth in this section have been
met, any past and current activities
undertaken and being undertaken in
trying to meet such goals and, if
applicable, a detailed explanation of
why the goals set forth in this section have not been met; and
D. Such other information as may
be requested by the Director; and
(4) Appoint a member of the contracting department or the division
to serve as a liaison between the
contracting
department
and
the
Office of Equal Opportunity, and to
nominate a member of the contracting department or division to serve
on the Committee established pursuant to Section 187.12.

In
advertising,
soliciting,
selecting and contracting for or
with any person or firm for engagement as a subcontractor or materialman, and during the term of any

actual subcontractor or materialman
because of race, religion, color, sex,
sexual orientation, national origin,
age, disability, ethnic group or Vietnam-era or disabled veteran status.

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 836-03.
By Council Members Dolan, Jackson,
Reed,
White,
Britt,
Coats,
Brady, Gordon, O’Malley, Rybka.
An
emergency
resolution
condemning the elected and administrative leadership of Butler, Georgia, and the student leadership at
Taylor County High School for holding a “white only” prom and further
condemning
those
administrators
and other public officials in Georgia
for failing to speak out against the
injustice and cruelty of such discriminatory and unacceptable behavior.
Whereas, on May 2, 2003, Taylor
County High School in Butler, Georgia held a junior prom for white students only; and
Whereas, this event was held offcampus, considered a private party
but was, nevertheless, organized
within a public school and billed as
Taylor High School’s junior prom;
and
Whereas, the principal of Taylor
High refused to comment publicly
about the prom; the superintendent
dismissed the event as “legal”; the
governor of Georgia stated only that
he was “disappointed”; and
Whereas, this type of segregated
event,
condoned
by
the
virtual
silence of the public school’s administrators and the governor of Georgia, is outrageous and reprehensible
in the United States in the 21st century; and
Whereas, a purposefully segregated school event in the year 2003 is
absolutely
unacceptable,
unconscionable and unjustifiable; and
Whereas, those that were involved
in the organizing of such an event,
and those who stood by and allowed
the event to go on without so much
as a question about the nature of
the event, should themselves be condemned as ignorant, irresponsible
and, even, amoral; and
Whereas, allowing a public school
event that excludes students on the
basis of skin color, ethnicity, or religion sends a very damaging and
damning message to all students in
the United States because of their
differences; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby condemns the elected and administrative leadership of Butler, Georgia, and the student leadership at
Taylor County High School for holding a “white only” prom and further
condemns those administrators and
other public officials in Georgia for
failing to speak out against the
injustice and cruelty of such discriminatory and unacceptable behavior.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force

May 14, 2003

An emergency resolution opposing
any action by the Ohio General Assembly that would attempt to prohibit a political subdivision from requiring its employees, as a condition
of employment, to live in any specific area; supporting the decision of
the citizens of the City of Cleveland
to establish a residency requirement
for employees of the City of Cleveland; considering passage of any legislation by the State Legislature
attempting to prohibit this type of
residency requirement as unconstitutional and contrary to the principles
and spirit of American democracy.
Whereas, the Ohio Constitution
grants municipalities the authority
to adopt and amend a charter for its
government; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland is
a charter municipality; and
Whereas, as a charter municipality, the City of Cleveland may exercise under the charter all powers of
local self government; and
Whereas, such powers include the
power to require City residency as
a condition of employment; and
Whereas, in 1982, the Charter of
the City of Cleveland was amended
by the citizens of the City of Cleveland to require that employees of
the City be bona fide residents of
the City and remain as such during
their terms of employment; and
Whereas, in amending the Charter
of the City of Cleveland to require
City residency as a condition of
employment, the citizens of the City
of Cleveland exercised their constitutional right to establish residency
as a condition of employment; and
Whereas, pending House Bill 114
attempts to prohibit political subdivisions from requiring its employees, as a condition of employment,
to reside in any specific area; and
Whereas, House Bill 114 is clearly unconstitutional as it is in direct
conflict with a municipality’s home
rule powers; and
Whereas, House Bill 114 is also
contrary to the principles and spirit
of American democracy in that the
citizens of a municipality have the
democratic power to adopt a charter
and exercise all powers of local selfgovernment, including the power to
require City employees to reside
within the City limits; and
Whereas, this Council is opposed
to any action by the Ohio General
Assembly that would attempt to prohibit a political subdivision from
requiring its employees, as a condition of employment, to live in any
specific area; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
