Whereas, no resident, especially
our children and seniors, should face

Whereas, utility companies serving Cleveland residents should place
the health, safety, and welfare of

An emergency resolution urging
the
Campbell
administration
to
investigate the rash of private hospitals closing in this city, to investigate possible violations by such
hospitals of Chapter 686 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of
Cleveland, and to investigate possible antirust violations by University
Hospitals Health Systems and the
Cleveland Clinic Foundation.
Whereas, in September, 2003, St.
Michael’s
Hospital
announced
it
would stop providing medical services on December 19, 2003; and
Whereas, this imminent closure
will effect thousands of City residents, including those most in need
of health care services; and
Whereas, in recent years, the city
of Cleveland has been affected by
the closure of St. Luke Hospital and
Mt. Sinai Hospital; and
Whereas, on Friday, November
28, 2003, Deaconess Hospital suddenly transferred its patients and
closed its doors, in apparent violation of Chapter 686 of the Codified
Ordinances of the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, Chapter 686 of the Codified Ordinances of the City requires
a 90 day notice to the City prior to
any reductions in or significant
operational
changes
to
hospital
facilities or services; and

The City Record
Whereas, the sudden and unannounced closing of Deaconess Hospital is just the latest consequence
of an ineffective health care system
and yet another indication of the
failure of our health care system to
meet the needs of the residents of
our city, including the uninsured
and the underinsured; and
Whereas, it is apparent that the
two major hospital systems in this
city, University Hospitals Health
System and The Cleveland Clinic
Foundation, monopolize the provision of health care services in Cleveland to the detriment of community
based hospitals and the people they
serve; and
Whereas, it is incumbent upon the
Campbell administration to investigate these actions to ensure that
residents of the city continue to
receive adequate health care services; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the Campbell administration to investigate the rash of private hospitals closing in this city, to
investigate possible violations by
such hospitals of Chapter 686 of the
Codified Ordinances of the City of
Cleveland, and to investigate possible antitrust violations by University Hospitals Health System and the
Cleveland Clinic Foundation.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
Dr. George Saad, CEO, Deaconess
Hospital, Floyd Loop, CEO, Cleveland Clinic, Thomas Zenty, University Hospitals Health System.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

By Council Member Coats.
An emergency resolution urging
the Public Utilities Commission of
Ohio to reject the FirstEnergy Rate
Stabilization Plan as proposed; to
reject any proposal that will harm
government aggregation programs;
and to extend the timetable for its
decision to allow all parties a full
and fair opportunity to analyze
FirstEnergy’s proposal and to participate in the proceedings.
Whereas, FirstEnergy submitted a
Rate Stabilization Plan to the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio
(“the Commission”) on October 21,
2003; and
Whereas, FirstEnergy’s plan would
either subject its customers’ electricity needs to a flawed competitive
auction process or freeze the customers’ present high-cost rates for
an additional three years, from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2008,
and permit FirstEnergy to continue
collecting the present charge for socalled generation “stranded costs”
that was scheduled to end December
31, 2005; and
Whereas, the high cost of power
in northeast Ohio contributes to the
loss of businesses, jobs, and tax revenues for the City, and causes great
hardship to the City’s residents,
many of whom have low to moderate incomes and are on fixed
incomes; and
Whereas, the FirstEnergy plan
would severely restrict and possibly
eliminate the City’s electric aggregation program, which has saved
the City’s Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company (CEI) customers
approximately $3,500,000 since 2001;
and
Whereas, the City’s electric aggregation program is the only alternative to CEI for many City customers who cannot be served by
Cleveland Public Power; and
Whereas,
the
Commission
has
scheduled its hearing on this important matter for December 17, 2003, a
timetable that will make it impossible for the customers, their representatives, other affected parties,
and the Commission itself to determine whether the plan serves the
best interests of the customers; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes the FirstEnergy Rate Stabilization Plan as proposed; that this
Council urges the Commission to
reject any FirstEnergy proposal
that will harm government aggregation programs; and that this Council urges the Commission to extend
the hearing process to afford all
interested persons a full and fair
opportunity to analyze FirstEnergy’s plan and to participate in the
Commission’s proceedings to determine whether the plan serves the
best interests of FirstEnergy’s customers.

An emergency resolution urging
the Administration to require that
all government facilities and operations energy consumption consist
of at least 5% of renewable energy resources and to develop a
strategic energy management plan
with specific goals for achieving
energy efficiency improvements in
all government facilities and operations.
Whereas, cities cannot continue
to solely rely on fossil fuels, such
as coal, natural gas, and nuclear
fuel, for their energy consumption;
and
Whereas, strictly relying on fossil
fuels for energy consumption has
dramatically reduced the supply of
these natural resources, heavily polluted our atmosphere, and substantially raised overall energy costs;
and
Whereas, harnassing renewable
energy resources, such as wind and
solar power, will provide the same
level
of
energy
services,
save
money, and protect the environment;
and
Whereas, cities, like Austin, Seattle, Chicago, and Oakland, have
made similar commitments to using
renewable energy in their government facilities and operations; and
Whereas, developing a strategic
energy management plan will improve energy use, save money, and
support the city’s commitment to
renewable energy; and
Whereas, cities, like Portland,
Phoenix, Minneapolis, Memphis, and
Philadelphia, have also developed
their own strategic energy management plans that have greatly scaled
back their energy use and generated millions of dollars in savings for
these cities; and
Whereas, this Council urges the
Administration to commit to using
renewable energy and to developing
a strategic energy management plan
for the city; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Urging the Administration to require that all government
facilities and operations energy consumption consist of at least 5% of
renewable energy resources and to
develop a strategic energy management plan with specific goals for
achieving

improvements in all government facilities and operations.

An emergency resolution urging
President Bush to act now to jump
start the economy by immediately
empowering his manufacturing Czar
to help save our cities.
Whereas, many cities facing debilitating budget deficits rely on the
income tax for the majority of their
operational revenues; and
Whereas, cities such as Cleveland
are viable and healthy when residents have jobs; and
Whereas, once the heart of rustbelt
vitality,
the
manufacturing
industry has increasingly become a
forgotten economic resource, leaving
hundreds of thousands of manufacturing workers without jobs in the
last ten years and cities without the
needed income tax revenue; and
Whereas, every on manufacturing
job generates three additional service jobs; and
Whereas,
rust-belt
cities
like
Cleveland and Pittsburgh may be
bitter football rivals on Sundays, but
remain intimately joined in their
fight for retaining and creating
these needed manufacturing jobs
the rest of the week; and
Whereas, President Bush used
Labor Day, 2003 and Cleveland as
a platform to announce that he
would create a manufacturing czar
to revitalize the manufacturing
base and create more blue-collar
jobs; and
Whereas, our City’s survival is
linked to the manufacturing industry, which is worth as much, or
more, than the $87 billion the President is spending on the War in
Iraq; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges President Bush to act now
to jump start the economy by
immediately empowering his manufacturing czar to help save our
cities.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a

the President of the United States.
Section 3. That this resolution is

An emergency resolution recognizing the O’Jays for their outstanding musical accomplishments
and supporting the induction of the
O’Jays into the Rock and Roll Hall
of Fame Museum.
Whereas, in the late 1950’s, Eddie
Levert, Walter Williams, William
Powell, Bobby Massey and Bill Isles
formed a quintet called the Triumphs of McKinley High School in
Canton, Ohio; and
Whereas,
this
group
became
known as the Mascots and was later
renamed the O’Jays after legendary
radio D.J., Eddie O’Jay; and
Whereas, in 1963, the O’Jays signed
a contract with Imperial Records and
the band quickly achieved their first
hit, Lonely Drifter; and
Whereas, after a string of hit singles, the O’Jays debut album Comin’
Through was released in 1965; and
Whereas, the group released one
more album, Soul Sounds, before
they met songwriters and producers,
Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, in
1967; and
Whereas, the group started recording on Gamble and Huff’s Neptune label as a quartet after the
departure of Bill Isles in 1967; and
Whereas, Bobby Massey left the
group in 1972 and the trio united
with Gamble and Huff on Philadelphia International Records label to
record some of the best R&B pop
hits ever; and
Whereas, during this time, the
O’Jays became known as one of the
best bands in the world; and
Whereas, the 1970’s was truly the
decade of the O’Jays; and
Whereas, from 1972 through 1978,
the O’Jays recorded eight No. 1 R&B
singles; and
Whereas, during this period the
band also had five albums that went
gold and three that went platinum;
and
Whereas, during this period of
successes, the O’Jays also faced one
of their darkest moments as William
Powell, a founding member of the
band, was forced to leave the band
because of terminal cancer; and
Whereas, Sammy Strain became
William Powell’s replacement; and
Whereas, the O’Jays were able to
overcome the loss of one of their
founding members to cancers and
continued to release hits through
the 1980’s and 1990’s; and
Whereas, today, the band continues to perform and bring joy to old
and new fans; and
Whereas, this Council takes great
pride in recognizing the O’Jays for
their outstanding accomplishments
and achievements during the course
of their illustrious career which
encompasses more than 40 years; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council is honored to recognize the O’Jays for
their outstanding musical accomplishments made possible by their
unique vocal style and showmanship.
Section 2. That this Council supports the induction of the O’Jays
into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Museum in Cleveland, Ohio.

The City Record
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to each
member of the O’Jays, Terry Stewart, Director, Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame Museum and the Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame Foundation.

hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
