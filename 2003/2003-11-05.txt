2508

November 5, 2003
Whereas, many of the Mayo County, Achill Parish Irish originally settled in “Irish bend”, along the Cuyahoga River, south of Detroit and

Whereas, representatives of the
City of Cleveland and Mayo County,
Achill Parish have expressed interest in an active exchange of culture,
tourism,
business
and
education
opportunities; and
Whereas, such exchange would
serve to support the development

and
Whereas, the leaders of Cleveland
and the Mayo County Council, Achill
Parish, have expressed an interest
