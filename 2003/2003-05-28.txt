ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 911-03.
By Council Members Dolan and
Jones.
An emergency resolution encouraging the Ohio state legislature to
pass a law making .08 for blood
alcohol content the standard for driving under the influence of alcohol.
Whereas, in December, 1998, the
President sought to make a .08
blood alcohol content a national
standard and announced that states
would receive federal transportation
money when they lowered the limit
to .08 for drunk-driving; and
Whereas,
two
years
later,
30
states, including Ohio, still had not
lowered their limits for drunk-driving; and
Whereas, Congress then stated
that any state that does not pass a
.08 law by October 1, 2003, will face
a reduction in federal highway funding; and
Whereas, the State of Ohio still has
not passed a law adopting .08 as the
standard for drunk-driving; and
Whereas, if Ohio fails to pass
such a law, it will lose 2% of its
highway money in 2004; which
amount will increase by 2% per
year until it reaches the maximum
of 8% in 2007; and
Whereas, this amounts to tens of
millions of dollars potentially lost to
the State of Ohio by 2007; and
Whereas arguably, passing a .08
law could save 500 lives annually;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby encourages the Ohio state legis-

1174

May 28, 2003
lature to pass a law making .08 for
blood alcohol content the standard
for driving under the influence of
alcohol.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to members of the
Ohio state legislature.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted May 19, 2003.
Effective May 27, 2003.

Res. No. 912-03.
By
Council
Members
Conwell,
Scott, Zone and Jones.
An emergency resolution declaring this Council’s support of the
City’s efforts to upgrade its traffic
signal system and equipment.
Whereas, traffic signal technology
has advanced significantly in recent
years; and
Whereas, these advancements include the ability to adjust signals in
response to the number of vehicles
on the road, the ability to link one
traffic light to another, and the ability to adjust signals with a computer; and
Whereas, upgrading traffic signals and instituting new technology
to monitor and control traffic signals will result in fewer traffic
delays, better traffic progression,
and improved air quality; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
Division of Traffic Engineering, is in
the process of upgrading its traffic
signal system and equipment; and
Whereas, the Commissioner of
Traffic Engineering has indicated
that the goal is to establish a citywide traffic signal system that
could be monitored and controlled
from City Hall; and
Whereas, this Council is supportive of these efforts; and
Whereas, there may be federal
funding available to assist the City
of Cleveland in its efforts to improve
its traffic signal system; and
Whereas, this Council encourages
the Director of Public Service and
Commissioner of Traffic Engineering to research and apply for any
grants that may be available to
assist the City in its efforts to
upgrade its traffic signal system
and equipment; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby declares its support of the City’s
efforts to upgrade its traffic signal
system and equipment.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Res. No. 919-03.
By Council Members Dolan, Sweeney and O’Malley.
An emergency resolution declaring this Council’s desire, interest
and commitment to work toward
establishing a permanent sister city
relationship
with
Mayo
County
Parish of Achill, Ireland.
Whereas, Achill Parish, located in
County Mayo, Ireland, is known for
its striking beauty and is home to
one of the world’s finest fishing
regions; and
Whereas, over 85% of the 250,000
Irish in Greater Cleveland trace
their ancestral origins to the Parish
of Achill; and
Whereas, many of the Mayo County Achill Parish Irish originally settled in “Irish bend”, along the Cuyahoga River, south of Detroit and
east of West 25th Street; and
Whereas, representatives of the
City of Cleveland and Mayo County
Achill Parish have expressed interest in an active exchange of culture,
tourism,
business
and
education
opportunities; and
Whereas, such exchange would
serve to support the development
and growth of both communities, to
deepen the relationship that has
existed between the communities for
the past 200 years, and to expand
and enhance knowledge and understanding between the communities;
and
Whereas, the leaders of Cleveland
and the Mayo County Council, Achill
Parish, have expressed an interest
in working toward establishing a
permanent sister city relationship
between their communities; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby declares its desire, intent and
commitment to work toward the
establishment of a permanent sister
city relationship with Mayo County
Achill Parish, Ireland.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Res. No. 921-03.
By Council Members Westbrook,
Zone,
Cimperman,
Scott,
Coats,
Polensek and Brady
An emergency resolution opposing
the proposed state budget cuts to
the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources, affecting services for
state parks including those in the
Cleveland area, such as Edgewater
Park, Euclid Beach Park, Wildwood
Park, and Gordon Park.
Whereas, Ohio’s state parks are
an important source of recreation
for the majority of Ohioans and
have a profound effect on Ohio’s
economy, with overnight visitors
spending $265 million dollars in the
state parks and local communities,
helping to generate $21.9 million
and $20.8 million in state and local
taxes, respectively; and
Whereas, Ohio State Parks System
consistently ranks near the top of
the nation’s state park systems in
terms of visitation, number of parks
and acreage, facilities and revenues
generated; and
Whereas, the Ohio House version
of the state budget requires significant cuts to the budget of the
Department of Natural Resources
(DNR), affecting Ohio’s state parks,
nature preserves and the management of state and private forests;
and
Whereas, among other things, the
House DNR budget eliminates the
Civilian Conservation Corps, a program that has provided nearly 1.9
million worth of labor for special
projects and conservation work to
Ohio State Parks and other department divisions; and
Whereas, the work done by the
CCC now must be absorbed by the
DNR’s bottom line and will impact
the department’s ability to provide
quality recreational service; and
Whereas, the House budget does
not provide funding for the Division
of Wildlife’s central support costs,
causing other divisions to absorb
those costs; and
Whereas, the House budget fails
to take into account normal inflationary costs; and
Whereas, taking the above into
account, the DNR’s budget actually
declines 2.4% in 2004 and increases
by 2.8% in 2005, which increase
barely covers the costs of collective
bargaining agreements; and
Whereas, Ohio State Parks has
already been streamlining its operations in that full-time permanent

1175

11
staff has been cut 17% over the past
three years; 29 of 74 state parks are
now operated as satellites to larger
parks in the region; and only 45
state parks have an on-site park
manager; and
Whereas, these latest budget cuts
will likely cause additional fee
increases for camping, cottages and
docks, the temporary closing of
some parks, significantly fewer seasonal employees, reduced educational and other programs, reduced law
enforcement presence, reduced mowing,
restroom
cleaning,
trash
removal and building maintenance;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby opposes the proposed state budget cuts to the Ohio Department of
Natural Resources, affecting services for state parks including those
in the Cleveland area, such as Edgewater Park, Euclid Beach Park,
Wildwood Park, and Gordon Park.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby directed to transmit certified
copies of this resolution Governor
Bob Taft and to the appropriate
members of the state legislature.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

An emergency resolution withdrawing objection to the renewal of
D1, D2, D3 and D3A Liquor Permit
at 3065 East 123rd Street and repealing Resolution No. 1427-01, objecting

Whereas, this Council objected to

Liquor Permit to 3065 East 123rd
Street by Resolution No. 1427-01
adopted by the Council on July 18,

by
and
through City Council Representative, Kenneth L. Johnson and Marcialena Kendrick, President, Kendrick Lounge, Inc., 3065 East 123rd
Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44120, Permanent Number 4580028, a copy of
which is in the file for this address
with the City Law Department; and
Whereas,
this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That objection to the
renewal of a D1, D2, D3 and D3A
Liquor Permit to 3065 East 123rd
Street be and the same is hereby

12
withdrawn and Resolution No. 142701, containing such objection, be and
the same is hereby repealed and
that this Council consents to the
immediate renewal thereof.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it

By Council Member Johnson.
An emergency resolution objecting to the transfer of ownership of
a C1 and C2 Liquor Permit to 8805
Buckeye Road.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Department of Liquor
Control of an application for the
transfer of ownership of a C1 and
C2 Liquor Permit from Serhan, Inc.,
DBA Buckeye Sunoco, 8805 Buckeye
Road, Cleveland, Ohio 44104, Permanent Number 7987615 to 8805 Buckeye, Inc., DBA Buckeye Marathon,
8805 Buckeye Road, Cleveland, Ohio
44104, Permanent Number 2455390;
and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of
notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
