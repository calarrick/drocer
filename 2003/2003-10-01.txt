An emergency resolution acknowledging the role that the “Amber
Alert” system provides in assisting
law enforcement agencies with child
kidnapping situations and stating
the Public Safety Committee’s intention to hold a hearing reviewing the
City of Cleveland’s “Amber Alert”
system.
Whereas, “Amber Alert” is a missing child response program that utilizes the resources of law enforcement and media to notify the public
when children are kidnapped; and
Whereas, the “Amber Alert” system was created and developed in
response to the tragic 1996 kidnapping and murder of nine-year-old
Amber
Hagerman
in
Arliginton,
Texas; and
Whereas, the “Amber Alert” system is now operational in Ohio; and
Whereas, the “Amber Alert” system may only be implemented by a
law enforcement agency; and
Whereas, law enforcement agencies activate an “Amber Alert” by
notifying broadcast media of the
kidnapping; and
Whereas,
upon
receipt
of
an
“Amber Alert”, radio and television
stations interrupt regularly scheduled programming to notify the public that a child has been kidnapped;
and
Whereas, the “Amber Alert” system is an effective tool that assists
law enforcement in responding to
child kidnapping situations; and
Whereas, it is important for this
Council to understand the operation
of the “Amber Alert” system within
the City of Cleveland and to be
familiar with the City of Cleveland
Department of Public Safety’s protocol as it pertains to child kidnapping situations and the decision to
issue an “Amber Alert”; and
Whereas, it is appropriate for the
Public Safety Committee to hold a
hearing and conduct a review of the
City of Cleveland’s “Amber Alert”
system; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
acknowledges the role that the
“Amber Alert” system provides in
assisting law enforcement agencies
with child kidnapping situations
and, in order to better understand

Alert” system, this Council will,

By Council Member Scott.
An emergency resolution objecting to a New C2 Liquor Permit at
1250 East 105th Street.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Department of Liquor
Control of an application for a New
C2 Liquor Permit at A & B Randa,
Inc., DBA Family Discount, Inc.,
1250 East 105th Street, Cleveland,
Ohio
44108,
Permanent
Number
0000725; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor

Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to

By Council Members Britt, Jackson,

White, Reed, Johnson, Lewis, Pierce
Scott, Conwell, Coats, Polensek, Cintron, Gordon, O’Malley, Zone, Westbrook, Brady, Sweeney and Dolan.
An emergency resolution demanding an end to a health care system
that indisputably fails to provide
quality care to urban neighborhoods
and the uninsured poor in our city;
calling upon community leaders,
hospitals
and
medical
service
providers to respond quickly to this
health
care
crisis
by
working
together to create a comprehensive
plan to ensure that all citizens are
provided quality, affordable health
care; and reaffirming this Council’s
commitment to work with community leaders, hospitals, and medical
providers to address local health
care issues and possible solutions.
Whereas, the State of Ohio ranked
second in the nation in hospital closures in 2000; and
Whereas, in recent years, the City
of Cleveland has been affected by
the closure of St. Luke Hospital and
Mt. Sinai Hospital; and
Whereas, Huron Hospital recently
contemplated the closure of its trauma center and the closure of Deaconess Hospital is rumored to be
imminent; and
Whereas,
University
Hospitals
Health System hired a consultant to
review the future use of the St.
Michael Hospital facility but failed
to share the results of the study
with the community; and
Whereas, last week University
Hospitals Health System announced
that St. Michael Hospital will stop
providing
medical
services
on
December 19, 2003; and
Whereas, the future closing of St.
Michael Hospital is just the latest
consequence of an ineffective health
care system and yet another indication of the failure of our health care
system to meet the needs of the
uninsured poor; and
Whereas,
the
closing
of
St.
Michael Hospital will significantly
hinder the ability of local residents
to receive urgent medical services
and will have a significant impact
on the neighborhood, its residents
and the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas,
the
closing
of
St.
Michael Hospital indicates an obvious lack of concern by health care
officials and hospital administrators
for the detrimental social and economic consequences such a closing
will have on the neighborhood; and
Whereas, this announcement and
decision by University Hospitals
Health System is an ominous foreshadowing of what is to come in
this city and this country if we do
not confront the significant health
care issues affecting all cities and

October 1, 2003
communities in the United States;
and
Whereas, these health care issues
include a health care system that
fails to provide health care to all citizens, a system that is revenue driven, and a system that is burdened
with excessive administrative operating
costs,
including
insurance
costs; and
Whereas, the current health care
system has caused a disinvestment
by health care providers in urban
hospitals and medical centers and
thereby a disinvestment in care provided to residents in those urban
neighborhoods, including the uninsured poor; and
Whereas, decisions to close and/or
decrease medical services in urban
hospitals further limits the ability
of indigent and uninsured citizens
to obtain quality health care; and
Whereas, closing and/or decreasing medical services in urban hospitals causes neighborhoods, built
for years around such hospitals, to
deteriorate as businesses that relied
on the hospital close up and move
out, and people who live in the
neighborhoods are forced to seek
medical assistance farther away
from home, and
Whereas, hospital closures and
decreases in medical services in
urban areas create an increased burden on those hospitals that take on
the responsibility of providing medical care and services to every person in need; and
Whereas, health care providers
have a moral and ethical responsibility to ensure that all citizens in
a community, whether insured or
not, receive quality health care; and
Whereas, it is incumbent upon
hospitals
and
medical
service
providers to provide care to their
fair share of indigent and uninsured
patients in order to relieve hospitals
that are overburdened with those
patients; and
Whereas, it is incumbent upon
hospitals
and
medical
service
providers to cooperate to find solutions by which all citizens are provided decent, affordable health care;
and
Whereas, these solutions could be
created by the drafting of a comprehensive plan coordinated by community leaders, hospitals, and medical service providers; and
Whereas, community leaders, hospitals, and medical service providers
must find a way to work together
to find a smarter and more efficient
way to provide health care services
to all residents of the City of Cleveland, including the uninsured poor,
in order to create a comprehensive
plan that would address the health
care needs of residents of the City
of Cleveland; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby demands an end to the current
health care system, a system that
indisputably fails to provide quality
health care to urban neighborhoods
and the uninsured poor.
Section 2. That this Council hereby calls upon community leaders,
hospitals,
and
medical
service
providers to respond quickly to the

The City Record
current health care crisis by working together to create a comprehensive plan to ensure that all citizens
are
provided
quality,
affordable
heath care.
Section 3. That this Council hereby reaffirms its commitment to

deposit by the lessor of the purchase
price of the vehicles and apparatus,
acceptance certificates evidencing
the City’s acceptance of the vehicles
from the vendors, and certificates as
to insurance, tax compliance and
related matters necessary to carry
out the transaction. The lease-purchase arrangement may provide that
the lease payments are to have a
principal component and an interest
component and that the interest
component is to be excluded from
gross income for federal income tax
purposes. In that event, the Director
of Finance and other City officials,
as appropriate, are authorized to
covenant on behalf of the City that
(I) the City will use and will
restrict the use of the vehicles and
apparatus leased by the City under
the lease-purchase agreement and
will use, and will restrict the investment of, any proceeds of the leasepurchase agreement in such manner
and to such extent as may be necessary so that the lease-purchase
agreement will not constitute a private activity bond, an arbitrage
bond or a hedge bond under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”), or be treated
other than as an obligation to which
Section 103(a) of the Code applies,
and (II) the City will take or cause
to be taken such actions that may
be required of it for the interest
component of the lease payments to
be and to remain excluded from
gross income for federal income tax
purposes and the City will not take
or authorize to be taken any actions
that would adversely affect that
exclusion. In the event that the City
enters into such a lease-purchase
arrangement, the Director of Public
Service may assign to the lessor
under the lease-purchase arrangement, or the lessor’s designee, the
rights of the City under the contracts for purchase of the vehicles
and apparatus authorized in Section
1 of this ordinance. The Director of
Law, Clerk of Council and other
appropriate officials of the City are
authorized to sign and deliver any
documents, certificates and other
instruments as the Director of Law
determines are necessary and appropriate to carry out the transactions
authorized by this ordinance.
Section 4. That it is found and
determined that all formal actions
of this Council concerning and relating to the passage of this Ordinance
where adopted in open meetings of
this Council, and any of its committees that resulted in such formal
action were in meetings open to the
public in compliance with the law.
Section 5. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
