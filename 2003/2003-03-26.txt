Whereas, this Council is well
aware of the increasing disparity in
the City between the rich and the

and, in particular, the working poor;
and
Whereas, this Council passed the
Fair Employment Law, Chapter 189
of the Codified Ordinances of the
City of Cleveland, Ohio, requiring
employers, under certain circumstances, to pay employees a “living
wage”; and
Whereas, a “living wage” is not
only determined by hourly wages,
but also health care coverage; and
Whereas, this Council has passed
legislation recognizing the rights of
all workers to seek safe and fair
working conditions and to be paid
equitably for their work; and
Whereas, this Council has consistently supported the right of employees to organize and bargain collectively with their employers in good
faith to negotiate fair and equitable
contracts; and
Whereas, this Council has passed
numerous resolutions urging employers to comply with federal and state
labor laws regarding union organization and representation; and
Whereas, this Council supported

An emergency resolution supporting the use of race as a factor in determining undergraduate and graduate school admissions and urging
Attorney General Petro to reconsider his refusal to sign a friend of
the court brief on behalf of the Ohio
State University.
Whereas,
in
1978,
the
United
States Supreme Court ruled that public universities could consider race
in
determining
admissions,
but
could not use racial quotas; and
Whereas, the University of Michigan considers race in its admissions
policies for both its undergraduate
programs and law school program;
and
Whereas,
the
United
States
Supreme Court has agreed to hear a
case involving admission policies at
the University of Michigan to determine whether race can be used in
college and graduate school admission practices; and
Whereas, the University of Michigan has maintained the position
that it has the right, and the responsibility, to use race in recruiting students; and
Whereas, the Ohio State University has released a statement supporting the University of Michigan’s
affirmative action policies and stating that it uses race as a “plus factor” in its own admissions; and
Whereas, the Ohio State University planned to file a brief with the
United States Supreme Court in support of the University of Michigan’s
affirmative action policies; and
Whereas, Ohio Attorney General
Jim Petro refused to sign this friend
of the court brief; and
Whereas, Ohio law requires all
state agencies, including public universities, to be represented in legal
actions by the attorney general; and
Whereas, this Council feels that,
in order to increase diversity, race
should be used as a factor in undergraduate
and
graduate
school
admissions and urges Attorney General Petro to reconsider his refusal
to sign a friend of the court brief
on behalf of the Ohio State University; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the use of race as a factor in
determining
undergraduate
and
graduate
school
admissions
and
urges Attorney General Petro to
reconsider his refusal to sign a
friend of the court brief on behalf
of the Ohio State University.

Whereas, on March 17th, President
Bush delivered an ultimatum to Saddam Hussein to leave Iraq or face
military action; and
Whereas, on March 18th, Saddam
Hussein rejected the President’s ultimatum; and
Whereas, troops from the United
States and England, with the support of 44 other nations, attacked
Iraq; and
Whereas, our troops are engaged
in war and are confronting many
difficulties, including the possibility
of use of chemical or biological
weapons; and
Whereas, the men and women of
our armed forces dedicate their lives
to protect the freedoms we hold dear
— freedoms we too often take for
granted; and
Whereas, these freedoms include
the first amendment right to freedom of speech and this Council
respects this right and encourages
Americans to exercise their first
amendment rights; and
Whereas, regardless of one’s personal opinion on the necessity of
this military action, it is essential
that the people of this nation band
together to support our men and
women serving in the armed forces,
who are on a dangerous and important mission; and
Whereas, the men and women of
our armed forces have earned our
respect and are courageous individuals; and
Whereas, the United States Senate
and the United States House of Representatives each passed a resolution expressing support and appreciation to the members of the United States armed forces and their
families; and
Whereas, it is appropriate for this
Council
to
express
its
support,

By Council Member Jones.
An emergency resolution urging
the United States Congress to support a new national holiday “American Heroes Day” to recognize and
pay tribute to our public servants
and citizens who exemplify the
American Spirit.
Whereas, the events of September
11, 2001 is indelibly etched in the
minds of all Americans as well as
every citizen throughout the world;
and
Whereas, the President of the
United States George W. Bush has
put forth the notion to commemorate
a special day known as “Patriots
Day” in order to remember the
events of September 11, 2001; and

32
Whereas, the events of September
11, 2001 should not end with the oneyear anniversary of grief and sorrow, but as a constant reminder of
the many men and women in public
service who were very instrumental
on that day in keeping citizens safe
in the face of serious danger and
harm as a result of the terrorist
attack; and
Whereas, the American people
came together as one to show support to the many public servants
who risk their lives daily to keep
our citizens and communities safe
from those conditions that can be a
threat to the general safety and welfare of the general public; and
Whereas, since our public servants are in fact worthy of hero status because of what they do on a
daily basis, which earns the recognition, honor and appreciation of all
citizens; and
Whereas, many of our citizens
have also exemplified the American
Spirit of heroism and have demonstrated acts of courage or unity during moments of great challenges to
our country; and
Whereas, it would be more appropriate to call this special day of
September 11, 2001 as “American
Heroes Day” to honor and pay tribute to our public servants and anyone else who has displayed acts of
courage
and
community
service
that exemplifies the great American Spirit; and
Whereas, this special day will
enable us to honor those American
heroes who are presently serving in
our local public safety forces and
those citizens that have displayed
acts of courage under extreme circumstances or acts of unity and
community service; and
Whereas, this special day will
also enable us to remember those
victims of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on our country as well
as the public servants who sacrificed their lives while in the line of
duty to protect and maintain the
safety and welfare of the general
public; now therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports legislation promoting a local,
state and national holiday to remember the innocent victims of tragedy
and accident, and to pay tribute to
our public servants and citizens who
respond to help and maintain the
public safety in our communities as
well as promoting community service.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she is hereby directed to
transmit two certified copies of this
resolution to the United States Congress urging the support of “American Heroes Day” to recognize and
pay tribute to our public servants
and citizens who exemplify the
American Spirit.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency

the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
