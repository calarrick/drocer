ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 656-03.
By
Council
Members
O’Malley,
Westbrook, Sweeney, Cimperman and
Jackson (by departmental request).
An emergency resolution declaring
it necessary to relay and repair sidewalks, aprons, driveway and curbs
(including adjustments of castings
and
landscaping,
if
necessary)
encroaching upon the public right-ofway on Woodhaven Avenue from
West 63rd Street to Ridge Road,
West 98th Street from Lorain Avenue
to Walford Avenue and West 110th
Street from Clifton Boulevard to
Franklin Boulevard.
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That it is necessary and
conducive to the public health and
welfare that Woodhaven Avenue
from West 63rd Street to Ridge
Road, West 98th Street from Lorain
Avenue to Walford Avenue and
West
110th
Street
from
Clifton
Boulevard to Franklin Boulevard, be
improved by relaying and repairing
sidewalks, driveway aprons, and
curbs
(including
adjustments
of
castings and landscaping, if necessary) encroaching upon the public
right-of-way or otherwise improving

the right-of-way in accordance with
plans, specifications and profiles, at
the estimated cost of $880,061.20, prepared and placed in File No. 656-03A in the Office of the Clerk of Council, which plans, specifications and
profiles are approved.
Section
2.
That
fifty
percent
(50%) of the cost and expense of
the improvement, and less the entire
cost of intersections, as shall be
found to be a proper charge, shall
be assessed on all lots and lands
abutting on, and other specifically
benefited
property
adjacent
to
Woodhaven Avenue from West 63rd
Street to Ridge Road, West 98th
Street from Lorain Avenue to Walford Avenue and West 110th Street
from Clifton Boulevard to Franklin
Boulevard, in proportion to the benefits which may result from the
improvement, and it is determined
that the lots and lands are specially benefited by the improvements.
The Director of Public Service has
fixed five (5) years as the estimated life of the improvements.
Section 3. That the entire amounts
to be levied shall be paid in five (5)
annual installments, with interest
on deferred payments at the rate of
4.31% per annum provided, however,
that the owner of any property
assessed may, at his option, pay the
principal amount of the assessment
in cash within 40 days from and
after the passage of the assessing
ordinance.
Section 4. That the remainder of
the cost of the improvement not
specifically assessed, as provided,
shall be paid by the City of Cleveland, or out of funds made available
to it by other sources, or governmental agencies.
Section 5. That the Director of
Finance is directed to cause written
notice to be served on the owner or
each lot or parcel of land to be
assessed, or on any other persons or
corporations entitled by any provision of law to notice of the adoption
of this resolution.
Section 6. That the Commissioner
of Assessments and Licenses is
authorized to prepare and file in the
Office of the Clerk of Council an
estimated assessment under the provisions of this resolution showing
the
amount
of
the
assessment
against each lot or parcel of land to
be assessed. Such estimated assessments shall be based on the estimated cost of the improvement
under the plans, specifications and
profiles now on file in the Office of
the Clerk of Council. The estimated
assessment shall be filed in the
Office of the Clerk and kept available for public inspection.
Section 7. That this resolution is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

An emergency resolution supporting Issue 2, and encouraging voters
to vote for Issue 2 on May 6th, in
order to maintain, enrich, enhance,

Library System.
Whereas, the Cleveland Public
Library system plays a vital role in
our community by providing access
to people of all ages to a world of

Library is committed to providing
library materials and programs for
all ages at the Main Library downtown as well as at the 28 branches
located throughout Cleveland; and

Library system contains a Library
for the Blind and Physically Handicapped, a Mobile Library and Public
Administration Library; and
Whereas, computer access, electronic services and instructional
classes are available at all branches and the Main Library; and

Library is currently undertaking a
Neighborhood Library Services Initiative, a comprehensive strategic
planning process the goal of which
is to integrate the best trends for
urban library systems with the
needs of Cleveland neighborhoods;

enhance the above mentioned services is great and the Library System is in need of increasing its revenue stream in order to ensure the

worldwide information; preservation
of
the
28
neighborhood
libraries, the Main Library and the
special libraries; increased hours of
service at neighborhood libraries,
including
year-round
Saturday
hours; more computers and computer training; special services for
youth;
additional
services
for
seniors; and programs for the Hispanic community and new Americans; and
