FIRST READING EMERGENCY

Res. No. 92-03.
By Council Members Cimperman
and Zone.
An emergency resolution supporting diversity training programs and
encouraging Senator White, President of the Ohio Senate, to complete
a diversity training program; and
inviting Senator White to visit the
City of Cleveland and surrounding
communities and tour its diverse
neighborhoods.
Whereas,
Ohio
Senator
Doug
White is the current President of
the Ohio Senate; and
Whereas, there are allegations
that Senator White’s history reflects
a lack of racial sensitivity and culture awareness; and
Whereas, Mayor Rhine McLin, a
former State of Ohio lawmaker, has
indicated
that
Senator
White
engaged in behavior that was offensive to her and is connected with an
old stereotype that rubbing a black
person can bring good fortune; and
Whereas, Senator White has conceded making “Jew them down”
comments; and
Whereas, such a comment was
made by Senator White this past
fall during a meeting in the Cleveland area; and
Whereas, Senator White has indicated to the Cleveland Plain Dealer
that the comments were not said “in
any negative connotation”; and
Whereas, these comments of Senator White, regardless of intent or
motive, are offensive to many Ohio
citizens and fail to recognize the
racial, culture and religious diversity of the citizens of the State of
Ohio; and
Whereas, this Council feels that
diversity
training
programs
are
valuable in that such programs educate individuals about racial, cultural, and religious differences and
the type of comments and behavior
that may offend other individuals;
and
Whereas, without the benefit of
diversity training programs many
individuals are not aware of comments and behaviors that may be
offensive; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland is
a diverse City and its citizens represent many different racial, culture, and religious backgrounds; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland is
proud of its diverse neighborhoods
and the racial, cultural, and religious sensitivity and awareness of
its citizens; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,

121

15
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports diversity training programs
and
encourages
Senator
White, President of the Ohio Senate,
to complete a diversity training program.
Section 2. That this Council hereby invites Senator White to visit the
City of Cleveland and surrounding
communities and tour its diverse
neighborhoods.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Senator
White and all members of the Ohio
Senate and Ohio House of Representatives representing the City of
Cleveland.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force

Control of an application for a New
C2 Liquor Permit at Joann M. Byrge,
DBA Beverage Store, 4409 Payne
Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44103, Permanent Number 1162873; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based on
other legal grounds as set forth in
Revised Code Section 4303.292; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.

An emergency resolution supporting men and women serving in the
armed forces and honoring their
commitment to our nation’s safety
and security; opposing unilateral
military action against Iraq and
urging President Bush to continue
seeking a peaceful resolution of
issues with Iraq in a diplomatic
manner.

18
Whereas, the United Nations is in
the process of conducting weapon
inspections in Iraq; and
Whereas, it has not been proven
that the issues with Iraq cannot be
resolved by traditional diplomatic
efforts; and
Whereas, more time may be necessary to resolve issues in a diplomatic manner; and
Whereas, military action against
Iraq would result in the loss of civilian lives, as well as the deaths of
Iraqi and U.S. military personnel; and
Whereas, military action against
Iraq will cost billions of dollars at
a time when the American economy
is struggling and at a time when
the federal government is operating
with a deficit; and
Whereas, the State of Ohio is facing deficit situations and budget
constraints; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland is
also facing serious financial problems; and
Whereas, while making preparations for a costly war against Iraq,
the Bush Administration is proposing a tax cut for the very wealthy
and this tax cut will result in less
dollars being provided for education,
health care, aid to American cities,
and desperately needed social services; and
Whereas, military action in Iraq
will divert attention from economic
issues and challenges confronting
the American people and American
cities; and
Whereas,
resolutions
opposing
military action against Iraq have
been adopted by numerous City
Councils including, Chicago, Detroit,
Philadelphia, Baltimore, San Francisco, Albuquerque, New Haven, Seattle, and Gary, Indiana; and
Whereas, the National Council of
Churches and the National Conference of Catholic Bishops have also
passed resolutions opposing military
action against Iraq; and
Whereas, military action against
Iraq is opposed by John Sweeney,
National President of the AFL-CIO,

Iraq is also opposed by many prominent clergy and other leaders in the
Cleveland

Westbrook, Gordon, Coats, Reed and
O’Malley.
An emergency resolution urging
Governor Taft to reconsider cutting
a total of $30 million from the Local
Government Fund, the Local Government Revenue Assistance Fund and
the Local Government and Library
Fund, which would result in a reduction in day-to-day services and
security for local constituents.
Whereas, Governor Taft recently
delivered his fifth State of the State
message to a joint session of the
Ohio General Assembly; and
Whereas, in his State of the State
speech, Governor Taft asked legislators to expect drastic measures to
be taken as the state develops its
new biennial budget; and
Whereas, one drastic measure the
governor has asked legislators to
consider is cutting local government
and library assistance by $30 million
dollars; and
Whereas, this $30 million cut
would result in losses of aid totaling $19 million for local governments such as Cleveland, and $11
million to libraries; and
Whereas, a cut in the aid Cleveland and other local governments
receive would mean less money for
necessary and important municipal
functions such as safety and fire
departments and recreation; and
Whereas, less money to local
libraries could mean that libraries
in our communities cut services and
hours; and
Whereas, by eliminating aid to
local governments and libraries, it
will be the people in our communities that ultimately suffer the loss
of services, from public safety, to
recreation services to full access to
libraries; and
Whereas, local governments and
the library system are already facing deficits and will be unable to
bridge the gap left by a $30 million
dollar cut in financial assistance;
and
Whereas, it is highly unlikely that
such a cut in local government and
library aid will make the state of
Ohio more fiscally secure; it will,
however, make it more difficult for
local constituents to receive necessary day-to-day services and security; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,

The City Record

January 29, 2003

to 359).
(b) Any part of a building or other structure, except permitted footings, constructed so as to project beyond

pole. No fee shall be charged for encroachment permits to stretch a banner across the right-of-way.
(d) No permit to erect, alter, enlarge, or maintain a projection beyond the street or alley line, or to encroach

action of Council, and the City shall not be liable for any damages to the owner by reason of the revocation.
(e) All projections and all encroachments shall be kept and maintained in a safe, sound and non-hazardous
condition and in conformity with the provisions of this chapter or, where applicable, with the provisions of Chapter 3113. All corrodible materials shall be kept protected from corrosion by painting or shall be otherwise protected as approved by the Commissioner. All conditions which are declared unsafe or in violation of this chapter

of the property.
(g) No projection beyond a street or alley line and no encroachment on public property, shall be constructed
so as to interfere with trees on public property, or with street lamps, hydrants, trolley or utility poles or wires,
or other public installations, or with any required means of egress.
(h) Except as may be limited or restricted by specific regulations, the provisions of this chapter permitting
projections beyond the street or alley line shall apply also to projections on a public park or other permanent
open public space provided, however, that the provisions of this chapter permitting underground installations
between the street or alley line and the curb line, and the erection of marquees, fixed awnings, and entrance

ordinances or laws of Ohio or of the United States in connection with a previous parade or procession in or upon
the streets, parks, or public grounds of the City or elsewhere; or if by reason of the nature of the proposed parade
or procession or of the character and type of the objects to be promoted or for the following reasons:
(1) The time, place, size, or conduct of the parade including the assembly areas and route of march would
unreasonably interfere with the public convenience and safe use of the streets and highways.
(2) The parade would require the diversion of so great a number of police officers to properly police the line
of movement, assembly areas, and areas contiguous so as to deny normal police protection to the City.
(3) The parade route of march or assembly areas would unreasonably interfere with the movement of police
vehicles, fire-fighting equipment, or ambulance service to other areas of the City.
(4) The parade would unreasonably interfere with another parade for which a permit has been issued.
(5) The information contained in the application is found to be false, misleading, or incomplete in any material detail.
(6) An emergency such as a fire or storm would prevent the proper conduct of the parade.
(h) The permit may be revoked at any time by the Commissioner for the same reasons as those stated for
refusal of a permit, provided that notice of revocation shall immediately be given to the applicant and that an
appeal may be taken within the same time and in the manner provided in Section 403.09.

persons leaving vehicles with a valet parking attendant.
(b) On receipt of an application for a permit to establish a valet zone, and payment of a fee of one hundred
dollars ($100.00), the Commissioner of Assessments and Licenses shall transmit the application to the Director of
Public Service to determine if the area in question complies with the requirements of this section. The Director
of Public Service shall, within sixty (60) days of receipt of the application, notify the Commissioner of Assessments and Licenses whether the area complies with this section. On notification of compliance, the Commissioner of Assessments and License shall issue the permit on a form promulgated by the Commissioner for that purpose.

(d) Prior to the establishment of any zone, the Commissioner of Traffic Engineering shall conduct a study and
report the findings to the Director of Public Service together with recommendations as to the need for and the
advisability of creating the zone. The investigation shall consider all relevant traffic engineering considerations,
including without limitation the specific considerations identified in this division. Following the investigation,
the zone shall not be established if the Director of Public Service determines that any of the following are true:
(1) Establishing proposed zone would create or contribute to a traffic flow or traffic congestion problem.
(2) The proposed zone is in an area already experiencing traffic congestion, and there are adequate off-street
areas for standing or parking vehicles, and the proposed zone cannot be implemented without resolving, accommodating, or decreasing traffic congestion.
(3) The proposed zone is presently a restricted parking area, unless the investigation of the Commissioner of
Traffic Engineering reveals that it is desirable to lift or change the restriction.
(e) The establishment of a zone under this section shall be effective ten (10) days after publication of a notice
in the City Record and on the posting of signs sufficient in number and location to apprise the ordinarily observant person of the existence of the zone, and shall have the force and effect of law until rescinded by the Director of Public Service or until disapproved by ordinance of Council.
(f) The use of any zone established under this section shall be suspended on any street of the City which has
been closed under any lawful authority, including without limitation street closings made under Sections 133.09,

be violated by issuance of the permit, including without limitation, the following:

(2) use restrictions;

(1) In reviewing the application, the City Planning Commission or Landmarks Commission, as applicable, shall
determine the appropriateness of any vending devices proposed to be used with respect to the following factors:
A. physical condition and state or repair;

designated local design review advisory committee.

a short-term peddling permit for a particular location on two prior occasions in a given permit year, which shall
commence August 1 and end July 31 of the following year, then no person shall be issued a third or subsequent
short-term peddling permit for the same location in that permit year. As used in this division, a “particular location” shall mean a property or group of contiguous or noncontiguous properties, whether or not under common
ownership, which are under a common street address, both as to house or building number and street name.
