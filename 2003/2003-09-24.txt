An emergency resolution objecting to a New C2 Liquor Permit at
1250 East 105th Street.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Department of Liquor
Control of an application for a New
C2 Liquor Permit at A & B Randa,
Inc., DBA Family Discount, Inc.,
1250 East 105th Street, Cleveland,
Ohio
44108,
Permanent
Number
0000725; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor

Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the

to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or

2217

11
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation

An emergency resolution demanding an end to a health care system
that indisputably fails to provide
quality care to urban neighborhoods
and the uninsured poor in our city;
calling upon community leaders,
hospitals
and
medical
service
providers to respond quickly to this
health
care
crisis
by
working
together to create a comprehensive
plan to ensure that all citizens are
provided quality, affordable health
care; and reaffirming this Council’s
commitment to work with community leaders, hospitals, and medical
providers to address local health
care issues and possible solutions.
Whereas, the State of Ohio ranked
second in the nation in hospital closures in 2000; and

12
Whereas, in recent years, the City
of Cleveland has been affected by
the closure of St. Luke Hospital and
Mt. Sinai Hospital; and
Whereas, Huron Hospital recently
contemplated the closure of its trauma center and the closure of Deaconess Hospital is rumored to be
imminent; and
Whereas,
University
Hospitals
Health System hired a consultant to
review the future use of the St.
Michael Hospital facility but failed
to share the results of the study
with the community; and
Whereas, last week University
Hospitals Health System announced
that St. Michael Hospital will stop
providing
medical
services
on
December 19, 2003; and
Whereas, the future closing of St.
Michael Hospital is just the latest
consequence of an ineffective health
care system and yet another indication of the failure of our health care
system to meet the needs of the
uninsured poor; and
Whereas,
the
closing
of
St.
Michael Hospital will significantly
hinder the ability of local residents
to receive urgent medical services
and will have a significant impact
on the neighborhood, its residents
and the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas,
the
closing
of
St.
Michael Hospital indicates an obvious lack of concern by health care
officials and hospital administrators for the detrimental social and
economic consequences such a closing will have on the neighborhood;
and
Whereas, this announcement and
decision by University Hospitals
Health System is an ominous foreshadowing of what is to come in
this city and this country if we do
not confront the significant health
care issues affecting all cities and
communities in the United States;
and
Whereas, these health care issues
include a health care system that
fails to provide health care to all citizens, a system that is revenue driven, and a system that is burdened
with excessive administrative operating
costs,
including
insurance
costs; and
Whereas, the current health care
system has caused a disinvestment
by health care providers in urban
hospitals and medical centers and
thereby a disinvestment in care provided to residents in those urban
neighborhoods, including the uninsured poor; and
Whereas,
decisions
to
close
and/or decrease medical services in
urban hospitals further limits the
ability of indigent and uninsured
citizens to obtain quality health
care; and
Whereas, closing and/or decreasing medical services in urban hospitals causes neighborhoods, built
for years around such hospitals, to
deteriorate as businesses that relied
on the hospital close up and move
out, and people who live in the
neighborhoods are forced to seek
medical assistance farther away
from home, and
Whereas, hospital closures and
decreases in medical services in
urban areas create an increased burden on those hospitals that take on
the responsibility of providing medical care and services to every person in need; and

The City Record
Whereas, health care providers
have a moral and ethical responsibility to ensure that all citizens in
a community, whether insured or
not, receive quality health care;
and
Whereas, it is incumbent upon
hospitals and medical service providers to provide care to their fair
share of indigent and uninsured
patients in order to relieve hospitals
that are overburdened with those
patients; and
Whereas, it is incumbent upon
hospitals and medical service providers to cooperate to find solutions
by which all citizens are provided
decent, affordable health care; and
Whereas, these solutions could be
created by the drafting of a comprehensive plan coordinated by community leaders, hospitals, and medical service providers; and
Whereas, community leaders, hospitals, and medical service providers
must find a way to work together
to find a smarter and more efficient
way to provide health care services
to all residents of the City of Cleveland, including the uninsured poor,
in order to create a comprehensive
plan that would address the health
care needs of residents of the City
of Cleveland; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby demands an end to the current
health care system, a system that
indisputably fails to provide quality
health care to urban neighborhoods
and the uninsured poor.
Section 2. That this Council hereby calls upon community leaders,
hospitals,
and
medical
service
providers to respond quickly to the
current health care crisis by working together to create a comprehensive plan to ensure that all citizens
are
provided
quality,
affordable
heath care.
Section 3. That this Council hereby reaffirms its commitment to
work with community leaders, hospitals, and medical service providers
to address local health care issues
and possible solutions.
Section 4. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Senators
George Voinovich and Mike DeWine,
Representatives
Dennis
Kucinich
and Stephanie Tubbs Jones, Floyd
Loop, CEO, Cleveland Clinic, Terry
R. White, President and CEO, Metro
Health Medical Center and Thomas
Zenty, CEO, University Hospitals
Health Systems.
Section 5. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 1705-03.
By Council Member Jackson (by
departmental request).
An emergency resolution to adopt
and declare a Tax Budget for the
City of Cleveland for the year 2004
and submit it to the County Budget
Commission as required by State
Law, Chapter 5705 of the Revised
Code.
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council, under
the provisions of Chapter 5705 of the
Revised Code, after public hearings
as required by law, does adopt the
statements of the year 2004 requirements for the several funds of the
City of Cleveland as being the budget required by state law to be submitted to the County Budget Commission, which requirements are
contained in File No. 1705-03-A.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to certify a copy of

sure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted September 15, 2003.
Effective September 17, 2003.

Res. No. 1815-03.
By Council Member Cintron.
An emergency resolution opposing
any effort to prematurely end the
protective steel tariffs and urging
the Bush Administration to allow
the protective steel tariffs to continue in operation through their
original three year term.
Whereas, the proud tradition of
steelmaking is a vital part of our
community’s history and identity,
and our local economy is still largely linked to the steel industry as a
provider of quality jobs; and
Whereas, a thorough Section 201
investigation by the International
Trade Commission (“ITC”) concluded that American steel companies,
communities, families and other nonsteel manufacturing operations were
injured as a result of illegallydumped foreign steel, and the ITC
recommended immediate action by
the U.S. Department of Commerce to
curb the illegal dumping of foreign
steel in U.S. markets; and
Whereas, after receiving the ITC’s
report and carefully considering a
number of remedies, the Department
of Commerce and the Bush Administration took legal and just corrective action and instituted limited
tariffs on specific steel products for
a period of three years; and
Whereas, enactment of the tariffs
has slowed the illegal dumping of
foreign steel and allowed American
steelmakers and their employees to
partially recover from the crises
sparked in 1998 by illegally dumped
foreign steel; and
Whereas, if the steel industry is
to survive, recovery must be able to
continue; and
Whereas,
the
American
steel
industry is currently in a state of
wide-scale restructuring and consolidation that will eventually enable
the remaining American steel companies to compete effectively in an
increasingly
global
marketplace;
and
Whereas, this Council supports
the continuation of these protective
tariffs through their original three
year term and opposes any efforts
to end them prematurely; and
Whereas, premature ending of
these protective tariffs will have
devastating consequences in the
Cleveland area as many individuals,
families, and business rely on the
steel manufacturing industry and
related industries for jobs and business; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

2229

Section 1. That the Council hereby opposes any effort to prematurely end the protective steel tariffs,
instituted after an investigation by
the ITC, and urges the Bush Administration to allow the protective
steel tariffs to continue in operation

term.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to President
George W. Bush and the United
States Secretary of Commerce.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted September 15, 2003.
Effective September 17, 2003.

Res. No. 1818-03.
By Council Members Gordon, Jackson, Reed, White, Coats and Jones.
An emergency resolution recognizing the important and vital role
of Section 8 vouchers in providing
low income individuals and families,
including families with children,
with housing opportunities; expressing Council’s support of the Section
8 voucher program and Council’s
concern that individuals and families, including families with children, will be forced into homelessness if there is a loss of Section 8
vouchers; and encouraging the Ohio
Congressional delegation to support
full funding for the United States
Department of HUD Section 8 voucher program.
Whereas, 5.4 million households in
the United States are in worst case
housing or are paying more than
30% of their income on housing
costs according to the United States
Department of Housing and Urban
Development (“HUD”); and
Whereas, 3.5 million households in
the United States will experience
homelessness this year and 1.35 million of those people will be children
according to the Urban Institute;
and
Whereas, in the City of Cleveland,
50% of the approximately 101,000
rental households pay more than
30% of their income for rent, and
25% pay more than 50% of their
income on rent; and

The City Record
Whereas, in Cuyahoga County, an
extremely low income household
(earning $18,000 per year, 30% of
the Area median income of $60,000
per year ) can afford a monthly rent
of no more than $450, while the Fair
Market Rent for a two bedroom
apartment is $748/month, and
Whereas, it would take 112 hours
of work a week for a household living on minimum wage to be able to
properly afford a 2 bedroom apartment, and
Whereas, a recipient of SSI (receiving
$593/month)
can
afford
monthly rent no more than $178,
while the fair market rent for a onebedroom unit is $603 according to the
United States Department of Housing and Urban Development; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
Consolidated Plan and Cuyahoga
County Continuum of Care recognizes the needs for affordable housing units and the need for additional funding resources; and
Whereas, the United States Congressional Budget Office has estimated
that
given
the
current
resources being proposed by the
United States Senate, there will be
the loss of approximately 100,000
Section 8 vouchers for families currently utilizing them; and
Whereas, the United States Congressional Budget Office has estimated
that
given
the
current
resources being proposed by the
United States House of Representatives, there will be the loss of
approximately
63,000
Section
8
vouchers for families currently utilizing them; and
Whereas, this loss of Section 8
vouchers will leave many individuals and families, including families
with children, without access to
affordable housing; and
Whereas, this loss of Section 8
vouchers will force many individuals and families, including families
with children, onto the streets and
into a life of homelessness; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has reported 17 straight years of
increases in homelessness, and the
U.S. Census reported the homeless
shelter population at 120% of capacity in April of 2000; and
Whereas, this Council has continually supported the need and right
of its citizens to live in safe, decent,
fair, accessible and affordable housing, and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
the important and vital role that
Section
8
vouchers
provide
in
enabling low income individuals and
families to afford housing; and
Whereas, this Council is concerned that the projected reductions
in Section 8 vouchers will increase
the number of homeless individuals
and
families,
including
families
with children; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council recognizes the important and vital role
of Section 8 vouchers in providing
low income individuals and families,
including families with children,
with housing opportunities.

2230

September 24, 2003
Section 2. That this Council is supportive of the Section 8 voucher program and is concerned that individuals and families, including families
with children, currently assisted by
Section 8 vouchers will be forced
into homelessness if there is a loss
of Section 8 vouchers.
Section 3. That this Council reaffirms the importance and need for
affordable
housing
and
hereby
encourages all members of the Ohio
Congressional Delegation to support
the full funding necessary to ensure
that the HUD Section 8 program
operates at full capacity.

copies of this resolution to U.S. Senator Michael DeWine, U.S. Senator
George Voinovich, Congresswoman
Stephanie Tubbs Jones, Congressman Dennis Kucinich, Congressman

Section 5. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency

all the members elected to Council,

immediately upon its adoption and
