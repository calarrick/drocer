departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Finance, on
behalf of the Cleveland Municipal
Court, to apply for and accept a
grant from the Office of Criminal
Justice Services for the Cleveland
Municipal Court Soliciting/Prostitution Program, Project HOPE.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Finance, on behalf of the Cleveland
Municipal Court, is authorized to
apply for and accept a grant in the
amount of $41,403, from the Office of
Criminal Justice Services to conduct
the Cleveland Municipal Court Soliciting/Prostitution Program, Project
HOPE; that the Director of Finance
is authorized to file all papers and
execute all documents necessary to
receive the funds under the grant;
and that the funds are appropriated
for the purposes set forth in the
application for the grant contained
in the file described below.
Section 2. That the application for

matching funds from Fund No. 01011501-639905, is approved in all
respects.
Section 3. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all

Referred to Directors of Finance,
Law; Committee on Finance.
Ord. No. 228-03.
By Council Member Jackson (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Finance, on
behalf of the Cleveland Municipal
Court, to enter into contract with
the Cuyahoga County Public Defender Commission for legal services
necessary
to
defend
indigents
charged with violation of ordinances
of the City of Cleveland, provided
such violation may result in incarceration, for the Cleveland Municipal Court, for a period of one year.
Whereas, in Argersinger v. Hamlin and Scott v. Illinois, the United
States Supreme Court held that no
indigent criminal defendant may be
sentenced to a term of imprisonment
unless he has been afforded the
right to assistance of appointed
counsel in his defense; and

February 26, 2003
Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
through the Cleveland Municipal
Court, is therefore obligated to provide an indigent defendant appointed counsel in order to permit the
imposition of a sentence including a
term of imprisonment; and
Whereas,
pursuant
to
Section
120.14 of the Ohio Revised Code, a
county commission which has organized a county public defender commission may contract with any
municipal corporation within the
County served by the county public
defender to provide such legal representation on behalf of the municipal corporation; and
Whereas, it is the recommendation
of the Cleveland Municipal Court,
the district of which encompasses
Bratenahl and the City of Cleveland,
that such indigent defense should be
provided by the Cuyahoga County
Public Defender Commission, who
will in turn, enter into an agreement
with the Legal Aid Society of Cleveland to provide these services; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Finance, on behalf of the Cleveland
Municipal Court, is hereby authorized to enter into contract with the
Cuyahoga County Public Defender
Commission for legal services necessary to defend indigents charged
with violation of ordinances of the
City of Cleveland, provided such violation may result in incarceration,
for the period of one year beginning
January 1, 2003, at an estimated cost
of $1,300,000. (RL 128133)
Section 2. That two percent (2%)

An emergency ordinance to enact
Sections 189A.01 to 189A.05 of the
Codified Ordinances of the City of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, relating to
Slavery Era Business and Corporate
Insurance Disclosure Law.
Whereas,
recent
investigations
suggest that many early American
industries
substantially
profited
from the commerce generated by the
uncompensated labor of enslaved
Americans; and
Whereas, such industries include
the insurance industry, the financial
industry, the textile industry, the
tobacco industry, the railroad industry, the shipping industry, the rice
industry, and the sugar industry;
and
Whereas, insurance policies from
the slavery era have recently been
discovered in the archives of several insurance companies; and
Whereas, such insurance policies
document insurance coverage to
slaveholders for bodily injury or
death of their slaves and these policies were issued by predecessor
insurance companies; and
Whereas, these insurance documents provide evidence of ill-gotten
profits from slavery and these illgotten profits in part capitalized
businesses whose successors remain
in existence today; and
Whereas, many citizens of Cleveland are descendants of slaves and
their ancestors were defined as private property, dehumanized, divided
from their families, forced to perform labor without appropriate compensation or benefits, and the owners of these slaves profited through
investments or were compensated
for bodily injury or death of their
slaves by insurers; and
Whereas, the descendants of these
slaves are entitled to full disclosure;
and
Whereas, appropriate compensation to Africans for their labor
would have assisted their descendants in lifting them out of a dependent, non-competitive and impoverished lifestyle; and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
the importance of full and accurate
disclosure; and
Whereas, this Council has determined that any business entity, corporation, partnership, firm, individual or company doing business with
the City of Cleveland shall be
required, in good faith, to disclose
any records within their possession
or knowledge relating to investments or profits from the slave
industry including insurance policies issued to slaveholders that provided coverage in the event of bodily injury or death to their slaves;
and
