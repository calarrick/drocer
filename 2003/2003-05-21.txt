FIRST READING EMERGENCY

Ord. No. 884-03.
By Council Member Jackson (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the purchase by one or more
requirement contracts of hand tools
and hand-held power tools, for the
various divisions of City government.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Finance is authorized to make one
or more written requirement contracts under the Charter and the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, for the requirements for
the term of one year or two years
for the necessary items of hand
tools and hand-held power tools in
the approximate amount as purchased during the preceding term,
purchased by the Commissioner of
Purchases and Supplies upon a unit
basis for the various divisions of
City government. Bids shall be
taken in a manner that permits an
award to be made for all items as
a single contract, or by separate
contract for each or any combination of the items as the Board of
Control determines. Alternate bids
for a period less than the specified
term may be taken if desired by the
Commissioner of
Purchases and
Supplies until provision is made for
the requirements for the entire
term.
The
Director
Finance
is
authorized to enter into one or more
contracts with a term of two years
instead of one year when there is
a financial advantage to the City.
For purposes of this ordinance, a
financial advantage shall be determined by the Director of Finance
by comparing the bids received for
both terms.
Section 2. That the costs of the
contract
or
contracts

be
charged against the proper appro-

1058

under
a
requisition
against the contract or contracts
certified
by
the
Director
of
Finance. (RL 104761)
Section 3. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

RESTATED
GENERAL AGREEMENT
BETWEEN
THE GREATER CLEVELAND REGIONAL TRANSIT AUTHORITY
AND
THE CITY OF CLEVELAND

on September 11, 2000, and Ord. No.______________ passed by the Council of the City of Cleveland on
___________________ 2003.
RECITALS
The Euclid Corridor Transportation Project (“ECTP”) is comprised of the following elements:
• Euclid Avenue Bus Rapid Transit (“BRT”) Improvements
• Transit Zone Improvements
• East Side Transit Center (“ESTC”)
GCRTA, as the Federal Transit Administration (“FTA”) grant recipient for ECTP, will serve as the lead agency
responsible for administering the grant and reporting to FTA; and
The successful implementation of ECTP will require significant modifications to the public rights-of-way controlled by CITY, and CITY’s participation in the coordination and development of this project is imperative to
insure success; and
The ECTP has a $246 million budget and CITY and GCRTA are both committed to meeting that budget. The
CITY, in cooperation with the Ohio Department of Transportation (“ODOT”), has completed the design and construction of an integrated downtown signal system with which the ECTP shall be compatible in design and operation to the extent practicable; and
It is the intent of this Agreement to establish general guidelines between GCRTA and CITY with respect to
the financing, duties, responsibilities, and rights of each party during the design, construction, and operational
phases of ECTP, in order that ECTP may be defined, designed, constructed, operated, and maintained within the
City of Cleveland; and
The construction and operation of ECTP as contemplated will contribute directly and continuously to the economy of Greater Cleveland and its surrounding region to the general benefit of its citizens and to the welfare of
the State of Ohio and its citizens; and
GCRTA and CITY anticipate that the operation of ECTP will achieve travel-time savings and more frequent
service, and GCRTA and CITY acknowledge and agree that such travel-time savings and more frequent service
are essential ingredients in the ECTP’s benefits to the CITY. Both parties agree to cooperate and use their best
efforts to permanently maintain such travel time savings and service levels; and
CITY and GCRTA understand that certain phases of the ECTP will extend beyond the boundaries of the City
of Cleveland and that such extensions are essential to the continuity and integrity of the ECTP; and
Under the authority of Section 3, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution, as well as Ohio Revised Code Section
723.01, the CITY has the power to regulate the use of the rights-of-way of Euclid Avenue, West 3rd Street, East
12th Street, East 13th Street, East 17th Street, East 18th Street, East 21st Street, East 22nd Street, Prospect Avenue,
Chester Avenue, Superior Avenue, and St. Clair Avenue; and

E. Reconfiguration of on-street parking;
F. Development of an Operations Plan and specifications for unique vehicles that are anticipated to be sixty
(60) foot low-floor, articulated, environmentally friendly vehicles with doors permitting both left- and right-side
boarding. The exact number of vehicles and propulsion system design will be determined during final design;
G. Preparation of a detailed plan for the protection and maintenance of vehicle and pedestrian traffic during
the construction of bus and roadway improvements. Consideration will be given to phasing some or all of the
roadway work to minimize safety conflicts with regular daytime traffic. The plan must provide safe access to
stakeholders and their invitees in the project area during construction, including, but not limited to, using directional signs, barriers and the like; and
H. Bicycle lanes as indicated in the 60% design drawings.
2. Transit Zone Improvements

Clair Avenue, Prospect Avenue, West 3rd Street, and East 22nd Street in downtown Cleveland to provide for
expanded, highly visible transit operations in the Central Business District, to allow for convenient transfer
between transit routes for regional travel, and to bring all curb-ramps in the Transit Zone into national ADA
compliance. The Transit Zone Improvements include:
A. St. Clair Avenue: Rehabilitation of the roadway composed of bus lanes and travel lanes for other vehicles
to facilitate the creation of a curbside peak-hours reserved transit lane in each direction between West 3rd Street
and East 13th Street to minimize conflicts between private vehicles and transit vehicles, and to minimize the routine operating and maintenance costs of the designated bus lanes and other vehicular travel lanes;
B. Superior Avenue: Rehabilitation of the roadway composed of both bus lanes and travel lanes for other vehicles to facilitate the creation of a curbside 24-hour exclusive transit lane between West 3rd Street and East 18th
Street, with curb-cuts to permit stakeholder deliveries as defined in the 60% design documents, to minimize conflicts between private vehicles and transit vehicles, and to minimize the routine operating and maintenance costs
of the designated bus lanes and other vehicular travel lanes;
C. Chester Avenue: Rehabilitation of the roadway pavement between East 12th Street and East 17th Street;
D. East 12th Street: Rehabilitation of the southbound roadway pavement between Superior Avenue and Chester
Avenue;
E. East 13th Street: Rehabilitation of the roadway pavement between Superior Avenue and Chester Avenue;

the Prospect Avenue and East 21st Street intersection, which includes:
A. The ESTC will serve as a transportation hub where customers can make convenient connections between
local, circulator, intercommunity, regional, and downtown bus service. The consolidation of these routes provides
an enhancement of transit service coverage by interfacing routes that were not previously connected. Transfer
between routes is facilitated by timed arrivals and departures. The ESTC also allows coordination of RTA services with those provided by other transit systems. The construction of the ESTC will eliminate the need in the
area for on-street bus layovers and increase pedestrian access.
B. This facility will include a climate-controlled building providing a passenger waiting area, driver’s restrooms,
communications and security area, concession area, janitor’s room, transit police sub-station, mechanical room and
storage area. The building will have a footprint of approximately 5000 square feet. A layover area for 12 to 16
- 40' buses will be located adjacent to the building.
C. There is a possibility of joint development in conjunction with this facility. The design will be flexible to
include the possible development of housing, office space, commercial, retail or structured parking with escalator and/or elevator access. All such joint development will be constructed by other entities above the proposed
ESTC location.

Form of Deed
OFFICIAL QUITCLAIM DEED
1. On _______________________, the Council of the City of Cleveland passed Ordinance No. ______________, attached
hereto as Exhibit “A” and incorporated herein by reference, authorizing the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies to sell certain City-owned real property.
2. On August 28, 1996, the Board of Control of the City of Cleveland adopted Resolution No. _____________,
attached hereto as Exhibit “B” and incorporated herein by reference, authorizing the Commissioner of Purchases
and Supplies to proceed with sale to the Grantee named below upon payment of the consideration stated below.
NOW, THEREFORE, the CITY OF CLEVELAND, a municipal corporation in the State of Ohio (the “City”), for
the consideration of $1.00 and other valuable consideration, grants and quitclaims to ____________________, its successors and assigns (the “Grantee”) whose tax mailing address is _____________________, the real property described
in Exhibit “C” attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference (the “Property”).
This conveyance is made, notwithstanding the fact that valuable consideration has been paid, upon the express
condition subsequent that Grantee shall perform the following obligations, pursuant to an Interagency Agreement
between Grantor and Grantee dated ________________ (hereinafter “Agreement”):
(1) Within twenty-four (24) months of the date of the execution of this Deed by the Mayor, commence
construction of the _______________, described more fully in Exhibit “D”, attached hereto and incorporated by reference (the “Improvements”); and
(2) Within five (5) years of the date of the execution of this Deed, complete construction of the Improvements.

If Grantee defaults in or violates any one or more of the obligations set forth above, and fails to cure such
default or violation within thirty (30) days after written notice of default by the City, then the City shall have
the right at its option, to re-enter and take possession of the Property and to terminate (and revest in the City)
the estate conveyed by this Deed, pursuant to Section 6 of the Agreement; provided, however, that the conditions
subsequent created herein and any revesting of title as a result thereof shall always be subject to and limited
by, and shall not defeat, render invalid or limit in any way, the lien of any mortgagee financing the contraction
of Improvements to the Property. Grantee agrees that all Improvements shall attach immediately and become a
part of the Property, and that if City exercises its right of re-entry all right, title and interest in and to the
Improvements shall immediately vest in the City and Grantee shall have no claim for contribution or reimbursement
for the Improvements.
City’s right of re-entry and repossession of the Sale Parcel shall terminate upon Completion of Construction of
the Improvements in satisfaction of the requirements of the Agreement. Within fourteen (14) days of Completion
of Construction of the Improvements, City shall issue a certificate in recordable form stating that construction
has been completed in satisfaction of the requirements of the Agreement, and that City no longer possesses a
right of re-entry.
Grantee and City agree that the obligations of Grantee set forth herein shall also constitute covenants running
with the land of the Property both as to burdens and benefits. The City’s failure to exercise the right of re-entry
reserved herein shall not be construed to waive any rights the City may have to enforce Grantee’s obligations
through any and all rights and remedies which the City or its successors and assigns may have at law or in
equity for the enforcement of covenants. No waiver by the City at any time of any of Grantee’s obligations shall
be deemed or taken as a waiver at any time thereafter of the same or any other obligations of the strict and
prompt performance thereof. No waiver shall be valid against the City unless reduced to writing and signed by
an officer of the City duly empowered to execute same.
This conveyance is made further subject to the covenant that Grantee not use, or permit the use of, the Property
or any structure erected or to be erected thereon, for billboards or other outdoor advertising devices. City and
Grantee agree that violation of said covenant shall not entitle City to re-enter and take possession of Property
or otherwise terminate the estate conveyed to Grantee by this Deed.
The Property is conveyed to Grantee “as is.”
The City specifically reserves, and this conveyance is made expressly subject to, any easements of record in
favor of the City and in addition thereto such easements as are necessary for public utilities (including without
limitation, sanitary and storm sewers, electric, telephone and other transmission lines, cables, gas and water lines)
presently located on the Property.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the City, by its Mayor on ____________________ and its Commissioner of Purchases
and Supplies on ____________________ has caused this instrument to be executed, and Grantee has accepted this
instrument, as evidenced by its duly authorized officer’s execution of Grantee’s Acceptance, set forth below.

Res. No. 911-03.
By Council Members Dolan and
Jones.
An emergency resolution encouraging the Ohio state legislature to
pass a law making .08 for blood
alcohol content the standard for driving under the influence of alcohol.
Whereas, in December, 1998, the
President sought to make a .08
blood alcohol content a national
standard and announced that states
would receive federal transportation
money when they lowered the limit
to .08 for drunk-driving; and
Whereas,
two
years
later,
30
states, including Ohio, still had not
lowered their limits for drunk-driving; and
Whereas, Congress then stated
that any state that does not pass a
.08 law by October 1, 2003, will face
a reduction in federal highway funding; and
Whereas, the State of Ohio still
has not passed a law adopting .08
as the standard for drunk-driving;
and
Whereas, if Ohio fails to pass
such a law, it will lose 2% of its
highway money in 2004; which
amount will increase by 2% per

The City Record
year until it reaches the maximum
of 8% in 2007; and
Whereas, this amounts to tens of
millions of dollars potentially lost to
the State of Ohio by 2007; and
Whereas arguably, passing a .08
law could save 500 lives annually;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby encourages the Ohio state legislature to pass a law making .08 for
blood alcohol content the standard
for driving under the influence of
alcohol.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby directed to transmit copies of

An emergency resolution declaring this Council’s support of the
City’s efforts to upgrade its traffic
signal system and equipment.
Whereas, traffic signal technology
has advanced significantly in recent
years; and
Whereas, these advancements include the ability to adjust signals in
response to the number of vehicles
on the road, the ability to link one
traffic light to another, and the ability to adjust signals with a computer; and
Whereas, upgrading traffic signals and instituting new technology
to monitor and control traffic signals will result in fewer traffic
delays, better traffic progression,
and improved air quality; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
Division of Traffic Engineering, is in
the process of upgrading its traffic
signal system and equipment; and
Whereas, the Commissioner of
Traffic Engineering has indicated
that the goal is to establish a citywide traffic signal system that
could be monitored and controlled
from City Hall; and
Whereas, this Council is supportive of these efforts; and
Whereas, there may be federal
funding available to assist the City
of Cleveland in its efforts to improve
its traffic signal system; and
Whereas, this Council encourages
the Director of Public Service and
Commissioner of Traffic Engineering to research and apply for any
grants that may be available to

Mayo
County
Parish of Achill, Ireland.
Whereas, Achill Parish, located in
County Mayo, Ireland, is known for

one of the world’s finest fishing
regions; and
Whereas, over 85% of the 250,000
Irish in Greater Cleveland trace

of Achill; and
Whereas, many of the Mayo County Achill Parish Irish originally settled in “Irish bend”, along the Cuyahoga River, south of Detroit and

Whereas, representatives of the
City of Cleveland and Mayo County
Achill Parish have expressed interest in an active exchange of culture,

By Council Members Westbrook,

An emergency resolution opposing
the proposed state budget cuts to
the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources, affecting services for
state parks including those in the
Cleveland area, such as Edgewater
Park, Euclid Beach Park, Wildwood
Park, and Gordon Park.
Whereas, Ohio’s state parks are
an important source of recreation
for the majority of Ohioans and
have a profound effect on Ohio’s
economy, with overnight visitors
spending $265 million dollars in the
state parks and local communities,
helping to generate $21.9 million
and $20.8 million in state and local
taxes, respectively; and
Whereas, Ohio State Parks System
consistently ranks near the top of
the nation’s state park systems in
terms of visitation, number of parks
and acreage, facilities and revenues
generated; and
Whereas, the Ohio House version
of the state budget requires signifi-

The City Record
cant cuts to the budget of the
Department of Natural Resources
(DNR), affecting Ohio’s state parks,
nature preserves and the management of state and private forests;
and
Whereas, among other things, the
House DNR budget eliminates the
Civilian Conservation Corps, a program that has provided nearly 1.9
million worth of labor for special
projects and conservation work to
Ohio State Parks and other department divisions; and
Whereas, the work done by the
CCC now must be absorbed by the
DNR’s bottom line and will impact
the department’s ability to provide
quality recreational service; and
Whereas, the House budget does
not provide funding for the Division
of Wildlife’s central support costs,
causing other divisions to absorb
those costs; and
Whereas, the House budget fails
to take into account normal inflationary costs; and
Whereas, taking the above into
account, the DNR’s budget actually
declines 2.4% in 2004 and increases
by 2.8% in 2005, which increase
barely covers the costs of collective
bargaining agreements; and
Whereas, Ohio State Parks has
already been streamlining its operations in that full-time permanent
staff has been cut 17% over the past
three years; 29 of 74 state parks are
now operated as satellites to larger
parks in the region; and only 45
state parks have an on-site park
manager; and
Whereas, these latest budget cuts
will likely cause additional fee
increases for camping, cottages and
docks, the temporary closing of
some parks, significantly fewer seasonal employees, reduced educational and other programs, reduced law
enforcement presence, reduced mowing,
restroom
cleaning,
trash
removal and building maintenance;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby opposes the proposed state budget cuts to the Ohio Department of
Natural Resources, affecting services for state parks including those
in the Cleveland area, such as Edgewater Park, Euclid Beach Park,
Wildwood Park, and Gordon Park.

Bob Taft and to the appropriate

DBA Buckeye Sunoco, 8805 Buckeye

8805 Buckeye Road, Cleveland, Ohio
44104, Permanent Number 2455390;
and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local

May 21, 2003
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation

Res. No. 836-03.
By Council Members Dolan, Jackson,
Reed,
White,
Britt,
Coats,
Brady, Gordon, O’Malley, Rybka.
An
emergency
resolution
condemning the elected and administrative leadership of Butler, Georgia, and the student leadership at
Taylor County High School for holding a “white only” prom and further
condemning
those
administrators
and other public officials in Georgia
for failing to speak out against the
injustice and cruelty of such discriminatory and unacceptable behavior.
Whereas, on May 2, 2003, Taylor
County High School in Butler, Georgia held a junior prom for white students only; and
Whereas, this event was held offcampus, considered a private party
but was, nevertheless, organized
within a public school and billed as
Taylor High School’s junior prom;
and
Whereas, the principal of Taylor
High refused to comment publicly
about the prom; the superintendent
dismissed the event as “legal”; the
governor of Georgia stated only that
he was “disappointed”; and
Whereas, this type of segregated
event,
condoned
by
the
virtual
silence of the public school’s administrators and the governor of Georgia, is outrageous and reprehensible
in the United States in the 21st century; and
Whereas, a purposefully segregated school event in the year 2003 is
absolutely
unacceptable,
unconscionable and unjustifiable; and
Whereas, those that were involved
in the organizing of such an event,
and those who stood by and allowed
the event to go on without so much
as a question about the nature of
the event, should themselves be condemned as ignorant, irresponsible
and, even, amoral; and
Whereas, allowing a public school
event that excludes students on the
basis of skin color, ethnicity, or religion sends a very damaging and
damning message to all students in
the United States because of their
differences; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby condemns the elected and administrative leadership of Butler, Georgia, and the student leadership at
Taylor County High School for holding a “white only” prom and further
condemns those administrators and
other public officials in Georgia for
failing to speak out against the
injustice and cruelty of such discriminatory and unacceptable behavior.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Jackson,
Gordon, Westbrook, Reed, Conwell,
Scott, Jones, Coats, Lewis, Brady,
Britt, Cimperman, Cintron, Dolan,
Johnson, O’Malley, Polensek, Rybka,
Sweeney, White and Zone.
An emergency resolution opposing
any action by the Ohio General Assembly that would attempt to prohibit a political subdivision from requiring its employees, as a condition
of employment, to live in any specific area; supporting the decision of
the citizens of the City of Cleveland
to establish a residency requirement
for employees of the City of Cleveland; considering passage of any legislation by the State Legislature
attempting to prohibit this type of
residency requirement as unconstitutional and contrary to the principles
and spirit of American democracy.
Whereas, the Ohio Constitution
grants municipalities the authority
to adopt and amend a charter for its
government; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland is
a charter municipality; and
Whereas, as a charter municipality, the City of Cleveland may exercise under the charter all powers of
local self government; and
Whereas, such powers include the
power to require City residency as
a condition of employment; and
Whereas, in 1982, the Charter of
the City of Cleveland was amended
by the citizens of the City of Cleveland to require that employees of
the City be bona fide residents of
the City and remain as such during
their terms of employment; and
Whereas, in amending the Charter
of the City of Cleveland to require
City residency as a condition of
employment, the citizens of the City
of Cleveland exercised their constitutional right to establish residency
as a condition of employment; and
Whereas, pending House Bill 114
attempts to prohibit political subdivisions from requiring its employees, as a condition of employment,
to reside in any specific area; and
Whereas, House Bill 114 is clearly unconstitutional as it is in direct
conflict with a municipality’s home
rule powers; and
Whereas, House Bill 114 is also
contrary to the principles and spirit
of American democracy in that the
citizens of a municipality have the
democratic power to adopt a charter
and exercise all powers of local selfgovernment, including the power to
require City employees to reside
within the City limits; and
Whereas, this Council is opposed
to any action by the Ohio General
Assembly that would attempt to prohibit a political subdivision from
requiring its employees, as a condition of employment, to live in any
specific area; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
strongly opposes any action by the
Ohio General Assembly that would
attempt to prohibit a political subdivision from requiring its employees, as a condition of employment,
to live in any specific area.
Section 2. That this Council supports the decision of the citizens of
the City of Cleveland to establish a
residency requirement for employees
of the City of Cleveland.

An emergency ordinance to amend Section 337.031 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended
by Ordinance No. 552-96, passed June 10, 1996, relating to townhouse districts.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 337.031 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended by Ordinance
No. 552-96, passed June 10, 1996 is hereby amended to read as follows:
Section 337.031 Townhouse (RA) Districts
(a) Purpose. Townhouse Districts (i.e., Residential Attached districts) are established to provide sites for low-rise
development of attached residential units at medium to high densities. Such developments are intended to serve as
a transition between areas of detached residences and areas of higher intensity development or to serve as a means
of clustering housing units on sites which can be developed most appropriately through such clustering.
(b) Definitions. A “townhouse unit” is a single dwelling unit, situated at ground level, served by its own
exclusive exterior entrance, and attached to one or more other such units by fire walls or fire separation walls.
A “townhouse building” is a building composed of two or more townhouse units. The terms “townhouse” and “row
house” shall have the same meaning unless otherwise indicated.
(c) Permitted Uses. In a Townhouse District, permitted uses are limited to townhouse buildings and all main
and accessory uses permitted and as regulated in Two-Family Districts. However, notwithstanding the provisions
of Section 355.05 regarding existing lots of record, lots established for development of attached residences shall
not be developed or redeveloped for detached residences unless such lots meet all prevailing regulations applicable
to the development of detached residences.
(d) Ownership. Townhouse units may be in condominium ownership, where two or more units are located on
a single lot, or in a type of ownership where each unit is located on a separate lot. Each townhouse development shall conform to the regulations applicable to its form of ownership.
(e) District Establishment. The following Townhouse Districts are hereby established: RA-1, RA-2, and RA-3
(with the abbreviation “RA” indicating “Residential, Attached” and the numerals indicating that the districts are
listed in order of “density,” from lowest to highest).
(f) Site Planning and Design. No Building Permit shall be issued for the original construction of a townhouse
unit or townhouse building without approval of the City Planning Commission, which shall seek to ensure that
the development meets the following standards of site planning and architectural design.
(1) Compatibility. The development shall be visually compatible with nearby properties with respect to such
design elements as scale, height, setback, orientation to existing streets, open spaces, roof lines, architectural
style, materials, colors, and proportions of architectural features. Furthermore, the development shall not adversely
affect the use of nearby properties with respect to such factors as pedestrian and vehicular access, privacy, safety, and obstructions to light and air.
(2) Site Layout. Buildings, structures and landscape features shall be arranged so as to create visual interest,
avoid monotony, maximize privacy, conserve natural features, minimize the need for grading, provide for usable
areas of common and private open space, facilitate efficient vehicular and pedestrian circulation, and promote
security and personal safety.
(3) Building Design. Townhouse units shall be designed so as to create visual interest and differentiate individual units through variations in roof lines, wall setbacks and building materials or through use of porches, bay
windows, and other projecting elements. Garages shall be placed to the rear of the residential units or, if located in the front of units, shall be designed and placed in a manner which reduces their visual prominence.
(4) Circulation and Parking. Circulation and parking shall be designed in a manner which provides proper access
for service and safety vehicles, minimizes conflicts between pedestrians. and vehicles, minimizes the number of
curb cuts onto major streets, avoids placing excessive traffic on local residential streets, avoids unenclosed parking
in front yards, and avoids placement of garage doors so close to sidewalks as to impair pedestrian safety.
(g) Area and Yard Regulations. The following yard and area regulations shall apply to townhouse developments in RA-1, RA-2, and RA-3 Districts and in other zoning districts which permit townhouse development. All
figures are minimum requirements unless otherwise stated. The City Planning Commission may require greater
restrictions as necessary to meet the standards of division (f). For main buildings other than townhouses and
for accessory uses and structures, regulations of the Two-Family District shall apply.

and/or scenic enjoyment by the residents of the townhouse development, as determined by the City Planning Commission. Common open space shall not include driveways, parking areas or structures other than those structures
devoted to recreational use. The applicant shall provide, to the Commissioner of Building and Housing, evidence
of legally enforceable mechanisms to ensure perpetual preservation of such land as common open space and to
ensure proper maintenance.
(i) Easements for Zero Lot Line Buildings. Where the City Planning Commission determines that provision of
an easement is necessary to ensure proper access, light and air to a building placed directly on a lot line, the
Commission may require provision of such easement as a condition of the issuance of a Building Permit for construction of the zero-lot-line building. The easement shall be shown on the recorded plat and incorporated into
each deed transferring title to the property.
(j) Variations from Area and Yard Regulations. The Board of Zoning Appeals may approve variations from
area and yard regulations applicable to townhouse developments if the Board determines that such variations are
necessary to achieve an appropriate development of the site and that such variations will not result in safety or
health hazards and will not be injurious to the use or value of nearby properties. In making such a determination,
the Board shall consider a recommendation made by the City Planning Commission on the basis of the site plan
and design review conducted in accordance with the provisions of division (f) of this section.
(k) Homeowners Association. Any townhouse development of three or more units, even those not located in
Townhouse Districts, consisting of individual townhouse units situated on separate parcels of land shall establish a homeowners association to ensure coordination of exterior alterations and maintenance. The homeowners
association shall, at a minimum, have authority to review and approve all exterior alterations to the buildings
and the property comprising the townhouse development. The homeowner’s association may determine the scope
of the exterior alterations that must be reviewed. A draft of the homeowners association declaration of restrictions shall be submitted to the Director of the City Planning Commission for review and approval at the time of
application for a building permit. The Director of the City Planning Commission shall review the declaration of
restrictions of the homeowners association to ensure that the minimum requirements of this section are met. A
declaration of restrictions of the homeowners association shall be filed and recorded with the Cuyahoga County
Recorder’s Office and evidence of such filing and recording shall be submitted to the Director of Building and
Housing prior to the issuance of an initial Certificate of Occupancy by the City.
Section 2. That existing Section 337.031 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended by
