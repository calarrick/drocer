brace for another bitterly cold winter; and

able to reconnect their service for a
minimal fee; and

An emergency resolution urging
the Campbell administration to investigate the rash of private hospitals closing in this city, to investigate possible violations by such hospitals of Chapter 686 of the Codified
Ordinances of the City of Cleveland,
and to investigate possible antirust
violations by University Hospitals
Health Systems and the Cleveland
Clinic Foundation.
Whereas, in September, 2003, St.
Michael’s
Hospital
announced
it
would stop providing medical services on December 19, 2003; and
Whereas, this imminent closure
will effect thousands of City residents, including those most in need
of health care services; and
Whereas, in recent years, the city
of Cleveland has been affected by
the closure of St. Luke Hospital and
Mt. Sinai Hospital; and
Whereas, on Friday, November
28, 2003, Deaconess Hospital suddenly transferred its patients and
closed its doors, in apparent violation of Chapter 686 of the Codified
Ordinances of the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, Chapter 686 of the Codified Ordinances of the City requires
a 90 day notice to the City prior to
any reductions in or significant
operational
changes
to
hospital
facilities or services; and
Whereas, the sudden and unannounced closing of Deaconess Hospital is just the latest consequence
of an ineffective health care system
and yet another indication of the
failure of our health care system to
meet the needs of the residents of
our city, including the uninsured
and the underinsured; and
Whereas, it is apparent that the
two major hospital systems in this
city, University Hospitals Health
System and The Cleveland Clinic
Foundation, monopolize the provision of health care services in Cleveland to the detriment of community
based hospitals and the people they
serve; and
Whereas, it is incumbent upon the
Campbell administration to investigate these actions to ensure that
residents of the city continue to
receive adequate health care services; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the Campbell administration to investigate the rash of private hospitals closing in this city, to
investigate possible violations by
such hospitals of Chapter 686 of the
Codified Ordinances of the City of
Cleveland, and to investigate possible antitrust violations by University Hospitals Health System and the
Cleveland Clinic Foundation.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
Dr. George Saad, CEO, Deaconess
Hospital, Floyd Loop, CEO, Cleveland Clinic, Thomas Zenty, University Hospitals Health System.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency

2001, is amended to read as follows:
Section 343.23 Pedestrian Retail
Overlay (PRO) District
(a) Purpose. The Pedestrian Retail Overlay (PRO) District is established to maintain the economic viability of older neighborhood shopping districts by preserving the
pedestrian-oriented character of those
districts and to protect public safety by minimizing conflicts between
vehicles and pedestrians in neighborhood shopping districts.
(b) Mapping. The PRO District is
an overlay district which shall be
mapped only in an area where at
least seventy five (75%) of the
underlying zoning is either Local
Retail or General Retail. In every
PRO District, any street frontage to
be considered a “Pedestrian Retail

2764

December 10, 2003
Street Frontage,” as defined herein,
shall be so marked on the Zoning
Map, with either one or both sides
of a street designated as such.
(c) Applicability. The PRO District regulations shall apply only in
those portions of a PRO District in
which the underlying zoning is
either
Local
Retail
or
General
Retail. In the relevant portions of a
PRO District, the regulations of the
underlying zoning district shall govern except where in conflict with
the regulations of the PRO District,
in which case the regulations of the
PRO District shall govern.
(d) Definitions. As used in this
section, the following terms shall be
defined as stated below.
(1)
“Pedestrian
Retail
Street
Frontage” means that side or sides

activity exists or is expected to
exist and such street frontage is
specifically designated on the Zoning Map.

Retail
Space”
means that portion of a building or
property located at or closest to the
level of the public sidewalk and
within forty (40) feet of a Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage.
(3) “Open Sales Lot” means a property or portion thereof used for the
sale of merchandise stored in outdoor, unenclosed locations.
(4) “Institutional Use” means, for
purposes of this section, a school,
day care center, place of worship,
place of assembly, hospital, nursing
home, residential treatment facility,
or similar use.
(5) “Non-Retail Office” means an
office use whose primary activity
does not involve service to customers or clients on the premises.
(e) Use Regulations. All uses permitted in the underlying retail zoning district shall be permitted in the
PRO District, except that the use of
Pedestrian Retail Spaces, as defined
herein, shall be further limited as
follows.
(1) Prohibited Uses. For Pedestrian Retail Spaces, as defined herein,
the following uses shall be prohibited:
A. open sales lots, as defined herein;
B. filling and service stations;
C. car washes;
D. lanes serving a drive-through
facility.
(2) Conditional Uses. For Pedestrian Retail Spaces, as defined herein, the following uses shall be permitted as Conditional Uses, as approved by the City Planning Commission in accordance with the
approval criteria provided in this
section:
A. off-street parking or loading
areas;
B. driveways extending across a
public sidewalk;
C. residential, institutional and
non-retail office uses, as defined
herein,
except
that
ground-floor
entrances and lobbies serving such
uses located on upper floors or in a
basement level shall be permitted
without the requirement for conditional approval;

does not have a public pedestrian
entrance from the Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage;
E. any use with more than forty
(40) feet of frontage along the
Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage;

December 10, 2003
F. a building with an interior side
yard more than four (4) feet in
width and located within forty (40)
feet of a Pedestrian Retail Frontage.
(f) Criteria for Conditional Uses.
The City Planning Commission shall
approve a Conditional Use application if it determines that the application meets the following criteria.
(1) In the case of a proposed residential, institutional or non-retail
office use, one or more of the following conditions apply.
A. The subject building space was
designed specifically for the type of
use proposed and, as such, occupancy by an allowed use is an unreasonable expectation.
B. Denial of the application for
occupancy by a conditional use
would result in a long-term vacancy
of the subject property, as demonstrated by the applicant.
C. It has been determined that the
proposed use is needed in the immediate area and that suitable alternative locations are unavailable.
(2) In the case of a proposed offstreet parking or loading area or
driveway, one or both of the following conditions apply.
A. The size, shape or layout of the
subject property does not permit
placement of the parking, loading or
driveway in a more suitable location.
B. It has been demonstrated by
the applicant that placement of the
parking, loading or driveway in an
allowed location would jeopardize
the continued occupancy of the subject property by uses suited to the
PRO District.
(3) In the case of a buildingenclosed use that does not have an
entrance from the Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage, one or both of the
following conditions apply.
A. The proposed use will occupy
an existing building that lacks such
pedestrian entrance, and the addition of a conforming pedestrian
entrance is made infeasible by the
configuration of the interior space
or other factors related to the
design and placement of the building.
B. Placement of the pedestrian
entrance in a location other than on
the Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage will result in more suitable
pedestrian access.
(4) In the case of a proposed use
with more than forty (40) feet of
frontage along the Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage, the subject space
was designed for use at such size
and the proposed use, in the determination of the City Planning Commission,
will
not
have
adverse
impacts on the functioning of nearby pedestrian-oriented retail uses.
(5) In the case of an interior side
yard more than four (4) feet in
width and located within forty (40)
feet of a Pedestrian Retail Frontage, the subject building will be
occupied by residential units which
require the greater side yard area
to allow for desirable levels of light
and air.
(g) Maximum Setbacks. Notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
the
underlying zoning district, properties in PRO Districts shall conform
to the following regulations with
respect to maximum setbacks.
(1) Front Street Yard. No main
building on a lot abutting a Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage shall be

The City Record
set back more than five (5) feet
from the Pedestrian Retail Street
Frontage unless the City Planning
Commission has approved establishment of a surface parking lot in
such location as a Conditional Use.
Such building features as entrances
and display windows may be set
back up to an additional five (5)
feet as long as these features occupy no more than fifty percent (50%)
of the a building’s total frontage.
These setback regulations shall not
apply to portions of buildings above
the first-story level.
(2) Interior Side Yard. No portion
of an interior side yard located within forty (40) feet of a Pedestrian
Retail Street Frontage shall exceed
four (4) feet in width on the ground
floor level, unless the City Planning
Commission has approved a driveway or a residential side yard in
such location as a Conditional Use.
(3) Exceptions for Outdoor Cafes.
A building may be set back a maximum of fifteen (15) feet from the
Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage in
order to accommodate a permanent
outdoor café. If use of such café is
discontinued for a period of two (2)
years or more, the setback area
shall be landscaped or otherwise
improved in accordance with a plan
approved by the City Planning Commission.
(h) Window Areas. For any nonresidential building or storefront
facing a Pedestrian Retail Street
Frontage, not less than sixty percent (60%) of the front facade
between 2.5 and 7.5 feet in height
shall be composed of transparent
windows or doors. In addition, not
more
than
twenty-five
percent
(25%) of such window or door area
on a building or storefront shall be
covered with permanent signs.
(i) Parking. In recognition of the
expected greater use of public transit, bicycles and walking by customers and employees traveling to
PRO Districts, the minimum number
of parking spaces otherwise required by the Zoning Code shall be
reduced
by
thirty-three
percent
(33%) for retail business uses in
such districts. The Board of Zoning
Appeals may further reduce parking
requirements where it has been
demonstrated that additional parking is available in common or
shared parking facilities or in onstreet parking areas located within
a reasonable walking distance of
the use, given the nature of the use
and the district. The Board shall
also consider such factors as the
number of bicycle racks available in
proximity to a use. In making its
determination, the Board shall be
guided by an up-to-date analysis of
parking supply and demand and
other relevant factors submitted by
or on behalf of the applicant. The
City Planning Commission shall
maintain a file of all such parking
analyses submitted for properties in
each PRO District.
(j) Signs in the Public Street
Right-of-Way. An ordinance to map
a PRO District in a particular location may include permission to place
private signs in the public street
right-of-way under the regulations
of Chapter 512 of the Codified Ordinances. Such provision shall be
included in the PRO designation
only if it is determined, on the basis
of a survey and analysis conducted
by the City Planning Commission,

2765

11
that the particular PRO District is
characterized by a preponderance of
restaurants and small independent
stores for which signs placed near
the street curb would provide useful
information to pedestrians seeking
goods
and
services
and
would
enhance
the
pedestrian-oriented
image of the district. Any PRO District designated for display of signs
in the street right-of-way shall be
shown on the Zoning Map as a
“PRO-S” District, with “S” noting the
presence of special sign provisions.
No sign permitted by these provisions shall be displayed without
design approval of the sign’s structure and permanent elements by the
City Planning Commission, or where
applicable, by the Landmarks Commission.
(k) Variances. The Board of Zoning Appeals may grant variances to
requirements of this section in
accordance with the applicable criteria stated in Chapter 329 of this
code.
(l) Appeals. Appeals from the
decision of the City Planning Commission to approve or disapprove
Conditional Uses in Pedestrian Retail Spaces shall be made to the
Board of Zoning Appeals.
Section 2. That Section 343.23 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as enacted by Ordinance No. 1020-01, passed July 18,
2001, is repealed.

the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
