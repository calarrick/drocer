Res. No. 2397-02.
By
Council
Members
Conwell,
Scott, Zone, Coats, O’Malley, Reed
and Jones.
An emergency resolution encouraging and supporting the creation of
a 511 traveler information system for
the State of Ohio; encouraging the
State of Ohio to implement a 511
traveler information system; and
encouraging the Director of the Ohio
Department of Transportation to submit a grant application for 511 planning.
Whereas, in July of 2000, the Federal
Communications
Commission
designated 511 as the national traveler information phone number; and
Whereas, 511 is an easy to remember telephone number that provides
traveler information; and
Whereas, 511 enables travelers to
access accurate, up-to-the-minute information about local highway and
public transportation options and
current travel conditions, and
Whereas, traveler information systems, such as 511, help to balance
demand on transportation systems;
and
Whereas, implementation of a 511
traveler information system is the
responsibility of state governments;
and
Whereas, the United States Department of Transportation is offering grants to support 511 planning
and such grants are available to a
state’s Department of Transportation; and

84

January 22, 2003
Whereas, this Council encourages
and supports the creation and development of a 511 traveler information
system for the State of Ohio; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby encourages and supports the creation and development of a 511 traveler information system for the
State of Ohio.
Section
2.
That
this

Res. No. 41-03.
By Council Members Coats and
Reed.
An emergency resolution opposing
the profiling of suspects based solely upon race, ethnic origin, religion,
or other similar factor and encouraging the federal government to
assist local law enforcement agencies in their efforts to provide education and training for law enforcement officers regarding appropriate
investigative and enforcement techniques.
Whereas, all Americans have a
right to expect equal treatment by
law enforcement offices, prosecuting
authorities, judges and correctional
officials; and
Whereas, discriminatory enforcement of criminal laws has a corrosive effect on American cities and
towns, undermines the confidence of
the community in law enforcement,
and interferes with efforts to prevent crime and prosecute offenders;
and
Whereas, unfortunately, our country has a long history of disparate
treatment in our criminal justice
system; and
Whereas, numerous studies confirm that racial minorities, especially African Americans and Latinos,
are more likely to be arrested, more

January 22, 2003
likely to be prosecuted and more
likely to be incarcerated for offenses that whites accused of the same
crime; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
supports
federal
legislation
and
action which eliminates discrimination in the enforcement of our criminal justice system; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
opposes profiling of suspects based
solely on race, ethnic origin, religion, or other similar factor; and
Whereas, the Council encourages
the federal government to assist
local law enforcement agencies in
their efforts to provide education
and training for law enforcement
officers regarding appropriate investigative
and
enforcement
techniques; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes profiling of suspects based solely upon race, ethnic origin, religion,
or other similar factor.
Section
2.
That
this
Council
encourages the federal government
to assist local law enforcement
agencies in their efforts to provide
education and training for law
enforcement officers regarding appropriate investigative and enforcement techniques.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to U.S. Senator Michael DeWine, U.S. Senator
George
Voinovich,
Congressman
Dennis
Kucinich,
and
Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs-Jones.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Res. No. 47-03.
By Council Members Westbrook,
Reed, Sweeney and Coats.
An emergency resolution encouraging the Transportation Security
Administration to reconsider and
review Security Directive SD 1542-0203A to determine if exceptions may
be granted under certain circumstances and encouraging the U.S.
Senate and U.S. House of Representatives to pass legislation granting
exceptions to Security Directive SD
1542-02-03A when certain conditions
are met.
Whereas, the Department of Transportation, Transportation Security
Administration (“TSA”) issued Security Directive SD 1542-02-03A on
November 8, 2002; and
Whereas, this Security Directive
requires all airport operators to
conduct certain security measures
for each employee of a vendor

The City Record
working in a sterile area of the airport and for each airport operator
employee who works in a sterile
area; and
Whereas, airport operators were
required within ten (10) calendar
days of receipt of the Security Directive to submit information, including an employee’s name, social security number, date of birth, city and
state of birth, and current residential address, to the Aviation Security Clearinghouse for all employees
who work in the sterile area of an
airport; and
Whereas, security staff at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport
compiled and submitted the requested information for more than seven
hundred (700) vendor employees;
and
Whereas, Cleveland Hopkins International Airport received a criminal
background check report for each
individual whose name and information was submitted to the Aviation Security Clearinghouse; and
Whereas, any employee convicted
of one or more of the disqualifying
offenses is prohibited from accessing a sterile area of the airport; and
Whereas,
fifteen
(15)
vendor
employees at Cleveland Hopkins
International Airport were convicted
of a disqualifying offense; and
Whereas, such employees are prohibited from accessing a sterile area
of Cleveland Hopkins International
Airport and, therefore, these fifteen
(15) vendor employees were either
fired or forced to resign; and
Whereas, several of these employees were convicted of a disqualifying offense several years ago; and
Whereas, several of these employees have been model employees for
several years and the TSA’s Security Directive appears to be unfair
and
unnecessarily
restrictive
as
applied to these employees; and
Whereas, in these instances, the
effect of the TSA’s Security Directive is contrary to the spirit of fair
employment; and
Whereas, this Council feels that
individuals who have paid their
debt to society for a criminal
offense should be permitted the
opportunity
to
obtain
gainful
employment; and
Whereas, this Council encourages
the TSA to reconsider and review
Security Directive SD 1542-02-03A to
determine if exceptions may be
granted
under
certain
circumstances; and
Whereas, this Council encourages
the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of
Representatives to pass legislation
granting
exceptions
to
Security
Directive SD 1542-02-03A when certain conditions are met; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
encourages the TSA to reconsider
and review Security Directive SD
1542-02-03A to determine if exceptions may be granted under certain
circumstances.
Section
2.

this
Council

Ord. No. 8-03.
By Council Members Westbrook,
Cimperman and Jackson (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance to authorize the issuance and sale of subordinated Airport Revenue Notes in
the aggregate principal amount not
to exceed $48,500,000, in anticipation
of the issuance of Bonds, to retire
outstanding notes issued to pay
costs of acquiring real property and
interests in real property for the
purpose of improving the airport
system.
Whereas, under authority of Ordinance No. 492-01 passed by the Council on April 30, 2001, the City issued
$44,950,000 Taxable Airport Surplus
Revenue Notes, Series 2001 (the
“Outstanding Notes”) to retire an
original issue of notes authorized by
Ordinance No. 78-99 passed January
14, 1999 and issued for the purpose
of acquiring real property and interests therein for the future expansion
of Cleveland Hopkins International
Airport; and
Whereas, the Outstanding Notes
may be redeemed prior to maturity
on March 1, 2003, and the City has
determined that redeeming the Outstanding Notes on that date will
enable the City to achieve debt service savings, based on the current
conditions in the financial markets,
and, as a result, the City has determined to issue the Notes authorized
by Section 3 to provide funds to
redeem the Outstanding Notes on
March 1, 2003 or, if that is no longer
advantageous, to retire the Outstanding Notes at maturity on June
1, 2003; now, therefore,

responsibilities thereof pursuant to
or by operation of law or who or
which are lawfully performing such
functions, duties, or responsibilities.
Unless the context shall otherwise
indicate, words importing the singular number shall include the plural number, and vice versa.
Section 2. The Bonds. It is necessary to issue bonds of this City in
an aggregate principal amount not
to exceed $48,500,000 (the “Bonds”)
to pay a portion of the costs of the
Project, including costs of issuance
of the Bonds, to adequately fund
any debt service reserve fund that
may be established pursuant to Section 12, and to retire the Notes (as
defined in Section 3 below). Interest
on the Bonds shall be payable semiannually until the principal amount
is paid. The Bonds are estimated to
mature
in
25
annual
principal
installments
that
are
in
such
amounts that the total principal and
interest payments on the Bonds in
any fiscal year in which principal is
payable are substantially equal. The
Bonds will be subordinated revenue
obligations of the City, the principal
of and interest on which will be
secured solely by, and payable solely from, Subordinated Airport Revenue. The Notes may be retired from
the proceeds of obligations issued
other than the Bonds or from other
moneys available for such purpose.
The Bonds or other obligations that
may be issued to retire the Notes
will have such terms as are provided in a subsequent ordinance of this
Council authorizing their issuance
and sale.
Section 3. Issuance of Notes. It is
necessary for the reasons set forth
in the preambles to this Ordinance,
and this Council determines, that
notes in the aggregate principal
amount not to exceed $48,500,000
(the “Notes”) shall be issued in
anticipation of the issuance of the
Bonds, the proceeds of which will be
used to retire the Outstanding Notes
and may be used, if and to the
extent so provided in the Certificate
of Award, to pay costs of any Credit Support Instrument with respect
to the Notes, to fund interest on the
Notes and any debt service reserve
fund established under Section 12,
and to pay costs of issuance of the
Notes. The Notes shall be issued in
the aggregate principal amount not
to exceed $48,500,000 that is determined by the Director of Finance in
the Certificate of Award to be
required to be issued for the purposes stated above in this Section,
taking into account other moneys
available for such purposes. The
Notes shall be dated the date of
issuance or such other date as is
designated in the Certificate of
Award. The Notes shall mature on a
date to be determined by the Director of Finance in the Certificate of
Award in accordance with his determination of the best interest of and
financial advantages to the City,
provided that such date shall not be
later than five years from the date
of issuance of the Notes.
Section 4. Interest. The Notes shall
bear interest from their date at the
rate per annum set forth in the Certificate of Award, or if any Notes

January 22, 2003
bear interest at a variable rate, at
the rate determined pursuant to the
method set forth in the Certificate
of Award. Interest on the Notes
shall be payable on the dates determined by the Director of Finance in
the Certificate of Award and until
the principal amount is paid or payment is provided for. If any Notes
bear interest at a fixed rate, that
rate shall not exceed six percent
(6%) per year (computed on the
basis of a 360-day year consisting of
twelve 30-day months) and interest
shall be payable not more often
than every six months and at maturity or at any earlier redemption
date. If any Notes bear interest at a
variable rate or rates, those rates
shall not exceed that set forth in
Section 5, and interest shall be
payable not more often than once a
month and following purchase and
at
maturity
or
at
any
earlier
redemption date.
Section 5. Variable Rate Notes. In
the event that the Director of
Finance determines that the City’s
best interests will be served by
causing all or a portion of the Notes
to be obligations bearing interest at
variable rates, redeemable by the
City without penalty or premium on
interest adjustment dates, then the
Director of Finance is authorized to
so specify in the Certificate of
Award. If the Director of Finance so
determines, then the Director of
Finance shall specify in the Certificate of Award the method and procedure by which the variable rate of
interest to be borne by the variable
rate Notes shall be determined,
whether by reference to a market
index, by auction, by a remarketing
agent or otherwise; provided that
the variable rate Notes shall not
bear interest at a rate in excess of
twelve percent (12%) per annum.
That maximum interest rate shall
not apply to variable rate Notes during any period those Notes are held
by a provider of a Credit Support
Instrument because they could not
be remarketed and the terms of the
Credit Support Instrument do not
permit such a maximum rate of
interest. Holders of variable rate
Notes may be given the right to tender their variable rate Notes for purchase by the City at the times, on
the terms, and subject to the conditions set forth in the Certificate of
Award and any tender agreement;
provided that tender rights shall be
exercisable only at such times as a
Credit Support Instrument is in
place that provides for the payment
of the purchase price payable to the
tendering holder of a variable rate
Note. If the Director of Finance designates any Notes as variable rate
Notes, and if the holders of the variable rate Notes are to be entitled to
tender the variable rate Notes for
purchase,
then
the
Director
of
Finance shall also designate in the
Certificate of Award for those variable rate Notes the provider or
providers for any Credit Support
Instrument, the tender agent or
agents and the remarketing agent
or agents, which designations shall
be based on the determination of the
Director of Finance that the parties
so designated possess the requisite
resources and experience to provide
the services required of them and
that the terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide

The City Record
such services are fair and commercially reasonable. The Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements in connection with the
delivery of the variable rate Notes,
and from time to time thereafter so
long as the variable rate Notes are
outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support
Instruments,
tender
agents (which may be the Registrar), remarketing agents, auction
agents and others as may be determined by the Director of Finance to
be necessary or appropriate to provide for the method of determining
the variable interest rates, permitting holders the right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support
for the payment of the variable rate
Notes upon tender for purchase or
redemption, and providing for the
repayment by the City of any
amounts drawn under the Credit
Support Instrument.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of
the Notes, and regardless of the
Notes bearing interest at variable or
fixed rates, is authorized to contract
for a Credit Support Instrument, and
to pay the costs of it from proceeds
of the Notes, if he determines that
the Credit Support Instrument will
result in a savings in the cost of
this financing to the City.
Section
6.
Payment
of
Debt
Charges on the Notes; Redemption.
The debt charges on the Notes shall
be payable in lawful money of the
United States of America, or in Federal Reserve funds of the United
States of America as determined by
the Director of Finance in the Certificate of Award, and shall be
payable, without deduction for services of the Registrar (as defined in
Section 7) as the City’s paying
agent. If agreed to by the Original
Purchaser, the Notes shall be subject to redemption without penalty
or premium at the option of the City
in whole or in part at any time prior
to maturity as provided in the Certificate of Award and this Ordinance.
If fewer than all of the Notes of
a
single
maturity
are
to
be
redeemed, the selection of Notes of
that maturity to be redeemed, or
portions thereof in amounts of the
minimum authorized denomination
or any integral multiple thereof,
shall be made by lot in a manner
determined by the Registrar. In the
case of a partial redemption of
Notes by lot when Notes of denominations greater than the minimum
authorized denomination are then
outstanding, each unit of principal
thereof in the amount of the minimum authorized denomination shall
be treated as if it were a separate
Note of the denomination of the minimum authorized denomination. If it
is determined that one or more, but
not all, of the units of principal
amount in the amount of the minimum authorized denomination represented by a Note are to be called
for redemption, then, upon notice of
redemption of such unit or units, the
registered owner of that Note shall
surrender the Note to the Registrar
(i) for payment of the redemption
price of such unit or units of principal amount called for redemption
(including, without limitation, the
interest accrued to the date fixed
for
redemption),
and
(ii)
for
issuance, without charge to the reg-

93

33
istered owner, of a new Note or
Notes of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Note surrendered.
The notice of the call for redemption of Notes shall identify (i) by
designation, letters, numbers, or
other
distinguishing
marks,
the
Notes or portions thereof to be
redeemed, (ii) the redemption price
to be paid, (iii) the date fixed for
redemption, and (iv) the place or
places where the amounts due upon
redemption are payable. The notice
shall be given by the Registrar on
behalf of the City by mailing a copy
of the redemption notice by first
class mail, postage prepaid, at least
30 days prior to the date fixed for
redemption, to the registered owner
of each Note subject to redemption
in whole or in part at the registered
owner’s address shown on the Note
Register (as defined in Section 7)
maintained by the Registrar at the
close of business on the 15th day
preceding that mailing. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Note,
however, shall not affect the validity
of
the
proceedings
for
the
redemption of any Note.
In
the
event
that
notice
of
redemption shall have been given
by the Registrar to the registered
owners as provided above, there
shall be deposited with the Registrar on or prior to the redemption
date, moneys that, in addition to
any other moneys available therefor
and held by the Registrar, will be
sufficient to redeem at the redemption price thereof, plus accrued
interest to the redemption date, all
of the redeemable Notes for which
notice
of
redemption
has
been
given. Notice having been mailed in
the manner provided in the preceding paragraph hereof, the Notes and
portions thereof called for redemption shall become due and payable
on the redemption date, and, upon
presentation and surrender thereof
at the place or places specified in
that notice, shall be paid at the
redemption
price,
plus
accrued
interest to the redemption date. If
moneys for the redemption of all of
the Notes and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with accrued
interest thereon to the redemption
date, are held by the Registrar on
the redemption date, so as to be
available therefor on that date and,
if notice of redemption has been
deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from and after the redemption
date those Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption shall cease
to bear interest and no longer shall
be considered to be outstanding. If
those moneys shall not be so available on the redemption date, or that
notice shall not have been deposited in the mail as aforesaid, those
Notes and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All moneys
held by
the Registrar for
the
redemption of particular Notes shall
be held in trust for the account of
the registered owners thereof and
shall be paid to them, respectively,
upon presentation and surrender of
those Notes.

34
Section 7. Registrar. The Director
of Finance shall designate a bank
or trust company to act as the
authenticating
agent,
registrar,
transfer agent, and paying agent for
the Notes after determining that the
payment at that bank or trust company will not endanger the funds or
securities of the City and that proper procedures and safeguards are
available for that purpose (the
“Registrar”).
The
Director
of
Finance shall sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
a registrar agreement or agreements between the City and the
Registrar (the “Registrar Agreement”) in a form consistent with
this Ordinance and as approved by
the Director of Law. In the event
that a trust agreement secures the
Notes, as provided in Section 12, the
Registrar Agreement may be incorporated in such trust agreement.
The Director of Finance shall provide for the payment of the services
rendered and for reimbursement of
expenses incurred pursuant to the
Registrar Agreement from the proceeds of the Notes to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
The Notes shall be issued only as
fully registered Notes. Principal on
the Notes shall be payable when due
upon presentation and surrender of
the Notes at the designated office of
the Registrar designated in the Registrar Agreement. Interest on each
Note shall be paid on each interest
payment date by check or draft
mailed to the person in whose name
the Note was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing on the
Note Register (defined below in this
Section) at the close of business on
the 15th day next preceding that
interest payment date. The City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange,
and transfer of Notes as provided in
this Section (the “Note Register”) so
long as any of the Notes remain outstanding. Subject to the provisions
of this Section, the person in whose
name a Note is registered on the
Note Register shall be regarded as
the absolute owner of that Note for
all purposes of the Note Proceedings. Payment of or on account of
the debt charges on any Note shall
be made only to or upon the order
of that person; neither the City nor
the Registrar shall be affected by
any notice to the contrary, but the
registration may be changed as provided in this Section. All such payments shall be valid and effectual
to satisfy and discharge the City’s
liability upon the Note, including
interest, to the extent of the amount
or amounts so paid.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
and so long as the Notes are issued
in a book entry system, principal of
and interest on the Notes shall be
payable in the manner provided in
any agreement entered into by the
Director of Finance, in the name
and on behalf of the City, in connection with the book entry system.
Section 8. Transfer and Exchange
of Certain Notes. Notes may be
exchanged for Notes of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the office designated by the Registrar, together

The City Record
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Note may be transferred only on
the Note Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Note at the
office designated by the Registrar
together with an assignment signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
Upon exchange or transfer, the Registrar shall complete, authenticate,
and deliver a new Note or Notes, of
any
authorized
denomination
or
authorized denominations requested
by the owner equal in the aggregate
to the unmatured principal amount
of the Note surrendered and bearing
interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Notes only after the new
Notes are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Notes exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Notes
in accordance with the provisions of
the Note Proceedings. The exchange
or transfer shall be without charge
to the owner, except that the City
and Registrar may make a charge
sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Notes
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
special obligations of the City, evidencing the same debt, and entitled
to the same security and benefit
under the Note Proceedings, as the
Notes
surrendered
upon
that
exchange or transfer. Neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be
required to make any exchange or
transfer of a Note during the period
beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the
mailing of a notice of redemption of
Notes and ending at the close of
business on the day of such mailing
or to transfer or exchange any Note
selected for redemption in whole or
in part.
Section 9. Book Entry. Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this Ordinance, if it is determined
by the Director of Finance to be in
the best interests of and financially
advantageous to the City, the Notes
may be issued in book entry form
in accordance with the provisions of
this Section. As used in this Section
and this Ordinance:
The Notes may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized, (i) the
Notes may be issued in the form of
a single, fully registered Note representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the book entry
interest owners of Notes in book
entry form shall have no right to
receive Notes in the form of physical securities or certificates; (iii)
ownership of book entry interests in
book entry form shall be shown by

94

January 22, 2003
book entry on the system maintained and operated by the Depository and its Participants, and transfers of the ownership of book entry
interests shall be made only by book
entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv) the Notes as such
shall
not
be
transferable
or
exchangeable, except for transfer to
another Depository or to another
nominee of a Depository, without
further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Notes for use in a book entry
system, the Director of Finance may
attempt to establish a securities
depository/book entry relationship
with another qualified Depository. If
the Director of Finance does not or
is unable to do so, the Director of
Finance, after making provision for
notification of the book entry interest owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Notes from the Depository,
and authenticate and deliver note
certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance also is
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the Notes,
after determining that the signing
thereof will not endanger the funds
or securities of the City and after
the approval of the form of any such
agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 10. Execution of Notes.
Notes shall be signed by the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, in the
name of the City and in their official capacities, provided that either
or both of those signatures may be
a facsimile, and shall bear the seal
of the City or a facsimile thereof;
provided that no Note shall be valid
or obligatory for any purpose or
shall be entitled to any security or
benefit under the Note Proceedings
unless and until the certificate of
authentication printed on the Note is
signed by the Registrar as authenticating agent, and authentication
by the Registrar shall be conclusive
evidence that the Note so authenticated has been duly issued, signed
and delivered under, and is entitled
to the security and benefit of, the
Note Proceedings. The certificate of
authentication may be signed by
any authorized officer or employee
of the Registrar or by any other person acting as an agent of the Registrar and approved by the Director
of Finance on behalf of the City.
The same person need not sign the
certificate of authentication on all
of the Notes.
Pursuant to Section 83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
shall prepare the Notes and shall
endorse thereon his approval of the
form and correctness thereof by his
manual or facsimile signature. The
Notes shall be issued in the denominations as requested by the Original Purchaser and approved by the
Director of Finance, in conformity
with this Ordinance. The entire principal amount may be represented by
a single note and may be issued as

January 22, 2003
fully registered securities and in
book entry or other uncertificated
form if it is determined by the
Director of Finance that issuance of
fully registered securities in that
form will facilitate the sale and
delivery of the Notes. The Notes
may be issued in the authorized
denominations of either (a) $100,000
each or in any denomination that is
the sum of (i) $100,000 and (ii)
$5,000 or any integral multiple thereof, and not exchangeable for other
Notes in denominations less than
$100,000, or (b) $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof, as determined
by the Director of Finance in the
Certificate of Award to be in the
best interests of the City. The Notes
shall not have coupons attached,
shall be numbered as determined by
the Director of Finance and shall
express upon their faces the purpose, in summary terms, for which
they are issued and that they are
issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 11. Sale of Notes. The
Notes shall be sold at not less than
97% of par plus accrued interest at
private sale by the Director of
Finance to the Original Purchaser
in accordance with law and the provisions of this Ordinance. If, in the
reasonable opinion of the Director of
Finance, an underwriter is incapable of fully performing its duties
or meeting its obligations in its
capacity as Original Purchaser with
respect to the Notes, the Director of
Finance is hereby authorized and
directed, in the name of and on
behalf of the City, to take whatever action may be necessary to terminate that underwriter’s standing
as Original Purchaser. The Director
of Finance shall sign the Certificate
of Award referred to in this Ordinance, evidencing that sale to the
Original Purchaser, cause the Notes
to be prepared, and have the Notes
signed and delivered, together with
a true transcript of proceedings
with reference to the issuance of the
Notes if requested by the Original
Purchaser, to the Original Purchaser upon payment of the purchase
price. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
a note purchase agreement between
the City and the Original Purchaser, or representative thereof (the
“Purchase Agreement”), in a form
consistent with this Ordinance and
as approved by the Director of Law.
The Director of Finance shall provide for the payment of the services
rendered and for reimbursement of
expenses incurred pursuant to the
Purchase Agreement from the proceeds of the Notes to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose. The Mayor, the Director of Finance, the Clerk of Council,
the Director of Law, and other City
officials, as appropriate, are each
authorized and directed to sign any
transcript
certificates,
financial
statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance.
Section 12. Security for the Notes.
The Notes are special obligations of
the City. The interest on the Notes,

The City Record
unless paid from other sources available to the City, is secured solely
by, and is payable solely from proceeds of the Notes or Bonds or the
Subordinated Airport Revenue.
The principal of the Notes, unless
paid from other sources available to
the City, is payable solely from the
proceeds of the Bonds. The City
covenants and agrees to do all
things
necessary
to
effect
the
issuance and delivery, prior to the
maturity of the Notes, of the Bonds
or any renewal notes, in that principal amount as may be necessary,
together with any other moneys
available to the City for the purpose, to pay the debt service on the
Notes when due at maturity and to
do all things necessary to sell the
Bonds in sufficient time to permit
their delivery prior to the maturity
of the Notes. The par value to be
received from the sale of the Bonds
or of any renewal notes and any
excess funds resulting from the
issuance of the Notes shall, to the
extent necessary, be used to pay the
debt charges on the Notes at maturity and are pledged for that purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the City covenants and agrees to
issue Additional Revenue Bonds on
a
parity
with
Airport
Revenue
Bonds (all as defined in the Indenture) to retire the Notes, if and to
the extent the City can satisfy the
conditions
precedent
under
the
Indenture for the issuance of Additional Revenue Bonds. Further, if
the Director of Finance determines,
based on the written advice of the
Financial Advisor, that under conditions of the market at that time, the
Bonds cannot be issued with reasonable terms, the City covenants
and agrees that it will issue obligations payable from other City
sources to retire the Notes at maturity.
The City shall not be obligated to
pay principal of and interest on the
Notes from any funds or sources
other than those described in this
Section, and the Notes shall not be
a claim upon or lien against any
other property of the City. The
Notes, as to both principal and interest, are not general obligations of
the City, and the full faith and credit of the City is not pledged to their
payment. The holders of the Notes
shall have no right to have taxes
levied by the City for the payment
of principal of and interest on the
Notes.
Nothing
herein,
however,
shall be deemed to prohibit the City,
of its own volition, from using, to
the extent that it is authorized by
law to do so, any other resources for
the fulfillment of any of the terms,
conditions, or obligations of this
Ordinance or of the Notes.
The City will observe and perform
all its agreements and obligations
provided for by the Notes or this
Ordinance. All of the obligations
under this Ordinance are hereby
established as duties specifically
enjoined by law and resulting from
an office, trust, or station upon the
City within the meaning of Section
2731.01 of the Ohio Revised Code.
In the event that the interest on
the Notes is to be provided for from
Note proceeds, or if in the judgment
of the Director of Finance, after consultation with the Financial Advisor, a debt service reserve to secure
the Notes is in the best interest of
and financially advantageous to the

95

35
City, the City shall enter into a trust
agreement with the bank or trust
company serving as Registrar for
the Notes and providing for a debt
service fund or debt service reserve
fund, as applicable, to be held by
that bank or trust company, in its
capacity as trustee, and such fund
or funds are hereby authorized. The
Director of Finance shall sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, the trust agreement in
a form consistent with this Ordinance and approved by the Director
of Law. The Mayor, Director of
Finance, Director of Port Control
and other City officials, as appropriate, are authorized to take such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate such additional security for the Notes. Such trust
agreement may be supplemental to
the Indenture. The City hereby
covenants and agrees to appropriate
annually from the Subordinated Airport Revenue into any such funds
amounts sufficient to maintain the
balances
required
by
the
trust
agreement and to restore any deficiency therein.
Section 13. Note Proceeds. The pro ceeds from the sale of the Notes are
appropriated and shall be used for
the purpose for which the Notes are
being issued. Any portion of the proceeds to be used to pay interest on
the Notes or to make a required
deposit to a debt service reserve
fund shall be paid into the debt service fund and debt service reserve
fund, respectively, created pursuant
to Section 12. Any money in the debt
service fund created for the security of the Outstanding Notes remaining after payment (or provision for
payment) of debt service on the Outstanding Notes shall be held for the
security of the Notes and used to
pay debt service on the Notes.
Section 14. Disclosure. If, in the
judgment of the Director of Finance,
after consultation with the Financial Advisor and the Original Purchaser, an official statement or
other disclosure document is appropriate relating to the initial offering
of
the
Notes,
the
Director
of
Finance, on behalf of the City and
in that officer’s official capacity, is
authorized to (i) cooperate with the
Original Purchaser in the preparation of, and the making of modifications, completions or changes of
or supplements to, such a disclosure
document, (ii) determine, and to certify or otherwise represent, when
the disclosure document is to be
deemed final or is final, (iii) authorize the use and distribution of that
disclosure document and any supplements thereto in connection with
the initial offering of the Notes, (iv)
sign certificates, statements or other
documents in connection with the
finality, accuracy, and completeness
of that disclosure document, and (v)
contract for the services for the production and distribution of the disclosure
document,
including
by
printed and electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Notes, the City agrees, as the
only obligated person with respect
to the Notes under the Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data, audited financial statements
and notices, in such manner, as may

36
be required for purposes of paragraph (b)(5)(i) of the Rule. In
order to describe and specify certain
terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for that purpose,
and
thereby
to
implement
that
agreement, including provisions for
enforcement, amendment, and termination, the Director of Finance is
authorized and directed to sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, and if required under
the Rule, a Continuing Disclosure
Certificate or Certificates in conformance with the reporting requirements of the Rule. The agreement
formed, collectively, by this paragraph and that Certificate, shall be
the
City’s
continuing
disclosure
agreement for purposes of the Rule,
and its performance shall be subject
to the annual appropriation of any
funds that may be necessary to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of the
occurrence of any other events, the
Director of Finance shall consult
with, as appropriate, the legal counsel and bond or other qualified independent special counsel to the City.
The Director of Finance, acting in
the name and on behalf of the City,
shall be entitled to rely upon any
legal advice provided by any such
counsel in determining whether a
filing should be made.
Section 15. Ratings, Insurance,
and Other Credit Enhancement. If,
in the judgment of the Director of
Finance after consultation with the
Original Purchaser, the filing of an
application for a rating on the Notes
by one or more nationally recognized rating agencies or a Credit
Support Instrument is in the best
interest of, and financially advantageous to, the City, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare
and submit those applications, to
provide to each such agency, company or credit provider such information as may be required for the
purpose. The cost of obtaining each
rating and Credit Support Instrument, except to the extent paid by
the Original Purchaser in accordance with the Purchase Agreement,
shall be paid from the proceeds of
the Notes.
Section 16. Interest Rate Swaps,
Hedges and Caps. For the purpose
of achieving the optimal available
debt structure for the Notes, the
Director of Finance may, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, enter into one or more
agreements in connection with or
subsequent to the issuance of the
Notes for an interest rate swap,
swaption, rate cap, rate collar or
other hedging transaction to lower
the effective interest rate on the
obligations to the City or to hedge
the exposure of the City against
fluctuations in prevailing interest
rates, provided, however, that: (i)
the counterparty to any hedging
transaction shall have a rating of at
least
“A”
by
either
Moody’s
Investors Service, Inc., or Standard
& Poor’s Corporation; (ii) payments

The City Record
by the City to the counterparty to
the hedging transaction shall be
limited to the same sources which
secure payment of the Notes as
described in this Ordinance; and
(iii)
the
cost
of
any
hedging
arrangement shall have been determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, to be justified by
the corresponding benefit to the
City and to be commercially reasonable based on then current market conditions.
Section 17. Tax Covenants. In the
event that the Notes are issued and
sold as obligations bearing interest
that is excluded from gross income
for federal income tax purposes, the
covenants in this Section 17 shall
govern. However, if the Notes are
issued and sold as obligations bearing interest that is included in gross
income for federal income tax purposes, the City shall not be bound
by the covenants of this Section
with respect to the Notes.
Subject to the foregoing, the City
covenants that it will use, and will
restrict the use and investment of,
the proceeds of the Notes in such
manner and to such extent as may
be necessary so that (a) the Notes
will not (i) constitute private activity bonds, arbitrage bonds or hedge
bonds under Sections 141, 148 or 149
of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the Code) or (ii)
be treated other than as bonds to
which Section 103(a) of the Code
applies, and (b) the interest on the
Notes will not be treated as an item
of tax preference under Section 57
of the Code. The City further
covenants that (a) it will take or
cause to be taken such actions that
may be required of it for the interest on the Notes to be and remain
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will
not take or authorize to be taken
any actions that would adversely
affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or
persons acting for it, will, among
other acts of compliance, (i) apply
the proceeds of the Notes to the governmental purpose of the borrowing,
(ii) restrict the yield on investment
property, (iii) make timely and adequate payments to the federal government, (iv) maintain books and
records and make calculations and
reports and (v) refrain from certain
uses of those proceeds, and, as
applicable,
of
property
financed
with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the extent necessary to
assure such exclusion of that interest under the Code.
The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer of
the City having responsibility for
issuance of the Notes is hereby
authorized (a) to make or effect any
election,
selection,
designation,
choice, consent, approval, or waiver
on behalf of the City with respect
to the Notes as the City is permitted to or required to make or give
under the federal income tax laws,
including, without limitation thereto, any of the elections provided for
in Section 148(f)(4)(C) of the Code
or available under Section 148 of the
Code, for the purpose of assuring,
enhancing or protecting favorable
tax treatment or status of the Notes
or interest thereon or assisting compliance with requirements for that
purpose, reducing the burden or

96

January 22, 2003
expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or payments
or penalties, or making payments of
special amounts in lieu of making
computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as rebate, or
obviating those amounts or payments, as determined by that officer,
which action shall be in writing and
signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf
of the City, as may be appropriate
to assure the exclusion of interest
from gross income and the intended
tax status of the Notes, and (c) to
give one or more appropriate certificates of the City, for inclusion in
the transcript of proceedings for the
Notes, setting forth the reasonable
expectations of the City regarding
the amount and use of all the proceeds of the Notes, the facts, circumstances and estimates on which
they are based, and other facts and
circumstances relevant to the tax
treatment of the interest on and the
tax status of the Notes.

Sections, subsections, paragraphs,
subparagraphs, or clauses hereof.

Section 19. Interpretation. Any pro visions of the Codified Ordinances
of the City which are inconsistent
with the provisions of this Ordinance shall not apply to the Notes

Ordinance is intended to, and no provision hereof shall be applied in any
manner as would, impair the obligation of contract of the City with
respect to any outstanding bonds,
notes, certificates of indebtedness,
other obligations, trust indentures,
trust agreements, or other agreements or contracts made or entered
into by the City.
Section 20. Satisfaction of Conditions. This Council determines that
all acts and conditions necessary to
be done or performed by the City or
to have been met precedent to and
in the issuing of the Notes in order
to make them legal, valid, and binding special obligations of the City
have been performed and have been
met, or will at the time of delivery
of the Notes have been performed
and have been met, in regular and
due form as required by law, and
that no limitation of indebtedness or
taxation, either statutory or constitutional,
is
applicable
to
the
issuance of the Notes.
Section 21. Compliance with Open
Meeting Requirements. This Council
finds and determines that all formal
actions of this Council and any of
its committees concerning and relating to the passage of this Ordinance
were taken in an open meeting of
this Council or committees, and that
all deliberations of this Council and
any of its committees that resulted
in those formal actions were in

than four families, a condominium
unit, or a cooperative unit when:

refinanced bears a lower interest
rate than the new loan unless the

counselor employed by a housing
counseling agency approved by the
Department of Housing and Urban
Development, that the borrower has
received counseling describing the
loan transaction and its impact on
the borrower;
ii. The borrower’s payment of prepaid finance charges and closing

originated, or was subsidized or
guaranteed by or through a state,
tribal or local government, or nonprofit organization, which bears
either a below-market interest rate,
or has nonstandard payment terms
beneficial to the borrower, such as
payments that vary with income, are
limited to a percentage of income,
or where no payments are required
under
specified
conditions,
and
where, as a result of the refinancing, the borrower will lose one or
more of the benefits of the mortgage,
unless
the
borrower
has
received counseling from a certified
housing counseling agency regarding such refinancing and the borrower and current holder of the loan
consent in writing to the refinancing.
B. “Balloon Payments”. A loan
that contains a scheduled payment
that is more than twice as large as
the average of earlier scheduled
payments or which contains a provision that gives the lender, in its
sole discretion, the right to accelerate the indebtedness in the absence
of the default of the borrower. The
term “balloon payment” shall not
apply to (i) any loan with a maturity of one year or less, if the purpose of the loan is a “bridge” loan
connected with the acquisition or
construction of a dwelling intended
to become the consumer’s principal
dwelling, or (ii) a home equity line
of credit secured by the borrower’s
primary dwelling.
C. “Negative Amortization”. Terms
under which the outstanding principal balance will increase at any
time over the course of the loan
because the regular periodic payments do not cover the full amount
of interest due.
D. “Points and Fees”. The financing of points and fees in excess of
four (4) percentage points of the
total
loan
amount
if
the
loan
amount is $16,000 or greater, or $800
if the loan amount is less than
$16,000.
E. “Increased Interest Rate”. A
loan that provides for an interest
rate applicable after default that is
higher than the interest rate that
applies before default.
F. “Advance Payments”. A loan
which includes terms under which
more than two periodic payments
required under the loan are consolidated and paid in advance from the
loan proceeds provided to the borrower.
G. “Mandatory Arbitration”. A loan
which contains a mandatory arbitration clause that limits in any
way the right of the borrower to
seek relief through a court of law
or equity.
H. “Prepayment Penalties”. A loan
under which a borrower must pay a
prepayment penalty for paying all
or part of the principal before the
date on which the principal is due.
Any method of computing a refund
of unearned scheduled interest is a
prepayment penalty if it is less
favorable to the consumer than the
actuarial
method,
as
“actuarial
method” is defined in division (A)
of Section 1349.25 of the Revised
Code. The term “prepayment penalties” shall not include prepayment

based upon the information provided by borrower and lender to the
counselor at the time counseling is
provided to the borrower.
K. “Lending Without Due Regard
to Repayment”. Except in conformity with the provisions of division
(b)(1)(B) of Section 659.02, making,
issuing or originating a loan without reasonable belief at the time the
loan is consummated that the borrower or borrowers (when considered collectively in the case of multiple borrowers) will be able to
make the scheduled payments to
repay the obligation based upon a
consideration of their current and
expected income, current obligations, employment status, and other
financial resources (other than the
borrower’s equity in the dwelling
which secures repayment of the
loan). A borrower shall be presumed
to be able to make the scheduled
payments to repay the obligation if,
at the time the loan is consummated, or at the time of the first rate
adjustment in the case of a lower
introductory interest rate (i) the
borrower’s scheduled monthly payments on the loan (including principal, interest, taxes, insurance and
assessments), combined with the
scheduled payments for all other
debt, do not exceed 50% of the borrower’s documented and verified
monthly gross income, and (ii) provided that the borrower has sufficient “residual income” as defined in
the guidelines established in 38
C.F.R. §36.4337(e) and VA form 266393

accordance with terms established
in a written agreement signed by
the borrower, the lender and the
contractor before the date of payment. However, “predatory loan”
shall not include a loan that is made
primarily for a business purpose
unrelated to the residential real
property securing the loan.

January 22, 2003
For purposes of division (f)(1) of
this Section, if the terms of the
home loan include an initial or introductory period, and the annual percentage rate is less than that which
will apply after the end of such initial or introductory period, then the
annual percentage rate that shall be
taken into account for purposes of
this Section shall be the first annual percentage rate adjustment that
is calculated and disclosed in conformance with the provisions of
division (b) of Section 659.01 for the
period after the initial or introductory period.
(g) “Home Improvement Contractor” means any person who engages
in the business of making home
improvements, and who undertakes
or offers to undertake or agrees to
perform any home improvement,
whether or not such person is registered, or subject to the licensing
and registration requirements of
Chapter 3107 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland, and
whether or not such person is a general contractor.
Section 659.02 Predatory Lending
Practices Prohibited
(a) Prohibited Conduct.
Subject to the limitations of division (b) of this section:
(1) Issuing Predatory Loans. No
person or business entity shall
make, issue, or arrange a predatory
loan, or assist others in doing so. A
person who, when acting in good
faith, fails to comply with this division will not be deemed to have violated this division if the person
establishes that the compliance failure was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid
such errors, and within 60 days after
the discovery of the compliance failure and prior to the institution of
any action under this Chapter or the
receipt of written notice of compliance failure, the borrower is notified
of the compliance failure, appropriate restitution is made, and whatever adjustments are necessary are
made to the loan to either, at the
choice of the borrower, (i) make the
predatory loan satisfy the requirements of this Chapter, or (ii)
change the terms of the loan in a
manner beneficial to the borrower
so that the loan will no longer be
considered a predatory loan subject
to the provisions of this Chapter.
Examples of a bona fide error
include clerical, calculation, computer malfunction and programming,
and printing errors. An error of
legal judgment with respect to a
person’s
obligations
under
this
Chapter is not a bona fide error.
(2) Lending Without Home Loan
Counseling. No person or business
entity shall make, issue or arrange,
or assist others in making, issuing
or arranging, any loan that is
secured by owner-occupied residential real property located within the
City of Cleveland on which there is
situated a dwelling for not more
than four families, a condominium
unit, or a cooperative unit in which
either:
A. the annual percentage rate at
consummation will exceed by more
than eight (8) percentage points for
first lien loans, or by more than ten
(10) percentage points for subordinate-lien loans, the yield on Trea-

January 22, 2003
sury securities having comparable
periods of maturity to the loan
maturity as of the fifteenth day of
the month immediately preceding
the month in which the application
for the extension of credit is received by the creditor; or
B. the total points and fees
payable by the consumer at or
before loan closing will exceed the
greater of eight (8) percent of the
total loan amount, or $400; the $400
figure shall be adjusted annually on
January 1 by the annual percentage
rate change in the consumer price
index that was reported on the preceding June 1, unless that person or
business entity first receives notice
from a counselor employed by a
housing
counseling
agency
approved by the Department of Housing and Urban Development that the
borrower has received counseling
describing the loan transaction and
its impact on the borrower based
upon the information provided by
borrower and lender to the counselor at the time counseling is provided to the borrower.
(3) Payments to Home Improve ment Contractors. A home improvement contractor may not receive
directly and solely from the lender,
the proceeds of a loan that is
secured by owner-occupied residential real property located within the
City of Cleveland on which there is
situated a dwelling for not more
than four families, a condominium
unit, or a cooperative unit in which,
at any time over the life of the loan
for a fixed interest rate loan, or at
the time a loan is consummated for
a variable interest rate loan, the
annual percentage rate of the loan
equals or exceeds by more than four
and one half (4 1/2) percentage
points in the case of a mortgage
that is a first lien when it is made,
or equals or exceeds by more than
six and one half (6 1/2) percentage
points in the case of a mortgage
that is junior when it is made, the
yield on Treasury securities having
comparable periods of maturity to
the loan maturity as of the fifteenth
day of the month immediately preceding the month in which the
application for the extension of
credit is received by the creditor.
(4) Incorporating Governmental
Financial Assistance Funds. All persons shall be barred from promoting, utilizing, packaging, or in any
other way incorporating funds from
any of the programs administered
by the City in combination with any
predatory loan. Any contract, lease,
grant or other agreement entered
into by the City with any person or
business entity shall contain a provision requiring that the person or
business entity, in the administration of governmental housing assistance funds, abide by the provisions
of this division as though its administration of such funds was directly
subject to the provisions of this division.
(b) Activities of Certain Financial
Institutions Exempted.
(1) Division (a) of this section is
not applicable in the following circumstances:
A. With respect to a lender duly
licensed as may be required under
State law, solely because of the
presence
of
a
loan
provision
described in divisions (f)(2)(B), (C)

predatory as defined in division (f)
of Section 659.01; or
B. In the case of a loan made pursuant to the Ohio’s Mortgage Loan

with respect to a State chartered

institutions.
Section 659.03 Notice to Customers
of Home Improvement Loans
(a) No person or business entity
that
knowingly
funds
a
home
improvement loan under the circumstances described in this section
shall fail to furnish the notice
described in this section. At least
three (3) business days prior to closing, every lender who knowingly

residential
real
estate
located within the City of Cleveland
on
which
there
is
situated
a
dwelling for not more than four
families, a condominium unit, or a
cooperative unit and which loan is
secured by that real estate, shall
furnish a notice to the borrower.
That notice shall be furnished as a
separate document, printed in 16
point font, with the signature line
at the top of the page, and shall be
in substantially the same form as
the following, as may
be amended from time to time by
the Department of Consumer Affairs:
IMPORTANT NOTICE TO
CUSTOMERS OF HOME
IMPROVEMENT CONTRACTORS
I received this notice on this date:
_______________________________ (date)
_________________________ signature of
home owner(s)
If you need a loan to pay for home
improvements:
BE CAREFUL. A lender will probably want to take a mortgage on
your house.
You should not borrow more than
you can afford or more than you
need. The loanyou are being offered
may be a predatory loan. You may
be eligible for a different loan
which charges significantly less
interest or fees. Be very cautious
about consolidating your debt with
a home mortgage. Beware that if
you default on this loan you could
lose your house! In certain cases, it
is now the law in Cleveland that
before you sign a home loan you
must receive housing counseling
assistance.

commonly known as a “home equity
line of credit”.
