Res. No. 610-03.
By
Council
Members
Jackson,
Sweeney, Jones, White, Reed, Johnson, Britt, Lewis, Pierce Scott, Conwell, Coats, Polensek, Rybka, Cimperman, Cintron, Gordon, O’Malley,
Zone, Westbrook, Brady and Dolan.
An emergency resolution acknowledging the importance of the many
human service and social programs
provided by Cuyahoga County and
declaring this Council’s support of
the Health and Human Services levy
appearing on the May 6, 2003 ballot.
Whereas, Cuyahoga County’s human services agencies, in partnership with community, governmental
and faith-based organizations, provide the social safety net that
ensures the health, safety and welfare of our community’s children,
families, and senior citizens; and
Whereas, Cuyahoga County has
incurred the loss of significant funding from the State of Ohio over the
last several years; and
Whereas, this funding is used to
support programs to help move people from poverty to self sufficiency,
programs that help abused and
neglected children, programs that
help abused and neglected seniors,
programs that help nursing home
eligible seniors remain in their
homes,
programs
that
help
the
development of infants and programs that provide early education
to children; and

788

April 9, 2003
Whereas, Cuyahoga County’s funding from the State for human services
was cut by $100 million in 2002 and
2003 and additional cut of $9 million
in state funding is proposed in Governor Taft’s 2004-2005 budget; and
Whereas, programs to train people
on welfare and provide job placement services have been cut by $10
million a year and this cut results
in a reduction in job search and job
readiness programs in Cuyahoga
County; and
Whereas, an additional $38 million
of money designed to assist people
with job placement was cut by the
State of Ohio; and
Whereas, such money has been
successfully used in the past to fund
the following: job retention services
helping people resolve personal and
workplace issues; outreach efforts
with churches and community agencies to inform their clients and members of the availability of healthcare, childcare, and other benefits;
constructive after-school youth programs with education for children
too old to use daycare; housing
assistance for families on the verge
of eviction to assist such families in
retaining stable housing and providing counseling to accomplish better budgeting; parent support programs to educate parents on the
need for more involved parenting
and
participation
in
children’s
schooling and activities; and Safety
Net strategies to work with families
with children who are vulnerable
due to the termination of time-limited cash assistance; and
Whereas, the Cuyahoga County
Early Childhood Initiative, one of
the top 25 early childhood programs
in
the
country,
which
provides
extensive home visiting programs
for teens and new mothers, quality
daycare for special needs children,
and other programs which improve
developmental outcomes for children
and help prepare them for school,
was cut by almost $5 million in the
last state budget and faces yet
another potential reduction by the
state in the upcoming budget; and
Whereas, the local childcare system was cut by $1.3 million by the
State for parent support services
which provide daycare services for
families, parent education services
relating to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, first aid, CPR, behavior management,
gang
prevention;
and
street management; and
Whereas, the State is considering
a proposal that will roll back the
subsidized daycare eligibility levels
and could force the working families of 3,200 children to make choices between caring for their children
and continuing to work or forcing
parents to choose to leave children
with older siblings or even acquaintances in order to continue to go to
work; and
Whereas, the State is considering
a proposal that could cut several
categories
of
Medicaid
eligible
working poor adults and disabled
persons, leaving an additional 6,000
more people in our community without healthcare, many of whom are
parents of children who retain their
benefits, but only if the parents can
understand that their loss of benefits does not include the child’s loss
of benefits; and

April 9, 2003
Whereas, the funds to protect
abused and neglected children have
been cut by the state in the last
biennium budget by $2.75 million
and an additional cut of $1.9 million
is proposed in Governor Taft’s 20042005 budget; and
Whereas, these funds are used by
the County to train foster parents,
recruit adoptive parents, serve children transitioning out of foster care,
and work with schools to help support families and children; and
Whereas, the State of Ohio has
proposed to completely cut the funds
providing for protective services for
vulnerable seniors in our community; and
Whereas, these funds are used to
investigate allegations of abuse and
neglect; and
Whereas, the State of Ohio also
proposes to cut funding for nursing
home eligible seniors, funding that
allows seniors to remain in their
homes and receive less costly nursing services than those provided by
a nursing home; and
Whereas, the State of Ohio proposes to cut funding for unemployed
an dislocated workers, services that
in
a
lagging
economy
provide
invaluable training and retooling
for adults and young people; and
Whereas, the partnership between
Cuyahoga County and the State of
Ohio to adequately maintain the
social safety net of human services
has been severely eroded by the
reductions in funding provided by
the State of Ohio; and
Whereas, the Board of County Commissioners of Cuyahoga County, Ohio,
has determined that it is necessary to
enhance the support provided locally
for vital human services; and
Whereas, the Board of County
Commissioners of Cuyahoga County,
Ohio has declared it necessary, in
order to continue to serve the citizens of Cuyahoga County with vital
human services, to replace the current 3.1 mill Human Services Levy
and enhance it by adding an additional 1.8 mills; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby acknowledges the importance of
the many human service and social
programs provided by Cuyahoga
County and declares its support of
the Health and Human Services
Levy appearing on the May 6, 2003

By Council Member Rybka.
An emergency resolution objecting to a New C1 Liquor Permit to
7020 Harvard Avenue.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Department of Liquor
Control of an application for a New
C1 Liquor Permit at Eden Oil, Inc.,
DBA Harvard Gas USA, 7020 Harvard Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44105,
Permanent Number 2434505; and
Whereas, the granting of this application for a liquor permit to this
high crime area, which is already
saturated with other liquor outlets,
is contrary to the best interests of
the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to
Section 4303.26 of the Ohio Revised
Code. Council’s objection to said
permit must be received by the
Director of Liquor Control within
30 days of notification; now, therefore,

Dolan and Jones.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio General Assembly and Governor Robert Taft to consider the
impact that the current fiscal budget reductions will have on social
service agencies and human services programs should the funding
not be restored.
Whereas, the Legislation Committee of Cleveland City Council held a
public hearing on Friday, March 28,
2003 regarding the impact that the
State’s budget cuts will have on
health and social support services
that provide assistance to the poor,
elderly, and children; and
Whereas, the Legislation Committee of Cleveland City Council heard
testimonies from representatives of
various agencies and organizations
that provide social support services
to the needy residents in the greater
Cleveland
community,
who
will
either have to drastically reduce or
eliminate services; and
Whereas, the Legislation Committee of Cleveland City Council also
heard testimonies from a number of
residents who will be impacted by
these state budget cuts; and
Whereas, the state budget cuts
will put into jeopardy funding for
the Adult Protective Services Program, which investigates reports of
abuse,
neglect,
self-neglect
and
exploitation of adults who are 60
years of age and older; and
Whereas, the state budget cuts
will put into jeopardy funding for
the PASSPORT program, which provides low-income frail and impaired
older persons with an alternative to
institutional care, as well as offering an array of home and community based services that include personal care and daily living assistance; and
Whereas, the state budget cut will
put into jeopardy the Residential
State Supplement Program, which is
a state funded cash assistance program, that when combined with an
individual’s income enables him or
her to live in a licensed or certified
adult foster home, group home or
residential care facility; and
Whereas, the state budget cuts
will put into jeopardy the Senior
Community Services Block Grant,
which provides funding for transportation, home delivered meals, personal care, and homemaking and
adult services; and
Whereas, the state budget cuts
will put into jeopardy funding to
mental
health
providers,
which
serve over 27,000 adults and children
in Cuyahoga County, as well as providing community based emergency
and crisis services; and

The City Record
Whereas, the state budget cuts
will put into jeopardy funding to the
many homeless agencies that provide transitional housing and emergency shelters for an increasing
homeless population; and
Whereas, the state budget cuts
will put into jeopardy funding the
State of Ohio’s Housing Trust Fund,
which has been used to build neighborhoods in the City of Cleveland;
and
Whereas, the Ohio Housing Trust
Fund, and other housing related programs have been funded by the
State at approximately $50 million
per year; and
Whereas, the CDCs, housing developers, social service providers
and homeless facilities in Cuyahoga
County and the City of Cleveland all
benefit from these resources and
have been very successful in competing for these funds, but now they
face a lost in funding as a result of
these state budget cuts; and
Whereas, Governor Robert Taft
has proposed doubling the county
recordation fee, which would provide a dedicated, stable source of
revenue for the Ohio Housing Trust
Fund for many years to come, however the Governor has also stripped
every revenue dollar from housing
program budgets, and has reduced
the state’s commitment to housing
programs overall by 23 percent; and
Whereas, should the state general
assembly reject the notion of doubling the recordation fee, there
would be literally no state dollars in
the budget for housing programs;
and
Whereas, there should be support
that the recordation fee increase be
solely dedicated to fund the Ohio
Housing Trust Fund; and
Whereas, the state budget cuts
will put into jeopardy funding to the
Medicaid program, which provides
health coverage and services to lowincome working parents that keeps
them healthy and employed; and
Whereas, the state budget cuts will
put into jeopardy funding to Ohio’s
Second Harvest Foodbanks, which
provides meals to senior citizens, children, and families that turn to these
foodbanks in times of crisis; and
Whereas,
these
concerns
were
raised during the Committee hearing by the many agencies, organizations and constituents who will be
directly affected by these budget
cuts by the State of Ohio; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland strongly urges the
Ohio General Assembly and Governor Robert Taft to consider the
impact that the state budget cuts
will have on the many human and
social service programs as well as
the various social support agencies
that provide assistance to the elderly, poor, mentally impaired and
children that are in need.
Section 2. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland strongly urges the

801

29
Ohio General Assembly and Governor Robert Taft to consider restoring the appropriate funds to these
social support programs, homeless
shelters,
transitional
supportive
housing, CDC operating grants and
the Housing Trust Fund so that
these
citizens
will
continue
to
receive
assistance
and
Services
without any interruptions.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council be and she is hereby directed to
transmit two certified copies of
this resolution to the Ohio General
Assembly
and
Governor
Robert
Taft urging them to consider the
impact that these budget cuts will
have on the various social support
agencies, and to restore the funding to these agencies at their previous levels.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
