An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio General Assembly and Governor Robert Taft to consider the
impact that the current fiscal budget reductions will have on social
service agencies and human services programs should the funding
not be restored.
Whereas, the Legislation Committee of Cleveland City Council held a
public hearing on Friday, March 28,
2003 regarding the impact that the
State’s budget cuts will have on
health and social support services
that provide assistance to the poor,
elderly, and children; and
Whereas, the Legislation Committee of Cleveland City Council heard
testimonies from representatives of
various agencies and organizations
that provide social support services
to the needy residents in the greater
Cleveland
community,
who
will
either have to drastically reduce or
eliminate services; and
Whereas, the Legislation Committee of Cleveland City Council also
heard testimonies from a number of
residents who will be impacted by
these state budget cuts; and
Whereas, the state budget cuts
will put into jeopardy funding for
the Adult Protective Services Program, which investigates reports of
abuse,
neglect,
self-neglect
and
exploitation of adults who are 60
years of age and older; and
Whereas, the state budget cuts
will put into jeopardy funding for
the PASSPORT program, which provides low-income frail and impaired
older persons with an alternative to
institutional care, as well as offering an array of home and community based services that include personal care and daily living assistance; and
Whereas, the state budget cut will
put into jeopardy the Residential
State Supplement Program, which is
a state funded cash assistance program, that when combined with an
individual’s income enables him or
her to live in a licensed or certified
adult foster home, group home or
residential care facility; and

The City Record
Whereas, the state budget cuts
will put into jeopardy the Senior
Community Services Block Grant,
which provides funding for transportation, home delivered meals, personal care, and homemaking and
adult services; and
Whereas, the state budget cuts
will put into jeopardy funding to
mental
health
providers,
which
serve over 27,000 adults and children
in Cuyahoga County, as well as providing community based emergency
and crisis services; and
Whereas, the state budget cuts
will put into jeopardy funding to the
many homeless agencies that provide transitional housing and emergency shelters for an increasing
homeless population; and
Whereas, the state budget cuts
will put into jeopardy funding the
State of Ohio’s Housing Trust Fund,
which has been used to build neighborhoods in the City of Cleveland;
and
Whereas, the Ohio Housing Trust
Fund, and other housing related programs have been funded by the
State at approximately $50 million
per year; and
Whereas, the CDCs, housing developers, social service providers
and homeless facilities in Cuyahoga
County and the City of Cleveland all
benefit from these resources and
have been very successful in competing for these funds, but now they
face a lost in funding as a result of
these state budget cuts; and
Whereas, Governor Robert Taft
has proposed doubling the county
recordation fee, which would provide a dedicated, stable source of
revenue for the Ohio Housing Trust
Fund for many years to come, however the Governor has also stripped
every revenue dollar from housing
program budgets, and has reduced
the state’s commitment to housing
programs overall by 23 percent; and
Whereas, should the state general
assembly reject the notion of doubling the recordation fee, there
would be literally no state dollars in
the budget for housing programs;
and
Whereas, there should be support
that the recordation fee increase be
solely dedicated to fund the Ohio
Housing Trust Fund; and
Whereas, the state budget cuts
will put into jeopardy funding to the
Medicaid program, which provides
health coverage and services to lowincome working parents that keeps
them healthy and employed; and
Whereas, the state budget cuts will
put into jeopardy funding to Ohio’s
Second Harvest Foodbanks, which
provides meals to senior citizens, children, and families that turn to these
foodbanks in times of crisis; and
Whereas,
these
concerns
were
raised during the Committee hearing by the many agencies, organizations and constituents who will be
directly affected by these budget
cuts by the State of Ohio; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland strongly urges the
Ohio General Assembly and Governor Robert Taft to consider the
impact that the state budget cuts
will have on the many human and
social service programs as well as
the various social support agencies
that provide assistance to the elder-

731

15
ly, poor, mentally impaired and children that are in need.
Section 2. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland strongly urges the
Ohio General Assembly and Governor
Robert Taft to consider restoring the
appropriate funds to these social support programs, homeless shelters,
transitional supportive housing, CDC
operating grants and the Housing
Trust Fund so that these citizens will
continue to receive assistance and
Services without any interruptions.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council be and she is hereby directed to
transmit two certified copies of this
resolution to the Ohio General Assembly and Governor Robert Taft
urging them to consider the impact
that these budget cuts will have on
the various social support agencies,
and to restore the funding to these
agencies at their previous levels.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 2476-02.
By Council Member Britt.
An emergency resolution designating Fairview Avenue (aka East
125th
Street)
between
Mayfield
Road and Murray Hill Road a residential permit parking area.
Whereas, the Director of Public
Service has received verified petitions by at least 250 dwelling units
on Fairview Avenue; and
Whereas, the Director of Public
Service has completed a survey of
Fairview Avenue and the surrounding area and has determined that
Fairview Avenue has serious issues
of motor vehicle congestion, particularly by long-term parking of cars
on neighborhood streets by non-residents, combined with a lack of driveways and garages in the neighborhood; and
Whereas, the Director of Public
Service has therefore determined
Fairview Avenue eligible for residential permit parking and has recommended to Council that it designate Fairview Avenue a residential
permit parking area; and
Whereas, Council Member Britt
concurs in said Director’s recommendation; and
Whereas, Fairview Avenue has
otherwise met the objective criteria
set forth in Chapter 461 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio,
1976; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby
designates
Fairview
Avenue
(aka East 125th Street) between
Mayfield Road and Murray Hill
Road a residential permit parking
area, twenty-four (24) hours per
day, seven (7) days per week.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted March 24, 2003.
Effective March 26, 2003.

Res. No. 510-03.
By Council Members Britt, Coats
Jones, White, Reed, Johnson, Jackson, Lewis, Scott, Conwell, Polensek,
Rybka, Cimperman, Cintron, Gordon,
O’Malley, Zone, Westbrook, Brady,
Sweeney and Dolan.
An emergency resolution urging
the State of Ohio to preserve the
spirit and mandates of Ohio’s Protective Services for Adults Law by
opposing any decrease in funding
for this life saving program; urging
the State of Ohio to ensure that any
an all senior eligible for PASSPORT
receive services; and opposing funding cuts to the Senior Community
Services Block Grant.

Whereas, over 77,000 older persons, 60 years of age and older,
reside in the City of Cleveland with
37% of the City’s senior population
75 years of age or older; and
Whereas, approximately 35% of
the City’s seniors live alone and
approximately 39% experience self
care and mobility limitations; and
Whereas, the County’s poverty rate
for older persons is 9.3%, the City’s
poverty rate for seniors is 16.8% and
50% of Cuyahoga County’s poor
elderly live in Cleveland; and
Whereas, the Protective Services
for Adults Law, Ohio Revised Code
Sections 5101.60 — 5101.71, was
passed and implemented in 1981, and
mandates the investigation of adults
age 60 years of age and older who
are reported to be abused, neglected, exploited, and/or self-neglected;
and
Whereas, in Cuyahoga County the
Department of Senior and Adult Services is entrusted with this responsibility; and
Whereas, approximately 50% of
the 2,331 individuals assisted by
Cuyahoga County Adult Protective
Services in 2002 lived in Cleveland;
and
Whereas,
the
PASSPORT
Program, a Medicaid Waiver Home
Care Program, was implemented in
Cuyahoga County in 1990, under the
administration of the Western Reserve Area Agency on Aging, to provide low-income frail and impaired
seniors an alternative to institutional care; and
Whereas, the PASSPORT Program
offers an array of home and community based services which include:
personal
care
and
home
maker
services,
home
delivered
meals, medical transportation, adult
day services, emergency response
systems, case management, assessment, minor home modifications,
respite care and durable medical
equipment; and
Whereas, 52% of the 3,558 PASSPORT clients served in Cuyahoga
County are residents of the City of
Cleveland; and
Whereas,
the
State
of
Ohio’s
Senior Community Services Block
Grant provides funding that assists
older adults who have the greatest
economic and social needs; and
Whereas, in recent years dollars
allocated to this important Block
Grant have lessened and 2003 budget appropriations are 30% less than
in 2001; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council joins
Mayor Jane L. Campbell and the
Cleveland Department of Aging Advisory Council in urging the State
of Ohio to preserve the spirit and
mandates of Ohio’s Protective Services for Adults Law by opposing
any decrease in funding for this life
saving program.
Section 2. That this Council joins
Mayor Jane L. Campbell and the
Cleveland
Department
of
Aging
Advisory Council in urging the State
of Ohio to ensure that any and all
seniors
eligible
for
PASSPORT
receive services without delay to
assist them in remaining independent in their homes.

Section 3. That this Council joins

Whereas, this Council is well
aware of the increasing disparity in

and, in particular, the working poor;
and
Whereas, this Council passed the
Fair Employment Law, Chapter 189

City of Cleveland, Ohio, requiring
employers, under certain circumstances, to pay employees a “living
wage”; and
Whereas, a “living wage” is not
only determined by hourly wages,
but also health care coverage; and
Whereas, this Council has passed
legislation recognizing the rights of
all workers to seek safe and fair
working conditions and to be paid
equitably for their work; and
Whereas, this Council has consistently supported the right of employees to organize and bargain collectively with their employers in good
faith to negotiate fair and equitable
contracts; and

numerous resolutions urging employers to comply with federal and state
labor laws regarding union organization and representation; and

Campaign and Local 47 are fighting
for the rights and working conditions for janitors; and
Whereas, this Council continues to

An emergency resolution supporting the use of race as a factor in determining undergraduate and graduate school admissions and urging
Attorney General Petro to reconsider his refusal to sign a friend of
the court brief on behalf of the Ohio
State University.
Whereas,
in
1978,
the
United
States Supreme Court ruled that public universities could consider race
in
determining
admissions,
but
could not use racial quotas; and
Whereas, the University of Michigan considers race in its admissions
policies for both its undergraduate
programs and law school program;
and
Whereas,
the
United
States
Supreme Court has agreed to hear a
case involving admission policies at
the University of Michigan to determine whether race can be used in
college and graduate school admission practices; and
Whereas, the University of Michigan has maintained the position
that it has the right, and the responsibility, to use race in recruiting students; and
Whereas, the Ohio State University has released a statement supporting the University of Michigan’s
affirmative action policies and stating that it uses race as a “plus factor” in its own admissions; and
Whereas, the Ohio State University planned to file a brief with the
United States Supreme Court in support of the University of Michigan’s
affirmative action policies; and
Whereas, Ohio Attorney General
Jim Petro refused to sign this friend
of the court brief; and
Whereas, Ohio law requires all
state agencies, including public
universities, to be represented in
legal actions by the attorney general; and

The City Record
Whereas, this Council feels that,
in order to increase diversity, race
should be used as a factor in undergraduate
and
graduate
school
admissions and urges Attorney General Petro to reconsider his refusal
to sign a friend of the court brief
on behalf of the Ohio State University; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the use of race as a factor in
determining
undergraduate
and
graduate
school
admissions
and
urges Attorney General Petro to
reconsider his refusal to sign a
friend of the court brief on behalf
of the Ohio State University.

copies of this resolution to Attorney
General Jim Petro and Karen A.
Holbrook, President, the Ohio State
University.
