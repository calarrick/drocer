An emergency resolution urging
the Public Utilities Commission of
Ohio to reject the FirstEnergy Rate
Stabilization Plan as proposed; to
reject any proposal that will harm
government aggregation programs;
and to extend the timetable for its
decision to allow all parties a full
and fair opportunity to analyze
FirstEnergy’s proposal and to participate in the proceedings.
Whereas, FirstEnergy submitted a
Rate Stabilization Plan to the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio
(“the Commission”) on October 21,
2003; and
Whereas,
FirstEnergy’s
plan
would either subject its customers’
electricity needs to a flawed competitive auction process or freeze
the
customers’
present
high-cost
rates for an additional three years,
from January 1, 2006, to December
31, 2008, and permit FirstEnergy to
continue
collecting
the
present
charge
for
so-called
generation

2668

November 26, 2003
“stranded costs” that was scheduled
to end December 31, 2005; and
Whereas, the high cost of power
in northeast Ohio contributes to the
loss of businesses, jobs, and tax revenues for the City, and causes great
hardship to the City’s residents,
many of whom have low to moderate incomes and are on fixed
incomes; and
Whereas, the FirstEnergy plan
would severely restrict and possibly
eliminate the City’s electric aggregation program, which has saved
the City’s Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company (CEI) customers
approximately $3,500,000 since 2001;
and
Whereas, the City’s electric aggregation program is the only alternative to CEI for many City customers
who cannot be served by Cleveland
Public Power; and
Whereas,
the
Commission
has
scheduled its hearing on this important matter for December 17, 2003, a
timetable that will make it impossible for the customers, their representatives, other affected parties,
and the Commission itself to determine whether the plan serves the
best interests of the customers; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes the FirstEnergy Rate Stabilization Plan as proposed; that this
Council urges the Commission to
reject any FirstEnergy proposal
that will harm government aggregation programs; and that this Council urges the Commission to extend
the hearing process to afford all
interested persons a full and fair
opportunity to analyze FirstEnergy’s plan and to participate in the
Commission’s proceedings to determine whether the plan serves the
best interests of FirstEnergy’s customers.
Section 2. The Clerk is directed to
transmit copies of this resolution to
the Chairman and each member of
the Commission, and to all parties
participating in the proceeding.
Section 3. That this resolution is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it

An emergency resolution urging
the Administration to require that
all government facilities and operations energy consumption consist of
at least 5% of renewable energy
resources and to develop a strategic
energy management plan with specific goals for achieving energy efficiency improvements in all government facilities and operations.
Whereas, cities cannot continue
to solely rely on fossil fuels, such
as coal, natural gas, and nuclear

November 26, 2003
fuel, for their energy consumption;
and
Whereas, strictly relying on fossil
fuels for energy consumption has
dramatically reduced the supply of
these natural resources, heavily polluted our atmosphere, and substantially raised overall energy costs;
and
Whereas, harnassing renewable
energy resources, such as wind and
solar power, will provide the same
level
of
energy
services,
save
money, and protect the environment;
and
Whereas, cities, like Austin, Seattle, Chicago, and Oakland, have
made similar commitments to using
renewable energy in their government facilities and operations; and
Whereas, developing a strategic
energy
management
plan
will
improve energy use, save money,
and support the city’s commitment
to renewable energy; and
Whereas, cities, like Portland,
Phoenix, Minneapolis, Memphis, and
Philadelphia, have also developed
their own strategic energy management plans that have greatly scaled
back their energy use and generated millions of dollars in savings for
these cities; and
Whereas, this Council urges the
Administration to commit to using
renewable energy and to developing
a strategic energy management plan
for the city; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Urging the Administration to require that all government
facilities
and

energy
consumption consist of at least 5%

An emergency resolution urging
President Bush to act now to jump
start the economy by immediately
empowering his manufacturing Czar
to help save our cities.
Whereas, many cities facing debilitating budget deficits rely on the
income tax for the majority of their
operational revenues; and
Whereas, cities such as Cleveland
are viable and healthy when residents have jobs; and

The City Record
Whereas, once the heart of rustbelt
vitality,
the
manufacturing
industry has increasingly become a
forgotten economic resource, leaving
hundreds of thousands of manufacturing workers without jobs in the
last ten years and cities without the
needed income tax revenue; and
Whereas, every on manufacturing
job generates three additional service jobs; and
Whereas,
rust-belt
cities
like
Cleveland and Pittsburgh may be
bitter football rivals on Sundays, but
remain intimately joined in their
fight for retaining and creating
these needed manufacturing jobs
the rest of the week; and
Whereas, President Bush used
Labor Day, 2003 and Cleveland as a
platform to announce that he would
create a manufacturing czar to revitalize the manufacturing base and
create more blue-collar jobs; and
Whereas, our City’s survival is
linked to the manufacturing industry, which is worth as much, or
more, than the $87 billion the President is spending on the War in
Iraq; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges President Bush to act now
to jump start the economy by immediately empowering his manufacturing czar to help save our cities.

the

label as a quartet after the departure of Bill Isles in 1967; and

record some of the best R&B pop
hits ever; and
Whereas, during this time, the
O’Jays became known as one of the
best bands in the world; and
Whereas, the 1970’s was truly the
decade of the O’Jays; and
Whereas, from 1972 through 1978,
the O’Jays recorded eight No. 1 R&B
singles; and
Whereas, during this period the
band also had five albums that went
gold and three that went platinum;
and
Whereas, during this period of
successes, the O’Jays also faced one
of their darkest moments as William
Powell, a founding member of the
band, was forced to leave the band
because of terminal cancer; and
Whereas, Sammy Strain became
William Powell’s replacement; and
Whereas, the O’Jays were able to
overcome the loss of one of their
founding members to cancers and
continued to release hits through
the 1980’s and 1990’s; and
Whereas, today, the band continues to perform and bring joy to old
and new fans; and

FANNIE M. LEWIS CLEVELAND
RESIDENT EMPLOYMENT LAW
INITIAL STANDARDS &
PROCEDURES
Under the authority and responsibility vested in the Director of the
Office of Equal Opportunity by Section 188.03 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio 1976, the
Director has created and established, and has caused the publication in the City Record of the following Standards and Procedures
(“Standards”) for administering the
intent of the Fannie M. Lewis Cleveland Resident Employment Law.
They are effective as of and from
December 26, 2003.
PREAMBLE
The Fannie M. Lewis Cleveland
Resident Employment Law, (the
“Resident Employment Law”), Chapter 188 of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio 1976, was enacted as
a temporary measure to alleviate
the lack of employment of City of
Cleveland residents that the Council
of the City of Cleveland found to
exist on City construction projects.
The Council also found that the
employment of City residents on
construction projects funded, in part
or in whole, with City assistance,
will help alleviate unemployment
and poverty in the City. The Resident Employment Law intends to
accomplish the purpose of increasing and maximizing employment of
City residents by requiring a minimum percentage of employee work
time on City construction projects to
be performed by City residents and
low income City residents. The following Standards implement the
Resident Employment Law.
ARTICLE I. DEFINITIONS
1.01 All words, phrases and terms
used in these Standards shall have
the same definitions as contained in
Section 188.01, or if not defined in
Section 188.01, as defined in this
Article I or as the context requires.
1.02 “Certified Payroll Report” is
the form on which a Contractor certifies the number of hours worked
by each of its employees on a contract. The Report shall be U.S.
Department of Labor form WH-347,
or its equivalent, and in a format
specified by the Director.

(c) is a verified non-Ohio Resident
as defined in Section 1.04 of these
Standards.
1.04 “Non-Ohio Resident” means
persons domiciled outside the boundaries of the State of Ohio. Domicile

fixed and permanent home and principal establishment. The Director
will presume that all workers are
Ohio residents unless the contractor
proves that the worker is a non-Ohio
Resident in the manner described in
4.02(a).
1.05 “Referral Source” means a
company or agency that the Director has designated as a source from
which a Contractor may seek referrals of Residents or Low Income
Persons to work on a Construction
Contract. The Director will identify
each Referral Source as either a
Core Source or an Other Source.
1.06 “Referral Source List” is the
list of companies and agencies
approved
by
the
Director,
as
described in Section 1.05 of these
Standards. This list includes both
Core Sources and Other Sources.
1.07 “Referral Source Verification”
is the form, prescribed by the Director and completed by a Referral
Source, that a Contractor must submit with a Request for Reduction to
document its efforts to obtain referrals of Residents and Low Income
Persons from Referral Sources.
1.08 “Request for Reduction” is the
form that a Contractor must complete and submit to seek a reduction
of the Resident Employment Requirement.
1.09 “Resident Construction Worker Hours” means the number of Construction Worker Hours worked by
Residents on a Construction Contract, and includes the number of
hours worked by Residents working
for the Contractor on contracts not
governed by Chapter 188.
1.10 “Resident Employment Requirement” means the percentage of
Construction Worker Hours Residents must work as required by Section 188.02.
1.11 “Serve” or “Service” means to
give notice by certified mail.
1.12 “Skilled and Unskilled Construction Trade Worker” includes all
workers who fit the definition in
Section 188.01 whether or not they
are union workers.
1.13 “Subcontractor(s)” as defined
in 188.01 includes all person, firms,
or companies that agree by contract
to perform any of the work of the
Contractor.

1.03 “Construction Worker Hours”,
as defined in Section 188.01(c),
excludes the hours worked by a Contractor’s or Subcontractor’s employee if the employee:

1.14
“Work
Force
Submission
Schedule” is the Schedule of dates,
each month, when the Work Force
Table is due, as determined by the
Director.

(a) is not a Skilled or Unskilled
Construction Trade Worker; or

1.15 “Work Force Table” is a document identifying the estimated

2675

45
numbers and job classifications of
various Skilled and Unskilled Construction Trade Workers that a Contractor will employ during the performance of a Construction Contract,
separately showing job classification, month, Residents and Low
Income Persons.
1.16 All references in these Standards and Procedures to section or
chapter refer to a section or chapter
of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio 1976 (C.O.) unless otherwise noted.
ARTICLE II. EMPLOYMENT
CITY RESIDENTS

OF

2.01 Contractors must keep proof
of the residency of each worker
whose hours they wish to count
toward the Resident Employment
Requirement, as explained in Section 4.02(a) of these Standards. The
Resident
Construction
Worker
Hours is divided by the Construction
Worker Hours to determine if the
Contractor has met the Resident
Employment Requirement.
2.02 Contractor must use significant efforts in seeking to hire Low
Income Persons. To demonstrate significant efforts, a Contractor must:
(a) Notify appropriate Referral
Sources within an appropriate time
of its need for Low Income Persons;
or
(b) Solicit a sufficient number of

Income
Persons,
including
those referred, to perform the work
identified in the bid specifications;
and
(c) have received no referrals or
an insufficient number of referrals
to enable it to meet the Low Income
Person requirement, and have been
unsuccessful in soliciting a sufficient number of Residents Low
Income Persons to perform the
work, although it received a sufficient number of referrals from the
sources notified.
A potential Contractor or Contractor provides timely notice of the
need for Low Income Persons to
Referral Sources by giving written
notice no less than ten (10) business
days prior to its requirement for
employee(s) to work on the Construction Contract. The Referral
Sources notified shall include at
least three (3) of the Core Sources
identified in the Referral Source
List plus any one (1) Other Source
on the list. If the Contractor seeks
a reduction in the Low Income Persons objective, it shall document its
efforts by submitting to the Director with its Request for Reduction
a Referral Source Verification completed and signed by each source
notified showing either the inability to refer any Low Income Persons
or listing the Low Income Persons
referred, and providing any comments the source may have regarding the request or the availability
of referrals. If a source referred
Low Income Persons, the potential
Contractor or Contractor shall specify the date, time and method of
each of its unsuccessful solicitations
of a Low Income Person to work
and the reason(s) it was unsuccessful. The Contractor may not limit its

ing days of the receipt of the letter
from the Director requesting it; and

2.03 The Low Income Persons
objective is no less than 4% of the
Resident Construction Worker Hours.
A Contractor is not required to hire
Low Income Persons for 4% of all the
Construction Worker Hours.

(d) and revise the initial Work
Force Table at least once a month
on the due dates in the currently
effective Work Force Table Submission Schedule, or more frequently as
necessary to reflect the actual work
force or if the Director requests revisions.

2.04 The hours a Resident works,
between the start date and the substantial completion date of a Construction Contract, for a Contractor
or its Subcontractor(s) on a project
other than the Construction Contract
between the City and the Contractor,
count
toward
the
Resident
Employment Requirement.
2.05 Any Contractor that seeks to
count Cleveland Residents working
on a project for that Contractor
other than its Construction Contract
with the City may only count hours
worked by a Resident towards one
Construction Contract, regardless of
the number of the Contractor’s contemporaneous
Construction
Contracts. The Contractor must submit
the same proof of residence for
those Residents as is required in
section 4.02 (a) of these Standards.
2.06 Any Contractor that seeks to
count the hours worked by a Resident who graduated from an established pre-apprenticeship program
may only count hours worked by the
Resident towards one Construction
Contract regardless of the Contractor’s contemporaneous Construction
Contracts. The Contractor must submit the same proof of residence for
that Resident as is required by 4.02
(a).
2.07 A Contractor that seeks to
count the hours of a Resident working on a project for the Contractor
other than the Construction Contract
between the City and the Contractor
must:
(a) submit certified payrolls documenting the project, date(s) and
number(s) of hours worked by the
Resident for whom the Contractor
wishes to receive credit; and
(b) submit the certified payrolls
at the same time and in the same
manner as the other certified payrolls Chapter 188 requires the Contractor to submit.
2.04 A Contractor may only count
the hours worked by a Resident on
any
one
Construction
Contract
towards that Construction Contract,
regardless of the number of Contractor’s contemporaneous Construction Contracts.
2.05 Contractors may employ as
many additional Residents as they
desire above the Resident Employment Requirement.
2.06 With regard to the Work
Force Table, the Contractor must
submit:
(a) it on the form provided by the
Director;
(b) it in electronic format unless
the Director makes an express written exception;
(c) the initial Work Force Table
to the Director within ten (10) work-

REDUCTIONS;

NO

3.01 The Director may reduce the
minimum percentage of Construction Worker Hours that Section
188.02 requires to be performed by
Residents
employed
or
to
be
employed by a Contractor or potential Contractor on a Construction
Contract only upon the Contractor’s
written request and demonstration
of the high impracticality of complying with that percentage for a
particular contract or contracts or
classes of employees, or upon the
occurrence of serious unforeseen circumstances, as applicable.
3.02 Request.
(a) A potential Contractor may
request a reduction in the Resident
Employment
Requirement
before
construction when there is a high
impracticality of complying. During
construction,
a
Contractor
may
request a reduction in the Resident
Employment
Requirement
based
upon either High Impracticality or
serious unforeseen circumstances.
(b) The potential Contractor or
Contractor shall include with its
Request for Reduction documentation satisfactory to the Director
demonstrating the high impracticality or serious unforeseen circumstance(s) upon which it bases its
request.
3.03 Form of Request.
The potential Contractor or Contractor shall make any reduction
request on a form of affidavit prescribed by the Director.
3.04 High Impracticality.
High impracticality exists when a
potential Contractor or Contractor
has made efforts to the greatest
extent feasible to:
(a) Notify appropriate sources of
referrals within an appropriate time
of its need for Residents; or
(b) Solicit a sufficient number of
Residents, including those referred,
to perform the work identified in
the bid specifications;
and it has received no referrals or
an insufficient number of referrals
to enable it to meet the Resident
Employment requirement, or it has
been unsuccessful in soliciting a
sufficient number of Residents to
perform the work, although it received a sufficient number of referrals from the sources notified.
3.05 Seeking Referrals.
A potential Contractor or Contractor provides timely notice of the
need for Residents to appropriate

2676

Referral Sources by giving written
notice no less than ten business (10)
days prior to its requirement for
employee(s) to work on the Construction Contract. The Referral
Sources notified shall include at
least five (5) of the Core Sources
identified in the Referral Source
List plus any two (2) Other Sources
on the list. If the potential Contractor or Contractor seeks a reduction
in the Resident Employment Requirement, it shall document its
efforts by submitting to the Director with its Request for Reduction
a Referral Source Verification completed and signed by each source
notified showing either the inability to refer any Residents or listing
the Residents referred, and providing any comments the source may
have regarding the request or the
availability of referrals. If a Referral Source referred Residents, the
potential Contractor or Contractor
shall specify the date, time and
method of each of its unsuccessful
solicitations of a Resident to work
and the reason(s) it was unsuccessful.
3.06 Serious
stances.

Unforeseen

Circum-

“Serious unforeseen circumstances”
are events occurring after submission of a bid, including but not limited to new governmental regulations, national or natural disasters,
war and/or other disastrous events
and other occurrences beyond control of the potential Contractor or
Contractor such as unavailability of
Residents for particular trade(s) or
craft(s) needed for the Contract and
approved change orders changing
the Contract scope of work. Those
circumstances
must
prevent
the
potential Contractor or Contractor
from employing sufficient Residents
to meet the Resident Employment
requirement. If the Contractor has
started the construction work under
the Contract or any other concurrent
contract under which the Contractor
employs
Residents,
the
circumstances must prevent the Contractor
from meeting the Resident Employment Requirement.
3.07 Evaluation of a Request for
Reduction; Determination.
In evaluating a reduction request, the Director shall determine
whether a Contractor or Subcontractor has made efforts to the greatest
extent feasible to meet the Resident
Employment requirement. The Director will consider it has exerted such
efforts if it has:
(a) timely sought referrals from
sources in the Referral Source List;
(b) solicited the Residents referred; and
(c) documented its efforts to the
Director’s satisfaction.
The Director may also consider
any comment a Referral Source may
make regarding the request and any
other factors he considers relevant
to his determination. The Director
shall evaluate each Request for
Reduction and issue a determination
on it within ten (10) business days
after receiving it.

The City Record

November 26, 2003
The Director may consider a
reduction appropriate when a Contractor or potential Contractor has
made efforts to the greatest extent
feasible
to
meet
the
Resident
Employment Requirement, but has
been
unsuccessful
in
doing
so.
Those unsuccessful efforts satisfactorily demonstrate high impracticality.
3.08 No Waiver of Requirement.
The Director may not waive the
entire Resident Employment Requirement of Chapter 188 by granting one or more reduction requests,
or by any other means.
ARTICLE IV. MONITORING; RECORDS AND REPORTING

Income

Persons

Docu-

Documents that verify the status
of a Resident as a Low Income Person are, at least, an award letter or
other record document showing entitlement to unemployment compensation,
Veteran’s
Administration,
Workers’ Compensation, Social Security, Social Security I, Welfare,
Retirement or other similar benefits
and the name, address, telephone
and fax numbers of the Resident’s
employer, if any, and indicating the
Resident’s actual income for the
twelve (12) months prior to the hire
date. Low Income Persons verification may also include other documents that the Director determines
verify Low Income status.
(c) Certified Payroll Reports

4.01 Monitoring
The Director must separately monitor Contractors’ and Subcontractors’
use of Residents in Skilled and
Unskilled Construction Trade Worker positions on each Construction
Contract. He must report his findings in writing to the City Council
Clerk, the City Council President
and to the City Council Employment, Affirmative Action and Training Committee bi-monthly.
4.02 Contractor’s
Maintain Records

Obligation

to

The Contractor must maintain all
records that document its employment of Residents and Low Income
Persons under each Construction
Contract and under all its contemporaneous contracts from which it
counts Residents toward the requirements of Chapter 188 for Resident Employment and the Low
Income Persons employment. The
Contractor and all its Subcontractors
must maintain copies of all documents that support and demonstrate
the actual residence of record of
every Resident and the Low Income
status of every Low Income Person
the Contractor and all its Subcontractors employ. Each Contractor is
responsible to ensure that its Subcontractors maintain all required
personnel documents.

Record

Docu-

Documents that demonstrate the
residence of record of a Resident
are, at least two of the three following documents:
(1) a driver’s license or a federal,
state, or local government or government agency with a color photograph of the Resident; or
(2) a Voter’s Registration Card; or
(3) a utility bill showing the Resident’s name and address and other
documents that the Director determines establish residence.
When the Director has reason to
doubt, or there is a lack of clarity,
whether an employee is a Resident
of the City, the Director may, without advance notice, require the Contractor or Subcontractor to provide
affidavits or other documentation
either identified in the List of
Approved Residency Documents or
otherwise satisfactory to the Director as sufficient to support the claim
of residence.

The Contractor must submit certified payroll reports to the Director
monthly during the performance of
every Construction Contract, in the
form of U.S. Department of Labor
form WH-347 or equivalent, as determined by the Director, and in an
electronic
computer
format
prescribed by the Director in the Invitation to Bid for the Construction
Contract.
The
certified
payroll
report must clearly identify the
actual residence of every employee
on each certified payroll and, the
first time an employee’s name appears on a payroll, must include
after his or her name the employee’s
hire date. A post office box as an
employee’s address in a Certified
Payroll Report is not sufficient to
verify that an employee is a Resident.

with
the
requirements of the Resident Employment Law, as implemented by these
Standards and Procedures.
4.04 Contractor’s Resident Employment Officer
The Contractor must designate a
principal officer (the “Resident Employment Officer”) of its organization as the person responsible for
administering the requirements that
Chapter 188 imposes on the Contractor and its Subcontractors under
a Construction Contract and as the
principal liaison and point of communication with the City. The Resident
Employment
Officer
must
meet with the Director or his
designee first before the start of
construction and, after that meeting,
at least quarterly and as requested
by
the
Director.
The
Resident
Employment Officer will work with
the Director or his designee to
ensure the Contractor’s and its Subcontractors’ compliance with the
Resident Employment Law. The
Director may notify the Contractor
whenever, during the Construction
Contract, the Director believes the
Contractor may not meet any Resident Employment Law obligation.
The Contractor has primary responsibility
for
meeting
the
Law’s
requirements and goals; appointment of a Resident Employment
Officer does not relieve it of that
responsibility.

4.03 Records Retention And Access
(a) Retention.
A Contractor and Subcontractor
working on a City Construction Contract must maintain and retain during performance of the contract and
for three (3) years after final completion of the work the personnel
and residence data required by the
Resident Employment Law or otherwise relevant, as determined by the
Director, to establish the employment, the residence of record, or
Low Income status, as applicable, of
each person it employs to perform
work under the contract. “Final completion of the work” means and
includes the completion of all contract work and expiration of the
one-year guarantee period after completion required by Section 185.40
C.O. If there are audit irregularities
in the records, the Director may
extend the retention period in writing as he determines necessary.
(b) Access.
Every Contractor and Subcontractor working on a City Construction

Standards and Procedures.

PENALTY

VI.

VIOLATION

AND

6.01 Upon the final acceptance of
the Construction Contract work by
the user department director under
Section 185.39, the Director will consider the work completed and will
determine whether the Contractor
has achieved the Resident Employment Requirement. If the Director
determines that the Contractor has
not then achieved the Requirement,
as reduced by any reduction the
Director
previously
granted,
the
Contractor has breached its obligation to meet the Requirement. For
the breach, the Contractor shall pay
the City a penalty of one-eighth of
one
percent
of
the
final
total
amount of the Construction Contract
for each full percentage point by
which the Contractor has fallen
short of achieving the Resident
Employment Requirement.
6.02 If the Contractor fails to meet
the Low Income Persons objective,
the Director shall determine if a
penalty is appropriate. A penalty is
appropriate if the Contractor has not

48
used significant efforts to hire Low
Income People, as described in Section 2.02 of these Standards.
6.03 If the Director determines
that a penalty is appropriate for a
Contractor’s failure to meet the Low
Income Persons objective, the Contractor shall pay one-eighth of one
percent of the final total amount of
the Construction Contract for each
percentage of shortfall toward the
Low Income Persons objective.

The City Record
contract awarded to the Contractor
within five years of a violation.
This bond requirement shall be in
addition to any other surety bond
requirements in the Codified Ordinances. The Director will make a
recommendation about whether or
not to impose the surety bond
requirement
to
the
department
director(s) entering into the Construction Contract on behalf of the
City.
6.08 Miscellaneous

6.04 Failure to submit Work Force
Table or any of the reports required
by Section 188.04 shall be a breach
of the Construction Contract. A Contractor has failed to submit a
required report when:
(a) for reports requested by the
Director, a Contractor does not submit the report within ten (10) working days of the Contractor’s receipt
of the Director’s request.
(b) for reports the Contractor is
responsible to update, the update is
not submitted when it is due.
The penalty for failure to submit
a Work Force Table or reports is
the maximum penalty described in
Section 6.03 of these Standards. The
Director must calculate the penalty
as
if
no
Residents
had
been
employed on the Construction Contract.
6.05 (a) Knowing falsification by
the Contractor of any reports, statements, or payroll certifications is a
breach of the Construction Contract
and a misdemeanor of the First
Degree.
(b) The penalty for breach is the
penalty in Section 6.01 of these Standards. The Director must calculate
the penalty as if no Residents had
been employed on the project.
(c) If the Director finds evidence
of knowing falsification, he shall
submit that evidence to the City
Prosecutor. Any Contractor convicted of knowing falsification under
Chapter 188 shall be barred from
contracting with the City for five
years on any Construction Contract.
6.06 Any person who knowingly
supplies false information to establish that the person is a Resident
for purposes of Chapter 188 is guilty
of a misdemeanor of the first
degree. If the Director has information that a person has knowingly
supplied false information to establish that he or she is a Resident, the
Director shall report that information to the prosecutor. Anyone convicted of knowingly supplying false
information to establish that the
person is a Resident is barred from
working on a Construction Contract
for five (5) years. The Director will
keep a list of all persons barred
from working on a Construction
Contract. The Contractor isresponsible to ensure that it does not employ
any persons on the list.
6.07 Any violation of Chapter 188
may also result in the City imposing a requirement that the Contractor post a surety bond or other
appropriate security in an amount
that is twenty percent (20%) of the
contract price for any subsequent

(a) With or without the recommendation
of
the
Director,
the
department director(s) that entered
into the Construction Contract may
withhold any retainage pending a
determination of whether or not the
Contractor must pay a penalty, even
beyond expiration of the guarantee
period. The Construction Contract
department director(s) may withhold this retainage for such time as
necessary for the Director to make
a determination as to whether or not
to impose a penalty on the Contractor, and to ensure payment of the
penalty.
(b) The City may choose to pursue other claims not covered in
Chapter 188 against any Contractor.
The Director’s imposition of a penalty or fine under this Chapter does
not preclude the City from exercising any other rights or remedies.
The fact that the Director has not
imposed a penalty or fine under the
Resident Employment Law is not a
waiver of the City’s right to pursue
other claims against the Contractor.
(c) The Director is responsible for
enforcement of a Contractor’s compliance with its obligations under
the Resident Employment Law.
6.09 Deposit of Funds. In order to
use the funds deposited into this
special account, the Director will
have to obtain legislative authority
for any use for which he would normally be required to obtain legislative authority.
ARTICLE VII. HEARING; APPEAL
PROCESS
7.01. A Contractor or Subcontractor timely appeals a written finding by the Director or his designee
that the contractor or subcontractor
is not demonstrating that it will
employ or has employed a sufficient number of Residents to meet
the Resident Employment Requirement on the Project, or that a Contractor or Subcontractor has not
sufficiently demonstrated that an
employee of the Contractor or Subcontractor is a Resident or a Low
Income Person, whichever applies,

By Council Members Jones, Reed,
Scott, Jackson, Brady, Britt Cimperman, Cintron, Coats, Conwell, Dolan,
Gordon, Johnson, Lewis, O’Malley,
Polensek, Rybka, Sweeney, Westbrook, White and Zone.
An emergency resolution acknowledging the role that the “Amber
Alert” system provides in assisting
law enforcement agencies with child
kidnapping situations and stating
the Public Safety Committee’s intention to hold a hearing reviewing the
City of Cleveland’s “Amber Alert”
system.
Whereas, “Amber Alert” is a missing child response program that utilizes the resources of law enforcement and media to notify the public
when children are kidnapped; and
Whereas, the “Amber Alert” system was created and developed in
response to the tragic 1996 kidnapping and murder of nine-year-old
Amber
Hagerman
in
Arliginton,
Texas; and
Whereas, the “Amber Alert” system is now operational in Ohio; and
Whereas, the “Amber Alert” system may only be implemented by a
law enforcement agency; and
Whereas, law enforcement agencies activate an “Amber Alert” by
notifying broadcast media of the
kidnapping; and
Whereas,
upon
receipt
of
an
“Amber Alert”, radio and television
stations interrupt regularly scheduled
programming to notify the public
that a child has been kidnapped; and
Whereas, the “Amber Alert” system is an effective tool that assists
law enforcement in responding to
child kidnapping situations; and
Whereas, it is important for this
Council to understand the operation
of the “Amber Alert” system within
the City of Cleveland and to be
familiar with the City of Cleveland
Department of Public Safety’s protocol as it pertains to child kidnapping situations and the decision to
issue an “Amber Alert”; and
Whereas, it is appropriate for the
Public Safety Committee to hold a
hearing and conduct a review of the
City of Cleveland’s “Amber Alert”
system; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
acknowledges the role that the
“Amber Alert” system provides in
assisting law enforcement agencies
with child kidnapping situations
and, in order to better understand
the use and operation of the “Amber
Alert” system, this Council will,
through the Public Safety Committee, hold a hearing reviewing the
City of Cleveland’s “Amber Alert”
system.
Section 2. That this Council encourages the Mayor to meet with the
Northern Ohio Amber Alert Review
Committee to discuss amendments to
the “Amber Alert” system.
Section 3. That this Council recommends than an “Amber Alert” be
issued whenever a child twelve
years of age or younger has been
missing for a period of at least
twelve hours.
Section 4. That this Council recommends that police command staff
be given flexibility to make deci-

2681

51
sions regarding the issuance of an
“Amber Alert” in any case involving
a missing child.
Section 5. That this Council recommends the use of flexibility in
considering
factors
such
as
a
change in the usual and customary
pattern of behavior of a missing
child, and the time limit used to
determine whether an “Amber Alert”
should be issued.
Section 6. That this Council recommends that the Northern Ohio
Amber
Alert
Review
Committee
reconsider the criteria of a “sighted
abduction” prior to the issuance of
an “Amber Alert.”
Section 7. That this Council recommends that an “Amber Alert” be
issued whenever a mentally-challenged child of any age has been
missing for any period of time.
Section 8. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Res. No. 2256-03.
By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency resolution objecting to the transfer of ownership of
a D5 and D6 Liquor Permit to 4114
John Avenue.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Department of Liquor
Control of an application for the
transfer of ownership of a D5 and
D6 Liquor Permit from LDJ Foods,

and Patio, 4114 John Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44113, Permanent Number
4949425 to Two Bridges Tavern, Inc.,
DBA Two Bridges Tavern, Inc., 1st
& 2nd Floors and Basement and
Patio, 4114 John Avenue, Cleveland,
Ohio
44113,
Permanent
Number
9122325; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based on
other legal grounds as set forth in
Revised Code Section 4303.292; and

52
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of
notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

An emergency resolution opposing
the Free Trade Area of the Americas trade agreement.
Whereas, the Free Trade Area of
the Americas (“FTAA”) is an effort
to unite the economies of the Western Hemisphere into a single Free
Trade Zone; and
Whereas, the FTAA is an expansion of the North American Free
Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”); and
Whereas, negotiations surrounding the FTAA have not occurred in
a forum that provides for effective
public evaluation and input; and
Whereas, like NAFTA, the FTAA
contains an investment clause that
provides corporations the right to
sue foreign governments for compensation if they believe corporate
investments have been harmed by
“regulatory takings”; and
Whereas, this provision and other
provisions in the FTAA will threaten clean air, clean water, and the
preservation of ecosystems; and
Whereas, the FTAA does not protect the right of employees to organize and bargain collectively; and
Whereas, trade ministers from
thirty-four nations are scheduled to
meet in Miami, Florida to negotiate
the FTAA on November 20th and
November 21st; and
Whereas, demonstrations are being
planned
by
organized
labor
in
Miami to express growing opposition to the FTAA; and

The City Record
Whereas, rallies and marches are
being planned throughout the United
States to support fair trade, not the
FTAA; and
Whereas, the Cleveland AFL-CIO
and other groups will hold one such
rally and march in Public Square in
Cleveland on Thursday, November
20th; and
Whereas, free trade agreements
should ensure decent wages and
working conditions, affordable services, and adequate enforcement of
environmental, health, and safety
laws for all workers; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council is
opposed to the proposed Free Trade
Area of the Americas trade agreement.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to President
George
W.
Bush,
U.S.
Senator
Michael
DeWine,
U.S.
Senator
George Voinovich, Congresswoman

Res. No. 2258-03.
By Council Members Coats, Cintron, Westbrook, Gordon, Polensek
and Dolan.
An emergency resolution encouraging the Bush Administration to
continue the protective steel tariffs
and allow the protective steel tariffs
to operate through their original
three year term.
Whereas, the proud tradition of
steelmaking is a vital part of our
community’s history and identity,
and our local economy is still largely linked to the steel industry as a
provider of quality jobs; and
Whereas, a thorough Section 201
investigation by the International
Trade Commission (“ITC”) concluded that American steel companies,
communities, families and other nonsteel manufacturing operations were
injured as a result of illegallydumped foreign steel, and the ITC
recommended immediate action by
the U.S. Department of Commerce to
curb the illegal dumping of foreign
steel in U.S. markets; and
Whereas, after receiving the ITC’s
report and carefully considering a
number of remedies, the Department
of Commerce and the Bush Administration instituted limited tariffs on
specific steel products for a period
of three years; and
Whereas, the World Trade Organization has determined that these
limited tariffs violate global trade
rules; and
Whereas, the World Trade Organization ruling becomes final in
December; and

2682

November 26, 2003
Whereas, the Bush Administration
has not yet decided whether or not
to lift the tariffs; and
Whereas, enactment of the tariffs
has slowed the illegal dumping of
foreign steel and allowed American
steelmakers and their employees to
partially recover from the crises
sparked in 1998 by illegally dumped
foreign steel; and
Whereas, if the steel industry is
to survive, recovery must be able to
continue; and
Whereas, the American steel industry is currently in a state of widescale restructuring and consolidation
that
will
eventually
enable
the
remaining American steel companies
to compete effectively in an increasingly global marketplace; and
Whereas, this Council supports
the continuation of these protective
tariffs through their original three
year term; and
Whereas, premature ending of
these protective tariffs will have
devastating consequences in the
Cleveland area as many individuals,
families, and business rely on the
steel manufacturing industry and
related industries for jobs and business; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council hereby encourages the Bush Administration to continue the protective
steel tariffs and allow the protective
steel tariffs to operate through their
original three year term.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to President
George W. Bush and the United
States Secretary of Commerce.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

the state legislature, when considering Sub. H.B. No. 218 regarding

Whereas, on November 13, 2003,
the state House of Representatives
introduced substitute House Bill 218;
and
Whereas, Sub. H.B. 218 speaks to
the state’s coastal management program and its effect on the rights of

structures on such property; and
Whereas, the use of all property
fronting Lake Erie is of great interest and concern to local municipalities located on the lake; and

An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Public Health to
enter into one or more mutual aid
agreements with other political subdivisions in the State of Ohio for reciprocal public health services for

assistance in the event of any hazard too great to be dealt with unassisted.
Whereas, in light of the events of
September 11, 2001 and the potential
for future biological or chemical
attacks and the increasing incidences
of contagious diseases, there may be
times, because of similar emergency
circumstances, that the Boards of
Health or Health Departments of various Health Districts need additional
environmental health, nursing, and
other public health services readily
available to them; and
Whereas, Section 5502.29 of the
Revised Code permits political subdivisions,
in
collaboration
with
other public and private agencies
within the state, to develop mutual
aid arrangements, consistent with
rules adopted under Section 5502.25
of the Revised Code, for reciprocal
emergency management aid and
assistance in case of any hazard too
great to be dealt with unassisted;
and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of

one or more mutual aid agreements
with other political subdivisions in
the State of Ohio for reciprocal public health services for emergency
management aid and assistance in
the event of any hazard too great to
be dealt with unassisted.
Section 2. That in any such mutual aid agreement or agreements, the
Director of Public Health shall
retain authority to determine the
extent of aid committed and to
decline to respond to a request for
mutual aid if the aid requested

November 26, 2003
interferes with the Department of
Public Health’s ability to provide
the proper level of services to its
own constituency. In addition, no
funds shall be paid to reciprocating
political subdivisions of the State
for the performance of mutual aid
services by them to the City, and
each participating political subdivision shall hold the City immune
from liability for any mutual aid
rendered under the agreement or
agreements. The Director of Law
shall review all such agreements to
determine that the terms and conditions are appropriate and consistent
with the City’s interests.
Section 3. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all

An emergency ordinance authorizing the execution and delivery of an
Amendment and Restatement of Cooperative Agreement in connection
with the refinancing of revenue
bonds issued by the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority to
finance costs of construction of the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and
Museum, and authorizing and approving related matters.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
(the “City”), the County of Cuyahoga (the “County”), the ClevelandCuyahoga County Port Authority
(the “Port Authority”) and the Rock
and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum,
Inc. (the “Museum”) entered into a
Cooperative Agreement dated as of

2691

61
February 26, 1993 (the “Cooperative
Agreement”) pursuant to special
state legislation to provide for the
ownership, financing, construction,
maintenance and operation of the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (the
“Rock Hall”) as a Port Authority
educational and cultural facility to
be owned by the Port Authority and
leased to the Museum; and
Whereas, pursuant to that Cooperative Agreement, the Port Authority issued $38,995,000 Revenue Bonds
(Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and
Museum Project) (the “Series 1993
Bonds”) which were issued and
delivered on May 20, 1993 to finance
a portion of the costs of construction of the Rock Hall and were subsequently refunded by the Port Authority by the issuance of $34,855,000
Refunding Revenue Bonds, Series
1997 (Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
and Museum Project) (the “Series
1997 Refunding Bonds” and collectively with the Series 1993 Bonds,
the “Bonds”) to establish a fixed
interest rate for the financing; and
Whereas, pursuant to the Cooperative Agreement and the Trust
Indentures entered into in connection with the Bonds (individually, a
“Trust Indenture” and collectively,
the “Trust Indentures”), provision
was made for payment of the principal of, premium, if any and interest on the Bonds (“Bond Service
Charge”) through the levy by the
County of an additional bed tax of
1-1/2% on transactions by which
lodging by a hotel is or is to be furnished to transient guests within
the County (the “Bed Tax”); and
Whereas, the payment of Bond
Service Charges was further secured
by a pledge by the Museum to
charge an admissions surcharge of
3% on all admissions to the Museum to be paid by the Museum to the
Trustee under the Trust Indentures
(and, in any event, in a minimum
annual
aggregate
amount
of
$224,000) and also to pay to that
Trustee the proceeds of any corporate sponsorships entered into by
the Museum in connection with the
operation of the Rock Hall; and
Whereas, the Museum has requested the City, the County and the
Port Authority to amend the Cooperative Agreement to permit the
Port Authority to refinance the
Series 1997 Refunding Bonds because the Bed Tax collections are
sufficient
to
pay
Bond
Service
Charges on the Bonds without the
Museum’s admissions surcharge and
corporate sponsorships and because
the Museum needs the revenue
derived from the admissions surcharge and corporate sponsorships
to pay operation, maintenance and
capital costs of the Rock Hall; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of the public
peace, property, health or safety in
that authorizing and executing the
Amendment
and
Restatement
of
Cooperative Agreement and refunding the Series 1997 Refunding Bonds
at the earliest possible time will
strengthen an important cultural and
economic development facility within the City by providing additional
revenue necessary to pay operation,
maintenance and capital costs of the
Rock Hall; now, therefore,
