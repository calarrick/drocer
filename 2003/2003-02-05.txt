60519, the City has the right to cancel the contract without cause upon
fifteen (15) days written notice

Res. No. 92-03.
By Council Members Cimperman
and Zone.
An emergency resolution supporting diversity training programs and
encouraging Senator White, President of the Ohio Senate, to complete
a diversity training program; and
inviting Senator White to visit the
City of Cleveland and surrounding
communities and tour its diverse
neighborhoods.
Whereas,
Ohio
Senator
Doug
White is the current President of
the Ohio Senate; and
Whereas, there are allegations
that Senator White’s history reflects
a lack of racial sensitivity and culture awareness; and
Whereas, Mayor Rhine McLin, a
former State of Ohio lawmaker, has
indicated
that
Senator
White
engaged in behavior that was offensive to her and is connected with an
old stereotype that rubbing a black
person can bring good fortune; and
Whereas, Senator White has conceded making “Jew them down”
comments; and
Whereas, such a comment was
made by Senator White this past
fall during a meeting in the Cleveland area; and
Whereas, Senator White has indicated to the Cleveland Plain Dealer
that the comments were not said “in
any negative connotation”; and
Whereas, these comments of Senator White, regardless of intent or
motive, are offensive to many Ohio
citizens and fail to recognize the
racial, culture and religious diversity of the citizens of the State of
Ohio; and
Whereas, this Council feels that
diversity training programs are valuable in that such programs educate
individuals about racial, cultural,
and religious differences and the
type of comments and behavior that
may offend other individuals; and

246

February 5, 2003
Whereas, without the benefit of
diversity training programs many
individuals are not aware of comments and behaviors that may be
offensive; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland is
a diverse City and its citizens represent many different racial, culture, and religious backgrounds; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland is
proud of its diverse neighborhoods
and the racial, cultural, and religious sensitivity and awareness of
its citizens; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports diversity training programs
and
encourages
Senator
White, President of the Ohio Senate,
to complete a diversity training program.
Section 2. That this Council hereby invites Senator White to visit the
City of Cleveland and surrounding
communities and tour its diverse
neighborhoods.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Senator
White and all members of the Ohio
Senate and Ohio House of Representatives representing the City of
Cleveland.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

An emergency resolution supporting men and women serving in the
armed forces and honoring their
commitment to our nation’s safety
and security; opposing unilateral
military action against Iraq and
urging President Bush to continue
seeking a peaceful resolution of
issues with Iraq in a diplomatic
manner.
Whereas, the United Nations is in
the process of conducting weapon
inspections in Iraq; and
Whereas, it has not been proven
that the issues with Iraq cannot be
resolved by traditional diplomatic
efforts; and
Whereas, more time may be necessary to resolve issues in a diplomatic manner; and
Whereas, military action against
Iraq would result in the loss of civilian lives, as well as the deaths of
Iraqi and U.S. military personnel; and
Whereas, military action against
Iraq will cost billions of dollars at
a time when the American economy
is struggling and at a time when
the federal government is operating
with a deficit; and

February 5, 2003
Whereas, the State of Ohio is facing deficit situations and budget
constraints; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland is
also facing serious financial problems; and
Whereas, while making preparations for a costly war against Iraq,
the Bush Administration is proposing a tax cut for the very wealthy
and this tax cut will result in less
dollars being provided for education,
health care, aid to American cities,
and desperately needed social services; and
Whereas, military action in Iraq
will divert attention from economic
issues and challenges confronting
the American people and American
cities; and
Whereas,
resolutions
opposing
military action against Iraq have
been adopted by numerous City
Councils including, Chicago, Detroit,
Philadelphia, Baltimore, San Francisco, Albuquerque, New Haven, Seattle, and Gary, Indiana; and
Whereas, the National Council of

An emergency resolution urging
Governor Taft to reconsider cutting
a total of $30 million from the Local

249

55
Government
Fund,
the
Local
Government
Revenue
Assistance
Fund and the Local Government
and Library Fund, which would
result in a reduction in day-to-day
services and security for local constituents.
Whereas, Governor Taft recently
delivered his fifth State of the State
message to a joint session of the
Ohio General Assembly; and
Whereas, in his State of the State
speech, Governor Taft asked legislators to expect drastic measures to
be taken as the state develops its
new biennial budget; and
Whereas, one drastic measure the
governor has asked legislators to
consider is cutting local government
and library assistance by $30 million
dollars; and
Whereas, this $30 million cut
would result in losses of aid totaling $19 million for local governments such as Cleveland, and $11
million to libraries; and
Whereas, a cut in the aid Cleveland and other local governments
receive would mean less money for
necessary and important municipal
functions such as safety and fire
departments and recreation; and
Whereas, less money to local
libraries could mean that libraries
in our communities cut services and
hours; and
Whereas, by eliminating aid to
local governments and libraries, it
will be the people in our communities that ultimately suffer the loss
of services, from public safety, to
recreation services to full access to
libraries; and
Whereas, local governments and
the library system are already facing deficits and will be unable to
bridge the gap left by a $30 million
dollar cut in financial assistance;
and
Whereas, it is highly unlikely that
such a cut in local government and
library aid will make the state of
Ohio more fiscally secure; it will,
however, make it more difficult for
local constituents to receive necessary day-to-day services and security; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges Governor Taft to reconsider cutting a total of $30 million from
the Local Government Fund, the
Local Government Revenue Assistance Fund and the Local Government and Library Fund which would
result in a reduction in day-to-day
services and security for local constituents.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
