An emergency resolution acknowledging “Matricula Consular” as personal
identification
for
Mexican
nationals living in Cleveland, and
urging Mayor Campbell’s administration and local financial institutions to do the same.
Whereas, the government of Mexico issues to its nationals living
abroad a form of Consular identification known as “Matricula Consular”; and

issues the Matricula Consular as a
form of personal identification in
about 46 cities across the country to
Mexican nationals residing in the
United States for a least six months
who submit a birth certificate, proper photo identification and fingerprints; and
Whereas, the acceptance of Consular I.D. cards as legal identification in Cleveland will provide Mexican nationals living in our city the
assurance that they need not pay
exorbitant fees for sending money
home to their relatives, or fear to call
the police and report a crime; and
Whereas,
financial
institutions
across the Midwest have agreed to
accept the Matricula Consular as a
form of identification; and

Section 3. Terms of Bonds. The

issuance or such other date as is
designated in the Certificate of
Award. The Bonds shall mature on
the dates and in the respective principal amounts to be determined by
the Director of Finance in the Certificate of Award in accordance with
his determination of the best interest of, and financial advantages to,
the City; provided that the final
maturity date shall be not later than
30 years from the date of issuance
of the Bonds. The Bonds shall bear
interest from their date at the rate
or rates per year set forth in the
Certificate of Award, or if any
Bonds bear interest at a variable
rate, at the rate determined pursuant to the method set forth in the
Certificate of Award. Interest on the
Bonds shall be payable on the dates
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance in the Certificate of Award,
and the Bonds shall bear interest at
those
rates
until
the
principal
amount of the Bonds is paid or payment is provided for. If any Bonds

basis of a 360-day year consisting of

shall be payable not more often

may be issued at the same or different times. The Bonds of each
series shall be designated as provided in the applicable Certificate of
Award. A separate Certificate of
Award may be delivered for each

June 18, 2003
Series.In the event that the Director
of Finance, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, determines that the City’s best interests
will be served by causing all or a
portion of the Bonds to be obligations bearing interest at variable
rates, redeemable by the City without penalty or premium on interest
adjustment dates, then the Director
of Finance is authorized to so specify in the Certificate of Award. If
the Director of Finance so determines, then the Director of Finance
shall specify in the Certificate of
Award the method and procedure by
which the variable rate of interest
to be borne by the variable rate
Bonds shall be determined, whether
by reference to a market index, by
a remarketing agent or otherwise;
provided that the variable rate
Bonds shall not bear interest at a
rate in excess of sixteen percent
(16%) per year. Notwithstanding
that limitation, Bonds held by a
provider of a Credit Support Instrument may bear interest at a rate not
in excess of twenty-five percent
(25%) per year as provided in the

Credit Support Instrument. Holders
of variable rate Bonds may be given
the right to tender their variable
rate Bonds for purchase by the City
at the times, on the terms, and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Certificate of Award and any tender
agreement; provided that tender
rights shall be exercisable only at
such times as a Credit Support
Instrument is in place that provides
for the payment of the purchase
price payable to the tendering holder of a variable rate Bond. If the
Director of Finance designates any
Bonds as variable rate Bonds, and
if the holders of the variable rate
Bonds are to be entitled to tender
the variable rate Bonds for purchase, then the Director of Finance
shall also designate in the Certificate of Award for those variable
rate Bonds the provider or providers
for any Credit Support Instrument,
the tender agent or agents and the
remarketing agent or agents, which
designations shall be based on the
determination of the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the parties so designated possess
the requisite resources and experience to provide the services required
of them and that the terms on which
the designated parties have agreed
to provide such services are fair and
commercially reasonable. The Director of Finance is authorized to enter
into agreements in connection with
the delivery of the variable rate
Bonds, and from time to time thereafter so long as the variable rate
Bonds
are
outstanding,
with
providers of Credit Support Instruments, tender agents (which may be
the Trustee), remarketing agents,
and others as may be determined by
the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the method of
determining the variable interest
rates, permitting holders the right
of tender, providing for liquidity or
credit support for the payment of
the variable rate Bonds upon tender
for purchase or redemption, and providing for the repayment by the
City of any amounts drawn under
the Credit Support Instrument.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of
the Bonds, and regardless of the
Bonds bearing interest at variable

The City Record
or fixed rates, is authorized to contract for one or more Credit Support
Instruments, and to pay their costs
from proceeds of the Bonds, if he
determines that the Credit Support
Instrument
or
Instruments
will
result in a savings in the cost of
this financing to the City, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor.
The Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, shall further determine and
specify in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds are subject to optional redemption prior to
maturity, the earliest date on which
redeemable Bonds shall be subject
to prior redemption, which shall not
be later than ten years from the
first interest payment date, and the
applicable redemption premium for
the redeemable Bonds, which shall
be not greater than 103% of the
principal amount redeemed.
Section 4. Registration, Transfer
and Exchange. The Bonds shall be
issued
only
as
fully
registered
Bonds. The Trustee shall act as the
authenticating
agent,
registrar,
transfer agent, and paying agent for
the Bonds, except as otherwise provided in the Trust Agreement.
Principal of the Bonds shall be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
office of the Trustee designated in
the Trust Agreement. Interest on
each Bond shall be paid on each
interest payment date by check or
draft mailed to the person in whose
name the Bond was registered, and
to that person’s address appearing
on the Register (defined below in
this Section) at the close of business
on the record date provided in the
Trust Agreement. The Trustee shall
maintain and keep all books and
records necessary for the registration, exchange, and transfer of
Bonds as provided in the Trust
Agreement (the “Register”) so long
as any of the Bonds remain outstanding. Subject to the provisions
in the Trust Agreement, the person
in whose name a Bond is registered
on the Register shall be regarded as
the absolute owner of that Bond for
all purposes of the Proceedings.
Payment of or on account of the
debt charges on any Bond shall be
made only to or upon the order of
that person; neither the City nor the
Trustee shall be affected by any
notice to the contrary, but the registration may be changed as provided in the Trust Agreement. All
such payments shall be valid and
effectual to satisfy and discharge
the City’s liability upon the Bond,
including interest, to the extent of
the amount or amounts so paid.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
and so long as the Bonds are issued
in a book entry system, principal of
and interest on the Bonds shall be
payable in the manner provided in
any agreement entered into by the
Director of Finance, in the name
and on behalf of the City, in connection with the book entry system.
Bonds may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the office designated by the
Trustee, together with a request for
exchange signed by the registered
owner
or
by
a
person
legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Trustee.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book

1453

31
entry system is utilized, (i) the
Bonds may be issued in the form of
a single, fully registered Bond representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the book entry
interest owners of Bonds in book
entry form shall have no right to
receive Bonds in the form of physical securities or certificates; (iii)
ownership of book entry interests in
book entry form shall be shown by
book entry on the system maintained and operated by the Depository and its Participants, and transfers of the ownership of book entry
interests shall be made only by book
entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv) the Bonds as
such shall not be transferable or
exchangeable, except for transfer to
another Depository or to another
nominee of a Depository, without
further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Director of Finance, after
making provision for notification of
the book entry interest owners by
the then Depository and any other
arrangements
deemed
necessary,
shall permit withdrawal of the
Bonds from the Depository, and
authenticate and deliver certificates
in registered form to the assigns of
the Depository or its nominee, all at
the cost and expense (including any
costs of printing), if the event is not
the result of City action or inaction,
of those persons requesting such
issuance.
The Director of Finance also is
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 5. Execution of Bonds.
Bonds shall be signed by the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, in the
name of the City and in their official capacities, provided that either
or both of those signatures may be
a facsimile, and shall bear the seal
of the City or a facsimile thereof;
provided that no Bond shall be valid
or obligatory for any purpose or
shall be entitled to any security or
benefit
under
the
Proceedings
unless and until the certificate of
authentication printed on the Bond
is signed by the Trustee as authenticating agent, and authentication
by the Trustee shall be conclusive
evidence that the Bond so authenticated has been duly issued, signed
and delivered under, and is entitled
to the security and benefit of, the
Proceedings.
The
certificate
of
authentication may be signed by
any authorized officer or employee
of the Trustee or by any other person acting as an agent of the
Trustee and approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City.

certificate of authentication on all
of the Bonds.

City’s Charter, the Director of Law
shall prepare the Bonds and shall
endorse thereon his approval of the
form and correctness thereof by his
manual or facsimile signature. The
Bonds shall be issued in the denominations as requested by the Original Purchaser and approved by the
Director of Finance, in conformity
with this Ordinance. The entire principal amount may be represented by
a single bond certificate and may be
issued as fully registered securities
and in book entry or other uncertificated form if it is determined by
the
Director
of
Finance
that
issuance of fully registered securities in that form will facilitate the
sale and delivery of the Bonds. The
Bonds may be issued in the authorized denominations of either (a)
$100,000 each or in any denomination that is the sum of (i) $100,000
and (ii) $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof, and not exchangeable
for other Bonds in denominations
less than $100,000, or (b) $5,000 or

of
Finance in the Certificate of Award
to be in the best interests of the
City. The Bonds shall not have
coupons attached, shall be numbered
as determined by the Director of
Finance and shall express upon
their faces the purpose, in summary
terms, for which they are issued and
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 6. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall be sold at not less than
97% of par plus accrued interest at
private sale by the Director of
Finance to the Original Purchaser
in accordance with law and the provisions of this Ordinance. If the
Director
of
Finance
determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that an underwriter is incapable of fully performing its duties or meeting its
obligations in its capacity as Original Purchaser with respect to the
Bonds, the Director of Finance is
hereby authorized and directed, in
the name of and on behalf of the
City, to take whatever action may
be
necessary
to
terminate
that
underwriter’s standing as Original
Purchaser. The Director of Finance
shall sign the Certificate of Award
referred to in this Ordinance, evidencing that sale to the Original
Purchaser, cause the Bonds to be
prepared,
and
have
the
Bonds
signed and delivered, together with
a true transcript of proceedings
with reference to the issuance of the
Bonds if requested by the Original
Purchaser, to the Original Purchaser upon payment of the purchase
price. The Director of Finance is
authorized to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
a bond purchase agreement between
the City and the Original Purchaser, or representative thereof (the
“Purchase Agreement”), in a form
consistent with this Ordinance and
as approved by the Director of Law.
The Director of Finance shall provide for the payment of the services
rendered and for reimbursement of
expenses incurred pursuant to the
Purchase Agreement from the proceeds of the Bonds to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for

The City Record
that purpose. The Mayor, the Director of Finance, the Clerk, the Director of Law, and other City officials,
as appropriate, are each authorized
and directed to sign any transcript
certificates,
financial
statements
and other documents and instruments and to take such actions as
are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance.
Section 7. Security for the Bonds.
The Bonds shall be special obligations of the City, and the debt
charges on the Bonds shall be
payable solely from the Net Project
Revenues and the Nontax Revenues.
The payment of debt charges on the
Bonds is secured by the Trust
Agreement and by a pledge of and
lien on the Bond Fund and the Bond
Reserve Fund held by the Trustee
under the Trust Agreement. The
Bonds are not and shall not be
secured by an obligation or pledge
of any money raised by taxation.
The Bonds do not and shall not represent or constitute a debt or pledge
of the faith and credit or taxing
power of the City, and the owners
thereof have and shall have no right
to have taxes levied by the City for
the payment of debt charges thereon. The Bonds shall contain a statement to that effect and to the effect
that the Bonds are payable solely
from the Net Project Revenues and
the Nontax Revenues and are not
secured by an obligation or pledge
of any money raised by taxation.
The City covenants and agrees
that while the Bonds are outstanding, it will appropriate and maintain
Nontax Revenues at such times and
in such amounts as will be sufficient, together with the Net Project
Revenues and any other funds available for the purpose, to pay the debt
charges on the Bonds and will so
restrict other obligations payable
from Nontax Revenues prior to or on
a parity with the Bonds as will
ensure the continuing availability
for appropriation of sufficient Nontax Revenues to pay debt charges
when due.
There is created by the City in the
custody of the Trustee a separate
fund or account designated as the
Core City Program Bond Retirement
Fund (the “Bond Fund”) into which
shall be deposited (i) any Net Project Revenues, and (ii) other Nontax
Revenues on or prior to the date
debt charges on the Bonds are due,
in an amount sufficient to pay those
debt charges. There is created by
the City in the custody of the
Trustee another separate fund or
account designated as the Core City
Program Bond Reserve Fund (the
“Bond Reserve Fund”). On the date
of delivery of the Bonds there shall
be deposited in the Bond Fund and
Bond Reserve Fund from the Nontax
Revenues in Economic Development
Land Sale Fund No. 10-504 of the
City or from proceeds of the Bonds
or by Credit Support Instrument the
respective amounts set forth in the
Certificate of Award as being sufficient, in the opinion of the Director
of Finance based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to
enhance the marketability of the
Bonds and to enable the City to stabilize its budget against fluctuations in the receipt of Nontax Revenues. Money in the Bond Fund and
Bond Reserve Fund shall be applied

1454

June 18, 2003
and invested as provided in the
Trust Agreement. Amounts drawn
on the Bond Reserve Fund shall be
restored to the extent, and over the
period of time, provided in the Trust
Agreement. The City shall apply
funds for that purpose from the following sources and in the following
priority: first from the Net Project
Revenues, second from the Nontax
Revenues in Economic Development
Land Sale Fund No. 10-504, third
from other Nontax Revenues. In consideration of the availability of the
Nontax Revenues to the Core City
program, there shall be transferred
to Fund No. 01-001 following passage
of
this
Ordinance
amounts
on
deposit as of the date of passage in
Economic Development JDA Highland Hills Shared Income Tax Fund
No. 10-5-28 and in Economic Development
JDA

Highland
Fund No. 10-5-27.
Section
8.
Payment
of
Debt
Charges on the Bonds. Nothing herein shall be construed as requiring
the City to use or apply to the payment of debt charges on the Bonds
any funds or revenues from any
source other than Net Project Revenues and the Nontax Revenues.
Subject
to
the
requirements
of
Revised Code Section 176.04, nothing
herein, however, shall be deemed to
prohibit the City, of its own volition,
from using, to the extent that it is
authorized by law to do so, any
other resources for the fulfillment of
any of the terms, conditions or obligations of this Ordinance or of the
Bonds.
The City will, solely from the proceeds of the Bonds or from the Net
Project Revenues or the Nontax
Revenues, pay or cause to be paid
the debt charges on the Bonds on
the dates, at the places and in the
manner provided herein and in the
Bonds. For that purpose, in each
year while the Bonds are outstanding, this Council, after providing for
the
payment
of
debt
charges
payable on the City’s general obligation securities in that year from
sources available for that purpose,
will appropriate Nontax Revenues
required to pay, and for the purpose
of paying, the debt charges due in
that year on the Bonds (less other
money available for the purpose)
and any outstanding parity obligations payable from Nontax Revenues. Further, this Council will
give effect to such appropriations in
all ordinances it passes thereafter in
that year appropriating money for
expenditure and encumbrance and
limit the other appropriations of
Nontax Revenues in that year to the
amount available after deducting
the amount required for the payment of debt charges payable on the
City’s general obligation securities
and to pay those debt charges. The
City covenants that, so long as any
of the Bonds are outstanding, it
shall not issue any additional obligations payable from the Nontax Revenues on a parity with the Bonds
and any outstanding parity obligations payable from Nontax Revenues, unless, prior to passage of
the ordinance authorizing such parity
obligations,
the
Director
of
Finance shall have certified to this
Council that the Nontax Revenues
during the preceding calendar year,
adjusted to reflect, if necessary,
changes in the rates or charges
resulting in the Nontax Revenues,

June 18, 2003
aggregate in amount not less than
100% of the highest amount of (a)
debt charges on the Bonds and (b)
required payments on such proposed
parity obligations and any outstanding parity obligations due in
any succeeding calendar year.
Each
obligation
of
the
City
required to be undertaken pursuant
to this Ordinance and the Bonds is
binding upon the City, and upon
each officer or employee of the City
as may from time to time have the
authority under law to take any
action on behalf of the City as may
be necessary to perform all or any
part of such obligation, as a duty of
the City and of each of those officers and employees resulting from
an office, trust or station within the
meaning of Section 2731.01 of the
Revised Code, providing for enforcement by writ of mandamus.
Section 9. Trust Agreement. The
City shall enter into the Trust
Agreement with a bank or trust
company designated as Trustee for
the
Bonds
by
the
Director
of
Finance in the Certificate of Award,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the entity so
designated possesses the requisite
resources to provide the services of
Trustee under the Trust Agreement
and that the terms on which it has
agreed to provide the services of
Trustee are fair and commercially
reasonable. The Mayor and the Director of Finance shall sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, the Trust Agreement in a form
consistent with this Ordinance and
approved by the Director of Law.
The Mayor and the Director of
Finance and other City officials, as
appropriate, are authorized to take
such actions and sign and deliver
such related instruments as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Ordinance.
Section 10. Project Fund; Deposit
of Proceeds. The proceeds from the
sale of the Bonds are appropriated
and shall be used for the purpose
for which the Bonds are being
issued. There is created by the City,
as a separate fund or account, in the
custody and control of the Trustee,
a fund designated the “Core City
Program Project Fund” (the “Project
Fund”). Within the Project Fund the
City shall establish as accounts or
subaccounts: the Economic Development Account, the Housing Account
and the Undesignated Account. The
proceeds from the sale of the Bonds
shall be deposited initially in the
Undesignated Account of the Project
Fund. Additional funds, from whatever source, may be voluntarily
deposited in any account of the Project Fund by the City. Funds in the
Undesignated Account of the Project
Fund may be transferred to the Economic Development Account to pay
costs of a Project, or to make loans
to others to pay costs of that Project, consistent with Revised Code
Chapter 165, following certification
of the Project by the Corporation as
being in accordance with the Economic Development Plan. Funds in
the Undesignated Account of the
Project Fund may be transferred to
the Housing Account of the Project
Fund to pay costs of a Project for
residential housing, or to make
grants or loans to others or subsi-

The City Record

dies to loans or otherwise to pay
costs of that Project, upon certification to the Trustee by the Director
of Community Development or the
Director of Finance of the City that
the Project is consistent with the
Housing Plan and was submitted for
review to the Housing Advisory
Board, all pursuant to Revised Code
176.04. Money in the respective
accounts of the Project Fund are
appropriated for, and shall be used
to pay, costs of Projects consistent
with the requirements of this Ordinance. The City may establish additional accounts or subaccounts within the Project Fund as necessary or
convenient to ascertain the dates,
amounts and sources of deposits. At
such time as disbursements are to
be made from the Project Fund to
pay costs of a Project, the City shall
direct
the
Trustee
to
transfer
amounts in the applicable account
of the Project Fund to the City for
subsequent
disbursement
by
the
City for Project purposes. Any portion of the proceeds of the Bonds to
be used to pay interest on the Bonds
shall be deposited in a capitalized
interest subaccount of the Project
Fund. Any premium and accrued
interest received from the sale of
the Bonds shall be deposited in the
Bond Fund.

agreement for purposes of the Rule,
and its performance shall be subject
to the annual appropriation of any
funds that may be necessary to perform it. The Director of Finance is
further authorized and directed to
establish procedures in order to
ensure compliance by the City with
its continuing disclosure agreement,
including the timely provision of
information and notices.

Section 11. Disclosure. If, in the
judgment of the Director of Finance,
after consultation with a Financial
Advisor and the Original Purchaser,
an official statement or other disclosure
document
is
appropriate
relating to the initial offering of the
Bonds, the Director of Finance, on
behalf of the City and in that officer’s official capacity, is authorized
to (i) cooperate with the Original
Purchaser in the preparation of, and
the making of modifications, completions or changes of or supplements to, such a disclosure document, (ii) determine, and to certify
or otherwise represent, when the
disclosure document is to be deemed
final or is final, (iii) authorize the
use and distribution of that disclosure document and any supplements
thereto in connection with the initial offering of the Bonds, and (iv)
sign certificates, statements or other
documents in connection with the
finality, accuracy, and completeness
of that disclosure document.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, as the
only obligated person with respect
to the Bonds under the Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data, audited financial statements
and notices, in such manner, as may
be required for purposes of paragraph (b)(5)(i) of the Rule. In
order to describe and specify certain
terms of the City’s continuing disclosure agreement for that purpose,
and
thereby
to
implement
that
agreement, including provisions for
enforcement, amendment, and termination, the Director of Finance is
authorized and directed to sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, and if required under
the Rule, a Continuing Disclosure
Certificate or Certificates in conformance
with
the
reporting
requirements of the Rule. The agreement formed, collectively, by this
paragraph and that Certificate, shall
be the City’s continuing disclosure

Section 13. Interest Rate Hedges
and Other Arrangements. For the
purpose of achieving the optimal
available debt structure for the
Bonds, the Director of Finance may,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, enter into one or
more agreements in anticipation of,
in connection with or subsequent to
the issuance of the Bonds for an
interest rate swap, an interest rate
cap or other arrangements to lower
the effective interest rate on the
obligations of the City or to hedge
the exposure of the City against
fluctuations in prevailing interest
rates or to optimize the City’s cash
flow, provided, however, that: (i)
the counterparty to any such agreement or arrangement shall have a
rating of at least “A” by either
Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., or
Standard & Poor’s Corporation; (ii)
no such agreement or arrangement
shall purport to entitle the counterparty or provider to payment by the
City from any source other than the
sources of payment for the Bonds as
described in this Ordinance; (iii) the
terms of the agreements or arrangements shall have been determined
by the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, to be justified by the corresponding benefit to the City and
to be commercially reasonable based
on then current market conditions.

1455

Section 12. Ratings, Insurance,
and Other Credit Enhancement. If,
in the judgment of the Director of
Finance, based on written advice of
a Financial Advisor, the filing of an
application for a rating on the
Bonds by one or more nationally recognized rating agencies or one or
more Credit Support Instruments is
in the best interest of, and financially advantageous to, the City, the
Director of Finance is authorized to
prepare and submit those applications, to provide to each such
agency, company or credit provider
such information as may be required
for the purpose. The cost of obtaining each rating and each Credit Support
Instrument,
except
to
the
extent paid by the Original Purchaser in accordance with the Purchase Agreement, shall be paid from
the proceeds of the Bonds.

Section 14. Prevailing Rates of
Wages. As provided in Revised Code
Section 165.031, all wages paid to
laborers and mechanics employed on
a Project funded from the Economic Development Account of the Project Fund shall be paid at not less
than the prevailing rates of wages
for laborers and mechanics for each
class of work called for by the Project, which wages shall be determined
in
accordance
with
the
requirements of Chapter 4115 of the
Ohio Revised Code, for determination of prevailing wage rates; provided that the requirements of this

34
Section shall not apply where the
federal government or any of its
agencies furnished or furnishes by
loan or grant all or any part of the
funds used or to be used in connection with the Project and prescribed
or prescribes predetermined minimum wages to be paid to such laborers and mechanics; and provided further that, if a nonpublic user beneficiary undertakes, as a part of the
Project, construction to be performed by its regular bargaining
unit employees who are covered by
a collective bargaining agreement
that was in existence prior to the
date of adoption of this Ordinance,
the rate of pay provided under the
applicable
collective
bargaining
agreement may be paid to such
employees. If and to the extent
required by Revised Code Section
176.05, all wages paid to laborers
and mechanics employed on a Project
funded
from
the
Housing
Account of the Project Fund shall
be paid at not less than the residential prevailing rate of wages for
laborers and mechanics for each
class of work called for by the Project, which wages shall be determined as provided in Section 176.05.
Section 15. Certifications of Community Improvement Corporation.
Prior to delivery of the Bonds, the
Core City Fund program shall be
certified to be in accordance with
the Plan by the Corporation as the
agency of the City for industrial,
commercial,
distribution
and
research facilities development within
the City. Each individual Project
shall be so certified by the Corporation prior to receiving proceeds of
the Bonds by loan or otherwise.
Section 16. Priorities of Projects.
In evaluating Projects to be assisted by the Core City Fund Program,
the City will endeavor to allocate
the proceeds of the Bonds (net of
amounts used to pay costs of any
Credit Support Instrument and costs
of issuance and net of amounts used
to make deposits to the Bond Fund
and Bond Reserve Fund) to the following categories of Projects in the
following respective amounts: 9% for
Projects in furtherance of technology-based industries, 10% for nonhousing Projects located in the Central Business District of the City,
24% for non-housing Projects not
located in the Central Business District estimated to cost less than
$1,000,000 (inclusive of all sources
and uses of funds), 24% for nonhousing Projects not located in the
Central Business District estimated
to cost $1,000,000 or more (inclusive
of all sources and uses of funds),
and 33% for housing Projects. Subaccounts of the Economic Development Account of the Project Fund
shall be established for the nonhousing projects to account for
these allocations of the net proceeds
of the Bonds. The Director of
Finance of the City may modify
those allocations to the extent necessary to properly match the amount
of loans to the financial requirements of the Projects to be assisted,
provided that any reduction to any
one category that results in an
aggregate reduction to that category amounting to more than 2-1/2%

The City Record
of the net proceeds of the Bonds
shall be submitted to Council for
review and approval. The Directors
of Economic Development and Community Development shall jointly
report annually to the Community
and Economic Development Committee of Council concerning the loans
or other assistance given to Projects
from the proceeds of the Bonds, the
completion status of the Projects
that have received assistance, the
status of the repayment of loans,
and the amounts available for new
loans or other assistance under the
Program. To the extent that the
Revenues received by the City from
Projects are not applied to the payment of debt service on the Bonds
and are to be used to assist new
Projects, the Revenues shall be
applied to assist the same category
of Projects from which the Revenues were derived.
Section 17. Captions, Headings,
and Section References. The captions and headings in this Ordinance
are solely for convenience of reference and in no way define, limit, or
describe the scope or intent of any
Sections, subsections, paragraphs,
subparagraphs, or clauses hereof.
Reference to a Section means a section of this Ordinance unless otherwise indicated.
Section 18. Interpretation. Any pro visions of the Codified Ordinances
of the City which are inconsistent
with the provisions of this Ordinance shall not apply to the Bonds
authorized herein. Nothing in this
Ordinance is intended to, and no provision hereof shall be applied in any
manner as would, impair the obligation of contract of the City with
respect to any outstanding bonds,
Bonds, certificates of indebtedness,
other obligations, trust indentures,
trust agreements, or other agreements or contracts made or entered
into by the City.
Section 19. Satisfaction of Conditions. This Council determines that
all acts and conditions necessary to
be done or performed by the City or
to have been met precedent to and
in the issuing of the Bonds in order
to make them legal, valid, and binding special obligations of the City
have been performed and have been
met, or will at the time of delivery
of the Bonds have been performed
and have been met, in regular and
due form as required by law, and
that no limitation of indebtedness or
taxation, either statutory or constitutional,
is
applicable
to
the
issuance of the Bonds.
Section 20. Compliance with Open
Meeting Requirements. This Council
finds and determines that all formal
actions of this Council and any of
its committees concerning and relating to the passage of this Ordinance
were taken in an open meeting of
this Council or committees, and that
all deliberations of this Council and
any of its committees that resulted
in those formal actions were in
meetings open to the public, all in
compliance with the law.

emergency measure and, provided it

Ord. No. 2031-A-02 (as a Substitute
for Ordinance No. 2031-02).
By Council Members Lewis, Sweeney, Polensek, Jackson, Brady and
O’Malley.
An ordinance to supplement the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, by enacting new Chapter
188 relating to employment of City
residents for certain public improvement contracts.
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland believes strongly in
employment opportunities for Cleveland residents; and
Whereas, there are Cleveland residents who possess the skills and
training required for work on construction projects; and
Whereas, despite, the expenditure
of millions of dollars in the City of
Cleveland on projects recently completed or currently under construction, few of the employment opportunities arising from those projects
have gone to Cleveland residents;
and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has a higher unemployment rate
and higher poverty rate than Cuyahoga County and many surrounding
communities; and
Whereas, the employment of City
residents on construction projects
funded, in part or in whole, with
City assistance will help alleviate
unemployment and poverty in the
City; and
Whereas, Council Member Fannie
M. Lewis serves as Chairperson of
the Employment, Affirmative Action, and Training Committee and
has conducted hearings on this matter for over one year; and
Whereas, it is appropriate to
honor Council Member Lewis’ service and dedication by naming the
Cleveland
Resident
Employment
Law the “Fannie M. Lewis Cleveland
Resident Employment Law”; now,
therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That, notwithstanding
and as an exception to any provision of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, to the contrary, the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are hereby
supplemented

enacting

objective is not achieved, the Director shall determine if a penalty is
appropriate and assess the penalty
in his/her discretion.
(c) Failure to submit, or knowing
falsification of, the reports required
in Sections 188.02 and 188.04 shall
result in a breach of the Construction Contract subject to assessment
of the maximum penalty provided in
division (b), and the penalty shall
be calculated as if no Residents of
the City were employed on the construction project in furtherance of
the Construction Contract.
(d) No Contractor shall knowingly falsify any required reports,
statements or payroll certifications.
Any Contractor who knowingly falsifies reports, statements or the certification of payroll data is guilty of

and subject to a fine of not more
than five thousand dollars ($5,000).
If a Contractor is convicted under
this division, that Contractor shall
be barred from contracting with the
City on any construction project subject to this Chapter for a period of
five (5) years.

due to the Contractor pursuant to
the Codified Ordinances of the City
of Cleveland may be withheld by the

the Director of whether the Contractor must pay a penalty.
(f) The imposition of any penalty
or fine under this section shall not
preclude the City from exercising
any other rights or remedies to
which it is entitled.
(g) All funds collected by the City
of Cleveland under division (b) or
(c) of this section shall be deposited into a special account which
shall be created for the sole purpose

used for the operation of the Office
of Equal Opportunity provided such
funds have been appropriated for
that purpose, provided there is any
necessary legislative authority and
provided the funds are used in compliance with all laws or restrictions
regarding their use.

penalty set forth above, the City
may, for a period of five (5) years

which the Contractor shall agree
and shall be required to forfeit in
its entirety in the event that full
compliance with the requirements of
this chapter are not achieved during
the performance of the
contract.
This surety bond shall be in addition to such other surety bonds that
are required pursuant to the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio.
(i) No person shall knowingly
supply false information to establish
that the person is a Resident for
purposes of this Chapter. Any person who knowingly supplies false
information to establish that he or
she is a Resident is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree and

Section 187.03 Goals of Contracting Departments; Bid and Contract
Provisions
(a) In accordance with the City’s
goal of increasing the level of MBE
and FBE participation in City contracts, each contracting department
shall use its best efforts to utilize
certified MBEs and FBEs as contractors or subcontractors for all
contracts in excess of ten thousand
dollars ($10,000). The Director shall
determine the appropriate annual
City-wide goal for MBE and FBE
participation for each type of City
contract, such as construction, services, professional services, supplies
and concessions, and for each type
of work to be performed in a particular contract, based on the availability of certified MBEs and FBEs
in the Cleveland contracting market
and within the following range of
annual goals fixed by the Council:
(1) The annual goals for MBE
participation shall range from fifteen percent (15%) to thirty percent
(30%);
(2) The annual goals for FBE participation shall range from five percent (5%) to twenty percent (20%).
The goal for MBE and FBE participation in a particular contract
shall be fixed by the Director in consultation
with
the
contracting
department based on the annual
City-wide goals for each type of City
contract and for each type of work
to be performed in the contract and
the availability of certified MBEs
and FBEs within the Cleveland contracting market, provided however
that the goal for a particular contract may exceed the range of goals
fixed by the Council in order to
assist the contracting department in
meeting the annual City-wide goal
for the type of contract to be awarded.
(b) Contracting departments shall
consider
utilization
of
certified
MBEs and FBEs when recommending a lowest and best or lowest
responsible bid in order to meet the
specified annual goals.
However,
these goals are not intended as quotas. It shall be the responsibility of
each
contracting
department
to
ensure that bids or proposals emanating from that department adhere
to the procedures and provisions in
this chapter.
(c) MBE and FBE participation
shall be counted toward meeting
MBE and FBE goals under the following provisions:
(1) Only expenditures to certified
MBEs and FBEs that perform commercially useful functions in the
implementation or performance of a
contract may be counted toward
meeting MBE and FBE goals.
A
MBE or FBE is considered to perform a commercially useful function
when it is responsible for executing
a distinct element of the work in
carrying out its responsibilities by
actually performing, managing, and
supervising the work involved. To
determine whether a MBE or FBE
is performing a commercially useful
function, the City will evaluate the
amount of the contractor’s work
which is subcontracted, industry
practices, and other relevant factors.
(2) A contractor or subcontractor
who qualifies as both a MBE and
FBE may obtain certification as
both a MBE and FBE.
The total
dollar value of a particular contract
with such contractor or subcontractor may be counted toward either

The City Record
the minority goal or the goal for
females, but not toward both. The
contractor must choose the category
to which the contract value should
be applied.
(3) A portion of the total dollar
value of the contract with a joint
venture equal to the percentage of
certified MBE or FBE participation
in the joint venture may be counted
toward meeting MBE and FBE
goals.
The MBE or FBE must be
responsible for performance of a
clearly defined portion of the work
to be performed, of equal proportion
to its share in the ownership, control,
management,
responsibility,
risk, and profits of the joint venture.
(4) The entire amount of expenditure to a certified MBE or FBE
manufacturer (i.e., a supplier that
produces goods from raw materials
or substantially alters them before
resale) may be counted toward
meeting MBE and FBE goals.
(5) Twenty percent (20%) of
expenditures to certified MBE or
FBE suppliers that are not manufacturers may be counted toward
meeting MBE and FBE goals, provided that the MBE or FBE supplier perform a commercially useful
function in the supply process.
A
firm will be considered a supplier
performing a commercially useful
function in the supply process when
it:
A. assumes the actual and contractual responsibility for furnishing the supplies or materials; and
B. is recognized as a distributor
by the industry involved in the contracted supplies and materials; and
C. owns or leases a warehouse,
yard, building, or whatever other
facilities are customary in the industry in supplying such supplies or
materials; and
D. distributes, delivers, and services products primarily with its
own staff and/or equipment.
(6) MBE or FBE subcontractors
who intend to subcontract services
to be performed under the contract
to non-minority business enterprises
and non-female business enterprises
may not be counted toward meeting
MBE and FBE goals.
This provision does not apply to subcontractor’s contracts for the purchase of
materials, equipment, or supplies
which are incident to the performance of services under the contract.
(d) In order to fulfill the purposes of the MBE and FBE goals, contractors using MBEs and FBEs shall
use them in a way which preserves
meaningful ownership, control and
performance of the work or other
contract obligations by the MBE or
FBE. Failure to do so may subject
the contractor to criminal prosecution, decertification, and other sanctions.
(e)
Notwithstanding
any
goal
established by the Director pursuant
to division (a) of this section, the
Council may increase or decrease
the percentage goals in any legislation considered by said body.
(f) In furtherance of the efforts
by the contracting departments to
achieve the annual goals for MBE
and FBE participation in City contracts as determined by the Director
pursuant to division (a) of this section, the director of a contracting
department in consultation with the
Director may elect to solicit bids or
proposals from only MBEs and
FBEs for a particular contract, pro-

1500

June 18, 2003
vided that the estimated cost of the
contract does not exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000).
The contracting department shall furnish
the Director with a copy of the bid
invitation or request for proposals
for such contract and the Director
shall provide the contracting department with a list of certified MBEs
and FBEs which can be solicited to
submit bids or proposals for the contract. The Council shall be notified
in writing whenever the director of
a contracting department has elected to solicit bids or proposals from
only MBEs and FBEs pursuant to
this division (f).
(g) Except for contracts solicited
in accordance with division (f) of
this section, contracts for a dollar
amount in excess of ten thousand
dollars ($10,000) shall be awarded
and
administered
in
accordance
with the following standards and
procedures:
(1) Bid invitations, requests for
proposals and all other specifications for contracts, shall require bidders to include in their bid or proposal such documentation and schedules as required by the Director in
which the bidder identifies the bidder’s efforts to utilize minority and
female business enterprises in a percentage which equals or exceeds the
applicable goal.
All bidders shall
make every effort to subcontract to
certified minority and female business enterprises.
All bidders shall
keep such records of such efforts
adequate to permit a determination
of compliance with the requirements
of this division (g) as are required
by the Director. MBE and FBE utilization shall be considered in determining the lowest and best or lowest responsible bid or determining
the best proposal.
(2) If the bid invitation or request
for proposal contains alternates, the
percentage of MBE and FBE participation will be computed with reference to the total dollar amount of
the award, including the cost of any
alternates to be awarded.
(3) It is the responsibility of the
bidder to ensure that all MBEs and
FBEs proposed to be used by the
bidder in the performance of the
contract have been certified by the
City prior to the bid opening.
(4) If a bidder is unable to
achieve the goal established by the
Director for a particular contract
pursuant to division (a) of this section, the bidder shall submit a
request for exception pursuant to
division (a) of Section 187.031.
(5) Prior to execution of a contract, a bidder shall submit to the
City such contract documents as is
specified by the Director which
shall identify the particular minority and female business enterprises
and other subcontractors to be utilized in performing the contract, and
shall specify for each subcontractor
the dollar value of the participation,
the type of work to be performed
and such information as may reasonably be required to determine
whether the minority and female
business
enterprise
participation
goals have been satisfied.
(6) All contracts shall contain the
following requirements:
A. The contractor shall utilize certified MBEs and FBEs in the performance of the contract in accordance with the participation identified in the contractor’s bid or proposal, subject only to the substitu-

June 18, 2003
tion and waiver provisions contained in division (b) of Section
187.031. Failure to utilize certified
MBEs and FBEs as identified in the
bid or proposal shall constitute a
material breach of the contract.
B. The contractor shall make
every effort to utilize minority and
female business enterprises during
performance of the contract.
C. The contractor shall maintain
such records as are required by the
Director to demonstrate compliance
with this chapter and the requirements of the contract relating to
minority and female business enterprise participation.
D. The provisions of this chapter
shall be incorporated into the contract by reference and any failure
of the contractor or any subcontractor to comply with the provisions of
this chapter shall constitute a material breach of the contract.
E.
Whenever
the
contract
is
amended or any change order or
subsidiary is authorized and the
total dollar amount of the contract
is increased by more than ten (10)
percent of the dollar value of the
original
contract,
the
contractor
shall comply with the provisions of
this chapter with respect to the
work to paid for through such
amendment, change order or subsidiary and ensure that any work
which is subcontracted is performed
with the same percentage of MBE
and FBE participation contained in
the contractor’s bid or proposal.
(7) In order to be considered best
or responsible, a bidder shall disclose annually such information as
is required by the Director which
demonstrates the extent to which, in
contracts that are not affected by
this chapter, the bidder has awarded subcontracts to minority and
female business enterprises.
(h) Contracts or other agreements
between the City of Cleveland and
other governmental agencies, quasi
governmental agencies, public corporations, or third-party contractors,
whereby such agencies or corporations receive money from or through
the City for the purpose of contracting with businesses to perform
public works, shall require such
agencies or corporations to comply
with the provisions of this chapter
in awarding and administering such
contracts.
(i) Participation of MBEs and
FBEs in joint ventures is encouraged. In the case of a certified joint
venture, only that portion of the
total dollar value of the contract
equal to the percentage of participation of the minority or female
partner in the joint venture will be
counted toward the applicable goal.
(j) The Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies and each contracting department hereby is directed
to:
(1) Make every effort to increase
the level of participation of MBEs
and FBEs in contracts of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less;

Ord. No. 835-03.
By Council Members Reed, White
and Jackson (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance to amend
the Part IV, Traffic Code, of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio,

June 18, 2003
Whereas, the Ohio General Assembly has amended certain sections of
the State Traffic Code and added
new sections; and
Whereas, the amendments should
be reflected in the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
since ordinances that are enacted as
an exercise of the City’s police powers are required by the Ohio Constitution not to conflict with the
general State law; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that violators may be
immediately
charged
under
the
City’s municipal code instead of the
State statutes and providing for the
usual daily operation of a municipal
department; now, therefore

levied by the Issuer for the payment

apply to the payment of Bond Service Charges any funds or revenues
from any source other than Nontax
Revenues. Nothing herein, however,
shall be deemed to prohibit the
Issuer, of its own volition, from
using, to the extent that it is authorized by law to do so, any other

office, trust or station upon the
Issuer within the meaning of Section 2731.01 of the Ohio Revised
Code.

the signing of those instruments by
the Fiscal Officer and the Law
Director.
