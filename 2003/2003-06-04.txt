Section 7. Payment and Security
for the Bonds. The Bonds are special obligations of the Issuer. The
Bonds do not and shall not represent or constitute a debt or pledge
of the faith or credit or taxing
power of the Issuer, and the owners of the Bonds have no right to
have taxes levied by the Issuer for
the
payment
of
Bond
Service
Charges, and each Bond shall contain a statement to that effect; provided, however, that nothing herein
shall be deemed to prohibit the
Issuer, of its own volition, from
using to the extent it is lawfully
authorized to do so, any other
resources for the fulfillment of any
of the terms, conditions or obligations of the Indenture, this Ordinance or the Bonds.
(a)
Payment.
Bond
Service
Charges on the Bonds are payable
solely from the Project Revenues
and from other moneys of the City
lawfully available therefor including, without limitation, Nontax Revenues, which Nontax Revenues are
hereby determined by the Issuer,
pursuant to Section 165.12 of the
Ohio Revised Code, to be money that
is not raised by taxation.
(b) Security. Payment of the
Bonds is secured by a pledge of
and an assignment of the Nontax

1206

June 4, 2003
this Ordinance and in the Indenture; provided, however, that the
Issuer’s pledge of Nontax Revenues
with respect to any Series of the
Bonds shall be subordinated in the
manner and to the extent, if any,
set forth in the applicable Final
Terms Certificate with respect to
the Issuer’s pledge of such Nontax
Revenues to secure any obligations
designated in the applicable Final
Terms Certificate as senior to the
Bonds.
The Issuer hereby covenants and
agrees that, as and to the extent
provided in the Indenture, it shall
appropriate in its annual appropriation measure for each year Nontax
Revenues in an amount sufficient to
pay all Bond Service Charges due
and payable in the then current
year, less any amounts remaining in
the Bond Funds after all Bond Service Charges for the prior year have
been paid.
The Bonds do not and shall not
represent or constitute a debt or
pledge of the faith or credit or taxing power of the Issuer, and the
owners of the Bonds have no right
to have taxes levied by the Issuer
for the payment of Bond Service
Charges.
Nothing herein shall be construed
as requiring the Issuer to use or
apply to the payment of Bond Service Charges any funds or revenues
from any source other than Nontax
Revenues. Nothing herein, however,
shall be deemed to prohibit the
Issuer, of its own volition, from
using, to the extent that it is authorized by law to do so, any other
resources for the fulfillment of any
of the terms, conditions or obligations of this Ordinance or of the
Bonds.
Section 8. Covenants of Issuer.

other appropriate officer of the
Issuer, will furnish to each Original Purchaser and to the Trustee a
true transcript of proceedings, certified by the Clerk of this Council
or other officer, of all proceedings

of the Bonds, together with such
information
from
the
Issuer’s
records as is necessary to determine the regularity and validity of
such issuance.
(d) Further Acts. The Issuer will,
at any and all times, cause to be
done all such further acts and
things and cause to be signed and
delivered all such further instruments as may be necessary to carry
out the purpose of the Bonds and
any ordinance authorizing the same
or as may be required by the Act.

office, trust or station upon the
Issuer within the meaning of Section 2731.01 of the Ohio Revised
Code.

accordance
with
the
requirements of Chapter 4115, Ohio
Revised Code, for determination of
prevailing wage rates; provided,

are covered under a collective bargaining agreement which was in
existence prior to the date of the
commitment instrument undertaking
to issue the Bonds, then, in that
event, the rate of pay provided
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement may be paid to those
employees.

changes by the Fiscal Officer, and

An emergency resolution opposing
the proposed new Federal Communications Commission rules regarding media ownership.
Whereas, the Federal Communications Commission was established
by the Communications Act of 1934
and is an independent government
agency, directly responsible to Congress;
Whereas, the Federal Communications Commission is charged with
regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable; and
Whereas, the Federal Communications Commission is expected to
approve new rules governing media
ownership, consolidation, and control of the nation’s newspapers and
radio and television stations; and
Whereas, it has been reported that
these new rules will allow media
companies to own more TV stations
in local markets, will eliminate the
rule prohibiting a daily newspaper
owner from owning a radio or TV
station, and will allow TV broadcasters to own two stations in certain markets; and
Whereas, the current ownership
limits were established to keep any
one company from controlling too
much of the information disseminated over public airways; and
Whereas, the proposed new rules
would limit diversity in media ownership, including local and community based ownership and minority
based ownership; and
Whereas, the proposed new rules
would diminish the quantity and
quality of local news and entertainment; and
Whereas, the proposed new rules
would create a climate for monopoly
ownership and control over cultural,
political, and educational information provided to the general public;

Kucinich has filed official comments denouncing further deregulation of the communications industry;
