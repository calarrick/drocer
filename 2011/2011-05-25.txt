Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That it is declared to be
in the public interest that the consent of the City of Cleveland is
given to the Director of Transportation of the State of Ohio (“the
State”) to construct the following

(the “Improvement”).
Section 2. That the City proposes to
cooperate with the State in the cost of
the Improvement by assuming and
contributing the entire cost and
expense of the Improvement, less the

of the cost of the Improvement. The
entire cost of engineering, property
acquisition, and environmental documentation shall be borne by the City.

(c) That arrangements have been
or will be made with and agreements
obtained from all utility companies
whose lines or structures will be
affected by the Improvement. That

the Improvement. Upon the request of
ODOT, the Director of Capital Projects is also empowered to assign all
rights, title, and interests of the City
to ODOT arising from any agreement
with its consultant in order to allow
ODOT to direct additional or corrective work, recover damages due to
errors or omissions, and to exercise
all other contractual rights and remedies afforded by law or equity.
Section 8. The City agrees that if
Federal Funds are used to pay the
cost of any consultant contract, the
City shall comply with 23 CFR 172 in
the selection of its consultant and the
administration of the consultant contract. Further, the City agrees to
incorporate ODOT’s “Specifications
for Consulting Services” as a contract
document in all of its consultant contracts. The City agrees to require, as a
scope of services clause, that all plans
prepared by the consultant must conform to ODOT’s current design standards and that the consultant shall be
responsible for ongoing consultant
involvement during the construction
phase of the Improvement. The City
agrees to include a completion schedule acceptable to ODOT and to assist
ODOT in rating the consultant’s performance through ODOT’s Consultant
Evaluation System.
Section 9. That notwithstanding
any provision of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, to the
contrary, the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies is authorized to

852

May 25, 2011
acquire for right-of-way purposes
such real property as is necessary to
make the Improvement. The consideration to be paid for the property shall
not exceed fair market value.
Section 10. That the Director of Capital Projects is authorized to execute

Effective May 20, 2011.

Ord. No. 1198-10.
By Council Members Brancatelli,
Mitchell, Cummins and Sweeney (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976 by enacting
new Section 601.061, relating to the
imposition of strict criminal liability for offenses in the Building and
Housing Codes that do not specify a
degree of culpability.
Whereas, it was always the intent
of this Council that offenses contained in the Building Code or Housing Code that do not specify a
degree of culpability be strict liability offenses; and
Whereas, in the case of Parma vs.
Mackay, No. 92858, a panel of the
Eighth District Court of Appeals
found, with respect to a building
code offense of another municipality,
that
recklessness
musts
be
proved to convict an offender where
the offense did not specify a degree
of culpability; and
Whereas, it is the desire of this
Council to reaffirm its consistent
and longstanding intent that offenses contained in the Building Code or
Housing Code be strict liability
offenses unless another degree of
culpability is specified; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976 are
supplemented by enacting new Section 601.061 to read as follows:
Section 601.061
Strict Criminal
Liability in Building and Housing
Code Offenses
Notwithstanding any other section
of the Codified Ordinances, when
any section of the Building Code or
Housing Code defining an offense

does not specify any degree of culpability, then strict criminal liability shall apply and culpability is not
required for the person to be guilty
of the offense.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Passed May 16, 2011.
Effective May 20, 2011.

May 25, 2011
requirements contract in accordance
with the Charter and the Codified
Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,

thereof

vehicles or apparatus, in the estimated sum of $6,585,000, to be purchased, leased or leased to purchase
by the Commissioner of Purchases

of Finance determines that it is in the
best interest of the City to enter into
that lease-purchase arrangement,
(II) the maximum term of any leasepurchase arrangement does not
exceed ten (10) years, (III) the aggregate principal obligation of the City
under the lease-purchase arrangement does not exceed $6,800,000, (IV)
if the lease-purchase arrangement
provides that the lease payments are
to have a principal component and an
interest component, the maximum
interest rate for the interest component does not exceed seven percent
(7%) per annum, (V) the obligations
of the City under that lease-purchase
arrangement for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2011 are subject to annual appropriations being

The City Record
priate in order to provide for that

agreement, an escrow agreement for
the deposit by the lessor of the purchase price of the vehicles and apparatus, acceptance certificates evidencing the City’s acceptance of the

Finance and other City officials, as
appropriate,
are
authorized
to
covenant on behalf of the City that
(A) the City will use and will restrict
the use of the vehicles and apparatus
leased by the City under the lease-purchase agreement and will use, and
will restrict the investment of, any
proceeds of the lease-purchase agreement in such manner and to such
extent as may be necessary so that
the lease-purchase agreement will
not constitute a private activity bond,
an arbitrage bond or a hedge bond
under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “Code”), or be
treated other than as an obligation to
which Section 103(a) of the Code
applies, and (B) the City will take or
cause to be taken such actions that
may be required of it for the interest
component of the lease payments to
be and to remain excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes and the City will not take or authorize to be taken any actions that
would adversely affect that exclusion. In the event that the City enters
into such a lease-purchase arrangement, the Director of Public Works
may assign to the lessor under the
lease-purchase arrangement, or the
lessor’s designee, the rights of the
City under the contracts for purchase
of the vehicles and apparatus authorized in Section 1 of this ordinance.
The Director of Law, Clerk of Council
and other appropriate officials of the
City are authorized to sign and deliver any documents, certificates and
other instruments as the Director of
Law determines are necessary and
appropriate to carry out the transactions authorized by this ordinance.
Section 4. That it is hereby found
and determined that all formal
actions of this Council concerning
and relating to the passage of this
Ordinance where adopted in open
meetings of this Council, and any of
its committees that resulted in such
formal action were in meetings open
to the public in compliance with the
law.
Section 5. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately upon its passage and approval
by the Mayor; otherwise it shall take
