ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 224-11.
By Council Members Cimperman,
Miller, Cleveland and Sweeney (by
request).
An emergency resolution declaring
the intent to vacate Radio Lane N.E.
Whereas, this Council is satisfied
that there is good cause to vacate a
portion of Radio Lane N.E., as
described; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
declares its intent to vacate the following described real property:
All that portion of Radio Lane N.E.
(66.0 feet wide) (formerly East 27th
Street) extending southerly from St.
Clair Avenue N.E. (99.0 feet wide)
about 162.0 feet to the easterly prolongation of the northerly line of sublot
number 91 in the Perry Payne Subdivision as shown by the recorded plat
in volume 2 of maps page 29 of Cuyahoga County Records and all that portion Radio Lane N.E. (12.0 feet wide)
(formerly Packard Court) extending
easterly from the southerly prolongation of the westerly line of sublot
number 94 in aforesaid Perry Payne
Subdivision 99.0 feet to the northerly
prolongation of sublot number 91 as
aforesaid.
Legal Description approved by
Greg Esber, Section Chief, Plats, Surveys and House Numbering Section.
Section 2. That this resolution is
declared to be an emergency measure
and, provided it receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take
effect and be in force immediately
upon its adoption and approval by the
Mayor; otherwise it shall take effect
and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.
Adopted May 2, 2011.
Effective May 5, 2011.

Res. No. 608-11.
By Council Members Sweeney and
Cleveland.
An emergency resolution supporting Space Laboratory Associates, a
joint non-profit entity of Universities
Space Research Association and Battelle, in efforts to gain NASA approval
of their headquarters in Cleveland to
manage the International Space Station National Laboratory.
Whereas, NASA is considering
Cleveland as the site of a new nonprofit, Space Laboratory Associates
(SLA) that would manage scientific
and commercial testing on the International Space Station National Laboratory (ISS NL); and

The City Record
Whereas, the Greater Cleveland
Partnership (GCP) is working in
partnership with Team NEO and
several other Northeast Ohio organizations to gain NASA approval for
SLA, a joint non-profit entity of Universities Space Research Association (USRA) and Battelle, to be
headquartered in Cleveland to manage the ISS NL for ten years; and
Whereas, NASA’s selection of SLA
and Northeast Ohio as a headquarters location will greatly assist management of the ISS NL for four primary reasons: 1) business, research,
and education climate, 2) regional
expertise in microgravity research
and space operations, 3) promotion
of STEM Education, and 4) state
and local commitment; and
Whereas, first, Northeast Ohio has
an outstanding business climate for
research-oriented
entrepreneurial,
organizations that thrive using our
proposed “Research to Application”
approach; and
Whereas, the region has the “economic ecosystem,” which networks
together major research universities, with nonprofit research centers
with
extensive
business
assets
posed to move quickly on commercialization in key research areas
and industry sectors that include
medicine and life sciences, advanced
materials and advanced energy, and
agriculture; and
Whereas, this is the environment
required
to
translate
ISS
NL
research into applications that will
deliver real economic and societal
value to the Nation; and
Whereas, second, Northeast Ohio
has a strong base of knowledge and
experience in microgravity research
and space operations that few other
regions in the country possess that
SLA will capitalize on to grow the
ISS NL program, substantially over
the coming decade; and
Whereas, third, Ohio is leading
the charge on STEM education and
has
made
nationally-recognized
progress, and Cleveland organizations have committed to contributing directly to STEM education associated with the ISS NL, both regionally and nationally; and
Whereas, this includes the new
Great Lakes Science Center, the official site of the NASA Glenn Visitor
Center, which just completed Phase
I and anticipates completing the second phase in 2012 featuring major
exhibits dedicated to ISS and the
National Laboratory; and
Whereas, the Great Lakes Science
Center
has
also
committed
to
advancing the connectivity of STEM
for
ISS,
nationally,
through
its
active board position with the American Science and Technology Centers (ASTC), a professional organization of over 250 science centers
worldwide; and
Whereas, lastly, recognizing the
large potential economic impact of
the ISS NL headquarters being located in Northeast Ohio, the Ohio
Department of Development, the
City of Cleveland, Cuyahoga County, and other civic economic development entities in Ohio have demonstrated strong support for our proposal to NASA; and
Whereas, the regions commitment
to provide more than $6 million in
financial and in-kind support for the
ISS NL significantly strengthens the
ability of SLA to manage the ISS NL
program; and

753

27
Whereas, if NASA selects the
Cleveland-based
proposal
next
month, SLA will build headquarters
at 7000 Euclid Avenue, in Ward 5
near the Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals, and next to the
128,000-square-foot MidTown Tech
Park now under construction at
East 69th Street between Euclid and
Carnegie Avenues; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports Space Laboratory Associates, a
joint non-profit entity of Universities
Space Research Association and Battelle, in efforts to gain NASA approval
of their headquarters in Cleveland to
manage the International Space Station National Laboratory.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit certified copies of this resolution to The
Honorable Charles F. Bolden, Jr.,
Administrator, National Aeronautics
and Space Administration, Cooperative
Agreement
Notice
NNH11SOMD002C, Martin McGann,
Vice President, State and Local Government Affairs, Greater Cleveland
Partnership, and Jay Foran, Team
NEO.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
