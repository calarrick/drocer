Res. No. 772-11.
By Council Members Zone, Brancatelli, Cleveland, Cummins, Westbrook and Cimperman.
An emergency resolution supporting the Safe and Complete Streets Act
of 2011, H.R. 1760.
Whereas, last week, Congressional Representatives Steve LaTourette
and Doris Matsui introduced the
Safe and Complete Streets Act of
2011, H.R. 1780, a bill requiring that
new street and transportation projects undertaken by state departments of transportation and metropolitan
planning
organizations
(“MPOs”) be designed with “pedestrians,
bicyclists,
public
transit
users, children, older individuals,
individuals
with
disabilities,
motorists, and freight vehicles” in
mind; and
Whereas, H.R. 1780 calls for consideration of the “safety and convenience” of all users in “all phases of

June 1, 2011
project planning and development”;
and
Whereas, currently, 23 states, the
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico
and more than 2,000 regional and
local
communities
have
adopted
some form of Complete Streets policies to enhance public safety, lower
transportation costs and promote
walking, bicycling and public transit as sustainable alternatives; and
Whereas, this legislation would
require that states and MPOs craft
and adhere to a Complete Streets
policy, under the guidance of the
U.S. DOT, which would apply to all
federally funded projects; and
Whereas, the Complete Streets
effort requires communities to plan
roadways and transportation corridors to accommodate all potential
uses and transportation modes and
plan for the elderly, handicapped
and children, in addition to public
transit, cars and trucks; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland is
researching and will soon introduce
Complete
Streets
legislation
to
improve Bike and pedestrian access
and improve mobility on street,
streetscape and bridge improvement
projects; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the Safe and Complete Streets
Act of 2011, H.R. 1780.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit certified copies of this resolution to all
members
Congress
representing
northeast Ohio and Cuyahoga County.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately

Section 535.15 New Applications for Water Service; Owner Liability; Deposits
(a) Applications for the use of water shall be made and accepted in a manner prescribed by the Director of

of some other person or entity. In addition, any user and/or occupant of the premises where water service is provided shall be liable for payment for such services.

(2) Has received delinquency or termination of service notices and wishes to avoid such termination.
(3) Has had service terminated for nonpayment.
(4) Is a debtor in a pending case in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.

the time it is closed, the deposit shall be applied to any final amount outstanding, and the balance, if any, shall
be returned to the depositor.
Section 535.21 Charges for Unmetered Fire Protection Service within the City and Direct Service Metropolitan
Area
Water shall be furnished to an unmetered fire protection service connection only for fire protection, testing and
maintenance purposes. A charge shall be made for each unmetered fire supply connection within the limits of
the City and direct service suburbs. The charge shall be determined by the size of the fire supply connection
through which water passes for use on the premises so supplied at the rate for unmetered fire line service under
Section 535.06 (p) of the Codified Ordinances. Unauthorized water use through unmetered fire protection service
connections shall be billed and charged at the additional MCF rate in the applicable service district. Additional
penalties and charges based on consumption may be charged for unauthorized uses of an unmetered fire protection service connection.
Charges shall be collected monthly or quarterly for each fire supply connection to cover inspection, testing,
sealing and resealing of such service connections, stand-by pumpage capacity, and replacement or cleaning of distribution or trunk water mains to improve the water supply for fire protection purposes.
Section 535.24 Charges for Water from Fire Hydrants
(a) In addition to other charges, if water is used from a public fire hydrant, upon special permit only, a charge
for the permit and a hydrant rental must be paid in advance under Section 535.06 of the Codified Ordinances. A
separate permit shall be issued for each hydrant which shall identify its location.
(b) Water may be furnished from a fire hydrant for any special purpose authorized by the Commissioner of
the Division of Water. The charge for water so furnished shall be at the additional MCF rate under Section 535.04
for the service district in which the fire hydrant is located. The quantity of water used may be estimated by the
Commissioner based on information provided by the user as to the user’s purpose and needs, or the Commissioner
may require the installation of a meter at the connection to the hydrant to be used, in which event the user shall
