MAYOR’S VETO

nance was introduced and passed on
one reading under suspension of
Council’s rules without any public
committee hearings or the benefit of
public comment from law enforcement or interested members of the
community. Passing legislation under
suspension is sometimes an appropriate and necessary tool.
I am sympathetic with the goal of
the Council to identify appropriate
tools to deal with the increasing
occurrence of unlawful mob activity
fueled by the proliferation of cell
phone use and other technology to
communicate quickly with large
numbers of people. However, like
any criminal prohibition, the law
needs to be narrowly tailored to
combat the illegal activity, be an
effective deterrent to wrongdoers,
and not unduly interfere with the
rights of law-abiding citizens.
Numerous legal and policy concerns have been expressed regarding the new criminal offense enacted by Ordinance No. 1012-11. Even
prior to its introduction and passage, the Law Department raised
and expressed concerns to City
Council’s attorney about:
• The need for an additional
criminal offense when unlawful
activity such as riot, disorderly
conduct and unlawful congregation are already prohibited in
the criminal code;
• The lack of clarity in the use
of the term “social media;” and,
• The enforceability of the new
code section.

Those voting Nay: Council Members Sweeney, Brady, Brancatelli,
Cimperman,
Cleveland,
Conwell,
Cummins, K. Johnson, Keane, Kelley, Mitchell, Polensek, Westbrook
and Zone.

Section 2. Authorization of the
Bonds.
This Council authorizes the City to
issue the Bonds in one or more series

Series of Bonds is to be the amount set
forth in the Certificate of Award, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 5, and determined by the Director

advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
the amount necessary, together with
other funds available for the purpose
(i) to pay costs of the Project, including funding interest on the Bonds for

Fund required under the Indenture or

This Council finds and determines
that the issuance of the Bonds for the
purpose provided in this Ordinance
serves a proper, public, municipal purpose by providing, maintaining and
improving air travel facilities serving the people of the City of Cleveland, thereby increasing and promoting commerce by providing necessary
transportation for individuals and
commercial enterprises purchasing
and selling services and products in
northeastern Ohio, and creating and
preserving jobs and employment
opportunities in the City and improving the economic welfare of the City.
Section 3. Authorization of Hedging
Arrangements and Termination of
Hedging Arrangements.
This Council finds that by engaging in interest rate hedging arrangements with respect to Revenue Bonds
the City may reduce its cost of borrowing by optimizing the relative
amounts of fixed and variable rate
obligations, or minimizing the risk of
variations in its debt service costs, or
obtaining savings by confirming
rates of interest on Revenue Bonds in
advance of their issuance. To permit
the City to have the flexibility to
undertake such arrangements, from
time to time, with respect to Revenue
Bonds and to establish the procedures
for approving those transactions, this
Council authorizes the signing and
delivery of one or more Hedge Agreements and any related agreements
necessary for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by
each Hedge Agreement. The authorizations in this Section 3 are supplemental to and not in derogation of any
authority provided by any other ordi-

1372

August 24, 2011
nance of this Council concerning
hedging arrangements.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
that it is to the financial advantage of
the City and in the City’s best interests that a hedging arrangement be
undertaken by the City with respect
to any Revenue Bonds issued or to be
issued under the Indenture, the Director of Finance may authorize one or
more interest rate hedge transactions, from time to time, in accordance
with the applicable Hedge Agreement; provided that (a) the counterparty shall be rated at the time of
signing the Hedge Agreement not
lower than A by at least one rating
agency or its obligations under the
Hedge Agreement shall be guaranteed or insured by an entity rated at
the time of signing the Hedge Agreement not lower than A by at least one
rating agency, (b) the scheduled termination date of each hedge transaction shall be not later than the final
maturity of the Revenue Bonds to
which the hedge relates, and (c) the
terms and conditions of the Hedge
Agreement shall not conflict with the
Indenture.
The Director of Finance shall negotiate the terms of each Hedge Agreement with a counterparty satisfying
the credit criteria in this Ordinance.
The City shall receive a written opinion of a Financial Advisor that the
payments made or to be made by the
counterparty to the City, or by the
City to the counterparty, shall be fair
value for the Hedge Agreement, considering, among other things, the
credit of the City’s Airport System,
the credit of the counterparty and the
terms and conditions of the Hedge
Agreement. Subject to the provisions
of this Ordinance, the Director of
Finance shall determine the terms
and conditions of the Hedge Agreement, including without limitation,
the time or times and procedures for
the exercise by the counterparty or
the City, as the case may be, of any
option under the Hedge Agreement,
whether the obligations of the City
under the Hedge Agreement shall be
secured by a Credit Support Instrument, and the rates to be paid by the
counterparty to the City and by the
City to the counterparty under the
Hedge Agreement in the event of the
exercise of the option. The approval
of each interest rate hedge transaction by the Director of Finance shall
be conclusively evidenced by the
signing and delivery of the applicable
Hedge Agreement by the Director of
Finance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to terminate any Hedge Agreement in whole or in part or any Credit
Support Instrument securing a Hedge
Agreement if the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the City’s best interests will be served
by such termination. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to enter
into amendments or modifications of
a Hedge Agreement or any Credit
Support Instrument securing a Hedge
Agreement determined by the Director of Finance, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the City’s best interests will be served
by such amendment or modification.
The Director of Finance is authorized
to pay any amounts that the City may
owe upon early termination of any
Hedge Agreement or modification

August 24, 2011
thereof from moneys derived from the
sale of the Bonds or from moneys in
any of the following funds established under the Indenture: the Airport Operating and Maintenance
Fund (Fund No. 60-001), the Airport
Renewal and Replacement Fund
(Fund
No.
60-104),
the
Airport
Improvement Fund (Fund No. 60-105),
the Airport Surplus Fund (Fund No.
60-106), and the Airport Account of the
Airport Development Fund (Fund No.
60-141). Such moneys as are to be
expended in connection with the termination or modification of any
Hedge Agreement are appropriated
for that purpose.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from the Airport Revenues as defined
in the Indenture and may be payable
also from other funds permitted by
law to be used for the purpose, as
identified by the Director of Finance
in the Hedge Agreement. Those payments may be secured by a pledge of
Airport Revenues, to the extent permitted by the Indenture, all as determined by the Director of Finance and
set forth in the Hedge Agreement.
The obligation of the City to make
payments under any Hedge Agreement does not and shall not represent
or constitute a general obligation,
debt, bonded indebtedness or a pledge
of the faith and credit of the City or
the State of Ohio. Nothing gives any
party to any Hedge Agreement the
right to have excises, ad valorem or
other taxes levied by the City or the
State of Ohio for the payment of any
amounts due under any Hedge Agreement.
Section 4. Terms of Bonds.
The Bonds shall contain the terms
provided in or determined pursuant
to, the Indenture, this Ordinance, the
applicable Certificate of Award and
the applicable Supplemental Indenture. Each series of Bonds may be
secured by a separate Supplemental
Indenture, or a single Supplemental
Indenture may secure more than one
series of Bonds.
(a) General. In the event that the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
determines that the City’s best interests will be served by causing a series
of Bonds to be obligations bearing
interest at variable interest rates,
then the Director of Finance is authorized to so specify in the Certificate of
Award for that series. The method
and procedure by which the variable
rate of interest to be borne by the
Bonds of that series are to be determined shall be set forth in the applicable Supplemental Indenture. Such
method or procedure may be by reference to a market index, by a remarketing agent or otherwise as set forth
in the applicable Supplemental Indenture, provided that no series of variable rate Bonds shall bear interest at
a rate in excess of twenty–five percent (25%) per year (including any
Bonds held by a provider of a Credit
Support Instrument). The Director of
Finance may determine that the
terms of a variable rate series of
Bonds may or may not permit the
holders to tender their variable rate
Bonds for purchase by the City. If the
Director of Finance designates any
series of Bonds as variable rate
Bonds, and if the holders of that
series of Bonds are to be entitled to
tender those Bonds for purchase, then
the Director of Finance shall also designate for those variable rate Bonds

The City Record
(and may designate others, from time
to time, in substitution therefor), the
tender agent or agents (which may be
the Trustee) and the remarketing
agent or agents (which may be any of
the Original Purchasers), which designations shall be based on the determination of the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the parties so
designated possess the requisite
resources and experience to provide
the services required of them and that
the terms on which the designated
parties have agreed to provide such
services are fair and commercially
reasonable. The Director of Finance
is authorized to enter into agreements
with others in connection with the
delivery of the Bonds, and from time
to time thereafter so long as the
Bonds are outstanding, as may be
by
the
Director
of
determined
Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for (i) the method of
determining the variable interest
rates, (ii) the rights and procedures
for tender, (iii) liquidity or credit support, (iv) repayment by the City of
any amounts drawn under the Credit
Support Instrument, (v) the direct
purchase of tendered Bonds, and (vi)
other arrangements in the best interests of the City. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to terminate any such agreements if the
Director of Finance determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the City’s best
interests will be served by such termination. The Director of Finance is further authorized to enter into agreements, from time to time so long as
the variable rate Bonds are outstanding, supplementing or amending the
applicable Supplemental Indenture
for a series of Bonds as provided in
Section 7. The Director of Finance is
authorized to pay any fees associated
with agreements entered into or terminated pursuant to this Section 4
from proceeds of Bonds, to the extent
permitted by the Indenture, and from
the Airport Revenues.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of any
series of Bonds, and regardless of
whether that series of Bonds bears
interest at variable or fixed rates, is
authorized to contract for a Credit
Support Instrument, and to pay the
costs of it from proceeds of the Bonds,
if the Director determines, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, that the Credit Support
Instrument will result in a savings in
the cost of the financing to the City.
(b) Form; Exchange and Transfer.
All Bonds shall be issued in fully registered form. The Bonds may be delivered in book–entry only form, in
which case they shall be registered in
the name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered owner, immobilized in the custody of the Depository,
and not be transferable or exchangeable (except for transfer to another
Depository or its nominee) without
further action by the City pursuant to
the provisions of the Supplemental
Indenture. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in the Original Indenture, no Bonds shall be exchanged for
or transferable into a coupon Revenue Bond or Bonds unless and until
the Indenture shall have been amended in accordance with the terms thereof to permit such exchanges or transfers. To the extent that the Original
Indenture (particularly, but without
limitation, Section 2.05) permits fully

1373

23
registered Revenue Bonds to be
exchanged for or transferred into
coupon Revenue Bonds or Revenue
Bonds payable to bearer, then the
Original Indenture is amended to prohibit such exchanges or transfers for
the Bonds unless and until the Indenture shall have been further amended
to permit such exchanges or transfers.
If any Depository determines not to
continue to act as a Depository for the
Bonds of any series then held in a
book–entry system, the Director of
Finance and the Trustee may attempt
establish
a
securities
to
depository/book–entry relationship
with another qualified Depository. If
the Director of Finance and the
Trustee do not or are unable to do so,
the Director of Finance and the
Trustee, after making provision for
notification of the beneficial owners
by the then Depository and any other
arrangements deemed necessary,
shall permit withdrawal of the Bonds
of any series from the Depository, and
authenticate and deliver registered
Bond certificates to the assigns of the
Depository or its nominee, all at the
cost and expense (including any costs
of printing), if the event is not the
result of action or inaction of the City,
of those persons requesting such
issuance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into any agreements
determined by the Director to be necessary in connection with any
book–entry system for any series of
Bonds, after determining that those
agreements will not endanger the
funds or securities of the City under
the Indenture (as evidenced by the
Director’s signing of those agreements).
(c) Dates; Denominations. The
Bonds of each series shall be dated as
of their date of issuance or such other
date provided in the Certificate of
Award for that series. The Bonds of
each series shall be issued in the
denominations permitted in the Supplemental Indenture for that series.
(d) Interest and Place of Payment.
The Bonds of each series shall bear
interest at their respective interest
rates specified in the Certificate of
Award (or, in the case of variable rate
Bonds, determined pursuant to the
Supplemental Indenture) for that
series. Bonds of the same series and
same maturity may bear interest at
different interest rates. The Bonds of
each series shall bear interest from
the most recent date to which interest
has been paid or duly provided for or,
if no interest has been paid or duly
provided for, from their date. The
principal and any redemption premium and the interest payable on each
series of Bonds shall be payable at the
times, to the persons and in the manner set forth in, or referenced by, the
Supplemental Indenture, including,
without limitation, provisions thereof
permitting special arrangements for
payments to the Depository.
(e) Maturities. The Bonds of each
series shall mature on the dates and
in the respective principal amounts
provided in the Certificate of Award,
consistent with this Ordinance and
the Indenture.
(f) Prior Redemption. The Bonds of
each series may be subject to redemption prior to maturity at the option of
the City, if and to the extent so provided in the Certificate of Award for
that series. Any Bonds so determined
to be subject to optional redemption

24
and maturing by their stated terms
after the earliest optional redemption
date shall be subject to redemption at
the option of the City on or after the
earliest optional redemption date in
whole or in part on any date at the
redemption prices provided in the Certificate of Award and in accordance
with the applicable Supplemental
Indenture and the Indenture. The

Award as term bonds subject to
mandatory sinking fund redemption

on each mandatory redemption date
designated in the Certificate of
Award in the aggregate amount of
the sinking fund installment to be
paid on such mandatory redemption
date, all as provided in the Certificate
of Award and in accordance with the
Supplemental Indenture. Any Bonds
designated in the Certificate of
Award as Direct Payment Obligations
may also be subject to extraordinary
optional redemption prior to maturity
by and at the sole option of the City in
whole or in part upon the occurrence
of events resulting in a reduction or
cessation of the applicable Direct
Payments at the redemption prices
specified in the Certificate of Award
(g) Purchase in Lieu of Redemption. The Bonds of each Series may be
subject to purchase by the City in lieu
of optional redemption if and to the
extent provided in the Certificate of
Award and the applicable Supplemental Indenture.
(h) Signing. The Bonds shall be
signed by the Mayor and the Director
of Finance, and approved as to form
by the Director of Law. Any or all of
the signatures of those officials may

An emergency resolution urging
the United States Postal Service to
keep the three Downtown Cleveland
locations being considered for closure
open for business.
Whereas, on August 4, 2011, the
Downtown Cleveland Improvement
Corporation unanimously passed a
resolution in support of keeping all
three Downtown post office locations
open; and
Whereas, the offices that are being
for
possible
closure
considered
include Tower City, the Old Arcade,
and Erieview; and
Whereas, with over 10,000 residents
and nearly 125,000 daily office workers, Downtown Cleveland is on the
cusp of another economic renaissance
with new developments and residential growth; and
Whereas, these three post offices
are the only offices located within
walking distance to the downtown
core and residential neighborhoods;
and
Whereas, the main post office located on Orange Avenue is simply not
accessible to someone who has chosen
to live car-free in Downtown Cleveland or does not drive to their office;
and
Whereas, closing these offices at a
time when residential demand is at an
all-time high and businesses begin
locating in Downtown due to its proximity to amenities sends the message
that the post office is not a part of
Cleveland’s rebirth; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the United States Postal Service to
keep the three Downtown Cleveland
locations being considered for closure open for business.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council

to keep open the Collinwood Post
Office located at 890 East 152nd Street
in Cleveland.
Whereas, the U. S. Postal Service
has recently announced they plan to
review several area post offices for
closure; and
Whereas, one post office they could
close is the Collinwood Post Office
located at 890 East 152nd Street in

Whereas, the City of Cleveland has
worked extremely hard over the
years to improve the Collinwood
neighborhood and keep it a thriving,
community-oriented business neighborhood; and
Whereas, if the Collinwood Post
Office were to close, this would devastate the Collinwood commercial
corridor and the adjacent residential
communities and especially seniors in
Cleveland’s Ward 10; and
Whereas, the lack of access to this
neighborhood post office would limit
neighborhood residents, especially
seniors, in transacting needed business and personal communication

immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,

An emergency resolution requesting the Jackson administration work
with Council to create an Office of
Project Management to ensure efficient and cost-effective project execution and delivery.
Whereas, Council believes that
businesses that have an Office of Project Management are better able to
deliver projects on a timely basis,
because they implement efficient and
cost-effective project initiation, planning, execution, monitoring and closing of projects and key milestones;

Project Management would establish
a process by which to help the city finish projects on time and on budget
through the use of established best
principles and practices, while ensuring the finished project meets the
city’s and community’s needs; and
Whereas, an Office of Project Management could use project teams to
oversee city projects that, when managed together, could provide greater
benefits than if managed separately;
and
Whereas, the city may be better
able to improve its success rate on
key projects by creating an Office of
Project Management; and
Whereas, this Council believes that
the City would benefit from having an
Office of Project management and is

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 931-11.
By Council Members J. Johnson,
Brancatelli, and Sweeney (by departmental request).
An emergency resolution supporting Cuyahoga County’s grant application to the Clean Ohio Council for
Clean Ohio Revitalization Funds to be
used for the demolition and remediation of the vacant Viking Hall at
Cleveland State University.
Whereas, the State of Ohio, through
the Clean Ohio Council, provides
financial assistance to local governments for the purpose of addressing
local needs; and
Whereas, Cuyahoga County is submitting a Clean Ohio Revitalization
Fund Program application to complete eligible activities, including but
not limited to, the demolition and
remediation of the vacant Viking
Hall at Cleveland State University;
and
Whereas, the Clean Ohio Revitalization Fund grant is vital to making
the completion of the redevelopment
of the Cleveland State University project economically feasible; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
approves and authorizes Cuyahoga
County to submit a Clean Ohio Revitalization Fund application for the
demolition and remediation of the
vacant Viking Hall at Cleveland
State University, and that the District
1 Integrating Committee of the Ohio
Public Works Commission and the
Clean Ohio Council are encouraged to
fund this innovative and worthwhile
project; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports
Cuyahoga
County’s
grant
application to the Clean Ohio Council for Clean Ohio Revitalization
funds to be used for the demolition
and
remediation
of
the
vacant
Viking Hall at Cleveland State University.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to send copies of this resolution to the Board of Cuyahoga County Commissioners and to the Clean
Ohio Council.
Section 3. That this resolution is
declared to be an emergency measure
and, provided it receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take
effect and be in force immediately
upon its adoption and approval by the
Mayor; otherwise it shall take effect
and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.

Res. No. 1120-11.
By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency resolution urging
the United States Postal Service to
keep the three Downtown Cleveland
locations being considered for closure
open for business.
Whereas, on August 4, 2011, the
Downtown Cleveland Improvement
Corporation unanimously passed a

1401

51
resolution in support of keeping all
three Downtown post office locations
open; and
Whereas, the offices that are being
considered
for
possible
closure
include Tower City, the Old Arcade,
and Erieview; and
Whereas, with over 10,000 residents
and nearly 125,000 daily office workers, Downtown Cleveland is on the
cusp of another economic renaissance
with new developments and residential growth; and
Whereas, these three post offices
are the only offices located within
walking distance to the downtown
core and residential neighborhoods;
and
Whereas, the main post office located on Orange Avenue is simply not
accessible to someone who has chosen
to live car-free in Downtown Cleveland or does not drive to their office;
and
Whereas, closing these offices at a
time when residential demand is at an
all-time high and businesses begin
locating in Downtown due to its proximity to amenities sends the message
that the post office is not a part of
Cleveland’s rebirth; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the United States Postal Service to
keep the three Downtown Cleveland
locations being considered for closure open for business.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit certified copies of this resolution to the
United States Postal Service, Downtown Cleveland Improvement Corporation, and Mayor Frank Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.

An emergency resolution urging

to keep open the Collinwood Post
Office located at 890 East 152nd Street

Whereas, the U. S. Postal Service
has recently announced they plan to
review several area post offices for
closure; and
Whereas, one post office they could
close is the Collinwood Post Office
located at 890 East 152nd Street in
Cleveland, Ohio 44110; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland has
worked extremely hard over the
years to improve the Collinwood
neighborhood and keep it a thriving,
community-oriented business neighborhood; and
Whereas, if the Collinwood Post
Office were to close, this would devastate the Collinwood commercial
corridor and the adjacent residential
communities and especially seniors in
Cleveland’s Ward 10; and
Whereas, the lack of access to this
neighborhood post office would limit
neighborhood residents, especially
seniors, in transacting needed business and personal communication
including paying bills, undertaking
sensitive transactions, and vital family and personal connections; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,

Section 3. Authorization of Hedging
Arrangements and Termination of

This Council finds that by engaging in interest rate hedging arrangements with respect to Revenue Bonds
the City may reduce its cost of borrowing by optimizing the relative
amounts of fixed and variable rate
obligations, or minimizing the risk of
variations in its debt service costs, or
obtaining savings by confirming
rates of interest on Revenue Bonds in
advance of their issuance. To permit
the City to have the flexibility to
undertake such arrangements, from
time to time, with respect to Revenue
Bonds and to establish the procedures
for approving those transactions, this
Council authorizes the signing and
delivery of one or more Hedge Agreements and any related agreements
necessary for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by
each Hedge Agreement. The authorizations in this Section 3 are supplemental to and not in derogation of any
authority provided by any other ordinance of this Council concerning
hedging arrangements.
Upon the determination of the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
that it is to the financial advantage of
the City and in the City’s best interests that a hedging arrangement be
undertaken by the City with respect
to any Revenue Bonds issued or to be
issued under the Indenture, the Director of Finance may authorize one or
more interest rate hedge transactions, from time to time, in accordance
with the applicable Hedge Agreement; provided that (a) the counterparty shall be rated at the time of
signing the Hedge Agreement not
lower than A by at least one rating
agency or its obligations under the
Hedge Agreement shall be guaranteed or insured by an entity rated at
the time of signing the Hedge Agreement not lower than A by at least one
rating agency, (b) the scheduled termination date of each hedge transaction shall be not later than the final
maturity of the Revenue Bonds to
which the hedge relates, and (c) the
terms and conditions of the Hedge
Agreement shall not conflict with the
Indenture.

1428

August 24, 2011
The Director of Finance shall negotiate the terms of each Hedge Agreement with a counterparty satisfying
the credit criteria in this Ordinance.
The City shall receive a written opinion of a Financial Advisor that the
payments made or to be made by the
counterparty to the City, or by the
City to the counterparty, shall be fair
value for the Hedge Agreement, considering, among other things, the
credit of the City’s Airport System,
the credit of the counterparty and the
terms and conditions of the Hedge
Agreement. Subject to the provisions
of this Ordinance, the Director of
Finance shall determine the terms
and conditions of the Hedge Agreement, including without limitation,
the time or times and procedures for
the exercise by the counterparty or
the City, as the case may be, of any
option under the Hedge Agreement,
whether the obligations of the City
under the Hedge Agreement shall be
secured by a Credit Support Instrument, and the rates to be paid by the
counterparty to the City and by the
City to the counterparty under the
Hedge Agreement in the event of the
exercise of the option. The approval
of each interest rate hedge transaction by the Director of Finance shall
be conclusively evidenced by the
signing and delivery of the applicable
Hedge Agreement by the Director of
Finance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to terminate any Hedge Agreement in whole or in part or any Credit
Support Instrument securing a Hedge
Agreement if the Director of Finance
determines, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the City’s best interests will be served
by such termination. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to enter
into amendments or modifications of
a Hedge Agreement or any Credit
Support Instrument securing a Hedge
Agreement determined by the Director of Finance, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, that
the City’s best interests will be served
by such amendment or modification.
The Director of Finance is authorized
to pay any amounts that the City may
owe upon early termination of any
Hedge Agreement or modification
thereof from moneys derived from the
sale of the Bonds or from moneys in
any of the following funds established under the Indenture: the Airport Operating and Maintenance
Fund (Fund No. 60-001), the Airport
Renewal and Replacement Fund
(Fund
No.
60-104),
the
Airport
Improvement Fund (Fund No. 60-105),
the Airport Surplus Fund (Fund No.
60-106), and the Airport Account of the
Airport Development Fund (Fund No.
60-141). Such moneys as are to be
expended in connection with the termination or modification of any
Hedge Agreement are appropriated
for that purpose.
The City’s obligations under any
Hedge Agreement shall be payable
from the Airport Revenues as defined
in the Indenture and may be payable
also from other funds permitted by
law to be used for the purpose, as
identified by the Director of Finance
in the Hedge Agreement. Those payments may be secured by a pledge of
Airport Revenues, to the extent permitted by the Indenture, all as determined by the Director of Finance and
set forth in the Hedge Agreement.
The obligation of the City to make
payments under any Hedge Agree-

August 24, 2011
ment does not and shall not represent
or constitute a general obligation,
debt, bonded indebtedness or a pledge
of the faith and credit of the City or
the State of Ohio. Nothing gives any
party to any Hedge Agreement the
right to have excises, ad valorem or
other taxes levied by the City or the
State of Ohio for the payment of any
amounts due under any Hedge Agreement.
Section 4. Terms of Bonds.
The Bonds shall contain the terms
provided in or determined pursuant
to, the Indenture, this Ordinance, the
applicable Certificate of Award and
the applicable Supplemental Indenture. Each series of Bonds may be
secured by a separate Supplemental
Indenture, or a single Supplemental
Indenture may secure more than one
series of Bonds.
(a) General. In the event that the
Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor,
determines that the City’s best interests will be served by causing a series
of Bonds to be obligations bearing
interest at variable interest rates,
then the Director of Finance is authorized to so specify in the Certificate of
Award for that series. The method
and procedure by which the variable
rate of interest to be borne by the
Bonds of that series are to be determined shall be set forth in the applicable Supplemental Indenture. Such
method or procedure may be by reference to a market index, by a remarketing agent or otherwise as set forth
in the applicable Supplemental Indenture, provided that no series of variable rate Bonds shall bear interest at
a rate in excess of twenty–five percent (25%) per year (including any
Bonds held by a provider of a Credit
Support Instrument). The Director of
Finance may determine that the
terms of a variable rate series of
Bonds may or may not permit the
holders to tender their variable rate
Bonds for purchase by the City. If the
Director of Finance designates any
series of Bonds as variable rate
Bonds, and if the holders of that
series of Bonds are to be entitled to
tender those Bonds for purchase, then
the Director of Finance shall also designate for those variable rate Bonds
(and may designate others, from time
to time, in substitution therefor), the
tender agent or agents (which may be
the Trustee) and the remarketing
agent or agents (which may be any of
the Original Purchasers), which designations shall be based on the determination of the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the parties so
designated possess the requisite
resources and experience to provide
the services required of them and that
the terms on which the designated
parties have agreed to provide such
services are fair and commercially
reasonable. The Director of Finance
is authorized to enter into agreements
with others in connection with the
delivery of the Bonds, and from time
to time thereafter so long as the
Bonds are outstanding, as may be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for (i) the method of
determining the variable interest
rates, (ii) the rights and procedures
for tender, (iii) liquidity or credit support, (iv) repayment by the City of
any amounts drawn under the Credit
Support Instrument, (v) the direct
purchase of tendered Bonds, and (vi)

The City Record
other arrangements in the best interests of the City. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to terminate any such agreements if the
Director of Finance determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the City’s best
interests will be served by such termination. The Director of Finance is further authorized to enter into agreements, from time to time so long as
the variable rate Bonds are outstanding, supplementing or amending the
applicable Supplemental Indenture
for a series of Bonds as provided in
Section 7. The Director of Finance is
authorized to pay any fees associated
with agreements entered into or terminated pursuant to this Section 4
from proceeds of Bonds, to the extent
permitted by the Indenture, and from
the Airport Revenues.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of any
series of Bonds, and regardless of
whether that series of Bonds bears
interest at variable or fixed rates, is
authorized to contract for a Credit
Support Instrument, and to pay the
costs of it from proceeds of the Bonds,
if the Director determines, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, that the Credit Support
Instrument will result in a savings in
the cost of the financing to the City.
(b) Form; Exchange and Transfer.
All Bonds shall be issued in fully registered form. The Bonds may be delivered in book–entry only form, in
which case they shall be registered in
the name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered owner, immobilized in the custody of the Depository,
and not be transferable or exchangeable (except for transfer to another
Depository or its nominee) without
further action by the City pursuant to
the provisions of the Supplemental
Indenture. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in the Original Indenture, no Bonds shall be exchanged for
or transferable into a coupon Revenue Bond or Bonds unless and until
the Indenture shall have been amended in accordance with the terms thereof to permit such exchanges or transfers. To the extent that the Original
Indenture (particularly, but without
limitation, Section 2.05) permits fully
registered Revenue Bonds to be
exchanged for or transferred into
coupon Revenue Bonds or Revenue
Bonds payable to bearer, then the
Original Indenture is amended to prohibit such exchanges or transfers for
the Bonds unless and until the Indenture shall have been further amended
to permit such exchanges or transfers.
If any Depository determines not to
continue to act as a Depository for the
Bonds of any series then held in a
book–entry system, the Director of
Finance and the Trustee may attempt
to
establish
a
securities
depository/book–entry relationship
with another qualified Depository. If
the Director of Finance and the
Trustee do not or are unable to do so,
the Director of Finance and the
Trustee, after making provision for
notification of the beneficial owners
by the then Depository and any other
arrangements deemed necessary,
shall permit withdrawal of the Bonds
of any series from the Depository, and
authenticate and deliver registered
Bond certificates to the assigns of the
Depository or its nominee, all at the
cost and expense (including any costs
of printing), if the event is not the

1429

79
result of action or inaction of the City,
of those persons requesting such
issuance.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into any agreements
determined by the Director to be necessary in connection with any
book–entry system for any series of
Bonds, after determining that those
agreements will not endanger the
funds or securities of the City under
the Indenture (as evidenced by the
Director’s signing of those agreements).
(c) Dates; Denominations. The
Bonds of each series shall be dated as
of their date of issuance or such other
date provided in the Certificate of
Award for that series. The Bonds of
each series shall be issued in the
denominations permitted in the Supplemental Indenture for that series.
(d) Interest and Place of Payment.
The Bonds of each series shall bear
interest at their respective interest
rates specified in the Certificate of
Award (or, in the case of variable rate
Bonds, determined pursuant to the
Supplemental Indenture) for that
series. Bonds of the same series and
same maturity may bear interest at
different interest rates. The Bonds of
each series shall bear interest from
the most recent date to which interest
has been paid or duly provided for or,
if no interest has been paid or duly
provided for, from their date. The
principal and any redemption premium and the interest payable on each
series of Bonds shall be payable at the
times, to the persons and in the manner set forth in, or referenced by, the
Supplemental Indenture, including,
without limitation, provisions thereof
permitting special arrangements for
payments to the Depository.
(e) Maturities. The Bonds of each
series shall mature on the dates and
in the respective principal amounts
provided in the Certificate of Award,
consistent with this Ordinance and
the Indenture.
(f) Prior Redemption. The Bonds of
each series may be subject to redemption prior to maturity at the option of
the City, if and to the extent so provided in the Certificate of Award for
that series. Any Bonds so determined
to be subject to optional redemption
and maturing by their stated terms
after the earliest optional redemption
date shall be subject to redemption at
the option of the City on or after the
earliest optional redemption date in
whole or in part on any date at the
redemption prices provided in the Certificate of Award and in accordance
with the applicable Supplemental
Indenture and the Indenture. The
Bonds designated in the Certificate of
Award as term bonds subject to
mandatory sinking fund redemption
shall be redeemed prior to maturity
on each mandatory redemption date
designated in the Certificate of
Award in the aggregate amount of
the sinking fund installment to be
paid on such mandatory redemption
date, all as provided in the Certificate
of Award and in accordance with the
Supplemental Indenture. Any Bonds
designated in the Certificate of
Award as Direct Payment Obligations
may also be subject to extraordinary
optional redemption prior to maturity
by and at the sole option of the City in
whole or in part upon the occurrence
of events resulting in a reduction or
cessation of the applicable Direct
Payments at the redemption prices
specified in the Certificate of Award

80
(g) Purchase in Lieu of Redemption. The Bonds of each Series may be
subject to purchase by the City in lieu
of optional redemption if and to the
extent provided in the Certificate of
Award and the applicable Supplemental Indenture.
(h) Signing. The Bonds shall be
signed by the Mayor and the Director
of Finance, and approved as to form
by the Director of Law. Any or all of
the signatures of those officials may
be facsimiles. The Bonds shall bear
the corporate seal of the City or a facsimile thereof.
(i) Numbering. The Bonds shall be
numbered as determined by the Director of Finance.
Section 5. Award and Sale of Bonds.
The Director of Finance shall sign
and deliver a Certificate of Award for
the Bonds. In the event the Bonds are
issued in more than one series sold at
different times, a separate Certificate
of Award shall be signed and delivered for each separately delivered
series. The Bonds shall be sold to one
or more Original Purchasers selected
by the Director of Finance and identified in the Certificate of Award. The
Bonds may be sold by direct placement to one or more institutions purchasing Bonds for their own account
and not for resale or may be sold to
financial institutions underwriting
the Bonds for sale to the public. Each
Certificate of Award shall determine
the following, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, consistent with this Ordinance and the
Indenture:

issued; provided that the aggregate
principal amount of Bonds issued in
one or more series under this Ordinance shall not exceed Seventy Million Dollars ($70,000,000);
(b) the purchase price to be paid to
the City by the Original Purchasers,
which amount shall be not less than:
(i) 97% of the amount determined by

amount of the Bonds any aggregate
original issue premium and subtracting from that amount any aggregate
original issue discount, plus (ii) any
accrued interest on the Bonds from
their date to the date of their delivery
to the Original Purchasers;
(c) whether the Bonds are to be
Tax-Exempt Bonds or Taxable Bonds
and, if the Bonds are Taxable Bonds,

(d) whether any Bonds are to be
subject to redemption prior to maturity, at the option of the City and, if so,
the dates those Bonds are subject to
prior redemption, or in the case of
extraordinary optional redemption,
the events giving rise to such redemption, and in either case the redemption price or prices, which may be
determined as a percentage of the
principal amount redeemed or by a
formula intended to make the bondholder whole for the loss of the investment resulting from the early redemption or by other methodology;
(e) the dates on which principal of
the Bonds is to be paid, which shall be
not later than thirty (30) years from
their respective dates of issuance,
with an identification of whether the
payment is due by stated maturity or
by mandatory sinking fund redemption of Bonds of a particular maturity;
(f) the interest rates to be borne by
Bonds bearing interest at a fixed rate,
the weighted average of which shall
not exceed eight percent (8%) as to

The City Record
Bonds of any series that are

any money to be deposited in the Bond
Service Reserve Fund in order to

Required Bond Service Reserve, if
and to the extent required by the
applicable Supplemental Indenture,
and any determination as to whether
there shall be a special reserve fund
for the Bonds of any series, separate

credit, or other form of credit or Credit Facility enhancing the security for
Bonds of that series in lieu of a funded reserve fund;

best interest of the City and consistent with all legal requirements.
The Director of Finance may enter
into one or more Bond Purchase
Agreements with the Original Purchasers of Bonds setting forth the
conditions for delivery of the Bonds
that are consistent with this Ordinance, the Certificate of Award, and
the Indenture and that are determined by the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a

In order to secure the payment of
the principal of and any premium and
interest on the Bonds, the Mayor, the

Section 11. Conversion and Remarketing or Refunding of Variable Rate
Bonds.
In the event that any series of
Bonds are issued as variable rate
obligations and the Director of
Finance determines that it is advantageous to the City to convert the
interest on such series of Bonds from
variable rates to fixed interest rates
for a period of time or to maturity, or
to convert the interest on any series of
Bonds bearing interest at a variable
rate to a different variable rate period
or mode, or to terminate or take other
actions with respect to any existing
Credit Support Instrument that will

any series of Bonds (such conversion
or other actions and the tender and
remarketing
being
collectively
referred to in this Section as “remarketing”), the City shall undertake the
remarketing in accordance with the
applicable Supplemental Indenture.
The City may enter into an agreement
with one or more purchasers for their

Bonds by a remarketing agent. In the
event that the interest rate on all of
the Bonds of a series is to be converted from variable rates to fixed rates
of interest to the final maturity of
that series of Bonds, the remarketing

the City to establish the date, location, procedure and conditions for the
remarketing of any series of Bonds

parties have notice of such pledge
and create a perfected security interest for all purposes of Chapter 1309,
Ohio Revised Code) without the
necessity for separation of delivery of
the Airport Revenues or for the filing
or recording of the Indenture or any
other resolution or instrument by
which such pledge is created or any
certificate, statement or other document with respect to such pledge. The
pledge of the Airport Revenues under
the Indenture shall be effective and
the money therefrom and thereof may
be applied to the purposes for which
pledged without necessity for any further act of appropriation.
Section 13. Financial Advisors and
Consultants.
The Director of Finance may obtain

the Director of Finance in making
any of the determinations required by

The City Record
this Ordinance to be determined by
the Director of Finance with respect
to the Bonds, any Hedge Agreements
and any Credit Support Instruments.
The Director of Finance may rely on
the written advice of any Financial
Advisor so retained. The Director of
Port Control may obtain the services
of one or more feasibility consultants,
from time to time, to provide reports
