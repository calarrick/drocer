domestic partners;
Whereas, in Ohio, the Cities of
Cleveland Heights and Columbus and
Franklin and Lucas Counties offer
their employees domestic partner benefits, and 19 Ohio public and private
colleges and universities offer these

Whereas, in order to remain competitive in the recruitment and retention of the best employees for the

this Council has determined to provide employment benefits to employees’ domestic partners in registered

Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:

of duty.
An employee’s registered domestic
partner and the partner’s family shall
be considered as “family members”
with respect to City of Cleveland
nepotism policies.
Section 2. Eligibility for health and
dental insurance benefits shall commence at the next open enrollment
period.
Section 3. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure
and, provided it receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take
effect and be in force immediately
upon its passage and approval by the

Ord. No. 421-11.
By Council Members Cleveland,
Brancatelli, and Sweeney (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Economic Development to enter into an Enterprise
Zone Agreement with Midtown Acquisition, LLC, or its designee, to provide
for a ten-year, sixty percent tax abatement for certain real property
improvements located at 6900 and
7000 Euclid Avenue in the Cleveland
Area Enterprise Zone.
Whereas, by letter dated March 10,
2011, the City provided the Cleveland
Metropolitan
School
District
(“CMSD”) with a notice of proposed
tax exemptions required by Section
5709.83 of the Revised Code. That
notice was provided to the CMSD not
later than fourteen days prior to adoption of this ordinance; and

March 30, 2011
Whereas, under Ordinance No. 94895, passed June 19, 1995, this Council
designated an area, which is in the
City of Cleveland and described in
File No. 948-95-A, as the Cleveland
Area Enterprise Zone (the “Zone”)
under Chapter 5709 of the Revised
Code; and
Whereas, in August, 1995, the Director of Development of the State of
Ohio determined that the Zone contains the characteristics described in
division (A) of Section 5709.61 of the
Revised Code and certified the area
as an “Urban Jobs and Enterprise
Zone” under Chapter 5709 of the
Revised Code; and
Whereas, Midtown Acquisition,
LLC, or its designee (the “Enterprise”) has proposed to redevelop a
large vacant building at 6900 and 7000
Euclid Avenue in the Cleveland Area
Enterprise Zone; and
Whereas, the Enterprise has certified to the City that it would be at a
competitive disadvantage operating
at this location if taxes on certain real
property improvements located at
6900 and 7000 Euclid Avenue were not
abated; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the immediate preservation of the
public peace, safety, property, and
welfare and that its enactment is a
necessary prerequisite to providing
immediate assistance to create and
preserve
job
opportunities
and
advance and promote commercial and
economic development in the City of

immediately necessary or jobs will be
lost; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
approves the application of the Enterprise for enterprise zone incentives
on the basis that the Enterprise is
qualified by financial responsibility
and business experience to create and
preserve employment opportunities in
the Cleveland Area Enterprise Zone
and to improve the economic climate
of the City of Cleveland.

By Mayor Jackson and Council
Members
Kenneth
Johnson
and
Sweeney.
An emergency resolution supporting passage of Senate Bill 125 by the
Ohio General Assembly to enable
cities to share services more efficiently and less costly.
Whereas, currently cities in Ohio
cannot exercise municipal powers
outside their borders without express
statutory authority; and
Whereas, in the past the Ohio General Assembly has authorized cities
to enter into mutual aid agreements
so that cities could provide police and
fire protection to their surrounding
communities; and
Whereas, there is currently no Ohio
statutory authority to provide other
municipal services such as waste collection and snow removal to a neighboring community; and
Whereas, cities in Ohio are struggling to find ways to cut costs; and
Whereas, one way for cities to
reduce their costs is to band together
with their neighboring communities
in the provision of governments services to their residents; and
Whereas, with the full support of
Mayor Jackson, Ohio Senators Nina

10
Turner and Bill Seitz are co-sponsoring Senate Bill 125 which, if passed by
the Ohio General Assembly, would
enable cities to share services more
efficiently and less costly; and
Whereas, this Council supports the
passage of Senate Bill 125 and urges
that the state legislators expedite
their review and passage of this
worthwhile legislation;
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council joins
Mayor Jackson in supporting the passage of Senate Bill 125 to enable cities
to share services more efficiently and
less costly.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to send a copy of this resolution to William G. Batchelder,
Speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives, Thomas E. Niehaus, President of the Senate, and to Ohio Senators Nina Turner and Bill Seitz.
Section 3. That this resolution is
declared to be an emergency measure
and, provided it receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take
effect and be in force immediately
upon its adoption and approval by the
Mayor; otherwise it shall take effect
and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.

Purpose
The purpose of this document is to identify the policy that will govern the investment activities of the Treasurer’s Office
of the City of Cleveland. This policy has been adopted by, and, if necessary, will be revised on an annual basis by, the
Director of Finance.
This policy is designed to ensure prudent management of public funds, conformance to Chapter 178 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland, availability of operating and capital funds when needed, and an investment return competitive with comparable funds and financial market indices.
All participants in the investment process shall act responsibly as custodians of the public trust. Investment officials
shall recognize that the investment portfolio is subject to public review and evaluation. The overall program shall be
designed and managed with a degree of professionalism that is worthy of the public trust.

Scope of the Investment Policy
This policy applies to the investment of all moneys of the City of Cleveland under the custody and control of the Division of Treasury. Any practice not clearly authorized under this policy is prohibited. The guidance set forth herein is
to be strictly followed by all those responsible for any aspect of the management or administration of these funds.
The City’s investments shall be segregated into distinct portfolios, including portfolios for the General Fund, and the
Divisions of Water, Airport, Utilities, Cemeteries, Safety, and Railroads. Total Average Portfolio, as defined in this policy, shall mean the average of the month-end market values for the prior twelve (12) month period of an individual portfolio.

Investment Objectives
All Portfolios shall be managed to accomplish the following hierarchy of objectives:

Preservation of Principal – The single most important objective of the City of Cleveland investment program is the
preservation of principal of those funds within the Portfolio.
Maintenance of Liquidity – The Portfolio shall be managed in such a manner that assures that funds are available as
needed to meet those immediate and/or future operating requirements of the City of Cleveland.

445

The City Record

March 30, 2011

Maximize Return – The Portfolio shall be managed in such a fashion as to attain a market-average rate of return
throughout budgetary and economic cycles, within the context and parameters set forth by objectives 1 and 2 above.

Delegation of Authority
The Treasurer is responsible for the prudent investment of the City of Cleveland Treasury and shall oversee the establishment of investment procedures consistent with this policy. Such procedures shall include explicit delegation of
authority to persons responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this policy and the procedures established by the Treasurer. The Treasurer shall
be responsible for all trades undertaken, and shall establish a system of controls to regulate the activities of subordinate officials and shall exercise control over that staff. Investment staff shall be bonded in amounts appropriate to levels of responsibility and portfolio characteristics.
The City’s Internal Auditor will review the investment program to ensure compliance with this policy.

Standard of Prudence
The standard of prudence to be applied to the investment of the City of Cleveland shall be the industry standard “Prudent Investor Rule”, which states:

“Investments shall be made with judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing which persons of
prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but
for investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the probable income to be derived.”
Treasury staff acting in accordance with this policy or any other written procedures pertaining to the administration
and management of the City of Cleveland and who exercise the proper due diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or market price changes, provided that these deviations are reported
immediately to the Treasurer and that appropriate action is taken to control and prevent any further adverse developments.

Ethics and Conflict of Interest
Employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with the
proper execution and management of the investment program, or that could impair their ability to make impartial decisions. Further, no employee involved in the investment process shall use the authority to influence of office or employment to secure anything of value or the promise or offer of anything of value that would create an improper influence
upon the public official or employee with respect to that person’s duties.
Employees and investment officials shall comply fully with the reporting and disclosure requirements of Chapter 102 of
the Ohio Revised Code.

of assets in a specific maturity, a specific issuer or a specific type of security. The maximum percentage of the Total

Each Portfolio will be further diversified to limit the exposure to any one issuer. No more than 2% of the Total Average
Portfolio will be invested in the securities of any single issuer with the following exceptions:

Maximum Maturity
Maintenance of adequate liquidity to meet the cash flow needs of the City is essential. Accordingly, each Portfolio will
be structured in a manner that ensures sufficient cash is available to meet anticipated liquidity needs. Selection of
investment maturities must be consistent with the cash requirements in order to avoid the forced sale of securities prior
to maturity.
Assets will be invested in permitted investments with a stated maturity of no more than five (5) years from the date of
purchase unless the security is matched to a specific obligation or debt of the City. To control the volatility of the assets,
the Treasurer of the City will determine a duration target, not to exceed three (3) years.
Notwithstanding these limitations, in no case will the assets in any Portfolio be invested in securities with a term to
maturity that exceeds the expected disbursement date of those funds.

Prohibited Investments and Investment Practices
The Treasurer is expressly prohibited from the following investments and investment practices.
This is not an exclusive list.
Short sales (selling a specific security before it has been legally purchased);
Investment in complex derivatives such as range notes, dual index notes, inverse floating rate notes and deleveraged
notes, or notes linked to lagging indices or to long-term indices;
Collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) and real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs);
Investing in any security not specifically permitted by this Policy.

Monitoring and Adjusting the Portfolio
Those responsible for the day-to-day management of the Portfolios will routinely monitor the contents of each Portfolio,
the available markets and the relative values of competing instruments, and will adjust each Portfolio as necessary to
meet the investment objectives listed above. It is recognized and understood that this non-speculative active management of Portfolio holdings may cause a loss on the sale of an owned investment. It is the policy of the City of Cleveland
to charge any such loss against the interest income account during the month in which the loss was realized.
The City of Cleveland Office of Budget and Management, on a quarterly basis, allocates the net income/losses earned
on investments of the General Revenue Account to various funds based on each fund’s cash balance in proportion to the
City of Cleveland as a whole.

Internal Controls
The City Treasurer is responsible for monitoring a system of internal controls governing the administration and management of the Portfolio which include a review of all investment activity, trade reconciliation, and targeting cash balances. Such controls are designed to prevent and control losses of the City funds arising from fraud, employee error, misrepresentation by third parties, unanticipated changes in financial markets, or imprudent actions by any personnel. The
internal controls address: control of collusion, separation of duties, separating transaction authority from accounting
and record keeping, custodial safekeeping, clear delegation of authority, written confirmation of telephone transactions, minimizing the number of authorized investments officials and documentation of investment transactions.

Eligible Banks and Broker/Dealers
The Director of Finance will establish and the Treasurer will maintain a list of eligible brokers, dealers, and banks with
which investment transactions can be made, as described in Section 178.11 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of
Cleveland. Qualified firms will be limited to “primary” dealers and other dealers that qualify under Securities and
Exchange Commission Rule 15C3-1 (uniform net capital rule) that are registered with the Ohio Department of Commerce
to do business in the State of Ohio. All financial institutions and broker dealers must provide the following information,
on an annual basis:
Sworn statement pledging to adhere to “Capital Adequacy Standards”
Annual financial statements for the most recent year showing the amount of liquid capital
A written statement from a certified public accountant certifying no weakness in the internal systems of controls of the
dealer or broker were found
A completed “Broker/Dealer Request for Information” and all documentation required by Section 178.12 of the Codified
Ordinances of the City of Cleveland.
Preference will be given to banks and broker/dealers who are headquartered or maintain a presence in the City of Cleveland.
Financial institutions and broker/dealers will be required to comply with this policy and to pledge to offer for sale only
appropriate securities.

Competitive Selection of Investment Instruments
It will be the policy of the Treasurer to transact all security purchases/sales only with approved financial institutions
through a competitive process. The City shall accept the offer which (a) has the highest rate of return within the maturity required; and (b) optimizes the investment objective of the overall portfolio. When selling a security, the Treasurer will select the bid that generates the highest sale price.
Primary fixed price Federal Agency offerings may be purchased from the list of qualified broker/dealers without competitive solicitation.
In making investment decisions, all other things being equal and subject to compliance with any applicable Internal
Revenue Code requirements for bond proceeds, investment in corporations and financial institutions doing business in
the City of Cleveland will be given preference over other investment options.

Safekeeping and Custody
All investment securities purchased by the Treasurer or held as collateral on deposits or investments shall be held in
third-party safekeeping at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland or at a secured and insured depository as required by
Chapter 178 of the City of Cleveland Codified Ordinance and Section 113.05 of the Ohio Revised Code.
All securities in the Portfolio shall be held in the name of the Treasurer of the City of Cleveland and will be free and
clear of any lien. Further, all investment transactions will be conducted on a delivery-vs.-payment basis. The depository shall issue a safekeeping receipt to the Treasurer listing the specific instrument, rate, maturity and other pertinent
information.
Appropriate Treasury officials and representatives of the depository responsible for, or in any manner involved with,
the safekeeping and custody process of the City of Cleveland shall be bonded in such a fashion as to protect the City from
losses from malfeasance and misfeasance.

Performance Standards
The investment portfolios shall be designed and managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return
throughout budgetary and economic cycles, commensurate with the investment risk constraints and cash flows needs of
the City.

Reporting
The City Treasury shall maintain accurate, complete, and timely records of all investment activities. Each business day,
the Treasurer shall provide the Commissioner of Accounts and the City Controller a sworn statement (Daily Treasurer’s
Report) showing the total amount deposited in and withdrawn from each depository from the preceding business day.
Within fifteen (15) business days of the end of the month, the City Treasurer shall submit an investment report to the
Director of Finance. This report shall include: (i.) a listing of the existing portfolios in terms of investment securities,
book value, maturity date, return, market value, and other features deemed relevant, (ii.) a listing of all transactions
executed during the month. The City Treasurer will also prepare annual reports in sufficient detail to provide full disclosure of all investment activities to the Director of Finance.

Conflict of Law
In the event that any portion of this policy is in conflict with any City, State, or Federal law, that law will prevail.

Investment Policy Effective Date
This policy is adopted this 9th day of April 2009 and shall remain in effect until rescinded or amended by the Director of
Finance.

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 101-11.
By Council Member Miller.
An emergency resolution supporting House Bill No. 4 of the 129th Ohio
General Assembly that would amend
the Ohio Revised Code to eliminate
the financial responsibility random
verification program of the Bureau of
Motor Vehicles.
Whereas, House Bill No. 4 introduced on January 11, 2011 by Representative Matt Huffman (R) would
amend the Ohio Revised Code to eliminate the financial responsibility random verification program of the
Bureau of Motor Vehicles; and

24
Whereas, current law requires that
a person be able to verify the person’s
ability to pay for damages for liability that come from the ownership,
maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle; and
Whereas, the ability to provide this
verification is called proof of financial responsibility and is usually
accomplished
through
providing
proof of motor vehicle liability insurance coverage; and
Whereas, under current law, any
person operating a motor vehicle in
Ohio or permitting another to operate
the person’s motor vehicle in Ohio
may be required to provide that proof
of financial responsibility under the
following circumstances:
• Involvement in a traffic accident
requiring the filing of an accident
report;
• Receipt of a traffic ticket indication that proof of financial responsibility was not produced upon the
request of a peace officer or State
Highway Patrol trooper; and
• Whenever the person is randomly selected by the Registrar and
requested to provide verification
under the random verification program; and
Whereas, failure to maintain proof
of financial responsibility results in
two civil penalties:
• suspension of operating privileges and impoundment of driver’s
license, and
• suspension of vehicle registration and impoundment of certificate
of registration; and
Whereas, current law requires the
Registrar to establish the random verification program by rule, but House
Bill No. 4 would repeal this program;
and
Whereas, with the looming state
budget hole, eliminating the random
verification program would save the
State of Ohio $800,000; and
Whereas, all other requirements of
proof of financial responsibility
remain unchanged; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports House Bill No. 4 of the 129th
Ohio General Assembly that would
amend the Ohio Revised Code to eliminate the financial responsibility random verification program of the
Bureau of Motor Vehicles.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit certified copies of this resolution to Representative Huffman, the 129th Ohio
General Assembly and Mayor Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted March 21, 2011.
Effective March 24, 2011.
