December 7, 2011
Res. No. 1720-11.
By Council Members Cummins,
Westbrook, Zone, Cimperman, Cleveland, Mitchell, J. Johnson, Brancatelli, Brady, Polensek, Pruitt, Conwell,
K. Johnson and Dow.
An emergency resolution recognizing and supporting the principles of
the Occupy Movement and the peaceful and lawful exercise of the First
Amendment as a cherished and fundamental right in the effort to seek
solutions for economically distressed
Americans at the federal, state and
local levels; committing to work with
the Jackson administration to take
steps to minimize economic insecurity and destructive disparities in the
City of Cleveland; and requesting our
County, State and U.S. elected leaders
generate solutions for economically
distressed Americans.
Whereas, Cleveland community
members, like others across the United States, are frustrated by the continuing economic crisis that threatens individual, family, small local
business and City finances, and our
community’s quality of life, and are
participating in Occupy protests to
make their voices heard; and
Whereas, the economic roots of
these protests are varied, including
sustained unemployment, growing
income disparity, banking system
failures, stalled earning power, and
unjust tax systems, that all contribute to ongoing wealth disparities;
and
Whereas, the political roots of these
protests are also varied, including the
growing political power of corporations, influence of money on elections
and public policy and inability of
average citizens to have their voices
heard and needs met through formal
political forums, thus contributing to
citizens pursuing alternative political arenas; and
Whereas, this prolonged economic
downturn has hurt nearly all Americans, in the areas of wealth loss,
unemployment, and housing access, it
has taken an even greater toll on people of color and women. Women are
29% more likely to be poor than men.
The poverty rate for single mother
families has increased to 40.7%. Economic gains made by people of color
since the Civil Rights Movement have
been substantially reduced by the
Great Recession; and Caucasian
Americans experienced a net wealth
loss of 16 percent from 2005 to 2009.
African Americans lost about half of
their wealth and Latinos lost twothirds of their wealth in this same
period [Ref: Census Bureau, Income,
Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2010]; and
Whereas, more than 25 million
Americans are unemployed and seeking work; more than 50 million Americans are living without health insurance; and, more than one in five American children are growing up in
households living in poverty without
sufficient resources to meet basic survival needs, such as food, clothing,
and shelter [Ref: unemployed defined
as unemployed, marginally attached
to the labor force, or working only
part-time for economic reasons, U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics, Table A15. Alternative measures of labor
underutilization]; and
Whereas, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), in its report, a
“CDC Health Disparities & Inequalities Report - United States, 2011” documents that income inequality in the

The City Record
United States is the highest among
advanced industrialized nations, with
wide-spread inequities in U.S. health
outcomes by income, race, and gender; and
Whereas, over the past 30 years,
gains in our economy have accrued
largely to the top 1% of Americans,
who now control 43% of the total net
wealth, and to the next 19% on the top
that control 50% of the wealth in the
United States (top 20% controls 93%
of wealth with the bottom 80% controlling only 7%) due in part to public
policies that can be changed [Ref:
Wealth Income and Power, by G.
William Domhoff, UC Santa Cruz,
2011]; and
Whereas, one of the largest problems distressing our economy is the
prolonged foreclosure crisis, with
many owners struggling to obtain
loan adjustments and too many banks
continuing the use of flawed review
procedures which end up flooding the
housing market with foreclosures
and result in blighted and de-valued
housing stock due to the high number
of properties being left vacant and
abandoned and poorly maintained;
and
Whereas, the Cleveland-LorainElyria metropolitan area has been
particularly hard-hit by the foreclosure crisis, ranking 27th of 366 metropolitan statistical areas in the rate of
foreclosures (8.2%) according to a
March, 2011 ranking compiled by an
analysis of LPS Applied Analytics
Data by Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC); and
Whereas, the Cleveland-LorainElyria metropolitan areas ranked
eighth amongst the nation’s 25
largest metro areas in its percentage
of underwater mortgages (41.5%)
according to third quarter 2011 data
provided by Zillow Real Estate Market reports; and
Whereas, local governments are
straining
under
the
increasing
weight of responsibility to provide for
basic support services at a time of
declining tax revenues and as a result
of budget reductions by the state and
federal government; and
Whereas, the structural causes of
the economic crisis facing our society
require decisive and sustained action
at the national and state levels. Cities
are harmed by the crisis and must
play an important role in the development of public policy to address it;
and
Whereas, this Council commits to
working with the Jackson administration to continue taking steps to
minimize economic insecurity and
destructive disparities in the City by:
1. following the City’s Community
Reinvestment Act practices to ensure
that public funds are invested in
responsible financial institutions that
demonstrate strong support for our
community. The Council may also
consider future legislation to promote
responsible banking and provide an
incentive for banking institutions to
invest more in our City, particularly
with regard to stabilizing the housing
market and supporting the creation of
new businesses. This review should
include evaluating City policies on
responsible depositing and management of City funds;
2. examining the number of home
foreclosures in Cleveland, the geographic neighborhoods in which the
foreclosures are occurring, and lender
information on homes involved in the
foreclosure process, including real

1973

21
estate owned homes; working with
the Cuyahoga County Land Bank, the
City of Cleveland Housing Court, and
Case Western Reserve University’s
NEOCanDo to gather qualitative data
on the circumstances and causes of
foreclosures and the foreclosure
methods and practices of lenders,
including
reviewing
apparent
inequities many people in Cleveland
face when lender foreclosure proceedings occur;
3. consulting with advocates of tax
reform and experts on equitable taxation and review past tax reform
efforts in order to work effectively
with the County and State Legislature toward a more equitable tax
structure;
4. as federal and state assistance
dwindles, continuing to use available
resources to provide assistance for
the most vulnerable people in Cleveland; and
5. because reforms in education and
career preparation are essential for
building a viable future and disparities in these areas begin very early in
life and often continue through adulthood, seeking maximum possible
funding for Early Learning and Basic
Education in the State Legislative
Agenda; and recognizing the critical
importance of supporting community
colleges, technical colleges, and state
universities as they provide access to
retraining and workforce development opportunities; and.
Whereas, Congress must generate
solutions for economically distressed
Americans by:
1. Supporting job creation, making
investments
in
the
substantial
nation’s critical physical and technological infrastructure, and reducing
the deficit by adopting fiscal policies
with equitable corporate and individual taxation and by allowing the 2010
extension of President Bush’s tax
cuts to expire in 2012 as the law currently requires;
2. Tightening regulation of the
banking and financial sector, including adoption of new rules and vigorous investigation and prosecution of
individuals and corporations that violate the fraud, theft, and securities
laws; and
3. Retaining or increasing community-building block grants for local
schools and social services and protect public education from devastating cuts and prevent tuition levels
that block fair access to higher education; and
Whereas, this Council does not condone actions that infringe upon the
lawful rights of others, obstruct or
interfere with the efforts of law
enforcement officers to protect such
rights, or cause personal injury or
property destruction; and
Whereas, Americans can and must
resolve the divisive economic and
social realities facing our nation in a
peaceful way that honors our commitment to democracy, equality and justice; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council recognizes and supports the principles of
the Occupy Movement and the peaceful and lawful exercise of the First
Amendment as a cherished and fundamental right in the effort to seek

22
solutions for economically distressed
Americans at the federal, state and
local levels.
Section 2. That this Council commits to working with the Jackson
administration to continue taking
steps to minimize economic insecurity and destructive disparities in the
City of Cleveland.
Section
3.
That
this
Council
requests our Congressional leaders

distressed Americans.
Section 4. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this

Obama and all members of the U.S.
Congress.
Section 5. That this resolution is

the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon

and
