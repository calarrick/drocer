ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 1609-11.
By Council Members Cimperman
and J. Johnson.
An emergency resolution urging
the United States Congress to preserve, protect and provide adequate
funding for Federal Student Aid.
Whereas, Federal Student Aid programs offer students an opportunity
to acquire the knowledge and skills
our nation demands for a strong
recovery; and
Whereas, work force projections
show that by 2018, there will be jobs
for as many as 22 million new workers with college degrees, but on our
current trajectory, our nation won’t
make that goal – in fact we’ll miss it
by three million workers; and
Whereas, recent budget deals have
already cut $30 billion from the student aid programs, sacrificing some
students’ benefits to pay for others,
while states across the country are
cutting higher education from their
own budgets; and
Whereas, the Joint Committee on
Deficit Reduction or “Super Committee” is mandated to reach an agreement by November 23, 2011 on cutting
the deficit by $1.2 trillion, and federal
student aid programs could face further funding cuts; and
Whereas, it’s more important than
ever to preserve, protect and provide
adequate funding for the core federal
student aid programs – such as Pell
Grants and student loan benefits; and
Whereas, this Council joins the Student Aid Alliance, the higher education coalition of AJCU and 61 other
higher education associations, including John Carroll University, in urging

the United States Congress to preserve Federal Student Aid; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the United States Congress to preserve, protect and provide adequate
funding for Federal Student Aid.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit copies
of this resolution to the United States
Congress, John Carroll University,
and Mayor Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted November 14, 2011.
Effective November 16, 2011.

Res. No. 1610-11.
By Council Members Polensek and
J. Johnson.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio General Assembly to renew
and fully fund the Job Ready Sites
program that, along with the Clean
Ohio Fund, enables distressed property cleanup for urban redevelopment.
Whereas, the Job Ready Sites program, along with the Clean Ohio
Fund, have strong support statewide,
particularly in urban areas that have
little or no undeveloped land; and
Whereas, both programs provide
outright grants to help cover part of
the cost of cleaning up chemically
contaminated
land
or
vacant,
asbestos filled buildings; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
passed Resolution No. 1226-11 on September 12, 2011 in support of renewing
the Clean Ohio Fund;
Whereas, authorization for the Job
Ready Sites program is set to expire
December 31st, while the deadline for
the final round of grants was November 1st of this year; and
Whereas, Job Ready Sites, authorized by Ohio voters in 2005, was
designed to build a portfolio of commercial and industrial properties that
would be attractive to growing businesses because they were in near
move-in condition; and
Whereas, a Job Ready Sites grant
might cover the cost of ridding a property of its asbestos contamination or
of replacing old windows with new,
energy-efficient ones; and
Whereas, the possible demise of the
Job Ready Sites program, along with
the Clean Ohio Fund, is related to
Governor Kasich’s reorganization of
the Department of Development and
the creation of JobsOhio, a private,
nonprofit body that will run many of
the state’s business attraction and
retention programs; and
Whereas, both programs have
received their money from bonds
issued against the profit stream from
Ohio’s state run liquor business; however, Governor Kasich intends to sell
the liquor revenue stream to fund JobsOhio, wiping out the programs’
source of money; and

1884

November 23, 2011
Whereas, unless the Job Ready
Sites program and the Clean Ohio
Fund are renewed, Cleveland will
lose valuable economic development
projects; and
Whereas, for an example, Silverlode Consulting Corporation in Cleveland won’t be able to go forward with
business expansion projects if it can’t
get state grants for brownfield
cleanup assistance; and
Whereas, the Job Ready Sites program, along with the Clean Ohio
Fund, are integral to saving agricultural land and redeveloping alreadydesignated portions of urban areas;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby
urges the Ohio General Assembly to
renew and fully fund the Job Ready
Sites program that, along with the
Clean Ohio Fund, enables distressed
property cleanup for urban redevelopment.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit copies
of this resolution to Governor John
Kasich, Senator Thomas Niehaus,
President of the Senate, Representative William Batchelder, Speaker of
the Ohio House of Representatives,
and Mayor Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.

and basement and repealing Resolution No. 1237-11, objecting to said
transfer.

44114, Permanent No. 8001459, by Resolution No. 1237-11 adopted by the

Res. No. 1616-11.
By Council Members Sweeney and
Keane.
An emergency resolution urging
the United States Postmaster General
to keep open the post office located at
14039 Puritas Avenue in Cleveland.
Whereas, the U.S. Postal Service
has recently announced they plan to
possibly close the post office located
at 14039 Puritas Avenue in Cleveland;
and
Whereas, Puritas Avenue in the
city of Cleveland is a community-oriented neighborhood of family-owned
businesses; and
Whereas, closing the post office
located on Puritas Avenue would

The City Record
destroy this commercial corridor and
cause hardship to the families living
in the adjacent residential communities in Cleveland’s Ward 18; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of

Adopted November 14, 2011.
Effective November 16, 2011.

Res. No. 1617-11.
By Mayor Jackson and Council
Members Zone, Westbrook and Cimperman.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) to reconsider its draft
scores and fund Phase II of the Lakefront West project.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland has
provided ODOT with a revised scoring proposal in response to its draft
scores for Phase II of the Lakefront
West project, to account for corrected
data and particular project benefits
not accounted for in the draft scores;
and
Whereas, the Lakefront West project is transformative for Cleveland
and its region, with long-term benefits in economic development, community development, motorist and pedestrian safety, recreation access, and
improved quality of life for local residents, to Northeast Ohio and to the
entire State of Ohio; and
Whereas, the economic health of
Ohio is dependent on the economic
health of its metropolitan areas, as
evidenced by the fact that the Cleveland-Akron metropolitan area alone
accounted for $133 billion or 28% of
the State’s $478 billion annual gross
domestic product in 2010; and
Whereas, the long-term loss of population and jobs in the City of Cleveland has weakened the economy of
the Cleveland region and Northeast
Ohio and has, thereby, deprived Ohio
of the full economic benefits that the
State’s largest region has the potential to provide; and
Whereas, Cleveland is currently
pursuing a multi-faceted strategy to
stabilize its population and grow its
economy, and a key element of that
strategy is reconnecting Cleveland to
its greatest asset – Lake Erie; and
Whereas, the Lakefront West project will transform a 2 1/2 mile freeway-style road along Cleveland’s
lakefront into a tree-lined lakefront
boulevard, with easy connections to
the waterfront and to Edgewater
Lakefront State Park; and

1885

23
Whereas, not only will the project
dramatically increase the desirability
of nearby urban districts, but it will
contribute to changing Cleveland’s
old “rustbelt” image to one of a
vibrant waterfront community – stimulating development and revitalization with associated increases in
property values, incomes, employment and tax revenues; and
Whereas, this change is important
not only for attracting new investment but also for retaining existing
businesses, including over 2,500 manufacturing jobs in companies adjacent to the West Shoreway in the
Detroit Shoreway, Ohio City, and
Flats West Bank districts; and
Whereas, the Lakefront West project will help retain existing manufacturing by improving traffic flow
and safety for trucks serving industries in the Flats district, including
the salt mines that provide road salt
for much of the Midwest; and
Whereas, one of the most significant benefits of the Lakefront West
project is elimination of critical safety hazards for pedestrians and
motorists, particularly where the
West Shoreway meets West 28th
Street, adjacent to the historic Lakeview Terrace public housing development; failure to correct these lifethreatening hazards to pedestrians
and motorists would be nothing less
than unconscionable; and
Whereas, eight years of community
meetings have built broad-based public support for the Lakefront West
project among the thousands of Clevelanders who participated and has
stimulated millions of dollars of
investment in anticipation of the
improvements; and
Whereas, construction of the first
phase project elements is underway,
and failure to fund the next phase of
work would leave the project half-finished and would be seen by many
local residents and businesses as an
example of a promise made and then
broken; and
Whereas, the Greater Cleveland
Partnership (Cleveland’s chamber of
commerce) and the region’s 5-county
metropolitan planning organization,
Northeast Ohio Area Wide Coordinating
Agency
(NOACA)
recently
responded to ODOT’s request to prioritize regional transportation projects
and placed the Lakefront West project near the top of the list; and
Whereas, after decades of decline,
the neighborhoods and districts adjacent to the Cleveland’s West Shoreway have begun to turn around; Ohio
City, Detroit Shoreway and the Cudell/Edgewater district are now experiencing community and economic
development activity that is based, in
part, on proximity to Lake Erie and
its recreational and scenic amenities
and the anticipation of implementation of the Lakefront West transportation project; and
Whereas, in the Detroit Shoreway
neighborhood, over $400 million in
development has been completed, is
under construction, or is being
planned, in part, because of the
promise of the Lakefront West project; and
Whereas, the largest project in
Detroit Shoreway, the nearly $100 million Battery Park project, is under
development at a 14-acre site former
brownfield site that was once home to
an Eveready Battery Company plant,
and its developer, Vintage Develop-

24
ment, is considering development for
an additional 8 acres near Battery
Park; the success of Battery Park –
currently approximately one-fourth
completed – and future development,
is dependent on completing the next
phase of the Lakefront West plan;
and
Whereas, another economic development project spurred by the Lakefront West project is the $30 million
Gordon Square Arts District (GSAD)
that has been a catalyst for attracting
60 new businesses and is projected to
create 950 permanent jobs when completed, according to an economic
impact study by Team NEO; and
Whereas, the State of Ohio has
invested $2 million to help launch
GSAD, and through the Ohio Department of Development and the Ohio
Housing Finance Agency has invested millions in developing affordable,
multi-family housing in the community, including fifteen apartment buildings with 280 apartment units that
have been redeveloped during the
past decade; and
Whereas, private sector housing
has been even more robust, with 375
housing units completed during the
past decade and another 400 units
under construction or planned in this
community; and
Whereas, just east of the DetroitShoreway/ Gordon Square District,
the Ohio City neighborhood has seen
nearly $50 million in private investment and $15 million in philanthropic
investment over the last two years
alone — much of this investment has
centered on the Ohio City Market District, the area surrounding the Historic West Side Market, which has
seen its commercial vacancy rate fall
from 19% to 5% over the past 14
months; and
Whereas, the momentum in this
part of the neighborhood is primed to
spread north on West 25th Street to
Detroit Avenue, an area that will be
directly and positively impacted by
the Lakefront West project that will
maximize the potential of a neighborhood that has over 3,000 jobs, making
it one of the largest employment centers within the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, the proposed West 25th
Street Lofts development, about one
block south of the Lakefront West
project, represents a nearly $20 million investment and stands to benefit
with direct access to future bicycle
and pedestrian connections to Edgewater Park; and
Whereas, not only does the Lakefront West project have the capability of spurring development along the
Detroit Avenue Corridor, it provides
improved connections for over 12,000
Ohio City residents to Lake Erie; and
Whereas, finally, the Lakefront
West project will improve truck flow
from industrial businesses in Cleveland’s Flats district through improvements planned along Main Avenue
and West 25th Street coming up from
the industrial valley; and
Whereas, the improved connection
to the Flats will also improve access
for residents visiting various entertainment and recreation venues in the
Flats, including soon-to-open aquarium, the recently opened rowing center on the Cuyahoga River and the
proposed regional skate park; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,

City of Cleveland:

Ord. No. 1517-11.
By Council Members Brancatelli
and
Sweeney
(by
departmental
request).
An emergency ordinance approving
the Tax Incentive Review Council’s
Year 2010 recommendations.
Whereas, under Section 5709.83 of
the Revised Code, if a municipal corporation grants an exemption from
taxation, they shall create a Tax
Incentive Review Council (“TIRC”);
and
Whereas, one of the functions of the
TIRC is to annually review all agreements granting exemptions from
property taxation and to make recommendations to either continue, modify, or cancel their agreements based
on various factors, including fluctuations in the business cycle unique to
the owner’s business; and
Whereas, in compliance with Section 5709.83 of the Revised Code, the
City of Cleveland has created a TIRC
and the TIRC has made written recommendations on exemptions to be
approved by the legislative authority;
and
Whereas, under division (D) of Section 5709.83 of the Revised Code, once
a legislative authority receives written recommendations from a tax
incentive review council, that legislative authority has sixty days after
receiving the recommendations, to
hold a meeting and vote to accept,
reject, or modify, all or any portion of
the recommendations; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

2010
recommendations
contained
File No. 1517-11-A are approved.

Ord. No. 1519-11.
By Mayor Jackson and Council
Members Westbrook and Brancatelli.
An emergency ordinance to amend
Section 3103.09 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as
amended by Ordinance No. 1112-A-07,
passed June 2, 2008 and Section 367.08,
as amended by Ordinance No. 54-94,
passed June 6, 1994, relating to cost
recovery from all owners jointly from
the time of notice of condemnation to
demolition for demolition costs.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
Building and Housing Department
has demolished 5,152 condemned
buildings between 2006 and 2010; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
Building and Housing Department
has only been able to recover a fraction of its demolition costs despite
efforts to collect from owners of such
buildings; and
Whereas, many condemned buildings are transferred between multiple
owners during the time from when
the City condemns the building to
when the building is demolished; and
Whereas, many property owners
transfer properties with condemned
structures in order to avoid liability
and without ensuring that the purchaser will abate the nuisance; and
Whereas, both state and local laws
require sellers or property to provide
written notice to purchasers of building and housing code violations and
require purchasers to obtain notice of
building and housing code violations;
and
Whereas, under Section 5301.253 of
the Revised Code, “The owner of any
property who has received written
notice that the property is in violation
of any building or housing code shall
give the purchaser or grantee of the
property written notice or the code
violations prior to entering into an
agreement for the transfer of title to
the property, or if the owner does not
enter into a written agreement for the
transfer, prior to filing for record of a
deed to the property.”; and
Whereas, under Section 5301.253 of
the Revised Code, “Any notice or
order of a court or of a housing or
building authority of the state or a
political subdivision that relates to a
violation of the building or housing
code of the state or any political subdivision and the appears on the public
records of the issuing authority is
notice to all subsequent purchasers,
transferees, or any other persons who
acquire any interest in the real property in which the violation exists and
may be enforced against their interest in the real property without further notice or order to them.”; and
Whereas, Section 367.12 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio,
1976, requires a seller of any structure
of five or more units to provide a purchaser and place in escrow prior to
sale a current Certificate of Occupancy or Statement of Authorized Use
from the Department of Building and
Housing along with any outstanding
notice of violation from the City or
outstanding notice of the City’s intention to demolish or effectively board;
and
Whereas, Section 367.12 requires a
seller of a one, two, three or four unit
structure to provide the purchaser
with a Certificate of Disclosure form
prescribed by the Director of Building
and Housing addressing the condition of the property, and if the purchaser does not receive the Certificate of Disclosure prior to sale, the

November 23, 2011
purchaser may rescind the purchase
contract prior to sale; and
Whereas, division (e)(4)A. of Section 3103.09 forbids any seller from
selling any interest in a structure
“without furnishing the buyer, prior
to sale a copy of any outstanding
notice or order from the City, including any notice of violation or any outstanding notice to make corrections
to the minimum standards of the Codified Ordinances…, applicable City
rules and regulations, the Revised
Code, including the Ohio Building
Code, or any outstanding notice to
demolish and remove.” It also forbids
any buyer or grantee from obtaining
any interest in a structure “without
obtaining from the seller, prior to
sale, the documents described above”;
and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 3103.09 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio 1976, as amended by Ordinance
No. 1112-A-07, passed June 2, 2008 and

are amended, respectively, as follows:
Section 3103.09 Unsafe Structures
and Exterior Property Nuisances; Violations and Remedial Notices; Cost
Recovery
(a) Legislative Findings.
Council of the City of Cleveland
finds that:
(1) Structures that are vacant and
open to entry at doors, windows or
other points accessible to the general
public:
A. Attract children to enter;
B. Become harborage for vermin;
C. Serve as temporary abode for
derelicts, vagrants and criminals; and
D. Are likely to be damaged by vandals or set ablaze by arsonists.
(2) Unkept grounds surrounding
vacant, open structures invite the
dumping of garbage and rubbish;
(3) Thousands of structures in this
City are made of wood-frame construction that is more combustible
than other building types;
(4) Thousands of structures in this
City are situated on narrow lots and
in close proximity to one another,
increasing the risk of conflagration
and spread of insect and rodent infestation;
(5) Population loss and economic
decline experienced by the City in
recent years has caused the incidence
of vacant, open structures, high
grass, weeds, junk, debris, and junk
motor vehicles to increase significantly;
(6) Vacant, open structures often
become dilapidated because they are
not repaired by the owners or persons
in control of the structures;
(7) Structures that are vacant and
open to entry, high grass, weeds,
junk, debris, and junk motor vehicles
depress the market value of surrounding properties;
(8) Vacant and unsafe structures in
which utility services have not been
shut-off create a serious risk of explosion, accidental fire and flood.
(9) The existence of certain hazardous conditions may require a
structure to be vacated; these conditions include but are not limited to:
A. Danger of structural collapse;
B. Inadequate heat or use of dangerous heating mechanism;

The City Record
C. Danger of fire; and
D. Lack of plumbing in safe working order.
(10) Structures that remain boarded for an extended period of time contribute to blight, cause a decrease in
neighboring property values, create
targets for arson, and lead to the cancellation of homeowners’ insurance
for neighboring property owners.
(11) The following conditions provide harborage and breeding grounds
for pests or otherwise create humanhealth problems:
A. Grass over 8 inches in height.
B. Noxious weeds including Russian, Canadian, or common thistle;
wild lettuce; wild mustard; wild parsley; ragweed; milk weed; iron weed;
wild plants that can cause skin reaction upon contact or produce or aggravate hay fever, asthma, allergic respiratory reaction, or similar conditions;
and all other noxious weeds.
C. Refuse, including but not limited
to, trash, junk, garbage and food
waste, offal, animal wastes, tires, and
all other waste materials.
D. Stagnant surface water.
(12) As used in this Chapter “junk”
motor vehicle means a motor vehicle
that meets all of the following criteria:
A. Three model years’ old or older;
B. Apparently inoperable; and
C. Extensively damaged, including,
but not limited to, any of the following: missing wheels, tires, engine,
motor,
or
transmission.
(R.C.
§505.173)
(b) Declaration of Nuisance.
(1) All buildings or structures that
are injurious to or a menace to the
public health, safety or welfare, or
are structurally unsafe, unsanitary or
not provided with adequate safe
egress, or constitute a fire hazard, or
are vacant and open to public entry,
or are otherwise dangerous to human
life or injurious to the public, or in
relation to existing use constitute a
hazard to the public health, safety or
welfare by reason of inadequate
maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence or abandonment, are, severally,
for the purposes of this Building
Code, declared to be “unsafe structures.” All unsafe structures or conditions are declared to be public nuisances. The public nuisance shall be
abated by correction of the violations
to the minimum standards of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio,
1976, applicable City rules and regulations, the Revised Code, and Ohio
Administrative Code, including the
Ohio Building Code, or by demolition.
(2) The condition described under
division (a) (8) of this section is
declared to be a nuisance because of
the risk of harm from explosion, accidental fire or flooding and shall be
abated by shut-off of the services.
(3) The conditions listed in division
(a) (11) of this section are declared to
be nuisances that shall be removed,
destroyed, or abated from any property on which they are found.
(4) Junk motor vehicles as defined
in division (a) (12) of this section are
declared to be nuisances that shall be
removed or abated from any property
on which they are found. Junk motor
vehicles are declared to be a nuisance
because:
A. They harbor rodents, vermin,
and other pests;
B. They contain toxic substances
and flammable liquids and fumes;
C. They attract children to enter;
D. They serve as temporary abode
for derelicts, vagrants and criminals;

1887

25
E. They diminish neighboring property values; and
F. They are likely to be damaged by
vandals or set ablaze by arsonists.
(c) Effective Boarding Pending
Rehabilitation.
(1) Permits. Pending the correction
of the violations to the minimum standards of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, applicable City
rules and regulations, the Revised
Code, and the Ohio Administrative
Code, including the Ohio Building
Code, the owner of a structure may
secure the structure through effective
boarding. In order to effectively
board the structure, the owner of the
structure shall apply, within 3 days of
receiving a notice of violation, to the
Department of Building and Housing
for a permit to board. The Department
of Building and Housing shall review
the condition of the structure, determine if it can be effectively boarded,
and grant or deny the owner’s permit
to board, setting forth special requirements, if any, necessary for compliance with minimum standards for
effective boarding. The owner shall
effectively board the structure within
3 days of the issuance of a boarding
permit, or within any other time limit
that the Director deems appropriate.
Structures that are boarded without
first obtaining a boarding permit or
structures that do not comply with the
boarding permit shall continue to be
considered public nuisances subject
to demolition. Within thirty (30) days
of the issuance of a permit to board,
the owner of the structure shall apply
for a rehabilitation permit under Section 3105.06 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976. The
Director may grant an extension of
time for acquiring a rehabilitation
permit on the owner’s written request
and for good cause shown. Failure of
the owner to obtain a rehabilitation
permit after effective boarding will
result in the structure being deemed a
public nuisance, and scheduled for
demolition.
(2) Materials. The effective boarding of a structure shall include, but
not be limited to, doors, windows, or
other areas of the structure open to
ingress and egress and to weather elements at any and all levels of the
structure. The openings shall be
secured by plywood, not less than
1/2" thick, or other material of equal
strength, cut and fit into the openings. Openings in excess of fortyeight inches wide shall be framed
with 2"
4" lumber and plywood, or
equivalent material fastened twentyfour inches on center onto frame. The
plywood or equivalent material shall
be fastened into the openings by
screw type nails or lag screws.
(3) Maintenance. Upon effectively
boarding the structure, the owner
shall monitor and maintain the structure and its surrounding premises in a
safe, sanitary and secured condition.
Any portion of the exterior structure
that is deemed to be potentially hazardous due to deteriorated conditions,
or to be structurally unsound, shall be
removed or treated in a manner so as
to eliminate the hazard. The exterior
premises shall be maintained free of
high weeds, debris, junk vehicles, and
conditions that may provide harborage for rodents. Failure of the owner
to properly maintain the building in
the above condition, will result in the
structure being deemed a public nuisance, and scheduled for demolition.

26
(4) Rehabilitation. Rehabilitation
of the structure shall begin within 30
days of receiving a rehabilitation permit under Section 3105.06 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio,
1976 unless the time period is extended with permission from the Director.
If rehabilitation of the effectively
boarded structure does not begin
within this time period, or if the rehabilitation permit is otherwise invalidated or revoked, then the Director
may declare that the nuisance has not
been abated and schedule the structure for demolition.
(d) Examination and Condemnation.
(1) The Director is authorized to
examine or cause to be examined
every building or other structure
reported to be unsafe or damaged or
injurious to or a menace to the public,
and shall make a written record of the
examination.
(2) The Director may designate as
a public nuisance those particular
structures or conditions found to be
unsafe under division (b) of this section.
(3) The Director may also declare
that a nuisance structure which, due
to its advanced state of dilapidation,
substantial fire damage or structural
infirmity, is an immediate hazard to
human life or health, may only be
abated by immediate repair and rehabilitation to the minimum standards
of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, applicable City rules
and regulations, the Revised Code,
and Ohio Administrative Code, including the Ohio Building Code, or by
demolition.
(4) Whenever the Director finds a
vacant structure open to entry at
doors, windows or other points accessible to the general public, he may
cause the structure to be secured at
those points of entry. The Director
shall be authorized at any time to
enter the premises to secure the structure in order to lessen the severity of
the public nuisance. In securing the
structure, the Director may call any
department, division or bureau of the
City for whatever assistance may be
necessary, or may, by private contract, secure such structure and may
notify Utilities to shut-off service to
the property under Section 3103.091.
This securing shall not be deemed to
constitute “effective boarding” under
division (b) of this section, and it
does not abate the nuisance condition
of an unsafe structure, as declared
under division (d) (2) of this section,
unless so declared in writing by the
Director. Later notice, issued under
division (e) (1) below, shall include
the fact that the Director has found it
necessary to take appropriate action
to secure the structure.
(e) Notice of Violation.
(1) Whenever the Director finds a
building, structure or a portion of
those to be unsafe and determines it
or the property on which it is located
to be a public nuisance as defined in
this Chapter, he shall forward by certified mail to the owner, agent or person in control of the building, structure or portion and to any mortgagee
of record a written notice of violation
stating the defects in the building or
structure. The notice of violation
shall require the owner within a stated time to abate the nuisance condition of the building or structure by
correction of the violations and
defects to the minimum standards of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, applicable City rules and

The City Record
regulations, the Revised Code, and
Ohio Administrative Code, including
the Ohio Building Code, or by demolition and removal of the building,
structure, or a portion of those. The
notice also shall state that if the nuisance is not abated within the
required time that the Director may
take appropriate action to repair,
remove, or otherwise abate the public
nuisance and that the owner, agent or
person in control shall be responsible
for the costs. The handing of the violation notice to the owner, agent or
person in control of the building,
structure or a portion of those shall be
deemed actual notice and is legal and
valid service and no other form of service is necessary.
(2) If the person to whom the notice
and order is addressed is not found
after a reasonable and diligent
search, then the notice and order shall
be sent by certified mail to his tax
mailing address, if available, as indicated on the County tax duplicate,
and a copy of the notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the
premises to which it relates. The mailing and posting shall be deemed legal
service of the notice.
(3) An owner, agent or person in
control of the structure or building, a
mortgagee of record, or a lien holder
of record who has received a notice of
violation or a notice to make corrections to the minimum standards of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, applicable City rules and
regulations, the Revised Code, and
Ohio Administrative Code, including
the Ohio Building Code, or to demolish and remove, as provided for in this
section, shall inform prospective purvendees,
grantees,
chasers,
assignees, lessees, or land contractees of the notice of violation or
the notice to make corrections, or to
demolish and remove. No person shall
transfer

a
vendee,
grantee,
assignee, lessee, land contractee or
any other transferee any Interest in a
building, structure or a portion of
those after receiving a notice of violation to make corrections, or to demolish and remove the same, without
first providing the transferee with a
copy of the notice.
(4) A. No person, agent, firm or corporation shall sell, by land contract or
otherwise, any interest in any structure or building without furnishing
the buyer, prior to the sale a copy of
any outstanding notice or order from
the City, including any notice of violation or any outstanding notice to
make corrections to the minimum
standards of the Codified Ordinances
of Cleveland, Ohio 1976, applicable
City rules and regulations, the
Revised Code, including the Ohio
Building Code, or any outstanding
notice to demolish and remove.
No buyer or grantee, by land contract or otherwise, shall obtain any
interest in any structure or building
without obtaining from the seller,
prior to sale, the documents described
above.
B. No person, agent, firm or corporation acting in the capacity of an
escrow agent in any real estate transaction involving the sale of a structure or building situated in the City,
shall disburse any funds unless the
provisions of this division have been
met.
C. Any buyer or grantee, by land
contract or otherwise, of a structure

November 23, 2011
order obtained or to be obtained under
this division and, within ten days of
the date of transfer, shall notify the
Director, in writing, of the actions
that will be taken to comply. The
Director may then establish a reasonable time to comply.
(f) Vacating Buildings and Prohibiting Use. The Director may also
require in the notice issued under
division (e) (1) of this section that
the building, structure or a portion of
those be vacated, not be reoccupied, or
used until the specified repairs and
improvements are completed, inspected, and approved by the Director. The
Director may cause to be posted at
each entrance to the building or structure a notice as follows: “THIS
STRUCTURE IS IN A DANGEROUS
CONDITION AND HAS BEEN CONDEMNED AND ITS USE HAS BEEN
PROHIBITED BY THE DIRECTOR
OF BUILDING AND HOUSING.” The
notice shall remain posted until the
required corrections are made or
demolition is completed. No person
shall remove the notice without written permission of the Director, nor
shall any person use or enter the
building or structure except for the
purpose of making the required corrections or demolishing or effectively
boarding the building or structure, or
securing the structure under division
(d) (4) of this section.
(g) Right to Appeal. The owner,
agent or person in control shall have
a right to appeal from the notice and
decision of the Director as provided in
this section and appear before the
Board of Building Standards and
Building Appeals at a specified time
and place to show cause why he
should not comply with the notice.
Any notice served by the Director
shall automatically become a final
order if a written notice of appeal
before the Board is not filed in the
office of the Board within the time set
forth in the notice from the Director.
In the absence of an appeal, all
actions taken shall constitute a valid
exercise of the police powers of the
City of Cleveland.
(h) Noncompliance with Notice.
(1) Director Authorized To Demolish, Remove, or Abate. In case the
owner, agent or person in control
fails, neglects or refuses to comply
with the notice to repair or rehabilitate, or to demolish and remove a public nuisance or unsafe building, structure or a portion of those, the Director

Law of the facts in the case, who may
institute appropriate action in the
court to cause correction of the violations and defects, or demolition and
removal, or effective boarding of the

(3) Rehabilitation Permits Not Bar
To Director’s Action To Abate. The
securing of rehabilitation permits for
the building or structure shall not in
and of itself bar the Director from
taking action to abate the nuisance.
(4) Effective Boarding by Director.
The Director may, with respect to any
condemned structure, also take appropriate action to effectively board the
structure, or to secure it under division (d) (4) of this section. The Director shall specifically state in writing

November 23, 2011
his findings with respect to the structure, and shall determine whether to
secure or to effectively board, based
on factors which may include the following: the distance of the structure
from neighboring structures, the type
of structure, the extent to which the
structure is secured, the likelihood of
vandalism or arson, the extent of the
deterioration, the economic likelihood
of eventual rehabilitation of the
structure, or cost of securing or effectively boarding the structure.
(5) Failure To Comply with Notice.

cause Utility services to be shut-off
under Section 3103.091 or to otherwise

the findings with respect to the structure, and shall determine whether to
perform repair or maintenance based
on factors which may include the following: the distance of the structure
from neighboring structures, the type
of structure, the extent of deterioration, the likelihood of vandalism or

of record and lien holders of record of
the City’s intention to demolish and
remove the unsafe building or structure at least 30 days before the intended action by the City. The notice may
be effective concurrently with the violation notice. A condemned structure,
once effectively boarded by the owner
pending rehabilitation that later
becomes open to entry, may then be
demolished and removed, subject to

this section, upon a finding by the
Director that the structure can no
longer be effectively boarded.
(i) Junk Motor Vehicle Removal.

emergency that, in the opinion of the

The City Record
Director, involve immediate danger to
human life or health, the Director
shall promptly cause the building,
structure or a portion of those to be
made safe or removed. For this purpose he may at once enter the structure or land on which it stands, or any
abutting land or structure, with assistance and at the cost as he deems necessary. He may request the Director
of Public Safety to enforce the orders
he gives that are necessary to cause
the building, structure or a portion of
those to be made safe or removed. The
Director of Public Safety has the
authority to enforce the orders. He
may order adjacent structures and

(3) Whenever an inspection is
made after the compliance date stated
on a Notice of Violation of the Building Code, the Housing Code, or the
Zoning Code or after a compliance
date determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether the violation has been remedied and the violation has not been
remedied, or an additional permit is
obtained for work previously permitted and the original permit has
expired or was appropriately voided,
a fee of $100.00 shall be charged for
each inspection, except that this fee
shall not apply to one-family and twofamily
owner-occupied
dwelling
