Res. No. 29-11.
By Council Members Brancatelli,
Zone, Brady, Cummins, Cimperman,
Sweeney, Cleveland, Dow, J. Johnson,
K. Johnson, Keane, Kelley, Miller,
Mitchell, Polensek, Pruitt, Reed and
Westbrook.
An emergency resolution opposing
any possible cuts in the FY 2012 federal
budget
to
Community
Development Block Grant funding
and strongly urging the Obama
Administration in the FY2012 budget
to freeze CDBG formula funding at
the FY 2010 level of $3.9 billion.
Whereas, in recent discussions
about the federal budget for 2012, it
has been stated by the Obama administration that all federal programs
are on the table for possible cuts; and
Whereas, Community Development
Block Grant (CDBG) funding could
be facing a funding reduction of up to
25 % or $1 billion dollars in the
President’s Budget; and
Whereas, this, or any reduction, in
CDBG funding would severely slow
down or eliminate thousands of local
and state projects and programs that
are directly contributing to local and
regional recovery; and

12
Whereas, without CDBG funds, the
City would not be able to assist
Cleveland’s community development
corporations and similar organizations to encourage economic development, business creation and expansion, housing projects, community
and neighborhood revitalization and
community services programs; and
Whereas, CDBG funds enable the
City of Cleveland to deliver essential
services including:
Community
Housing Solutions (the furnace
repair program, the home repair loan
program, tool loan program, credit
counseling and foreclosure prevention counseling); and
Whereas, CDBG funds enable the
City to assist non-profit organizations
providing social service programs
including AIDS prevention services,
at-risk youth services, elderly services, family services and local homeless shelter and homeless prevention
services; and
Whereas, CDBG funds provide community development corporations in
Cleveland with funding for new market-rate and affordable housing construction and acquisition for redevelopment of single family vacant substandard housing; and
Whereas, CDBG funds are critical
in helping deal with the foreclosure
crisis impacting our community, from
blight elimination to foreclosure
counseling, and in helping manage
the negative impact this crisis has on
our neighborhoods; and
Whereas, in the City, CDBG funds
were essential in these development
Cogswell Hall (a 41-unit
projects:
rehab for low income adults completed to green building standards);
Detroit Avenue Streetscape in the
Gordon Square District; Morgana
East Infrastructure (site improvements and project support for 90 units
of new construction market-rate housing); and the Flats East Bank project
(a large scale mixed-use project of
hotel, office and retail commercial
space, housing and public use and
green space); and
Whereas, in the City of Cleveland,
CDBG funds have been instrumental
in helping the Ohio City area open
over a dozen new businesses in the
last two years – with more than $40
million dollars in new investment and
hundreds of new jobs created in the
neighborhood; and
Whereas, CDBG funds were essential in creating Ohio City Farm, a sixacre farm developed through a partnership between the local development corporation, the local housing
authority, the Great Lakes Brewing
Company
and
local
nonprofits
focused on workforce development
for resettled refugees - this farm has
garnered
national
attention
on
thoughtful development and sustainability; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby
opposes any possible cuts in the FY
2012 federal budget to Community
Development Block Grant funding
and strongly urges the Obama
Administration in the FY2012 budget
to freeze CDBG formula funding at
the FY 2010 level of $3.9 billion.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit copies
of this resolution to President Barak
Obama, Jack Lew, the Director of the
Office of Management and Budget,
