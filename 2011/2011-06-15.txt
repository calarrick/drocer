ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 837-11.
By Council Member Sweeney (by
departmental request).
An emergency resolution to adopt
and declare a Tax Budget for the City
of Cleveland for the year 2012 and
submit it to the County Budget Commission as required by State Law,
Chapter 5705 of the Revised Code.
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,

14
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council, under
the provisions of Chapter 5705 of the
Revised Code, after public hearings
as required by law, does adopt the
statements of the year 2012 requirements for the several funds of the
City of Cleveland as being the budget required by state law to be submitted to the County Budget Commission, which requirements are
contained in File No. 837-11-A.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to certify a copy of the resolution to the County Auditor of Cuyahoga County.
Section 3. That this resolution is
declared to be an emergency measure
and, provided it receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take
effect and be in force immediately
upon its adoption and approval by the
Mayor; otherwise it shall take effect
and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.
Adopted June 6, 2011.
Effective June 13, 2011.

Res. No. 841-11.
By Mayor Jackson and Council
Members Reed, J. Johnson, Cimperman, Westbrook, Polensek, Brancatelli, Mitchell, Zone, Cleveland, Kelley, Keane and Brady.
An emergency resolution endorsing
a Healthy Cleveland through violence
prevention strategies to improve the
public health of Cleveland and individual Clevelanders.
Whereas, in Resolution No. 257–11,
adopted on March 28, 2011, this Council and Mayor Jackson endorsed a
partnership with the four hospital
systems in Cleveland to create a
Healthy Cleveland with healthy
neighborhoods and residents who
enjoy longer and healthier lives by
combating chronic health conditions
like chronic pulmonary disease, heart
disease, diabetes, obesity and behavioral health; and
Whereas, this Healthy Cleveland
initiative addresses smoking cessation, diet and nutrition, exercise and
mobility issues, and behavioral and
mood disorders; and
Whereas, in addition to these
important health issues, violence is a
real and present threat to the health
and lives of many Cleveland residents, especially disproportionately
people of color;
Whereas, in the City of Cleveland
alone, there were 6,451 violent crimes
committed in 2009; and
Whereas, violence is among the
leading causes of death for people
aged 15 to 44 years worldwide, and
violence also contributes significantly to post-traumatic stress, permanent
injury, and morbidity; and
Whereas, in 1998 approximately 2.3
million people died worldwide as a
result of violence; and
Whereas, many more people die
from homicide than from attack in a
war, and even more die from suicide;
worldwide for every death due to war,
there are three deaths due to homicide
and five deaths due to suicide; and
Whereas, we must address behavioral and mood disorders of perpetrators in order to prevent violence, as
well as the psychological and physical impact on victims and their families of violence and resulting mental
health issues; and
Whereas, while African Americans
comprise 14% of the United States
population, 43% of all murder victims

The City Record
in 2007 were African American, 93.1%
of whom were killed by African Americans; and
Whereas, African American males
between the ages of 18 and 35 have a
40 to 50% chance they will either die
or be incarcerated by their 36th birthday as a result of a shooting, violent
crime or murder; and
Whereas, the effects of violence
extend far beyond the impact on individuals’ health and livelihoods – they
shape the well-being and social fabric
of families and communities, and can
have a negative impact on a city’s economic prospects; and
Whereas, each year, nearly $4.5 billion is spent nationally on healthcare
related to violence, including burial
costs, counseling services, healthcare
costs, property damage, lost jobs and
lost industry; and
Whereas, alcohol and drug addictions significantly contribute to the
commission of violent crime; and
Whereas, though violence is pervasive, evidence suggests that the factors
that
contribute
to
violent
responses – whether they are factors
of attitude and behavior or related to
larger social, economic, political and
cultural conditions – can be changed,
and that violence can be prevented;
and
Whereas, the World Health Organization has documented scientific evidence that the following interventions effectively prevent violence: 1)
developing safe, stable, and nurturing relationships between children
and their parents and caregivers
through home visiting programs and
child-rearing education; 2) developing life skills in children and adolescents; 3) reducing the availability
and harmful use of alcohol by reducing the number of alcohol retail outlets and offering interventions and
treatment for problem drinkers; 4)
reducing access to guns and knives
through enforced bans on carrying
firearms in public; and 5) promoting
gender equality to prevent violence
against women through school and
community interventions and education; and
Whereas, the City will collaborate
with local health institutions, agencies and advocates to study the cost of
healthcare related to violence in
Cleveland; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
encourages public-private partnerships, including local health care
institutions, social service agencies,
and local schools, to create solutions
responding to the causes and impacts
of violence; and
Whereas, the City will collaborate
with local health institutions and
public safety groups to identify and
secure funding for proven anti-violence programs and activities, including sports, recreation centers, arts
and music, and mentoring programs;
and
Whereas, in collaboration with the
City’s Departments of Public Safety
and Public Health, Cleveland City
Council’s Public Safety and Health
committees will ensure the existence
of neighborhood-based anti-violence
projects, such as surveillance cameras, street club development, and
mentoring programs including the
Police Athletic League; and
Whereas, in collaboration with
Mayor Jackson, local health institutions, the City’s Community Relations
Department, and Boys and Girls Club
of Cleveland, Cleveland City Council’s Health and Human Services committee will hold the Second Healthy

1034

June 15, 2011
Cleveland Summit in September to
address violence prevention strategies to improve the public health of
Clevelanders; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council endorses a Healthy Cleveland through violence
prevention
strategies
to
improve the public health of Cleveland and individual Clevelanders.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted June 6, 2011.
Effective June 13, 2011.

Res. No. 844-11.
By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency resolution withdrawing objection to the renewal of a
D2, D2X, D3, D3A and D6 Liquor Permit at 1701 East 12th Street, Suite
R135 and 1st floor and repealing Resolution No. 1109-10, objecting to said
renewal.
Whereas, this Council objected to a
D2, D2X, D3, D3A and D6 Liquor Permit to 1701 East 12th Street, Suite
R135 and 1st floor by Resolution No.
1109-10 adopted by the Council on
August 18, 2010; and
Whereas, this Council wishes to
withdraw its objection to the above
renewal and consents to said renewal;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That objection to a D2,
D2X, D3, D3A and D6 Liquor Permit to
1701 East 12th LLC, DBA Scorchers,
1701 East 12th Street, Suite R135, 1st
floor, Cleveland, Ohio 44114, Permanent Number 6549231 be and the same
is hereby withdrawn and Resolution
No. 1109-10, containing such objection,
be and the same is hereby repealed
and that this Council consents to the
immediate renewal thereof.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted June 6, 2011.
Effective June 13, 2011.

Res. No. 845-11.
By Council Members Polensek, J.
Johnson and Westbrook.
An emergency resolution disagreeing with the Cleveland Clinic in its
announcement that it intends to close
Huron Hospital in the next 90 days.
Whereas, the Cleveland Clinic
announced today that it would be
closing Huron Hospital in East Cleveland in 90 days; and

June 15, 2011
Whereas,
when
the
Clinic
announced the closing of the level 2
trauma center at Huron Hospital last
October, it stated that it had no intention to close the entire hospital facility; and
Whereas, the closing of Huron Hospital will negatively impact the
entire east side of the City of Cleveland, both medically and economically, placing a tremendous burden on
Cleveland’s critical care protocols for
Fire and EMS; and
Whereas, in 2010 Cleveland EMS
transported 3,000 patients to Huron
Road Hospital, with 800 of these
patients being transported for emergency trauma care; and,
Whereas, that the Clinic chose to
close Huron Hospital with little
advance notice shows the disingenuousness of its previous negotiations
with the City regarding the closing of
the level 2 trauma center there and its
blatant disregard of the ramifications
of the closing of the entire hospital on
the citizens living in the Glenville
and Collinwood communities on the
east side of the City of Cleveland, as
well as on the people of the entire City
of Cleveland and of East Cleveland;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council overwhelmingly disagrees with Cleveland
Clinic in its announcement that it
intends to close the vital Huron Road
Hospital in 90 days.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
resolution to Dr. Toby Cosgrove of the
Cleveland Clinic, their Board of
Trustees and those members of the
State of Ohio’s General Assembly, and
U.S. Congressional Representatives,
the Honorable Marcia Fudge, the
Honorable Dennis Kucinich and the
Honorable Steve LaTourette of Cuyahoga County, as well as the Honorable Ron Portman and the Honorable
Sherrod Brown.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted June 6, 2011.
Effective June 13, 2011, without
the signature of the Mayor.

various divisions of the Department
of Port Control. Bids shall be taken
in a manner that permits an award

contract, or by separate contract for
each or any combination of the
items as the Board of Control determines. Alternate bids for a period
less than the specified term may be
taken if desired by the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies
until provision is made for the
requirements for the entire term.
The first of the one-year options to
renew shall not be exercised without additional legislative authority.
If such additional legislation authority is granted and the first of the

appellant to pay the costs identified

costs identified in the ticket, but may
in the interest of equity reduce the
costs assessed.
If the Director finds by a preponderance of evidence that the appellant is not liable under this section for
the costs assessed, then the Director

approve, modify or annul the finding
