By Council Members Cimperman,
Kelley, J. Johnson, Pruitt, Sweeney,
Cleveland, Polensek, Brady, Keane,
Brancatelli, Zone, Cummins, Reed,
Mitchell and Westbrook.
An emergency resolution declaring
opposition to Issue Three.
Whereas, in the General Election of
November 8, 2011 voters will be asked
to vote ‘yes’ or ‘no’ on the so-called
Health Care Freedom Amendment on
the ballot as Issue Three; and
Whereas, the Amendment to the
Ohio Constitution says, “ No federal,
state, or local law or rule shall compel, directly or indirectly, any person,
employer, or health care provider to
participate in a health care system”;
and
Whereas, the Amendment defines a
‘health care system’ as “. . . any public
or private entity or program whose
function or purpose includes the management of, processing of, enrollment
of individuals for, or payment for, in
full or in part, health care services,
health care data, or health care information for its participants; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland has
responsibility for the public health;
and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland’s
population includes thousands of
uninsured people and underinsured
people; and
Whereas, the Health Care Freedom
Amendment is worded so that it could
make it more difficult for the City to
carry out its duty to its residents in
providing needed vaccines during
potential epidemics or sharing data
on health issues with government
entities; and
Whereas, the Amendment was originally designed to undermine the
national health reform act known as
the Affordable Care Act which is
already providing benefits to the people of Cleveland; and
Whereas, benefits already being
provided by the Affordable Care Act
include the following: young adults

1769

can gain coverage through their parent’s group policies; preventive and
primary care procedures must now be
given without co-pays or deductibles;
the doughnut hole is being closed for
our senior citizens; small businesses
that provide coverage are receiving
tax breaks; and the pre-existing condition insurance plan is covering
some Clevelanders; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
calls upon the voters of Cleveland to
“Vote No” on Issue Three in order to
protect the gains we have already
won and those yet to be under the
Affordable Care Act and to protect the
City’s ability to protect the public
health; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
1.
That
this
Council
Section
declares its opposition to Issue Three.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit copies

Res. No. 1535-11.
By
Council
Members
Keane,
Sweeney, Kelley, Zone, Brady, Brancatelli, Miller, Pruitt and Cummins.
An emergency resolution urging
the City Planning Commission, the
Group Plan Commission, NOACA’s
Northeast Ohio Sustainable Communities Regional Planning, and other
planning efforts to incorporate Chicago-East Coast passenger rail services,
rights of way and facilities in their
efforts to support Amtrak’s ridership
growth and future expansion plans;
and further urging the Ohio Congressional Delegation to support the President’s funding recommendations for
Amtrak and high-speed rail in order
to support the development of
Amtrak’s rapidly growing ChicagoEast Coast services and future highspeed rail planning through Cleveland and Northeast Ohio.
Whereas, Greater Cleveland has
long been one of the nation’s largest
and most dynamic economies; and
Whereas, Northeast Ohio offers a
diverse base of manufacturing, agriculture, academic and government
research, and business services that
are often too distant from our cities
and from one another for effective
business development and sharing of
intellectual capital; and
Whereas, Greater Cleveland’s economic recovery is ahead of the
nation’s as measured in unemployment rates, but is still below rates
experienced during more prosperous
times; and
Whereas, fast, convenient and
affordable travel is needed to facilitate a stronger and more vibrant economy; and
Whereas, existing Amtrak services
through Ohio, linking Chicago to the
East Coast, have seen significant ridership increases in recent years, with
Amtrak forecasting it to grow from
500,000 riders per year in 2010 to more
than 900,000 riders by 2013; and
Whereas, a trunk line of improved
Amtrak service between Chicago and
the East Coast via Cleveland, operating at 90-110 mph with affordable
fares would provide a strong foundation for future high-speed trains of up
to 220 mph in the region; and
Whereas, high-speed trains would
transform the way we travel and do
business by making travel more
affordable and better connecting our
business, manufacturing, agricultural, and research and development centers; and
Whereas, high-speed trains would
strengthen our economy, drive productivity in the Region’s existing
commercial arenas, encourage job
growth, and help foster potential for
business investment, entrepreneurship, technology development and
advanced manufacturing; and
Whereas, the investment in a highspeed train network would lower our
consumption of foreign oil, saving
nearly 130 million gallons of gasoline
a year; and
Whereas, the construction of a
high-speed network would create
nearly 300,000 high quality construction, engineering and manufacturing
jobs; and
Whereas, The President has proposed an authorization of $53 billion
over the next 6 years for high-speed
and inter-city passenger rail development as part of the Administration’s
surface transportation reauthorization proposal outline in its February
budget; and

The City Record
Whereas, The President has proposed $8 billion be appropriated in the
2012 budget in order to accelerate the
development of a high-speed rail network and its subsequent benefits; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the City Planning Commission, the
Group Plan Commission, NOACA’s
Northeast Ohio Sustainable Communities Regional Planning, and other
planning efforts to incorporate Chicago-East Coast passenger rail services,
rights of way and facilities in their
efforts to support Amtrak’s ridership
growth and future expansion plans.
Section 2. That this Council further
urges the Ohio Congressional Delegation to support the President’s funding recommendations for Amtrak and
high-speed rail in order to support the
development of Amtrak’s rapidly
growing Chicago-East Coast services
and future high-speed rail planning
through Cleveland and Northeast
Ohio
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
resolution
to
President
Barack
Obama, all members of the Ohio congressional delegation, the members
of the Group Plan Commission, and
the members of NOACA’s Northeast
Sustainable Communities Regional
Planning.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immeupon
its
adoption
and

shall take effect and be in force from

less than half the total price, nor in
any case less than the land cost apportioned to the lot. Payment of the
remainder of the price shall be

prescribed and approved by the Director of Law, and shall require the payment to the City for the benefit of the

at the rate of six percent per annum
on the deferred portion of the price,
and for the reduction from time to

times keep in his office as a public
record a plan of every City mausoleum, which plan shall show and

state the plan or particular items of
the plan intended to be altered,
amended, supplemented or superseded.

land cost or the land and capital cost
in proportion as may be required. No
