RESOLUTION REFERRED

By Council Member Miller.
An emergency resolution supporting House Bill No. 4 of the 129th Ohio
General Assembly that would amend
the Ohio Revised Code to eliminate
the financial responsibility random
verification program of the Bureau of
Motor Vehicles.
Whereas, House Bill No. 4 introduced on January 11, 2011 by
Representative Matt Huffman (R)
would amend the Ohio Revised Code
to eliminate the financial responsibility random verification program of
the Bureau of Motor Vehicles; and
Whereas, current law requires that
a person be able to verify the person’s
ability to pay for damages for liability that come from the ownership,
maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle; and
Whereas, the ability to provide this
verification is called proof of financial responsibility and is usually
accomplished
through
providing
proof of motor vehicle liability insurance coverage; and
Whereas, under current law, any
person operating a motor vehicle in
Ohio or permitting another to operate
the person’s motor vehicle in Ohio
may be required to provide that proof
of financial responsibility under the
following circumstances:
• Involvement in a traffic accident
requiring the filing of an accident
report;
• Receipt of a traffic ticket indication that proof of financial responsibility was not produced upon the
request of a peace officer or State
Highway Patrol trooper; and
• Whenever the person is randomly selected by the Registrar and
requested to provide verification
under the random verification program; and
Whereas, failure to maintain proof
of financial responsibility results in
two civil penalties:
• suspension of operating privileges and impoundment of driver’s
license, and
• suspension of vehicle registration and impoundment of certificate
of registration; and
Whereas, current law requires the
Registrar to establish the random verification program by rule, but House
Bill No. 4 would repeal this program;
and
Whereas, with the looming state
budget hole, eliminating the random
verification program would save the
State of Ohio $800,000; and
Whereas, all other requirements of
proof of financial responsibility
remain unchanged; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,

The City Record
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports House Bill No. 4 of the 129th

An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio General Assembly to adequately fund behavioral health services in Ohio and further urging the
Ohio Department of Mental Health to
avoid reducing funding to the
Alcohol, Drug Addiction & Mental
Health Services Board of Cuyahoga
County in the 408 Funding Formula
for FY 2012.
Whereas,
the
residents
of
Cuyahoga County can live healthier
lives with access to quality mental
health, alcohol, drug and other prevention, treatment and support services; and
Whereas, 2 out of 3 Ohioans are
impacted by a friend or family member with a mental illness or substance
abuse problem; and
Whereas, behavioral health care, as
treatment of mental illness and addiction goes hand in hand with traditional health care, which is the treatment
of the body; thus behavioral health
care is health care; and
Whereas, State general revenue
funds for community-based mental
health and substance abuse services
in Ohio were cut disproportionately in
the last biennial budget; and
Whereas, an increasing number of
County Boards, like the Alcohol, Drug
Addiction & Mental Health Services
Board
of
Cuyahoga
County
(ADAMHS) are unable to meet the
Medicaid match for behavioral health
services within the existing Medicaid
population; and
Whereas, ADAMHS is able to provide service to fewer and fewer
severely mentally ill and addicted
non-Medicaid eligible clients due to
the continued erosion of the behavioral health safety net; and
Whereas, in reviewing the 408 allocation formula, the Ohio Department
of Mental Health (ODMH) is looking
to reallocate distribution of state
funds in a way that would drastically
reduce funding to community boards
such as ADAMHS; and
Whereas, full implementation of
the proposed reallocation would mean
that funding to ADAMHS for community mental health services would be
reduced by 50%, leaving thousands of
people without mental health services, causing 240 consumers to lose
supported housing, reducing availability of suicide prevention and
other mental health crisis services,
and losing more than 450 jobs in the
behavioral health field; and
Whereas, this Council agrees with
the ADAMHS, the Ohio Association of
County
Behavioral
Health
Authorities and the Ohio Council of
Behavioral Health & Family Services
Providers that budget line items 408,
505 and 401 remain fully funded with
dollars being allocated to these
Boards for services in the community;
and agrees with the recommendation
that the Community Behavioral
Health Medicaid match be funded
from the Ohio Department of Jobs and
Family Services 525 line; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby
urges the Ohio General Assembly to

adequately fund behavioral health
services in Ohio and further urges the
Ohio Department of Mental Health to
avoid reducing funding to the
Alcohol, Drug Addiction & Mental
Health Services Board of Cuyahoga

An emergency resolution opposing
House Bill No. 3 of the 129th Ohio
General Assembly that would amend
the Ohio Revised Code to repeal the
estate tax for the estates of individuals dying on or after January 1, 2011.
Whereas, House Bill No. 3 introduced on January 11, 2011 by
Representatives Cheryl L. Grossman
(R) and Jay Hottinger (R) would
amend the Ohio Revised Code to
repeal the estate tax for the estates of
individuals dying on or after January
1, 2011; and
Whereas, the estate tax helps
address the imbalance of wealth by
taxing the wealthy; and
Whereas, currently Ohio levies an
estate tax of up to 7 percent on the net
value of an estate before its assets are
transferred to anyone else, but Ohio
doesn’t collect tax on an estate unless
its net taxable value is greater than
$338,333, according to the Taxation
Department; and
Whereas,
the
Census
Bureau
reports that Ohio’s 2009 median family income was about $57,000 – and the
median value of an Ohio owner-occupied housing unit about $135,000; and
Whereas, Ohio taxed only about
8,000 estates in the 12 months that
ended in June 2009, though about
110,000 Ohioans – albeit of all ages
and financial circumstances – died in
calendar 2008; and
Whereas, abolishing the estate tax
would hurt local municipalities that
receive about 80 percent of estate tax
revenue – about $270 million in fiscal
year 2009; and
Whereas, with 80 cents of every $1
Ohio collects in estate tax being
returned to the city, village or township where the dead person lived, in
2008, for example $5.4 million went to
Cleveland, $2.3 million to Cleveland
Heights, $9.2 million to Columbus, $2
million to Upper Arlington, $785,000 to
Dayton, $3.6 million to Kettering, $1.5
million each to Springfield and
Hamilton, and $911,000 to Mason; and

12
Whereas,
Representative
Mike
Foley, a Democrat from Cleveland, is
concerned that without the estate tax,
local governments will be forced to
cut services and raise taxes on their
own citizens to make up for the shortfall; and
Whereas, Ohio Municipal League
Deputy Director John Mahoney said
that municipalities would like to see
some source of revenue that would
make up for that money if the state
chooses to repeal the estate tax; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes
House Bill No. 3 of the 129th Ohio
General Assembly that would amend
the Ohio Revised Code to repeal the
estate tax for the estates of individuals dying on or after January 1, 2011.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit certified copies of this resolution to
Grossman
and
Representatives
Hottinger, the 129th Ohio General
Assembly and Mayor Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Motion to suspend rules, Charter,

Res. No. 104-11.
By Council Members Reed, J.
Johnson,
Brady,
Cleveland
and
Cummins.
An emergency resolution urging
Governor Kasich to reconsider his
stance on diversity and seek qualified
minorities to fill open state government positions.
Whereas, Governor Kasich has
assembled a cabinet devoid of racial
and ethnic diversity; and
Whereas, the last time an Ohio governor’s cabinet had no people of color
was 1962; and
Whereas, today Ohio’s population is
15% minority; and
Whereas, Ohio’s Latino community
is at 320,000; Ohio’s African-American
population is 1.4 million; 60% of Asian
Americans in Ohio hold college
degrees; and
Whereas, this Council believes that
the governor’s hires should reflect the
diversity of the state’s population;
and
Whereas, if the Governor’s cabinet
is not diverse, at the very least the
Governor should look to minorities
when appointing positions to commissions, directorships and other state
government jobs; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby
urges Governor Kasich to reconsider
his stance on diversity and seek qualified minorities to fill open state government positions.

Section 2. That the Clerk of Council

Ohio Senate, the Ohio Legislative

Cleveland, the Greater Cleveland
