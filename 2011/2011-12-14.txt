Effective December 9, 2011.

December 14, 2011
Res. No. 1720-11.
By Council Members Cummins,
Westbrook, Zone, Cimperman, Cleveland, Mitchell, J. Johnson, Brancatelli, Brady, Polensek, Pruitt, Conwell,
K. Johnson and Dow.
An emergency resolution recognizing and supporting the principles of
the Occupy Movement and the peaceful and lawful exercise of the First
Amendment as a cherished and fundamental right in the effort to seek
solutions for economically distressed
Americans at the federal, state and
local levels; committing to work with
the Jackson administration to take
steps to minimize economic insecurity and destructive disparities in the
City of Cleveland; and requesting our
County, State and U.S. elected leaders
generate solutions for economically
distressed Americans.
Whereas, Cleveland community
members, like others across the United States, are frustrated by the continuing economic crisis that threatens individual, family, small local
business and City finances, and our
community’s quality of life, and are
participating in Occupy protests to
make their voices heard; and
Whereas, the economic roots of
these protests are varied, including
sustained unemployment, growing
income disparity, banking system
failures, stalled earning power, and
unjust tax systems, that all contribute to ongoing wealth disparities;
and
Whereas, the political roots of these
protests are also varied, including the
growing political power of corporations, influence of money on elections
and public policy and inability of
average citizens to have their voices
heard and needs met through formal
political forums, thus contributing to
citizens pursuing alternative political arenas; and
Whereas, this prolonged economic
downturn has hurt nearly all Americans, in the areas of wealth loss,
unemployment, and housing access, it
has taken an even greater toll on people of color and women. Women are
29% more likely to be poor than men.
The poverty rate for single mother
families has increased to 40.7%. Economic gains made by people of color
since the Civil Rights Movement have
been substantially reduced by the
Great Recession; and Caucasian
Americans experienced a net wealth
loss of 16 percent from 2005 to 2009.
African Americans lost about half of
their wealth and Latinos lost twothirds of their wealth in this same
period [Ref: Census Bureau, Income,
Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2010]; and
Whereas, more than 25 million
Americans are unemployed and seeking work; more than 50 million Americans are living without health insurance; and, more than one in five American children are growing up in
households living in poverty without
sufficient resources to meet basic survival needs, such as food, clothing,
and shelter [Ref: unemployed defined
as unemployed, marginally attached
to the labor force, or working only
part-time for economic reasons, U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics, Table A15. Alternative measures of labor
underutilization]; and
Whereas, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), in its report, a

The City Record
“CDC Health Disparities & Inequalities Report - United States, 2011” documents that income inequality in the
United States is the highest among
advanced industrialized nations, with
wide-spread inequities in U.S. health
outcomes by income, race, and gender; and
Whereas, over the past 30 years,
gains in our economy have accrued
largely to the top 1% of Americans,
who now control 43% of the total net
wealth, and to the next 19% on the top
that control 50% of the wealth in the
United States (top 20% controls 93%
of wealth with the bottom 80% controlling only 7%) due in part to public
policies that can be changed [Ref:
Wealth Income and Power, by G.
William Domhoff, UC Santa Cruz,
2011]; and
Whereas, one of the largest problems distressing our economy is the
prolonged foreclosure crisis, with
many owners struggling to obtain
loan adjustments and too many banks
continuing the use of flawed review
procedures which end up flooding the
housing market with foreclosures
and result in blighted and de-valued
housing stock due to the high number
of properties being left vacant and
abandoned and poorly maintained;
and
Whereas, the Cleveland-LorainElyria metropolitan area has been
particularly hard-hit by the foreclosure crisis, ranking 27th of 366 metropolitan statistical areas in the rate of
foreclosures (8.2%) according to a
March, 2011 ranking compiled by an
analysis of LPS Applied Analytics
Data by Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC); and
Whereas, the Cleveland-LorainElyria metropolitan areas ranked
eighth amongst the nation’s 25
largest metro areas in its percentage
of underwater mortgages (41.5%)
according to third quarter 2011 data
provided by Zillow Real Estate Market reports; and
Whereas, local governments are
straining
under
the
increasing
weight of responsibility to provide for
basic support services at a time of
declining tax revenues and as a result
of budget reductions by the state and
federal government; and
Whereas, the structural causes of
the economic crisis facing our society
require decisive and sustained action
at the national and state levels. Cities
are harmed by the crisis and must
play an important role in the development of public policy to address it;
and
Whereas, this Council commits to
working with the Jackson administration to continue taking steps to
minimize economic insecurity and
destructive disparities in the City by:
1. following the City’s Community
Reinvestment Act practices to ensure
that public funds are invested in
responsible financial institutions that
demonstrate strong support for our
community. The Council may also
consider future legislation to promote
responsible banking and provide an
incentive for banking institutions to
invest more in our City, particularly
with regard to stabilizing the housing
market and supporting the creation of
new businesses. This review should
include evaluating City policies on
responsible depositing and management of City funds;
2. examining the number of home
foreclosures in Cleveland, the geographic neighborhoods in which the

2043

11
foreclosures are occurring, and lender
information on homes involved in the
foreclosure process, including real
estate owned homes; working with
the Cuyahoga County Land Bank, the
City of Cleveland Housing Court, and
Case Western Reserve University’s
NEOCanDo to gather qualitative data
on the circumstances and causes of
foreclosures and the foreclosure
methods and practices of lenders,
including
reviewing
apparent
inequities many people in Cleveland
face when lender foreclosure proceedings occur;
3. consulting with advocates of tax
reform and experts on equitable taxation and review past tax reform
efforts in order to work effectively
with the County and State Legislature toward a more equitable tax
structure;
4. as federal and state assistance
dwindles, continuing to use available
resources to provide assistance for
the most vulnerable people in Cleveland; and
5. because reforms in education and
career preparation are essential for
building a viable future and disparities in these areas begin very early in
life and often continue through adulthood, seeking maximum possible
funding for Early Learning and Basic
Education in the State Legislative
Agenda; and recognizing the critical
importance of supporting community
colleges, technical colleges, and state
universities as they provide access to
retraining and workforce development opportunities; and.
Whereas, Congress must generate
solutions for economically distressed
Americans by:
1. Supporting job creation, making
investments
in
the
substantial
nation’s critical physical and technological infrastructure, and reducing
the deficit by adopting fiscal policies
with equitable corporate and individual taxation and by allowing the 2010
extension of President Bush’s tax
cuts to expire in 2012 as the law currently requires;
2. Tightening regulation of the
banking and financial sector, including adoption of new rules and vigorous investigation and prosecution of
individuals and corporations that violate the fraud, theft, and securities
laws; and
3. Retaining or increasing community-building block grants for local
schools and social services and protect public education from devastating cuts and prevent tuition levels
that block fair access to higher education; and
Whereas, this Council does not condone actions that infringe upon the
lawful rights of others, obstruct or
interfere with the efforts of law
enforcement officers to protect such
rights, or cause personal injury or
property destruction; and
Whereas, Americans can and must
resolve the divisive economic and
social realities facing our nation in a
peaceful way that honors our commitment to democracy, equality and justice; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council recognizes and supports the principles of

12
the Occupy Movement and the peaceful and lawful exercise of the First
Amendment as a cherished and fundamental right in the effort to seek
solutions for economically distressed
Americans at the federal, state and
local levels.
Section 2. That this Council commits to working with the Jackson
administration to continue taking
steps to minimize economic insecurity and destructive disparities in the
City of Cleveland.
Section
3.
That
this
Council
requests our Congressional leaders
generate solutions for economically
distressed Americans.
Section 4. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit copies of this
to
President
Barack
resolution
Obama and all members of the U.S.
Congress.
Section 5. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immeupon
its
adoption
and
diately
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted December 5, 2011.
Effective December 9, 2011, without the signature of the Mayor.

Res. No. 1721-11.
By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency resolution withdrawing objection to the transfer of
ownership of a D2, D2X, D3, D3A and
D6 Liquor Permit at 850 Euclid
Avenue, Suite 120 and repealing Resolution No. 1494-11, objecting to said

Whereas, this Council objected to a

divisions (f) and (g).

this section are noncriminal. The
imposition of liability upon the
responsible parties under this section

any purpose.
(d) Other costs and penalties not
abrogated. Nothing in this section

The ticket shall inform the respondents of the procedure to file an
appeal and the time frame for filing
it. The ticket shall state that failure
to appeal the ticket or pay the costs
imposed not later than 20 days from
the date of issuance of the ticket shall
constitute a waiver of the right to contest the ticket and shall be considered
an admission. The ticket shall further
state that if the ticket is not appealed
or paid in that time frame, then a
default finding of civil liability shall
be imposed upon respondents for the
costs established in divisions (f) and
(g).
The ticket may be in any format

required by this section.

ment of infractions, and for some
infractions, the increased costs of
solid waste disposal.
(g) Late penalties. Late penalties

for a total additional penalty of $60.00
in such a case.
(h) Appeals - timing. Any respondent or other person who is potentially liable for the costs imposed by this
section may appeal the imposition of
liability to the Director of Public
Works or his or her designee, which

as Parking Violations Bureau Administrator or otherwise, in the manner
described in the ticket. As used in
divisions (h), (i) and (j), of this section, “Director” means the Director of
Public Works or his or her designee.
The appeal shall be taken not later
than 20 days from the date of issuance
of the ticket. Failure to appeal the
ticket or pay the costs imposed within
this time period shall constitute a
waiver of the right to contest the ticket and shall be considered an admission.
(i) Appeal - process. The Director
shall establish an administrative
appeal process for persons to appeal
tickets issued under this section. The
administrative appeal process shall
allow the appellant the right to present appellant’s case in person and
may allow for evidence to be presented ex-parte. The strict rules of evidence applicable to courts of law
shall not apply in any administrative
hearing or ex-parte review. The ticket
charging the offense shall constitute
prima facia evidence that the offense
identified in the ticket occurred and
that the parcel owner(s) to whom the
ticket was mailed are the responsible
parties as defined in division (m) and
are liable to the City of Cleveland for
the costs imposed by this section.
If the Director finds by a preponderance of evidence that an appellant
is liable under this section for the

The City Record
costs assessed, then the Director shall
dismiss the appeal and order the
appellant to pay the costs identified
in the ticket.
If the Director finds by a preponderance of evidence that an appellant
is liable under this section for the
costs assessed but that there are reasons for the commission of the infraction that mitigate the offense, then
the Director shall dismiss the appeal
and order the appellant to pay the
costs identified in the ticket, but may
in the interest of equity reduce the
costs assessed.
If the Director finds by a preponderance of evidence that the appellant is not liable under this section for
the costs assessed, then the Director
shall dismiss the ticket and grant the
appeal.
(j) Appeal of the Director’s decision. Any person subject to an
adverse decision of the Director may
appeal that decision to the Board of
