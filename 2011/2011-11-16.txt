An emergency resolution urging
the United States Congress to preserve, protect and provide adequate
funding for Federal Student Aid.
Whereas, Federal Student Aid programs offer students an opportunity
to acquire the knowledge and skills
our nation demands for a strong
recovery; and
Whereas, work force projections
show that by 2018, there will be jobs
for as many as 22 million new workers with college degrees, but on our
current trajectory, our nation won’t
make that goal – in fact we’ll miss it
by three million workers; and
Whereas, recent budget deals have
already cut $30 billion from the student aid programs, sacrificing some

1838

November 16, 2011
students’ benefits to pay for others,
while states across the country are
cutting higher education from their
own budgets; and
Whereas, the Joint Committee on
Deficit Reduction or “Super Committee” is mandated to reach an agreement by November 23, 2011 on cutting
the deficit by $1.2 trillion, and federal
student aid programs could face further funding cuts; and
Whereas, it’s more important than
ever to preserve, protect and provide
adequate funding for the core federal
student aid programs – such as Pell
Grants and student loan benefits; and
Whereas, this Council joins the Student Aid Alliance, the higher education coalition of AJCU and 61 other
higher education associations, including John Carroll University, in urging
the United States Congress to preserve Federal Student Aid; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the United States Congress to preserve, protect and provide adequate
funding for Federal Student Aid.

An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio General Assembly to renew
and fully fund the Job Ready Sites
program that, along with the Clean
Ohio Fund, enables distressed property cleanup for urban redevelopment.
Whereas, the Job Ready Sites program, along with the Clean Ohio
Fund, have strong support statewide,
particularly in urban areas that have
little or no undeveloped land; and
Whereas, both programs provide
outright grants to help cover part of
the cost of cleaning up chemically
contaminated
land
or
vacant,
asbestos filled buildings; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
passed Resolution No. 1226-11 on September 12, 2011 in support of renewing
the Clean Ohio Fund;
Whereas, authorization for the Job
Ready Sites program is set to expire
December 31st, while the deadline for
the final round of grants was November 1st of this year; and
Whereas, Job Ready Sites, authorized by Ohio voters in 2005, was
designed to build a portfolio of commercial and industrial properties that

November 16, 2011
would be attractive to growing businesses because they were in near
move-in condition; and
Whereas, a Job Ready Sites grant
might cover the cost of ridding a property of its asbestos contamination or
of replacing old windows with new,
energy-efficient ones; and
Whereas, the possible demise of the
Job Ready Sites program, along with
the Clean Ohio Fund, is related to
Governor Kasich’s reorganization of
the Department of Development and
the creation of JobsOhio, a private,
nonprofit body that will run many of
the state’s business attraction and
retention programs; and
Whereas, both programs have
received their money from bonds
issued against the profit stream from
Ohio’s state run liquor business; however, Governor Kasich intends to sell
the liquor revenue stream to fund JobsOhio, wiping out the programs’
source of money; and
Whereas, unless the Job Ready
Sites program and the Clean Ohio
Fund are renewed, Cleveland will
lose valuable economic development
projects; and
Whereas, for an example, Silverlode Consulting Corporation in Cleveland won’t be able to go forward with
business expansion projects if it can’t
get state grants for brownfield
cleanup assistance; and
Whereas, the Job Ready Sites program, along with the Clean Ohio
Fund, are integral to saving agricultural land and redeveloping alreadydesignated portions of urban areas;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby
urges the Ohio General Assembly to
renew and fully fund the Job Ready
Sites program that, along with the
Clean Ohio Fund, enables distressed
property cleanup for urban redevelopment.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit copies
of this resolution to Governor John
Kasich, Senator Thomas Niehaus,
President of the Senate, Representative William Batchelder, Speaker of
the Ohio House of Representatives,

An emergency resolution urging
the United States Postmaster General
to keep open the post office located at
14039 Puritas Avenue in Cleveland.
Whereas, the U.S. Postal Service
has recently announced they plan to
possibly close the post office located
at 14039 Puritas Avenue in Cleveland;
and
Whereas, Puritas Avenue in the
city of Cleveland is a community-oriented neighborhood of family-owned
businesses; and
Whereas, closing the post office
located on Puritas Avenue would
destroy this commercial corridor and
cause hardship to the families living
in the adjacent residential communities in Cleveland’s Ward 18; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the United States Postmaster General
to keep open the post office located at
14039 Puritas Avenue in Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council

resolution to the Postmaster General
of the United States.

Res. No. 1617-11.
By Mayor Jackson and Council
Members Zone, Westbrook and Cimperman.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) to reconsider its draft
scores and fund Phase II of the Lakefront West project.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland has
provided ODOT with a revised scoring proposal in response to its draft
scores for Phase II of the Lakefront
West project, to account for corrected
data and particular project benefits
not accounted for in the draft scores;
and

24
Whereas, the Lakefront West project is transformative for Cleveland
and its region, with long-term benefits in economic development, community development, motorist and pedestrian safety, recreation access, and
improved quality of life for local residents, to Northeast Ohio and to the
entire State of Ohio; and
Whereas, the economic health of
Ohio is dependent on the economic
health of its metropolitan areas, as
evidenced by the fact that the Cleveland-Akron metropolitan area alone
accounted for $133 billion or 28% of
the State’s $478 billion annual gross
domestic product in 2010; and
Whereas, the long-term loss of population and jobs in the City of Cleveland has weakened the economy of
the Cleveland region and Northeast
Ohio and has, thereby, deprived Ohio
of the full economic benefits that the
State’s largest region has the potential to provide; and
Whereas, Cleveland is currently
pursuing a multi-faceted strategy to
stabilize its population and grow its
economy, and a key element of that
strategy is reconnecting Cleveland to
its greatest asset – Lake Erie; and
Whereas, the Lakefront West project will transform a 2 1/2 mile freeway-style road along Cleveland’s
lakefront into a tree-lined lakefront
boulevard, with easy connections to
the waterfront and to Edgewater
Lakefront State Park; and
Whereas, not only will the project
dramatically increase the desirability
of nearby urban districts, but it will
contribute to changing Cleveland’s
old “rustbelt” image to one of a
vibrant waterfront community – stimulating development and revitalization with associated increases in
property values, incomes, employment and tax revenues; and
Whereas, this change is important
not only for attracting new investment but also for retaining existing
businesses, including over 2,500 manufacturing jobs in companies adjacent to the West Shoreway in the
Detroit Shoreway, Ohio City, and
Flats West Bank districts; and
Whereas, the Lakefront West project will help retain existing manufacturing by improving traffic flow
and safety for trucks serving industries in the Flats district, including
the salt mines that provide road salt
for much of the Midwest; and
Whereas, one of the most significant benefits of the Lakefront West
project is elimination of critical safety hazards for pedestrians and
motorists, particularly where the
West Shoreway meets West 28th
Street, adjacent to the historic Lakeview Terrace public housing development; failure to correct these lifethreatening hazards to pedestrians
and motorists would be nothing less
than unconscionable; and
Whereas, eight years of community
meetings have built broad-based public support for the Lakefront West
project among the thousands of Clevelanders who participated and has
stimulated millions of dollars of
investment in anticipation of the
improvements; and
Whereas, construction of the first
phase project elements is underway,
and failure to fund the next phase of
work would leave the project half-finished and would be seen by many
local residents and businesses as an

The City Record
example of a promise made and then
broken; and
Whereas, the Greater Cleveland
Partnership (Cleveland’s chamber of
commerce) and the region’s 5-county
metropolitan planning organization,
Northeast Ohio Area Wide Coordinating
Agency
(NOACA)
recently
responded to ODOT’s request to prioritize regional transportation projects
and placed the Lakefront West project near the top of the list; and
Whereas, after decades of decline,
the neighborhoods and districts adjacent to the Cleveland’s West Shoreway have begun to turn around; Ohio
City, Detroit Shoreway and the Cudell/Edgewater district are now experiencing community and economic
development activity that is based, in
part, on proximity to Lake Erie and
its recreational and scenic amenities
and the anticipation of implementation of the Lakefront West transportation project; and
Whereas, in the Detroit Shoreway
neighborhood, over $400 million in
development has been completed, is
under construction, or is being
planned, in part, because of the
promise of the Lakefront West project; and
Whereas, the largest project in
Detroit Shoreway, the nearly $100 million Battery Park project, is under
development at a 14-acre site former
brownfield site that was once home to
an Eveready Battery Company plant,
and its developer, Vintage Development, is considering development for
an additional 8 acres near Battery
Park; the success of Battery Park –
currently approximately one-fourth
completed – and future development,
is dependent on completing the next
phase of the Lakefront West plan;
and
Whereas, another economic development project spurred by the Lakefront West project is the $30 million
Gordon Square Arts District (GSAD)
that has been a catalyst for attracting
60 new businesses and is projected to
create 950 permanent jobs when completed, according to an economic
impact study by Team NEO; and
Whereas, the State of Ohio has
invested $2 million to help launch
GSAD, and through the Ohio Department of Development and the Ohio
Housing Finance Agency has invested millions in developing affordable,
multi-family housing in the community, including fifteen apartment buildings with 280 apartment units that
have been redeveloped during the
past decade; and
Whereas, private sector housing
has been even more robust, with 375
housing units completed during the
past decade and another 400 units
under construction or planned in this
community; and
Whereas, just east of the DetroitShoreway/ Gordon Square District,
the Ohio City neighborhood has seen
nearly $50 million in private investment and $15 million in philanthropic
investment over the last two years
alone — much of this investment has
centered on the Ohio City Market District, the area surrounding the Historic West Side Market, which has
seen its commercial vacancy rate fall
from 19% to 5% over the past 14
months; and
Whereas, the momentum in this
part of the neighborhood is primed to
spread north on West 25th Street to
Detroit Avenue, an area that will be

1840

November 16, 2011
directly and positively impacted by
the Lakefront West project that will
maximize the potential of a neighborhood that has over 3,000 jobs, making
it one of the largest employment centers within the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, the proposed West 25th
Street Lofts development, about one
block south of the Lakefront West
project, represents a nearly $20 million investment and stands to benefit
with direct access to future bicycle
and pedestrian connections to Edgewater Park; and
Whereas, not only does the Lakefront West project have the capability of spurring development along the
Detroit Avenue Corridor, it provides
improved connections for over 12,000
Ohio City residents to Lake Erie; and
Whereas, finally, the Lakefront
West project will improve truck flow
from industrial businesses in Cleveland’s Flats district through improvements planned along Main Avenue
and West 25th Street coming up from
the industrial valley; and
Whereas, the improved connection
to the Flats will also improve access
for residents visiting various entertainment and recreation venues in the
Flats, including soon-to-open aquarium, the recently opened rowing center on the Cuyahoga River and the
proposed regional skate park; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) to reconsider its draft
scores and fund Phase II of the Lakefront West project.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit copies
of this resolution to Jerry Wray,
Director, ODOT, NOACA, and Greater
Cleveland Partnership.
Section 3. That this resolution is
