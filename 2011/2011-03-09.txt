ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 258-11.
By Council Members Cimperman,
Cummins, J. Johnson and Mitchell.
An emergency resolution urging
the United States Congress to amend
the Continuing Resolution for FY
2011 to restore funding for public
broadcasting.
Whereas, the U.S. House has voted
in favor of a Continuing Resolution to
fund government for the remainder of
FY 2011; and
Whereas, the Continuing Resolution for FY 2011 eliminates all federal
funding for public broadcasting; and
Whereas, federal funding for public
broadcasting provides an important
share of funding for WVIZ/PBS and
90.3 WCPN ideastream, here in northeast Ohio; and
Whereas, these public broadcasting
stations deliver educational and commercial-free
programming
that
expands children’s minds, documentaries that open up new worlds to all
of us, trusted news and information,
and programs that expose us to
worlds of music, theater, dance and
art; and
Whereas, an amendment to restore
federal funding for public broadcasting has been introduced and congress
will vote on this matter in the next
several days; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:

314

March 9, 2011
Section 1. That this Council hereby
urges the United States Congress to
amend the Continuing Resolution for
FY 2011 to restore funding for public
broadcasting.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to forward copies
of this resolution to all members of
the United States Congress.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted February 28, 2011.
Effective March 1, 2011.

Res. No. 259-11.
By Council Members Conwell, Westbrook, Dow, Mitchell, Zone, Pruitt,
Cleveland, Brady, Cummins, J. Johnson, Brancatelli and Kelley.
An emergency resolution objecting
to Senate Bill 5 which would eliminate collective bargaining for state
employees and reform collective bargaining rules for local government
employees.
Whereas, Senate Bill 5 (S.B. 5)
recently introduced in the Ohio Senate, seeks to rewrite Ohio’s collective
bargaining law; and
Whereas, as originally introduced,
S.B. 5 would ban collective bargaining for all state employees and
sharply curtail binding arbitration
rules for local governments; and
Whereas, this Council agrees that
S.B. 5 is a direct attack on public-sector workers and will lead to lower
wages and benefits that will hurt
Ohio families; and
Whereas, this Council understands
that 61% of Americans oppose measures such as S.B. 5; and
Whereas, this Council believes that
the serious budget crisis facing the
state should not be used as an excuse
to eliminate the long established collective bargaining rights of hard
working public servants; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland has
shown that a more effective way of
addressing economic crisis is to openly engage workers, clearly explain
the crisis, while honoring union
rights and respecting public servants;
and
Whereas, state government should
look to Cleveland as an example of a
city that has been able to successfully
balance its budget while maintaining
respect for workers and manage
through the current economic crisis;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby
objects to Senate Bill 5 which would
eliminate collective bargaining for
state employees and reform collective
bargaining rules for local government employees.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to forward a copy
of this resolution to Governor John
Kasich and all members of the Ohio
Senate and House of Representatives.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all

March 9, 2011
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted February 28, 2011.
Effective March 1, 2011.

Res. No. 260-11.
By Council Members Dow, Conwell,
Mitchell,
Zone,
Reed,
Polensek,
Sweeney, Pruitt, Westbrook, Keane,
Cummins, J. Johnson, Brady and Kelley.
An emergency resolution objecting
to the state’s decision to close the
Northcoast Behavioral Healthcare
facility in Cleveland.
Whereas, the Ohio Department of
Mental Health has announced it will
close its Cleveland campus of Northcoast Behavioral Healthcare; and
Whereas, the state has now determined that the $8 million in capital
funds originally for the development
of a new hospital on Euclid Avenue
will be allocated to other facilities;
and
Whereas, the City has already
spent considerable time and money
working with the state to prepare a
site for a new behavioral healthcare
facility on Euclid Avenue; and
Whereas, closing the current facility and the decision to not open a new
facility will create a hardship to
Cleveland-area residents in need of
behavioral health care treatment and
will eliminate nearly 200 jobs; and
Whereas, the state’s decision to
close Cleveland’s facility and not
fund a new facility will leave the citizens of northeast Ohio, especially
inner-city residents in need of treatment, with little or no means to access
help; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby
objects to the state’s decision to close
the Northcoast Behavioral Healthcare
facility in Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to forward a copy
of this resolution to Governor John
Kasich and the members of the Ohio
General
Assembly
representing
northeast Ohio.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted February 28, 2011.
Effective March 1, 2011.

Res. No. 262-11.
By Council Member Cummins.
