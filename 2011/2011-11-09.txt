Res. No. 1556-11.
By Council Member Dow
An emergency resolution objecting
to the transfer of liquor license of D2,

6735 St. Clair Avenue.
Whereas, Council has been notified
by the Department of Liquor Control

Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44103, Permanent Number 90530790001; and
Whereas, the granting of this application for a liquor permit to this high

and
Whereas, the place for which the

the building, safety or health requirements of the governing body of this
County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or constructed that law enforcement officers or agents of the Department of
Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based on
other legal grounds as set forth in
Revised Code Section 4303.292; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of
the public peace, prosperity, safety
and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of notification; now, therefore,

1806

November 9, 2011
