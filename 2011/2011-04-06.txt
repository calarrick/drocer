to

rights-of-way of the City, for a term of
two years with two one-year options
to renew, the first of which is exercisable through additional legislative
authority.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
one or more contracts by way of concession with Global Tel Link, on the
basis of its proposal dated July 6,
2010, for the provision of pay telephones at various City facilities, but

April 6, 2011
excluding any of the rights-of-way of
the City. The facilities may include
Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, the Convention Center, City
Hall, City jails, and other City facilities, or any combination of these facilities, as deemed most advantageous
in the opinion of the Director of
Finance. The contract or contracts
authorized by this ordinance shall be
for a term of not to exceed two years,
with two one-year options to renew.
The first of the one-year options to
renew may not be exercised without
additional legislative authority. If
such additional legislative authority
is granted and the first of the oneyear options to renew is exercised,
then the second of the one-year
options to renew may be exercisable
at the option of the Director of
Finance, without the necessity of
obtaining additional authority of this
Council. The contract or contracts
shall be prepared by the Director of
Law, and approved and certified by
the Director of Finance.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure
and, provided it receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take
effect and be in force immediately
upon its passage and approval by the

Ord. No. 449-11.
By Council Member Sweeney (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Finance, on behalf
of the Cleveland Municipal Court, to
enter into contract with the Cuyahoga
County Public Defender Commission
for legal services necessary to defend
indigents charged with violation of
ordinances of the City of Cleveland
provided such violation may result in
incarceration, for the Cleveland
Municipal Court for a period of one
year, with one option to renew for an
additional one-year period.
Whereas, in Argersinger v. Hamlin
and Scott v. Illinois, the United States
Supreme Court held that no indigent
criminal defendant may be sentenced
to a term of imprisonment unless he
has been afforded the right to assistance of appointed counsel in his
defense; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
through the Cleveland Municipal
Court, is obligated to provide an indigent defendant appointed counsel in
order to permit the imposition of a
sentence including a term of imprisonment; and
Whereas, under Section 120.14 of
the Revised Code, a county commission that has organized a county public defender commission may contract
with any municipal corporation within the County served by the county
public defender to provide legal representation on behalf of the municipal corporation; and
Whereas, the Cleveland Municipal
Court, the district of which encompasses Bratenahl and the City of
Cleveland, recommends that the
Cuyahoga County Public Defender

An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting
new Section 241.42, relating to foods
containing
artificial
trans
fat
restricted.
Whereas, dietary trans fat increases the risk of heart disease by elevating LDL “bad” cholesterol, and lowering HDL “good” cholesterol; and
Whereas, because a significant portion of dietary trans fat comes from
food purchased at food shops, the
presence of artificial trans fat purchased at such establishments contributes to cardiovascular risk in
Cleveland; and

April 6, 2011
Whereas, this Council finds that the
presence of artificial trans fat in
foods prepared in food shops poses a
threat to the public health; and
Whereas, this Council adopted Resolution No 12-07 on January 8, 2007
that encouraged the City of Cleveland’s Department of Health and the
Cuyahoga County Board of Health to
study ways to reduce artificial trans
fats in citizens’ diets and work
towards banning them from restaurants, and further encouraged the
Cleveland Municipal School District
to ban artificial trans fats from being
served in public schools; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1.
That the Codified
Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
are supplemented by enacting new
Section 241.42 to read as follows:
Section 241.42 Foods Containing
Artificial Trans Fat Restricted
(a) No foods containing artificial
trans fat, as defined in this section,
shall be stored, distributed, held for
service, used in preparation of any
menu item or served in any food shop,
as defined in Section 241.03(b) of this
code or successor provision, except
food that is being served directly to
patrons in a manufacturer’s original
sealed package.
(b) For purposes of this section, a
food shall be deemed to contain artificial trans fat if the food is labeled as,
lists as an ingredient, or has vegetable shortening, margarine or any
kind of partially hydrogenated vegetable oil. However, a food whose
nutrition facts label or other documentation from the manufacturer
lists the trans fat content of the food
as less than 0.5 grams per serving
shall not be deemed to contain artificial trans fat.
(c) Food shops shall maintain on
site the original labels identifying
the trans fat content or approved
alternative documentation for all
food products:
(1) that are, or that contain, fats,
oils or shortenings;
(2) that are, when purchased by
such food shops, required by applicable federal and state law to have
labels; and
(3) that are currently being stored,
distributed, held for service, used in
preparation of any menu items, or
served by the food service establishment.
Documentation acceptable to the
Director, from the manufacturers of
such
food
products,
indicating
whether the food products contain
vegetable shortening, margarine or
any kind of partially hydrogenated
vegetable oil, or indicating trans fat
content, may be maintained instead of
original labels.
Documentation is required when
food products are not labeled. If
baked goods, or other food products
restricted pursuant to subdivision (a)
of this section, that are or that contain fats, oils or shortenings, are not
required to be labeled when purchased, food shops shall obtain and
maintain documentation acceptable
to the Director, from the manufacturers of the food products, indicating
whether the food products contain
vegetable shortening, margarine or
any kind of partially hydrogenated
vegetable oil, or indicating trans fat
content.
(d) The Director of Public Health
may make rules and regulations to

The City Record
secure proper enforcement of this section.
(e) This section shall take effect on
January 1, 2013 with respect to oils,
shortenings and margarines containing artificial trans fat that are used
for frying or in spreads; except that
the effective date of this section with
regard to oils or shortenings used for
deep frying of yeast dough or cake
batter, and all other foods containing
artificial trans fat, shall be July 1,
2013.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure
and, provided it receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take
effect and be in force immediately
upon its passage and approval by the
Mayor; otherwise it shall take effect
and be in force from and after the earliest period allowed by law.

Res. No. 446-11.
By Council Member Kelley.
An emergency resolution urging
the Governor, the Ohio Senate and the
Ohio House to support and maintain
the current process of funding the
Ohio Consumers’ Council.
Whereas, Governor John Kasich
desires to reduce the budget of the
Ohio Consumers’ Counsel from $8.5
million to $4.1 million in the next
Biennial Budget; and
Whereas, Governor Kasich believes
that the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel provides services duplicative to those
provided by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (the “PUCO”); and
Whereas, the Ohio Consumers’

491

19
Counsel’s operating budget is funded
independently by mandatory assessments filed against revenue of the
state’s utilities and not from tax revenues; and
Whereas, the Ohio Consumers’
Counsel is charged under state law
with the responsibility to represent
consumers’ interests regarding activities of both regulated utilities and
the PUCO; and
Whereas, the PUCO is not legally
charged with advocating on behalf of
consumers and consumers’ interests;
and
Whereas, a reduction in funding to
the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel will significantly reduce resources for consumer protection and representation;
and
Whereas, significant budget reductions will shrink the Ohio Consumers’
Counsel’s consumers’ education programs; and
Whereas, reducing the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel budget will not contribute any reduction to Ohio’s Biennial Budget; and
Whereas, this Council strongly supports representation of consumers by
the oversight and regulation of Ohio
utilities; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Urging the Governor, the
Ohio Senate and the Ohio House to

and community gardening is a great
way to achieve health and nutrition
goals, and exercise mobility goals as
well; and

to creating a Healthy Cleveland with
healthy neighborhoods and residents
who enjoy longer and healthier lives

and behavioral health; and

four best health care systems in the
United States; Cleveland Clinic,
MetroHealth, Sisters of Charity
Health System, and University Hospitals, and all four institutions support
the mission of creating a Healthy
Cleveland; and

Administration, Cleveland City Council and the four health care institutions will collaborate to address
smoking cessation, diet and nutrition,

and in all City Properties, including
parks,
playgrounds,
cemeteries,
garages, and areas within 150 feet of
any entrance to any City building or

Whereas, we will work to create a
voluntarily-adopted smoke free zone
within 150 feet of any entrance to any

this voluntary designation; and

can provide and increase the accessibility of city-wide smoking cessation
programs to help people quit smoking; and

will collaborate with the health care
institutions and community partners
to improve physical activity throughout Cleveland by creating joint-use
agreements
between
community
organizations, schools and city recreational facilities; and
Whereas, the City will work to
develop a Complete Streets Policy to
improve bike and pedestrian access
and improve mobility on street,

health centers, providing proactive,
preventative health information and
creating an ethic of health education
and health awareness at the grass
roots level in the City; and
Whereas, by working with community organizers, the City of Cleveland

An emergency resolution supporting passage of Senate Bill 125 by the
Ohio General Assembly to enable
cities to share services more efficiently and less costly.
Whereas, currently cities in Ohio
cannot exercise municipal powers
outside their borders without express
statutory authority; and

Whereas, there is currently no Ohio
statutory authority to provide other
municipal services such as waste collection and snow removal to a neighboring community; and
Whereas, cities in Ohio are struggling to find ways to cut costs; and

reduce their costs is to band together
with their neighboring communities
in the provision of governments services to their residents; and

Turner and Bill Seitz are co-sponsoring Senate Bill 125 which, if passed by
the Ohio General Assembly, would

and, provided it receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take
