Res. No. 209-11.
By Council Members J. Johnson,
Dow and Cimperman.
An emergency resolution urging
Governor John Kasich and the Ohio
General Assembly to amend Section
2743.60 of the Revised Code (Ohio Victims Compensation Fund) to allow a
claimant to receive an award of reparations regardless of whether the

February 23, 2011
innocent victim or the innocent
claimant was convicted of a felony
offense within 10 years before the
crime.
Whereas, the Ohio Revised Code
allows for a victim of “criminally
injurious conduct” or the victim’s family to receive reparations, or compensatory payments for certain expenses
that are resultant of the crime; and
Whereas, the Revised Code further
allows for denial of a compensation
claim if the innocent victim of the
criminal misconduct, or the innocent
member of the victim’s family making the claim, has been convicted of a
felony offense within the 10 years previous to the crime for which compensation is sought; and
Whereas, this Council believes that
this discriminates against ex-offenders who have turned, or are attempting to turn, their lives around; and
Whereas, the Governor and the
Ohio General Assembly are asked to
amend this law so that compensation
is distributed fairly to all victims,
regardless of whether they have committed past crimes; and
Whereas, the recent denial by the
Ohio Victims Compensation Fund of
compensation to families representing victims who were ex-offenders
and who were killed on Imperial
Avenue (aka Imperial Avenue murders) was especially unfair and insensitive; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
Governor John Kasich and the Ohio
General Assembly to amend Section
2743.60 of the Revised Code (Ohio Victims Compensation Fund) to allow a
claimant to receive an award of reparations regardless of whether the
innocent victim or the innocent
claimant was convicted of a felony
offense within 10 years before the
crime.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit copies
of this resolution to Governor John
Kasich and all members of the Ohio
General Assembly.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted February 14, 2011.
Effective February 14, 2011.

Res. No. 211-11.
By Council Members Cimperman
and Westbrook.
An emergency resolution urging
Governor Kasich and the Ohio General Assembly to pass a budget that protects funding health, education,
human services and other critical
needs in the Ohio State 2012-2013 biennium budget through a balanced
approach of long term funding and
revenue increases.
Whereas, as a result of the tax cuts
begun in 2005 and a weak Ohio economy, Ohio is currently facing at least
an eight billion dollar deficit as the
Governor and General Assembly

The City Record
begin to consider and approve a biennium budget for fiscal years 20122013; and
Whereas, without revenue increases, this means that one out of every
six dollars that has previously been
appropriated for Ohio’s needs will
have to be cut; and
Whereas, such cuts will detrimentally affect Cleveland and Clevelanders, including anticipated cuts to
public education, higher education,
the local government fund, child care,
elderly services, health care, mental
health services, public transportation, library services, public safety,
and other critical needs; and
Whereas, in this economic climate
with Ohio having a 9.6% unemployment rate, and millions of others
struggling to make it day to day, we
cannot afford to decrease and eliminate services that will reduce and
diminish the opportunities for Ohio
citizens to move forward productively
with their lives; and
Whereas, to protect critical services, potential areas to be examined
for revenue enhancements include
closing the billions of dollars in tax
loopholes, reinstatement of a 7.5%
income-tax rate for those making
over $201,800, and the strengthening
of corporate taxes; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
Governor Kasich and the Ohio General Assembly to pass a budget that protects funding health, education,
human services and other critical
needs in the Ohio State 2012-2013 biennium budget through a balanced
approach of long term funding and
revenue increases.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit copies
of this resolution to the Ohio General
Assembly, the Speaker of the Ohio
House of Representatives, the Ohio
Senate President, all Cleveland-area
General Assembly members, and Governor Kasich.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.

Ord. No. 128-11.
By Council Member Sweeney (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the issuance and sale of bonds in
the maximum principal amount of
$750,000 for the purpose of providing
funds to improve municipal cemetery
facilities, buildings, structures and
grounds and authorizing related matters.
Whereas, this Council desires to
issue bonds in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed Seven Hundred
Fifty Thousand Dollars ($750,000)
(the “Bonds”) to finance the costs of
certain permanent improvements
described in Section  1 of this ordinance (this “Ordinance”); and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of this City, has previously certified to this Council that
the estimated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be financed with the
proceeds of the Bonds is at least five
years and that the maximum maturity of the Bonds is 20  years, as evidenced by the Certificate contained in
File No. 128-11-A; and
Whereas, this Council passed Ordinance No. 1749-80 on October 8, 1980,
and thereafter amended that ordinance by Ordinance No. 1112-83,
passed May 6, 1983, and Ordinance No.
944-96, passed June 10, 1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so amended and
as the same may further be amended
from time to time in accordance with
its provisions, is referred to as the
“General Bond Ordinance”), providing the general terms and provisions
for the issuance of unvoted general
obligations of the City, with the specific terms of each series of Bonds to
be contained in ordinances authorizing the issuance of Bonds in accordance with the provisions thereof
(the “Series Bond Ordinances”); and
Whereas, the authorization for
issuance of the Bonds is necessary to
provide funds to pay the costs of certain
permanent
improvements
described in Section 1 hereof that are
urgently needed for the benefit of the
City, and as a result, this Ordinance
constitutes an emergency measure
providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health and safety, and for the usual
daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,

10
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose.
It is deemed necessary to issue the
Bonds in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed Seven Hundred
Fifty Thousand Dollars ($750,000) for
the purpose of providing funds to
improve municipal cemetery facilities,
buildings,
structures
and
grounds by constructing, reconstructing, installing, enlarging, renovating,
and rehabilitating buildings, structures and grounds, including clearing, grading and excavating land,
reconstructing, installing, renovating, and rehabilitating septic system,
drainage
and
sewer
facilities,
installing access roadways including
any necessary bridges and culverts,
installing utility lines, laying out and
numbering burial plots, constructing
and reconstructing retaining walls,
gates and fences, acquiring and
installing fences, gates, signage,
waste receptacles and other fixtures,
and planting and landscaping, together with all necessary and incidental
appurtenances and the acquisition of
any required real estate and interests
in real estate, and to pay any capitalized interest and all expenses
incurred in connection with the
issuance of the securities, including
all financing costs within the meaning of Section 133.01(K) of the Ohio
Revised Code and such other costs of
the foregoing permanent improvements that may be financed with the
proceeds of securities as permitted by
Section 133.15(B) of the Ohio Revised
Code and as otherwise permitted by
law.
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Chapter 133
of the Ohio Revised Code and other
applicable provisions of the Ohio
Revised Code, the Charter of the City,
the General Bond Ordinance and this
Ordinance for the purpose stated in
Section 1 hereof. The Bonds shall be
designated “Cemeteries Improvement
Bonds” and may contain such further
designation as provided in the certificate of award providing for the final
terms of the Bonds and the sale of the
Bonds signed by the Director of
Finance in accordance with this Ordinance (the “Certificate of Award”).
The Bonds shall be issued in one lot
as fully registered Bonds in denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. The Bonds shall be numbered as determined by the Director
of Finance.
The Bonds shall be issued in the
principal amount specified in the Certificate of Award, which shall not
exceed the amount stated in Section 1
hereof. The Bonds shall be dated the
date and shall bear interest from their
date until the principal amount is
paid at the rate or rates per year specified in the Certificate of Award, provided that the weighted average of
such rates (taking into account the
principal amount and maturity of
each Bond to which a rate applies)
shall not exceed seven percent (7%)
per year. Interest on the Bonds shall
be payable when due, or until the
principal amount is paid, semiannually as specified in the Certificate of
Award as the dates on which interest
on the Bonds shall be payable (the
“Interest Payment Dates”), beginning
on the date specified in the Certificate
of Award as the first Interest Payment Date.
The Bonds shall mature in the
years and principal amounts as shall
be permitted by law and determined

The City Record
by the Director of Finance and specified in the Certificate of Award, based
on the written advice of a Financial
Advisor to be in the best interests of
the City, provided that (i) each principal payment shall occur on an Interest Payment Date, (ii) the first principal payment on the Bonds shall be
no earlier than November 15, 2011 and
no later than December 31, 2013, (iii)
the final maturity date of the Bonds
shall be no later than 20 years from
that date which is 12 months prior to
the first date on which provision for
payment of principal is made, and
(iv) the principal amount thereof
shall be payable in annual installments such that the total principal
and interest payments on the Bonds
in any fiscal year in which principal
is payable is not more than three
times the amount of those payments
in any other fiscal year.
The Bonds stated to mature in any
year may be issued as term bonds (the
“Term Bonds”), payable pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements as defined and further
described below. The Director of
Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award whether any of the
Bonds shall be issued as Term Bonds,
any dates (the “Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable pursuant to mandatory sinking fund installments rather than at
stated maturity and the amount of
principal to be paid on each Mandatory Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption or purchase prior to stated maturity as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory
sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100%
of the principal amount redeemed,
plus interest accrued to the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to be
deposited with the Escrow Agent, currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of and
interest on any Term Bonds shall
include amounts sufficient to redeem
on the Mandatory Redemption Dates
the principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided
below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined in
Section  3 hereof) for cancellation
Term Bonds in any aggregate principal amount and to receive a credit
against the then-current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City for
any Term Bonds. That option shall be
exercised by the City on or before the
forty-fifth day preceding the applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, by
furnishing the Escrow Agent a certificate, signed by the Registrar, setting forth the extent of the credit to
be applied with respect to the thencurrent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement. If the certificate is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be

228

February 23, 2011
reduced. A credit against the thencurrent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding
mandatory
redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds that
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and cancelled
by the Registrar, to the extent not
applied theretofore as a credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and cancelled, shall be credited by the
Escrow Agent at 100% of the principal amount thereof against the thencurrent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding
mandatory
redemption
obligation). Any excess of that
amount over the then-current Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirement
shall
be
credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligations) in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(b) Optional Redemption. The
Bonds may be subject to redemption
prior to maturity by and at the option
of the City, in whole or in part on any
date, in integral multiples of $5,000,
on the optional redemption dates and
at the redemption prices (expressed
as a percentage of the principal
amount redeemed) specified in the
Certificate of Award, plus, in each
case, accrued interest to the redemption date. The first optional redemption date shall not be later than ten
years from the first Interest Payment
Date, and the highest redemption
price shall not be greater than 102%
of the principal amount redeemed
plus accrued interest to the redemption date. Based on the written advice
of a financial advisor, the Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that it is in the best
interests of the City for some or all of
the Bonds not to be callable prior to
their stated maturity.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, the Bonds, or portions thereof, to be redeemed optionally shall be selected by lot prior to
the selection by lot of the Bonds to be
redeemed on the same date by operation of the Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds shall be
redeemed pursuant to this paragraph
only upon written notice from the
Director of Finance to the Registrar.
That notice shall specify the redemption date and the principal amount of
each maturity of Bonds to be
redeemed, and shall be given at least
45 days prior to the redemption date
or such shorter period as shall be
acceptable to the Registrar. There
shall be deposited with the Registrar
on or prior to the redemption date
funds sufficient to redeem at the
redemption
price
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice of
redemption has been given.
(c) Purchase in Lieu of Redemption. If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the City may
elect to purchase Bonds called for
optional redemption in lieu of redeeming those Bonds. That election shall
be exercised by written direction
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar and the Escrow Agent.

February 23, 2011
That written direction shall state
whether all or less than all of the
Bonds called for optional redemption
are to be purchased by the City in lieu
of redemption, shall identify the
Bonds to be purchased by their maturity date and shall specify the principal amount of each maturity to be purchased in lieu of redemption. If less
than all of the Bonds called for optional redemption are to be purchased in
lieu of redemption, the amount of
each maturity to be purchased shall
be in amounts of $5,000 or integral
multiples of $5,000. Any Bonds called
for optional redemption that are not
to be purchased shall be redeemed in
accordance with their redemption provisions. The purchase price of the
Bonds to be purchased in lieu of
redemption shall be equal to the principal of, any accrued but unpaid interest on, and any premium that would
have been payable on the Bonds on
the redemption date if the Bonds had
been optionally redeemed instead of
being purchased. No notice of the purchase in lieu of redemption is
required to be given to the owners of
the Bonds in addition to the notice of
redemption required by this Ordinance. The Escrow Agent or Registrar, as paying agent, shall not purchase Bonds if sufficient moneys
have not been deposited with the
Escrow Agent or Registrar, as paying
agent, by the City for the purpose. On
or prior to the scheduled date for
optional redemption, the City may
rescind its direction to purchase the
Bonds in lieu of redemption by written notice from the Director of
Finance to the Registrar and the
Escrow Agent. In the event that the
direction to purchase is rescinded, the
Bonds shall be redeemed on the
redemption date set forth in the notice
of redemption delivered to the owners
of the Bonds and in accordance with
the provisions of this Ordinance.
(d) Partial Redemption or Purchase. If fewer than all of the outstanding Bonds are called for redemption at one time (whether for redemption or purchase in lieu of redemption), they shall be called in the order
of maturities directed by the Director
of Finance. If fewer than all Bonds of
a single maturity are to be redeemed
or purchased in lieu of redemption,
the selection of Bonds to be redeemed
or purchased, or portions thereof in
amounts of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof, shall be made by the
Registrar by lot in a manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of
a partial redemption or purchase of
Bonds by lot when Bonds of denominations greater than $5,000 are then
outstanding, each $5,000 unit of principal thereof shall be treated as
though it were a separate Bond of the
denomination of $5,000. If it is determined that one or more, but not all of
the $5,000 units of principal amount
represented by a Bond are to be called
for redemption, then upon notice of
redemption of a $5,000 unit or units,
the registered owner of that Bond
shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i) for payment of the redemption
or purchase price of the $5,000 unit or
units called for redemption (including, without limitation, the interest
accrued to the date fixed for redemption and any premium), and (ii) for
issuance, without charge to the registered owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured portion of the Bond not
redeemed or purchased and bearing
interest at the same rate and matur-

The City Record
ing on the same date as the Bond surrendered.
(e) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii) the
redemption price to be paid, (iii) the
date fixed for redemption, and (iv)
the place or places where the amounts
due upon redemption are payable.
The notice shall be given by the Registrar on behalf of the City by mailing
a copy of the redemption notice by
first-class mail, postage prepaid, at
least 30 days prior to the date fixed
for redemption (or such period specified in the Certificate of Award), to
the registered owner of each Bond
subject to redemption in whole or in
part at the registered owner’s address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close of
business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing and to any provider
of a Credit Support Instrument (as
defined in Section 15 hereof) for the
Bonds or designated portions thereof.
Failure to receive notice by mail or
any defect in that notice regarding
any Bond, however, shall not affect
the validity of the proceedings for the
redemption of any Bond. Any notice
of redemption of any Bonds may specify that the redemption is contingent
on the deposit of moneys with the
Escrow Agent or Registrar, as paying
agent, on or prior to the redemption
date in an amount sufficient to pay
the redemption price of the Bonds to
be redeemed.
(f) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the manner provided in the preceding paragraph, and moneys having been
deposited by the City with the Escrow
Agent or Registrar, as paying agent,
in an amount sufficient to pay the
redemption price, the Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption
shall become due and payable on the
redemption date, and, upon presentation and surrender at the place or
places specified in that notice, shall
be paid. If money for the redemption
of all of the Bonds and portions thereof to be redeemed, including interest
accrued to the redemption date, is
held by the Registrar on the redemption date, and, if notice of redemption
has been deposited in the mail, then
from and after the redemption date
those Bonds and portions thereof
called for redemption shall cease to
bear interest and no longer shall be
considered to be outstanding. If that
money shall not be so available on the
redemption date, or that notice shall
not have been deposited in the mail,
those Bonds and portions thereof
shall continue to bear interest, until
they are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money held
by the Registrar for the redemption of
particular Bonds shall be held in trust
for the account of the registered owners and shall be paid to them, respectively, upon presentation and surrender of those Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without
deduction for the services of the Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent. Principal shall be payable
when due upon presentation and surrender of the Bonds at the principal
corporate trust office of the Registrar. Interest on a Bond shall be paid
on each Interest Payment Date by
check or draft mailed to the person in
whose name the Bond was registered,

229

11
and to that person’s address appearing, on the Bond Register (as defined
in Section  3 hereof) at the close of
business on the date provided in the
Registrar Agreement authorized and
defined in Section  3 hereof (the
“Record Date”). Notwithstanding any
contrary provision in the General
Bond Ordinance, so long as the Bonds
are held by a Depository in a book
entry system (as described in Section  3 hereof), debt charges on the
Bonds will be payable in lawful
money of the United States by wire
transfer to the Depository made by
the Escrow Agent on each Interest
Payment Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance. The General Bond Ordinance, except for the third paragraph
of Section 13(a) (pertaining generally to an adjustment of the interest
rate in an event of default) and the
third paragraph of Section 4 (pertaining generally to the periods during
which the City is not required to make
any transfers or exchanges of bonds
issued under the General Bond Ordinance), will apply to the Bonds.
Except for those provisions, the General Bond Ordinance is included as a
part of this Ordinance as fully as if
restated in this Ordinance. Words and
terms not otherwise defined in this
Ordinance shall have the same meaning as set forth in the General Bond
Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of the
Bonds; Paying Agents.
The Bonds shall express upon their
faces the purpose for which they are
issued and that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to
Section  4 of the General Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be authenticated by the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee (as
defined therein). The Bonds shall be
signed by the City’s Mayor and by the
City’s Director of Finance, and, consistent with Section 133.27 of the Ohio
Revised Code and notwithstanding
Section  177.02 of the Codified Ordinances of the City, either or both of
those signatures may be a facsimile.
The Bonds shall bear the seal of the
City, which seal may be a facsimile
seal. Pursuant to Section  83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
shall prepare the Bonds and shall
endorse thereon his approval of the
form and correctness thereof by his
manual or facsimile signature.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating
agent, bond registrar, transfer agent
and paying agent for the Bonds (the
“Registrar”). The Registrar shall also
act as paying agent for the Bonds so
long as the Bonds are held in a book
entry system. The Director of Finance
is authorized to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City, an
agreement between the City and the
Registrar (the “Registrar Agreement”), approved as to form and correctness by the Director of Law, providing for services relating to the registration, transfer, exchange and payment of the Bonds on terms approved
by the Director of Finance on behalf
of the City and consistent with this
Ordinance and not substantially
adverse to the City. That approval
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Registrar Agreement by the Director of Finance. The
Director of Finance shall provide for
the payment of the services rendered
and for reimbursement of expenses
incurred pursuant to the Registrar

12
Agreement from the proceeds of the
Bonds to the extent available and
then from other money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds remain
outstanding, the City will cause the
Registrar to maintain and keep at its
principal corporate trust office all
books and records necessary for the
registration, exchange and transfer
of Bonds as provided in this Section
(the “Bond Register”). The person in
whose name a Bond is registered on
the Bond Register shall be regarded
as the absolute owner of that Bond for
all purposes of this Ordinance. Payment of or on account of the debt
charges on any Bond shall be made
only to or upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar
shall be affected by any notice to the
contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid and
effectual to satisfy and discharge the
City’s liability upon the Bond, including interest, to the extent of the
amount or amounts so paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender
at the principal corporate trust office
of the Registrar, together with a
request for exchange signed by the
registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. A Bond may
be transferred only on the Bond Register upon presentation and surrender
of the Bond at the principal corporate
trust office of the Registrar together
with an assignment signed by the registered owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner equal
in the aggregate to the unmatured
principal amount of the Bond surrendered and bearing interest at the
same rate and maturing on the same
date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any tax or
other governmental charge required
to be paid with respect to the
exchange or transfer. The City or the
Registrar may require that those
charges, if any, be paid before the procedure is begun for the exchange or
transfer. All Bonds issued and
authenticated upon any exchange or
transfer shall be valid obligations of
the City, evidencing the same debt,
and entitled to the same security and
benefit under this Ordinance, as the
Bonds
surrendered
upon
that
exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:

The City Record
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds and the principal of and interest on the Bonds may
be transferred only through a book
entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are
issued by the City only to a Depository or its nominee as registered owner,
with the Bonds “immobilized” in the
custody of the Depository. The book
entry maintained by others than the
City is the record that identifies the
owners of beneficial interests in those
Bonds and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited
purpose trust company), New York,
New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers,
banks and trust companies, and clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized: (i) the Bonds
may be issued in the form of a single,
fully registered Bond representing
each maturity and registered in the
name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository;
(ii) the beneficial owners in book
entry form shall have no right to
receive Bonds in the form of physical
securities or certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book
entry form shall be shown by book
entry on the system maintained and
operated by the Depository and its
Participants, and transfers of the
ownership of beneficial interests
shall be made only by book entry by
the Depository and its Participants;
and (iv) the Bonds as such shall not
be transferable or exchangeable,
except for transfer to another Depository or to another nominee of a Depository, without further action by the
City.
If any Depository determines not to
continue to act as a Depository for the
Bonds for use in a book entry system,
the Director of Finance may attempt
to
establish
a
securities
depository/book entry relationship
with another qualified Depository. If
the Director of Finance does not or is
unable to do so, the Registrar, after
making provision for notification of
the beneficial owners by the then
Depository and any other arrangements deemed necessary, shall permit
withdrawal of the Bonds from the
Depository, and the Trustee and Registrar shall authenticate and deliver
bond certificates in registered form to
the assigns of the Depository or its
nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to the
extent necessary or required to enter
into any agreements determined necessary in connection with the book
entry system for the Bonds, after
determining that the signing thereof
will not endanger the funds or securi-

230

February 23, 2011
ties of the City and after the approval
of the form of any such agreement by
the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds.
The Bonds shall first be offered for
purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by
them, shall be offered to the Treasury
Investment Account for purchase and,
if not purchased for that Account,
shall be sold to one or more firms that
have proposed to underwrite the
Bonds and have been selected by the
Director of Finance based on an evaluation of the qualifications of those
firms (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”).
The Bonds shall be awarded to the
Original Purchaser in the Certificate
of Award which shall specify the
final terms of the Bonds in accordance with law, the provisions of this
Ordinance, the written advice of a
financial advisor retained under
authority of Section 16 hereof and the
Original Purchaser’s offer to purchase the Bonds, including: the principal amount of the Bonds, the purchase price (which shall be not less
than 97% of the principal amount of
the Bonds plus any accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate or
rates, the amounts and years in which
principal installments are payable
(at stated maturity or pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements), the Interest Payment
Dates and the date of the Bonds and
any other matters required in this
Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. As appropriate under the
Charter, the Mayor, Director of
Finance, Director of Law, Clerk of
Council and other appropriate officers of the City are, and each of them
is, authorized to take such actions as
are necessary, appropriate and in the
best interest of the City to establish
the terms and requirements for delivery of the Bonds and to make such
arrangements as are necessary with
the Original Purchaser in order to
establish the date, location, procedures, and conditions for the delivery
of the Bonds to the Original Purchaser, to give all appropriate notices and
certificates, to cause a true transcript
of proceedings with reference to the
issuance of the Bonds to be delivered
to the Original Purchaser, to sign any
transcript
certificates,
financial
statements and other documents and
instruments and to take such actions
as are necessary or appropriate to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take
all steps necessary to effect the due
execution, authentication and delivery of the Bonds. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to sign
and deliver on behalf of the City a
bond purchase agreement between
the City and the Original Purchaser
(the “Bond Purchase Agreement”),
approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, setting forth
the terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell the Bonds and the
Original Purchaser agrees to buy the
Bonds, which shall be consistent with
this Ordinance, not substantially
adverse to the City, and approved by
the Director of Finance and Director
of Law on behalf of the City, all of
which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of the Bond
Purchase Agreement by the Director
of Finance. It is determined that the
terms of the Bonds, as provided in this
Ordinance and as may be provided in
or pursuant to the Certificate of
Award, are in the best interest of the
City and in compliance with all legal
requirements.

February 23, 2011
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B) of the
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds with
other bonds into a single consolidated
issue of bonds for purposes of their
sale as a single issue to be designated
“Various Purpose General Obligation
Bonds, Series 2011” or such other designation as may be set forth in the
Certificate of Award. Such bonds
shall contain a summary statement of
purposes encompassing the purpose
for which the Bonds are issued and
shall state that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax.
For the purpose of providing the
necessary funds to pay the interest on
the Bonds promptly when and as the
same falls due, and also to provide for
the discharge of the Bonds at maturity, there shall be and is levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes, a direct
tax annually during the period the
Bonds are outstanding, in an amount
sufficient to provide for the payment
of that interest, when and as the same
shall fall due, and also to discharge
the principal of the Bonds at maturity, which tax shall not be less than
the interest and sinking fund tax
required by Section 11 of Article XII
of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is ordered computed, certified, levied and extended
upon the tax duplicate and collected
by the same officers, in the same manner and at the same time that taxes
for general purposes for each of those
years are certified, extended and collected. The tax shall be placed before
and in preference to all other items
and for the full amount thereof. The
funds derived from those tax levies
shall be placed in the Unvoted Tax
Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund as required by the General Bond Ordinance, and those funds,
together with the interest collected on
them, shall be irrevocably pledged for
the payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds when and as the
same fall due; provided, however,
that, subject to the provisions of Section 8 of the General Bond Ordinance,
in each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the Bonds
and are appropriated for such purpose, the amount of such tax shall be
reduced by the amount of such revenues so available and appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections  133.25(B)(1) and 5705.51 of
the Ohio Revised Code, and in accordance with the provisions of and to
the extent required or permitted by
the General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt charges
for the Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended and applied for the objects
and purposes for which the Bonds are
issued. The proceeds of the Bonds to
be applied to pay costs of any Credit
Support Instruments obtained pursuant to Section 15 hereof shall be
paid to the provider or providers of
those Credit Support Instruments.
The proceeds of the Bonds to be used
to pay costs of issuing the Bonds shall
be deposited with the Registrar in a
separate account under the Registrar
Agreement pending their application

The City Record
to the payment of such costs. Pursuant to Chapter 133 of the Ohio
Revised Code and this Ordinance, and
notwithstanding Chapter 179 of the
Codified Ordinances, any accrued
interest and any premium received
from the sale of the Bonds shall be
deposited in the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund to be applied to the payment of the principal of and interest
on the Bonds.
Section 7. General Obligation.
The Bonds are secured by a pledge
and lien on a parity with the pledges
and liens authorized by the General
Bond Ordinance and, in addition to
the taxes and revenues specifically
pledged pursuant to this Ordinance
and the General Bond Ordinance and
the other covenants, terms and agreements provided hereunder and in the
General Bond Ordinance to secure
payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds, the City hereby
determines, declares, warrants and
covenants that the Bonds are general
obligations of the City and that the
full faith and credit of the City are
hereby pledged for the payment of the
principal of and interest on the Bonds
in accordance with the laws and Constitution of the State of Ohio, this
Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid and
discharged all the outstanding Bonds,
or there shall otherwise be paid to the
holders of the outstanding Bonds all
debt charges due or to become due
thereon, and provision shall also be
made for paying all other sums
payable hereunder, then and in that
event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of
further effect, and the covenants,
agreements and other obligations of
the City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the request
of the City execute and deliver to the
City such instruments in writing as
shall discharge the lien hereof and
enter on the record such discharge of
the lien and such other instruments as
may be reasonably required by the
City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if:
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or subaccounts, in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold in
special accounts or subaccounts, in
trust for and irrevocably committed
solely thereto, direct obligations of
the United States certified by an independent public accounting firm of
national reputation to be of such
maturities and interest payment
dates and to bear such interest, without further investment or reinvestment of either the principal amount
thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held in trust and
committed, except as hereinafter provided), as will be sufficient, together
with moneys referred to in (i) above,
for the payment, at their maturities or
redemption dates, of all debt charges
on the Bonds to their date of maturity
or redemption, as the case may be, or
if default in such payment shall have
occurred on such date then to the date
of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds are to be

231

13
redeemed prior to the maturity thereof, notice of such redemption shall
have been duly given or irrevocable
provision satisfactory to the Trustee
shall have been duly made for the giving of such notice. Any moneys held
by the Escrow Agent in accordance
with the provisions of this Section
shall be invested by the Escrow
Agent in direct obligations of the
United States of America maturing, or
redeemable at the option of the holder, at times and in amounts sufficient
to meet payment of debt charges on
the Bonds, as directed by the Director
of Finance. Any income or interest
earned by, or increment to, the investments held under this Section shall, to
the extent determined from time to
time by the Escrow Agent to be in
excess of the amount required to be
held by it for the purposes of this Section, be transferred at the time of
such determination as provided in
Section  17(a) of the General Bond
Ordinance for unclaimed funds held
by a Paying Agent. In the event of
nonpresentment of any Bond as
described in Section 17(a) of the General Bond Ordinance, the moneys held
pursuant to this Section shall be held
and paid as provided in said Section  17(a) for unclaimed funds held
by a Paying Agent.
Section 9. Bond Anticipation Notes.
For the purpose of raising money in
anticipation of the issuance of the
Bonds for the purpose set forth in Section 1 hereof, notes of the City may be
issued in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed Seven Hundred
Fifty Thousand Dollars ($750,000)
(the “Notes”) upon the direction of the
Director of Finance to be set forth in a
certificate providing for the final
terms of the Notes and the sale of the
Notes and signed by the Director of
Finance (the  “Note Certificate of
Award”).
(a) Terms of the Notes. The Notes
shall bear interest at such rate, not
exceeding seven percent (7%) per
year, as may be fixed by the Director
of Finance of the City in the Note Certificate of Award; shall be dated their
date of issuance; shall mature on the
date set forth in the Note Certificate
of Award, which shall be no later than
five years from such date of issuance;
shall be subject to redemption by the
City at any time prior to maturity
without penalty, provided that, if the
Director of Finance, based on the
advice of a financial advisor, determines that it is in the best interest of
the City in order to enhance the marketability of the Notes, the Director of
Finance may cause the Notes to not be
redeemable for a period which ends
no later than the date which is two
years following the date of issuance
of the Notes; shall be designated
“Cemeteries
Improvement
Bond
Anticipation Notes”; shall be issued in
such numbers and denominations as
may be requested by the Note Purchaser (hereinafter defined); and
shall be issued in fully registered
form (which may be in a book entry
only system) in denominations of
$5,000 or integral multiples thereof.
Interest shall be payable semiannually on the dates set forth in the Note
Certificate of Award; provided that if
the Notes mature on or before the end
of the twelfth month following their
date of issuance, interest on the Notes
shall be payable at maturity.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating
agent, registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Notes (the “Note
Registrar”). The Escrow Agent also
shall act as paying agent for the

14
Notes if the Notes are held in a book
entry system. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, an agreement among the City, the Note Registrar and the Escrow Agent (the “Note
Registrar Agreement”) providing for
services relating to the registration,
transfer, exchange and payment of
Notes on terms that are approved by
the Director of Finance on behalf of
the City. That approval shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the Note Registrar Agreement by the
Director of Finance. The Director of
Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and for
reimbursement of expenses incurred
pursuant to the Note Registrar Agreement from the proceeds of the Notes to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Notes remain
outstanding, the City will cause the
Note Registrar to maintain and keep
at its principal corporate trust office
all books and records necessary for
the registration, exchange and transfer of Notes as provided in this Section
(the “Note Register”). The person in
whose name a Note is registered on
the Note Register shall be regarded as
the absolute owner of that Note for all
purposes of this Ordinance. Payment
of or on account of the debt charges
on any Note shall be made only to or
upon the order of that person; neither
the City nor the Note Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid and
effectual to satisfy and discharge the
City’s liability upon the Note, including interest, to the extent of the
amount or amounts so paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for
Notes of any authorized denomination
upon presentation and surrender at
the principal corporate trust office of
the Note Registrar, together with a
request for exchange signed by the
registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Note Registrar. A Note
may be transferred only on the Note
Register upon presentation and surrender of the Note at the principal corporate trust office of the Note Registrar together with an assignment
signed by the registered owner or by
a person legally empowered to do so
in a form satisfactory to the Note Registrar. Upon exchange or transfer the
Note
Registrar
shall
complete,
authenticate and deliver a new Note
or Notes of any authorized denomination or denominations requested by
the owner equal in the aggregate to
the unmatured principal amount of
the Note surrendered and bearing
interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Note Registrar shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Notes only after the new
Notes are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Notes exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Note Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Notes
in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Note Registrar may make a charge
sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to the
exchange or transfer. The City or the

The City Record
Note Registrar may require that those
charges, if any, be paid before the procedure is begun for the exchange or
transfer. All Notes issued and authenticated upon any exchange or transfer shall be valid obligations of the
City, evidencing the same debt, and
entitled to the same security and benefit under this Ordinance, as the Notes
surrendered upon that exchange or
transfer.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B) of the
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Notes with
other bond anticipation notes of the
City for purposes of their sale as a single issue to be designated “Various
Purpose General Obligation Bond
Anticipation Notes.” The Notes shall
contain a summary statement of purposes encompassing the purpose for
which the Notes are issued and shall
state that they are issued pursuant to
this Ordinance.
(b) Execution and Payment of the
Notes. The Notes shall express upon
their faces the purpose for which they
are issued and that they are issued
pursuant to this Ordinance. Each Note
shall be authenticated by the manual
signature of an authorized officer of
the Trustee (as defined therein). The
Notes shall be signed by the City’s
Mayor and by the City’s Director of
Finance, and, consistent with Section
133.27 of the Ohio Revised Code and
notwithstanding Section 177.02 of the
Codified Ordinances of the City,
either or both of those signatures may
be a facsimile. The Notes shall bear
the seal of the City, which seal may be
a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section 83 of the City’s Charter, the Director of Law shall prepare the Notes and
shall endorse thereon his approval of
the form and correctness thereof by
his manual or facsimile signature.
(c) Sale of the Notes. The Notes
shall first be offered for purchase to
the Trustees of the Sinking Fund and,
if not purchased by them, shall be
offered to the Treasury Investment
Account for purchase and, if not purchased for that Account, shall be sold
to one or more firms that have proposed to underwrite the Notes and
have been selected by the Director of
Finance based on an evaluation of the
qualifications of those firms (the
“Note Purchaser”) in the principal
amount set forth in a certificate of
award to be executed by the Director
of Finance (the  “Note Certificate of
Award”) at not less than par and
accrued interest and at a rate not
exceeding that set forth in Section 10
hereof. The proceeds of such sale
shall be paid into the proper fund and
used for the purpose for which the
Notes are being issued under the provisions of this Ordinance.
(d) Security for the Notes. The
Notes shall be the full general obligations of the City, and the full faith,
credit and revenue of the City are
hereby pledged for the prompt payment of the same. The par value to be
received from the sale of the Notes
and any excess funds resulting from
the issuance of the Notes shall, to the
extent necessary, be used for the
retirement of the Notes at maturity,
together with the interest thereon,
and are hereby pledged for such purpose.
Section 10. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax.
During the year or years while the
Notes are outstanding there shall be
levied on all the taxable property in
the City, in addition to all other taxes
but within tax limitations, a direct
tax annually not less than that which
would have been levied if bonds had

232

February 23, 2011
been issued therefor without the prior
issue of the Notes. That tax shall be
and is ordered computed, certified,
levied and extended upon the tax
duplicate and collected by the same
officers, in the same manner and at
the same time that taxes for general
purposes for each year are certified,
extended and collected. That tax
shall be placed before and in preference to all other items and for the full
amount thereof. The funds derived
from the tax levies required by this
Ordinance shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account, and those funds, together
with the interest collected on them,
shall be irrevocably pledged for the
payment of the principal and interest
of the Notes or the Bonds in anticipation of which they are issued, when
and as the same falls due; provided,
however, that in each year to the
extent that revenues are available
from other sources for the payment of
the Notes and Bonds and are appropriated for such purpose, the amount of
such direct tax upon all of the taxable
property in the City may be reduced
by the amount of such revenues so
available and appropriated.
Section 11. Official Statement; Continuing Disclosure.
If, in the judgment of the Director
of Finance, a disclosure document
(each, an “Official Statement”) is
appropriate or necessary in connection with the sale of the Notes or the
Bonds, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare or cause to be
prepared on behalf of the City an Official Statement with respect to the
Notes or the Bonds, as the case may
be, and any necessary supplements
and to authorize the use and distribution of each Official Statement and
any supplements. The Director of
Finance is authorized to sign on
behalf of the City and in her official
capacity each Official Statement and
any supplements approved by her.
The Director of Finance is authorized
to sign and deliver on behalf of the
City and in her official capacity such
certificates in connection with the
accuracy of each Official Statement
and any supplements as may, in the
judgment of the Director of Finance,
be necessary or appropriate. The
Director of Finance is also authorized
to determine and certify on behalf of
the City that such disclosure document is “deemed final” by the City
within the meaning of Securities and
Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12
(the “SEC Rule”). The Director of
Finance is authorized to contract for
services for the production and distribution of preliminary and final Official Statements, including by printed
and electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time of
the Notes or the Bonds, the City
agrees, in accordance with, and as the
only obligated person with respect to
the Notes and the Bonds under the
SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be
provided such financial information
and operating data and notices, in
such manner as may be required for
purposes of the SEC Rule. In order to
describe and specify certain terms of
the City’s continuing disclosure
agreement for that purpose, and
thereby to implement that agreement,
including provisions for enforcement,
amendment and termination, the
Director of Finance is authorized and
directed to prepare, or cause to be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of the City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the

February 23, 2011
continuing
disclosure
agreement
made by the City for the benefit of the
holders and beneficial owners of the
Notes or the Bonds, as the case may
be, in accordance with the SEC Rule.
The performance of that agreement
shall be subject to the availability of
funds and their annual appropriation
to meet costs the City would be
required to incur to perform it. The
Director of Finance is further authorized and directed to establish procedures in order to ensure compliance
by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely
provision of information and notices.
Section 12. Miscellaneous.
(a) Any provisions of the Codified
Ordinances of the City that are inconsistent with the provisions of this
Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance shall not apply to the Bonds or
the Notes authorized herein.
(b) All covenants, terms and provisions of the General Bond Ordinance
are fully applicable to the Bonds and
the Notes authorized herein, and nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed
to alter or restrict such full application of the General Bond Ordinance,
except for the exclusion from application to the Bonds and the Notes authorized herein of the provisions of the
third paragraph of Section 13(a) and
the third paragraph of Section 4 of the
General Bond Ordinance, pursuant to
Section 2 hereof.
Section 13. Captions.
The captions or headings in this
Ordinance are for convenience only
and in no way define, limit or describe
the scope or intent of any provisions
or sections of this Ordinance.
Section 14. Federal Tax Covenants.
The City covenants that it will use,
and will restrict the use and investment of, the proceeds of the Notes and
the Bonds in such manner and to such
extent as may be necessary so that
(a) the Notes and the Bonds will not
(i) constitute private activity bonds,
arbitrage bonds or hedge bonds under
Sections 141, 148 or 149 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the “Code”) or (ii) be treated other
than as bonds to which Section 103(a)
of the Code applies, and (b) the interest thereon will not be treated as an
item of tax preference under Section 57 of the Code.
The City further covenants that (a)
it will take or cause to be taken such
actions that may be required of it for
the interest on the Notes and the
Bonds to be and to remain excluded
from gross income for federal income
tax purposes, (b) it will not take or
authorize to be taken any actions that
would adversely affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting for
it, will, among other acts of compliance, (i) apply the proceeds of the
Notes and the Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing, (ii)
restrict the yield on investment property acquired with those proceeds,
(iii) make timely and adequate payments to the federal government, (iv)
maintain books and records and make
calculations and reports, and (v)
refrain from certain uses of those proceeds, and, as applicable, of property
financed with such proceeds, all in
such manner and to the extent necessary to assure such exclusion of that
interest under the Code.
Each covenant made in this Section
with respect to the Notes and the
Bonds is also made with respect to all
issues any portion of the debt service
on which is paid from proceeds of the
Notes or the Bonds (and, if different,
the original issue and any refunding
issues in a series of refundings), to

The City Record
the extent such compliance is necessary to assure exclusion of interest on
the Notes and the Bonds from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, and the officers identified above
are authorized to take actions with
respect to those issues as they are
authorized in this Section to take with
respect to the Notes and the Bonds.
The Director of Finance, as the fiscal officer, or any other officer of the
City
having
responsibility
for
issuance of the Notes and the Bonds is
hereby authorized (a) to make or
effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or
waiver on behalf of the City with
respect to the Notes and the Bonds as
the City is permitted or required to
make or give under the federal
income tax laws, including, without
limitation thereto, any of the elections
provided
for

assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose, reducing the
burden or expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or
payments or penalties, or making
payments of special amounts in lieu
of making computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as

Notes and the Bonds.
Section 15. Credit Enhancement and
Ratings.
If, in the judgment of the Director
of Finance, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, the filing of an application for a rating on
the Bonds or designated portion
thereof by one or more nationally recognized rating agencies is in the best
interest of the City, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare and
submit those applications and to provide to each such agency such information as may be required for the purpose. The Director of Finance is
authorized to contract for one or more
Credit Support Instruments for the
Bonds or designated portions thereof
if the Director determines, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, that the Credit Support
Instruments will result in debt service savings to the City. As used in
this Section, “Credit Support Instrument” means an insurance policy,
surety, letter of credit, or other instrument used to enhance or provide for
the security of Bonds. The cost of
obtaining each rating and the cost of
obtaining each Credit Support Instrument, except to the extent paid by the
Original Purchasers in accordance

with the Bond Purchase Agreement,
shall be paid from the proceeds of
Bonds or funds appropriated for that
purpose.
Section 16. Financial Advisor.
The Director of Finance may obtain
the services of one or more financial
advisors, from time to time, to assist
the Director of Finance in making
any of the determinations required by
this Ordinance to be determined by
the Director of Finance. The Director
of Finance may rely on the written
advice of any financial advisor so
retained. Any financial advisor
employed under the authority of this
Ordinance shall be disinterested in
the transaction and be independent of
the Original Purchasers and any
other party interested in the transaction.
Section 17. Open Meeting Determination.
It is found and determined that all
formal actions of this Council and of
any of its committees concerning and
relating to the passage of this Ordinance were taken, and that all deliberations of this Council and any of its
committees that resulted in these formal actions were held, in meetings
open to the public in compliance with
all legal requirements, including,
without limitation, Section  121.22 of
the Ohio Revised Code.
Section 18. Findings and Recitals of
Validity.
It is hereby determined, represented and recited that all acts, conditions
and things necessary to be done
precedent to and in the issuing of the
Bonds and the Notes in order to make
them legal, valid and binding obligations of the City have happened, been
done and been performed in regular
and due form as required by law; and
that no limitation of indebtedness or
taxation, either statutory or constitutional, will have been exceeded in the
issuance of the Bonds or the Notes. It
is further found and determined, and
is hereby represented and recited,
that the provisions of Sections 28, 29,
32, 33 (including the provisions of Section  33 with respect to readings on
three separate days or dispensing
with such readings by a two-thirds
vote of all members of the Council),
36, 37, 48 and all other applicable provisions of the City’s Charter and the

Ordinance and of the Certificate of
Award for the Bonds and any Note
Certificate of Award to the appropriate official of the County of Cuyahoga, Ohio and to secure a receipt

Section 20. Severability.
Each section and each part of each
section of this Ordinance is hereby
declared to be an independent section
or part of a section and, notwithstanding any other evidence of legislative
intent, it is hereby declared to be the
controlling legislative intent that if
any such section or part of a section
or any provision thereof, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the
remaining sections or parts of sections and the application of such provisions to any other person or circumstance, other than those as to which it
is held invalid, shall not be affected
thereby, and it is hereby declared to
be the legislative intent that the other
provisions of this Ordinance would
have been passed independently of
such section, or parts of a section, so
held to be invalid.

16
Section 21. Legislative Intent.
All terms, conditions, pledges,
covenants or agreements on the part
of the City provided for in this Ordinance are made by the voluntary act
of the City under its lawful authority,
including its authority under its Charter and Article XVIII of the Constitution of Ohio.

indentures, trust agreements, or other
agreements or contracts made or
entered into by the City and for which
consideration was duly received by
the City prior to the passage of this
Ordinance or the General Bond Ordinance.

Ord. No. 129-11.
By Council Member Sweeney (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the issuance and sale of bonds in
the maximum principal amount of
$2,095,000 for the purpose of providing
funds to improve municipal parks and
recreation facilities and authorizing
related matters.
Whereas, this Council desires to
issue bonds in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed Two Million
Ninety-Five
Thousand
Dollars
($2,095,000) (the “Bonds”) to finance
the costs of certain permanent
improvements described in Section 1
of this ordinance (this “Ordinance”);
and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of this City, has previously certified to this Council that
the estimated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be financed with the
proceeds of the Bonds is at least five
years and that the maximum maturity of the Bonds is 26  years, as evidenced by the Certificate contained in
File No. 129-11-A; and
Whereas, this Council passed Ordinance No. 1749-80 on October 8, 1980,
and thereafter amended that ordinance by Ordinance No. 1112-83,
passed May 6, 1983, and Ordinance No.
944-96, passed June 10, 1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so amended and
as the same may further be amended
from time to time in accordance with
its provisions, is referred to as the
“General Bond Ordinance”), providing the general terms and provisions
for the issuance of unvoted general
obligations of the City, with the specific terms of each series of Bonds to
be contained in ordinances authorizing the issuance of Bonds in accor-

The City Record
dance with the provisions thereof
(the “Series Bond Ordinances”); and
Whereas, the authorization for
issuance of the Bonds is necessary to
provide funds to pay the costs of certain
permanent
improvements
described in Section 1 hereof that are
urgently needed for the benefit of the
City, and as a result, this Ordinance
constitutes an emergency measure
providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health and safety, and for the usual
daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose.
It is deemed necessary to issue the
Bonds in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed Two Million
Ninety-Five
Thousand
Dollars
($2,095,000) for the purpose of providing funds to municipal parks and
recreation facilities by constructing,
reconstructing,
rehabilitating,
installing, renovating, enlarging,
redeveloping and otherwise improving parks and recreation centers and
areas, pools, skating rinks, greenhouses, bicycle paths, playgrounds,
playfields, tracks, fields and related
buildings,
structures,
walkways,
pavement, plazas, landscaping and
facilities, and providing necessary
water systems, drainage, lighting,
signage, fixtures, furnishings, equipment, safety modifications and site
improvements, together with all necessary and incidental appurtenances
and the acquisition of any required
real estate and interests in real estate
and the demolition of any existing
buildings, structures, walkways and
facilities, and to pay any capitalized
interest and all expenses incurred in
connection with the issuance of the
securities, including all financing
costs within the meaning of Section  133.01(K) of the Ohio Revised
Code and such other costs of the foregoing permanent improvements that
may be financed with the proceeds of
securities as permitted by Section  133.15(B) of the Ohio Revised
Code and as otherwise permitted by
law.
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Chapter 133
of the Ohio Revised Code and other
applicable provisions of the Ohio
Revised Code, the Charter of the City,
the General Bond Ordinance and this
Ordinance for the purpose stated in
Section 1 hereof. The Bonds shall be
designated “Parks and Recreation
Facilities Improvement Bonds” and
may contain such further designation
as provided in the certificate of award
providing for the final terms of the
Bonds and the sale of the Bonds
signed by the Director of Finance in
accordance with this Ordinance (the
“Certificate of Award”). The Bonds
shall be issued in one lot as fully registered Bonds in denominations of
$5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. The Bonds shall be numbered as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance.
The Bonds shall be issued in the
principal amount specified in the Certificate of Award, which shall not
exceed the amount stated in Section 1
hereof. The Bonds shall be dated the
date and shall bear interest from their
date until the principal amount is
paid at the rate or rates per year specified in the Certificate of Award, provided that the weighted average of
such rates (taking into account the
principal amount and maturity of

234

February 23, 2011
each Bond to which a rate applies)
shall not exceed seven percent (7%)
per year. Interest on the Bonds shall
be payable when due, or until the
principal amount is paid, semiannually as specified in the Certificate of
Award as the dates on which interest
on the Bonds shall be payable (the
“Interest Payment Dates”), beginning
on the date specified in the Certificate
of Award as the first Interest Payment Date.
The Bonds shall mature in the
years and principal amounts as shall
be permitted by law and determined
by the Director of Finance and specified in the Certificate of Award, based
on the written advice of a Financial
Advisor to be in the best interests of
the City, provided that (i) each principal payment shall occur on an Interest Payment Date, (ii) the first principal payment on the Bonds shall be
no earlier than November 15, 2011 and
no later than December 31, 2013, (iii)
the final maturity date of the Bonds
shall be no later than 26 years from
that date which is 12 months prior to
the first date on which provision for
payment of principal is made, and
(iv) the principal amount thereof
shall be payable in annual installments such that the total principal
and interest payments on the Bonds
in any fiscal year in which principal
is payable is not more than three
times the amount of those payments
in any other fiscal year.
The Bonds stated to mature in any
year may be issued as term bonds (the
“Term Bonds”), payable pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements as defined and further
described below. The Director of
Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award whether any of the
Bonds shall be issued as Term Bonds,
any dates (the “Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable pursuant to mandatory sinking fund installments rather than at
stated maturity and the amount of
principal to be paid on each Mandatory Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption or purchase prior to stated maturity as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory
sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100%
of the principal amount redeemed,
plus interest accrued to the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to be
deposited with the Escrow Agent, currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of and
interest on any Term Bonds shall
include amounts sufficient to redeem
on the Mandatory Redemption Dates
the principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided
below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined in
Section  3 hereof) for cancellation
Term Bonds in any aggregate principal amount and to receive a credit
against the then-current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City for

February 23, 2011
any Term Bonds. That option shall be
exercised by the City on or before the
forty-fifth day preceding the applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, by
furnishing the Escrow Agent a certificate, signed by the Registrar, setting forth the extent of the credit to
be applied with respect to the thencurrent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement. If the certificate is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the thencurrent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding
mandatory
redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds that
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and cancelled
by the Registrar, to the extent not
applied theretofore as a credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and cancelled, shall be credited by the
Escrow Agent at 100% of the principal amount thereof against the thencurrent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding
mandatory
redemption
obligation). Any excess of that
amount over the then-current Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirement
shall
be
credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligations) in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(b) Optional Redemption. The
Bonds may be subject to redemption
prior to maturity by and at the option
of the City, in whole or in part on any
date, in integral multiples of $5,000,
on the optional redemption dates and
at the redemption prices (expressed
as a percentage of the principal
amount redeemed) specified in the
Certificate of Award, plus, in each
case, accrued interest to the redemption date. The first optional redemption date shall not be later than ten
years from the first Interest Payment
Date, and the highest redemption
price shall not be greater than 102%
of the principal amount redeemed
plus accrued interest to the redemption date. Based on the written advice
of a financial advisor, the Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that it is in the best
interests of the City for some or all of
the Bonds not to be callable prior to
their stated maturity.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, the Bonds, or portions thereof, to be redeemed optionally shall be selected by lot prior to
the selection by lot of the Bonds to be
redeemed on the same date by operation of the Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds shall be
redeemed pursuant to this paragraph
only upon written notice from the
Director of Finance to the Registrar.
That notice shall specify the redemption date and the principal amount of
each maturity of Bonds to be
redeemed, and shall be given at least
45 days prior to the redemption date
or such shorter period as shall be
acceptable to the Registrar. There

The City Record
shall be deposited with the Registrar
on or prior to the redemption date
funds sufficient to redeem at the
redemption
price
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice of
redemption has been given.
(c) Purchase in Lieu of Redemption. If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the City may
elect to purchase Bonds called for
optional redemption in lieu of redeeming those Bonds. That election shall
be exercised by written direction
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar and the Escrow Agent.
That written direction shall state
whether all or less than all of the
Bonds called for optional redemption
are to be purchased by the City in lieu
of redemption, shall identify the
Bonds to be purchased by their maturity date and shall specify the principal amount of each maturity to be purchased in lieu of redemption. If less
than all of the Bonds called for optional redemption are to be purchased in
lieu of redemption, the amount of
each maturity to be purchased shall
be in amounts of $5,000 or integral
multiples of $5,000. Any Bonds called
for optional redemption that are not
to be purchased shall be redeemed in
accordance with their redemption provisions. The purchase price of the
Bonds to be purchased in lieu of
redemption shall be equal to the principal of, any accrued but unpaid interest on, and any premium that would
have been payable on the Bonds on
the redemption date if the Bonds had
been optionally redeemed instead of
being purchased. No notice of the purchase in lieu of redemption is
required to be given to the owners of
the Bonds in addition to the notice of
redemption required by this Ordinance. The Escrow Agent or Registrar, as paying agent, shall not purchase Bonds if sufficient moneys
have not been deposited with the
Escrow Agent or Registrar, as paying
agent, by the City for the purpose. On
or prior to the scheduled date for
optional redemption, the City may
rescind its direction to purchase the
Bonds in lieu of redemption by written notice from the Director of
Finance to the Registrar and the
Escrow Agent. In the event that the
direction to purchase is rescinded, the
Bonds shall be redeemed on the
redemption date set forth in the notice
of redemption delivered to the owners
of the Bonds and in accordance with
the provisions of this Ordinance.
(d) Partial Redemption or Purchase. If fewer than all of the outstanding Bonds are called for redemption at one time (whether for redemption or purchase in lieu of redemption), they shall be called in the order
of maturities directed by the Director
of Finance. If fewer than all Bonds of
a single maturity are to be redeemed
or purchased in lieu of redemption,
the selection of Bonds to be redeemed
or purchased, or portions thereof in
amounts of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof, shall be made by the
Registrar by lot in a manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of
a partial redemption or purchase of
Bonds by lot when Bonds of denominations greater than $5,000 are then
outstanding, each $5,000 unit of principal thereof shall be treated as
though it were a separate Bond of the
denomination of $5,000. If it is determined that one or more, but not all of
the $5,000 units of principal amount
represented by a Bond are to be called
for redemption, then upon notice of
redemption of a $5,000 unit or units,
the registered owner of that Bond

235

17
shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i) for payment of the redemption
or purchase price of the $5,000 unit or
units called for redemption (including, without limitation, the interest
accrued to the date fixed for redemption and any premium), and (ii) for
issuance, without charge to the registered owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured portion of the Bond not
redeemed or purchased and bearing
interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date as the Bond surrendered.
(e) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii) the
redemption price to be paid, (iii) the
date fixed for redemption, and (iv)
the place or places where the amounts
due upon redemption are payable.
The notice shall be given by the Registrar on behalf of the City by mailing
a copy of the redemption notice by
first-class mail, postage prepaid, at
least 30 days prior to the date fixed
for redemption (or such period specified in the Certificate of Award), to
the registered owner of each Bond
subject to redemption in whole or in
part at the registered owner’s address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close of
business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing and to any provider
of a Credit Support Instrument (as
defined in Section 15 hereof) for the
Bonds or designated portions thereof.
Failure to receive notice by mail or
any defect in that notice regarding
any Bond, however, shall not affect
the validity of the proceedings for the
redemption of any Bond. Any notice
of redemption of any Bonds may specify that the redemption is contingent
on the deposit of moneys with the
Escrow Agent or Registrar, as paying
agent, on or prior to the redemption
date in an amount sufficient to pay
the redemption price of the Bonds to
be redeemed.
(f) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the manner provided in the preceding paragraph, and moneys having been
deposited by the City with the Escrow
Agent or Registrar, as paying agent,
in an amount sufficient to pay the
redemption price, the Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption
shall become due and payable on the
redemption date, and, upon presentation and surrender at the place or
places specified in that notice, shall
be paid. If money for the redemption
of all of the Bonds and portions thereof to be redeemed, including interest
accrued to the redemption date, is
held by the Registrar on the redemption date, and, if notice of redemption
has been deposited in the mail, then
from and after the redemption date
those Bonds and portions thereof
called for redemption shall cease to
bear interest and no longer shall be
considered to be outstanding. If that
money shall not be so available on the
redemption date, or that notice shall
not have been deposited in the mail,
those Bonds and portions thereof
shall continue to bear interest, until
they are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money held
by the Registrar for the redemption of
particular Bonds shall be held in trust
for the account of the registered owners and shall be paid to them, respec-

18
tively, upon presentation and surrender of those Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without
deduction for the services of the Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent. Principal shall be payable
when due upon presentation and surrender of the Bonds at the principal
corporate trust office of the Registrar. Interest on a Bond shall be paid
on each Interest Payment Date by
check or draft mailed to the person in
whose name the Bond was registered,
and to that person’s address appearing, on the Bond Register (as defined
in Section  3 hereof) at the close of
business on the date provided in the
Registrar Agreement authorized and
defined in Section  3 hereof (the
“Record Date”). Notwithstanding any
contrary provision in the General
Bond Ordinance, so long as the Bonds
are held by a Depository in a book
entry system (as described in Section  3 hereof), debt charges on the
Bonds will be payable in lawful
money of the United States by wire
transfer to the Depository made by
the Escrow Agent on each Interest
Payment Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance. The General Bond Ordinance, except for the third paragraph
of Section 13(a) (pertaining generally to an adjustment of the interest
rate in an event of default) and the
third paragraph of Section 4 (pertaining generally to the periods during
which the City is not required to make
any transfers or exchanges of bonds
issued under the General Bond Ordinance), will apply to the Bonds.
Except for those provisions, the General Bond Ordinance is included as a
part of this Ordinance as fully as if
restated in this Ordinance. Words and
terms not otherwise defined in this
Ordinance shall have the same meaning as set forth in the General Bond
Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of the
Bonds; Paying Agents.
The Bonds shall express upon their
faces the purpose for which they are
issued and that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to
Section  4 of the General Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be authenticated by the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee (as
defined therein). The Bonds shall be
signed by the City’s Mayor and by the
City’s Director of Finance, and, consistent with Section 133.27 of the Ohio
Revised Code and notwithstanding
Section  177.02 of the Codified Ordinances of the City, either or both of
those signatures may be a facsimile.
The Bonds shall bear the seal of the
City, which seal may be a facsimile
seal. Pursuant to Section  83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
shall prepare the Bonds and shall
endorse thereon his approval of the
form and correctness thereof by his
manual or facsimile signature.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating
agent, bond registrar, transfer agent
and paying agent for the Bonds (the
“Registrar”). The Registrar shall also
act as paying agent for the Bonds so
long as the Bonds are held in a book
entry system. The Director of Finance
is authorized to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City, an
agreement between the City and the
Registrar (the “Registrar Agreement”), approved as to form and cor-

The City Record
rectness by the Director of Law, providing for services relating to the registration, transfer, exchange and payment of the Bonds on terms approved
by the Director of Finance on behalf
of the City and consistent with this
Ordinance and not substantially
adverse to the City. That approval
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Registrar Agreement by the Director of Finance. The
Director of Finance shall provide for
the payment of the services rendered
and for reimbursement of expenses
incurred pursuant to the Registrar
Agreement from the proceeds of the
Bonds to the extent available and
then from other money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds remain
outstanding, the City will cause the
Registrar to maintain and keep at its
principal corporate trust office all
books and records necessary for the
registration, exchange and transfer
of Bonds as provided in this Section
(the “Bond Register”). The person in
whose name a Bond is registered on
the Bond Register shall be regarded
as the absolute owner of that Bond for
all purposes of this Ordinance. Payment of or on account of the debt
charges on any Bond shall be made
only to or upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar
shall be affected by any notice to the
contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid and
effectual to satisfy and discharge the
City’s liability upon the Bond, including interest, to the extent of the
amount or amounts so paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender
at the principal corporate trust office
of the Registrar, together with a
request for exchange signed by the
registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. A Bond may
be transferred only on the Bond Register upon presentation and surrender
of the Bond at the principal corporate
trust office of the Registrar together
with an assignment signed by the registered owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner equal
in the aggregate to the unmatured
principal amount of the Bond surrendered and bearing interest at the
same rate and maturing on the same
date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any tax or
other governmental charge required
to be paid with respect to the
exchange or transfer. The City or the
Registrar may require that those
charges, if any, be paid before the procedure is begun for the exchange or
transfer. All Bonds issued and
authenticated upon any exchange or

236

February 23, 2011
transfer shall be valid obligations of
the City, evidencing the same debt,
and entitled to the same security and
benefit under this Ordinance, as the
Bonds
surrendered
upon
that
exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds and the principal of and interest on the Bonds may
be transferred only through a book
entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are
issued by the City only to a Depository or its nominee as registered owner,
with the Bonds “immobilized” in the
custody of the Depository. The book
entry maintained by others than the
City is the record that identifies the
owners of beneficial interests in those
Bonds and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited
purpose trust company), New York,
New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers,
banks and trust companies, and clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized: (i) the Bonds
may be issued in the form of a single,
fully registered Bond representing
each maturity and registered in the
name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository;
(ii) the beneficial owners in book
entry form shall have no right to
receive Bonds in the form of physical
securities or certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book
entry form shall be shown by book
entry on the system maintained and
operated by the Depository and its
Participants, and transfers of the
ownership of beneficial interests
shall be made only by book entry by
the Depository and its Participants;
and (iv) the Bonds as such shall not
be transferable or exchangeable,
except for transfer to another Depository or to another nominee of a Depository, without further action by the
City.
If any Depository determines not to
continue to act as a Depository for the
Bonds for use in a book entry system,
the Director of Finance may attempt
to
establish
a
securities
depository/book entry relationship
with another qualified Depository. If
the Director of Finance does not or is
unable to do so, the Registrar, after
making provision for notification of
the beneficial owners by the then
Depository and any other arrangements deemed necessary, shall permit
withdrawal of the Bonds from the
Depository, and the Trustee and Registrar shall authenticate and deliver
bond certificates in registered form to

February 23, 2011
the assigns of the Depository or its
nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to the
extent necessary or required to enter
into any agreements determined necessary in connection with the book
entry system for the Bonds, after
determining that the signing thereof
will not endanger the funds or securities of the City and after the approval
of the form of any such agreement by
the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds.
The Bonds shall first be offered for
purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by
them, shall be offered to the Treasury
Investment Account for purchase and,
if not purchased for that Account,
shall be sold to one or more firms that
have proposed to underwrite the
Bonds and have been selected by the
Director of Finance based on an evaluation of the qualifications of those
firms (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”).
The Bonds shall be awarded to the
Original Purchaser in the Certificate
of Award which shall specify the
final terms of the Bonds in accordance with law, the provisions of this
Ordinance, the written advice of a
financial advisor retained under
authority of Section 16 hereof and the
Original Purchaser’s offer to purchase the Bonds, including: the principal amount of the Bonds, the purchase price (which shall be not less
than 97% of the principal amount of
the Bonds plus any accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate or
rates, the amounts and years in which
principal installments are payable
(at stated maturity or pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements), the Interest Payment
Dates and the date of the Bonds and
any other matters required in this
Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. As appropriate under the
Charter, the Mayor, Director of
Finance, Director of Law, Clerk of
Council and other appropriate officers of the City are, and each of them
is, authorized to take such actions as
are necessary, appropriate and in the
best interest of the City to establish
the terms and requirements for delivery of the Bonds and to make such
arrangements as are necessary with
the Original Purchaser in order to
establish the date, location, procedures, and conditions for the delivery
of the Bonds to the Original Purchaser, to give all appropriate notices and
certificates, to cause a true transcript
of proceedings with reference to the
issuance of the Bonds to be delivered
to the Original Purchaser, to sign any
transcript
certificates,
financial
statements and other documents and
instruments and to take such actions
as are necessary or appropriate to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take
all steps necessary to effect the due
execution, authentication and delivery of the Bonds. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to sign
and deliver on behalf of the City a
bond purchase agreement between
the City and the Original Purchaser
(the “Bond Purchase Agreement”),
approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, setting forth
the terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell the Bonds and the
Original Purchaser agrees to buy the
Bonds, which shall be consistent with

The City Record
this Ordinance, not substantially
adverse to the City, and approved by
the Director of Finance and Director
of Law on behalf of the City, all of
which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of the Bond
Purchase Agreement by the Director
of Finance. It is determined that the
terms of the Bonds, as provided in this
Ordinance and as may be provided in
or pursuant to the Certificate of
Award, are in the best interest of the
City and in compliance with all legal
requirements.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B) of the
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds with
other bonds into a single consolidated
issue of bonds for purposes of their
sale as a single issue to be designated
“Various Purpose General Obligation
Bonds, Series 2011” or such other designation as may be set forth in the
Certificate of Award. Such bonds
shall contain a summary statement of
purposes encompassing the purpose
for which the Bonds are issued and
shall state that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax.
For the purpose of providing the
necessary funds to pay the interest on
the Bonds promptly when and as the
same falls due, and also to provide for
the discharge of the Bonds at maturity, there shall be and is levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes, a direct
tax annually during the period the
Bonds are outstanding, in an amount
sufficient to provide for the payment
of that interest, when and as the same
shall fall due, and also to discharge
the principal of the Bonds at maturity, which tax shall not be less than
the interest and sinking fund tax
required by Section 11 of Article XII
of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is ordered computed, certified, levied and extended
upon the tax duplicate and collected
by the same officers, in the same manner and at the same time that taxes
for general purposes for each of those
years are certified, extended and collected. The tax shall be placed before
and in preference to all other items
and for the full amount thereof. The
funds derived from those tax levies
shall be placed in the Unvoted Tax
Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund as required by the General Bond Ordinance, and those funds,
together with the interest collected on
them, shall be irrevocably pledged for
the payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds when and as the
same fall due; provided, however,
that, subject to the provisions of Section 8 of the General Bond Ordinance,
in each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the Bonds
and are appropriated for such purpose, the amount of such tax shall be
reduced by the amount of such revenues so available and appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections  133.25(B)(1) and 5705.51 of
the Ohio Revised Code, and in accordance with the provisions of and to
the extent required or permitted by
the General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt charges
for the Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest

237

19
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended and applied for the objects
and purposes for which the Bonds are
issued. The proceeds of the Bonds to
be applied to pay costs of any Credit
Support Instruments obtained pursuant to Section 15 hereof shall be
paid to the provider or providers of
those Credit Support Instruments.
The proceeds of the Bonds to be used
to pay costs of issuing the Bonds shall
be deposited with the Registrar in a
separate account under the Registrar
Agreement pending their application
to the payment of such costs. Pursuant to Chapter 133 of the Ohio
Revised Code and this Ordinance, and
notwithstanding Chapter 179 of the
Codified Ordinances, any accrued
interest and any premium received
from the sale of the Bonds shall be
deposited in the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund to be applied to the payment of the principal of and interest
on the Bonds.
Section 7. General Obligation.
The Bonds are secured by a pledge
and lien on a parity with the pledges
and liens authorized by the General
Bond Ordinance and, in addition to
the taxes and revenues specifically
pledged pursuant to this Ordinance
and the General Bond Ordinance and
the other covenants, terms and agreements provided hereunder and in the
General Bond Ordinance to secure
payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds, the City hereby
determines, declares, warrants and
covenants that the Bonds are general
obligations of the City and that the
full faith and credit of the City are
hereby pledged for the payment of the
principal of and interest on the Bonds
in accordance with the laws and Constitution of the State of Ohio, this
Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid and
discharged all the outstanding Bonds,
or there shall otherwise be paid to the
holders of the outstanding Bonds all
debt charges due or to become due
thereon, and provision shall also be
made for paying all other sums
payable hereunder, then and in that
event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of
further effect, and the covenants,
agreements and other obligations of
the City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the request
of the City execute and deliver to the
City such instruments in writing as
shall discharge the lien hereof and
enter on the record such discharge of
the lien and such other instruments as
may be reasonably required by the
City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if:
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or subaccounts, in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold in
special accounts or subaccounts, in
trust for and irrevocably committed
solely thereto, direct obligations of
the United States certified by an independent public accounting firm of
national reputation to be of such
maturities and interest payment
dates and to bear such interest, without further investment or reinvest-

20
ment of either the principal amount
thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held in trust and
committed, except as hereinafter provided), as will be sufficient, together
with moneys referred to in (i) above,
for the payment, at their maturities or
redemption dates, of all debt charges
on the Bonds to their date of maturity
or redemption, as the case may be, or
if default in such payment shall have
occurred on such date then to the date
of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds are to be
redeemed prior to the maturity thereof, notice of such redemption shall
have been duly given or irrevocable
provision satisfactory to the Trustee
shall have been duly made for the giving of such notice. Any moneys held
by the Escrow Agent in accordance
with the provisions of this Section
shall be invested by the Escrow
Agent in direct obligations of the
United States of America maturing, or
redeemable at the option of the holder, at times and in amounts sufficient
to meet payment of debt charges on
the Bonds, as directed by the Director
of Finance. Any income or interest
earned by, or increment to, the investments held under this Section shall, to
the extent determined from time to
time by the Escrow Agent to be in
excess of the amount required to be
held by it for the purposes of this Section, be transferred at the time of
such determination as provided in
Section  17(a) of the General Bond
Ordinance for unclaimed funds held
by a Paying Agent. In the event of
nonpresentment of any Bond as
described in Section 17(a) of the General Bond Ordinance, the moneys held
pursuant to this Section shall be held
and paid as provided in said Section  17(a) for unclaimed funds held
by a Paying Agent.
Section 9. Bond Anticipation Notes.
For the purpose of raising money in
anticipation of the issuance of the
Bonds for the purpose set forth in Section 1 hereof, notes of the City may be
issued in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed Two Million
Ninety-Five
Thousand
Dollars
($2,095,000) (the “Notes”) upon the
direction of the Director of Finance to
be set forth in a certificate providing
for the final terms of the Notes and
the sale of the Notes and signed by the
Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate of Award”).
(a) Terms of the Notes. The Notes
shall bear interest at such rate, not
exceeding seven percent (7%) per
year, as may be fixed by the Director
of Finance of the City in the Note Certificate of Award; shall be dated their
date of issuance; shall mature on the
date set forth in the Note Certificate
of Award, which shall be no later than
five years from such date of issuance;
shall be subject to redemption by the
City at any time prior to maturity
without penalty, provided that, if the
Director of Finance, based on the
advice of a financial advisor, determines that it is in the best interest of
the City in order to enhance the marketability of the Notes, the Director of
Finance may cause the Notes to not be
redeemable for a period which ends
no later than the date which is two
years following the date of issuance
of the Notes; shall be designated
“Parks and Recreation Facilities
Improvement
Bond
Anticipation
Notes”; shall be issued in such numbers and denominations as may be
requested by the Note Purchaser
(hereinafter defined); and shall be
issued in fully registered form (which
may be in a book entry only system)

The City Record
in denominations of $5,000 or integral
multiples thereof. Interest shall be
payable semiannually on the dates
set forth in the Note Certificate of
Award; provided that if the Notes
mature on or before the end of the
twelfth month following their date of
issuance, interest on the Notes shall
be payable at maturity.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating
agent, registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Notes (the “Note
Registrar”). The Escrow Agent also
shall act as paying agent for the
Notes if the Notes are held in a book
entry system. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, an agreement among the City, the Note Registrar and the Escrow Agent (the “Note
Registrar Agreement”) providing for
services relating to the registration,
transfer, exchange and payment of
Notes on terms that are approved by
the Director of Finance on behalf of
the City. That approval shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the Note Registrar Agreement by the
Director of Finance. The Director of
Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and for
reimbursement of expenses incurred
pursuant to the Note Registrar Agreement from the proceeds of the Notes to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Notes remain
outstanding, the City will cause the
Note Registrar to maintain and keep
at its principal corporate trust office
all books and records necessary for
the registration, exchange and transfer of Notes as provided in this Section
(the “Note Register”). The person in
whose name a Note is registered on
the Note Register shall be regarded as
the absolute owner of that Note for all
purposes of this Ordinance. Payment
of or on account of the debt charges
on any Note shall be made only to or
upon the order of that person; neither
the City nor the Note Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid and
effectual to satisfy and discharge the
City’s liability upon the Note, including interest, to the extent of the
amount or amounts so paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for
Notes of any authorized denomination
upon presentation and surrender at
the principal corporate trust office of
the Note Registrar, together with a
request for exchange signed by the
registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Note Registrar. A Note
may be transferred only on the Note
Register upon presentation and surrender of the Note at the principal corporate trust office of the Note Registrar together with an assignment
signed by the registered owner or by
a person legally empowered to do so
in a form satisfactory to the Note Registrar. Upon exchange or transfer the
Note
Registrar
shall
complete,
authenticate and deliver a new Note
or Notes of any authorized denomination or denominations requested by
the owner equal in the aggregate to
the unmatured principal amount of
the Note surrendered and bearing
interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Note Registrar shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Notes only after the new

238

February 23, 2011
Notes are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Notes exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Note Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Notes
in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Note Registrar may make a charge
sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to the
exchange or transfer. The City or the
Note Registrar may require that those
charges, if any, be paid before the procedure is begun for the exchange or
transfer. All Notes issued and authenticated upon any exchange or transfer shall be valid obligations of the
City, evidencing the same debt, and
entitled to the same security and benefit under this Ordinance, as the Notes
surrendered upon that exchange or
transfer.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B) of the
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Notes with
other bond anticipation notes of the
City for purposes of their sale as a single issue to be designated “Various
Purpose General Obligation Bond
Anticipation Notes.” The Notes shall
contain a summary statement of purposes encompassing the purpose for
which the Notes are issued and shall
state that they are issued pursuant to
this Ordinance.
(b) Execution and Payment of the
Notes. The Notes shall express upon
their faces the purpose for which they
are issued and that they are issued
pursuant to this Ordinance. Each Note
shall be authenticated by the manual
signature of an authorized officer of
the Trustee (as defined therein). The
Notes shall be signed by the City’s
Mayor and by the City’s Director of
Finance, and, consistent with Section
133.27 of the Ohio Revised Code and
notwithstanding Section 177.02 of the
Codified Ordinances of the City,
either or both of those signatures may
be a facsimile. The Notes shall bear
the seal of the City, which seal may be
a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section 83 of the City’s Charter, the Director of Law shall prepare the Notes and
shall endorse thereon his approval of
the form and correctness thereof by
his manual or facsimile signature.
(c) Sale of the Notes. The Notes
shall first be offered for purchase to
the Trustees of the Sinking Fund and,
if not purchased by them, shall be
offered to the Treasury Investment
Account for purchase and, if not purchased for that Account, shall be sold
to one or more firms that have proposed to underwrite the Notes and
have been selected by the Director of
Finance based on an evaluation of the
qualifications of those firms (the
“Note Purchaser”) in the principal
amount set forth in a certificate of
award to be executed by the Director
of Finance (the  “Note Certificate of
Award”) at not less than par and
accrued interest and at a rate not
exceeding that set forth in Section 10
hereof. The proceeds of such sale
shall be paid into the proper fund and
used for the purpose for which the
Notes are being issued under the provisions of this Ordinance.
(d) Security for the Notes. The
Notes shall be the full general obligations of the City, and the full faith,
credit and revenue of the City are
hereby pledged for the prompt payment of the same. The par value to be
received from the sale of the Notes
and any excess funds resulting from
the issuance of the Notes shall, to the

February 23, 2011
extent necessary, be used for the
retirement of the Notes at maturity,
together with the interest thereon,
and are hereby pledged for such purpose.
Section 10. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax.
During the year or years while the
Notes are outstanding there shall be
levied on all the taxable property in
the City, in addition to all other taxes
but within tax limitations, a direct
tax annually not less than that which
would have been levied if bonds had
been issued therefor without the prior
issue of the Notes. That tax shall be
and is ordered computed, certified,
levied and extended upon the tax
duplicate and collected by the same
officers, in the same manner and at
the same time that taxes for general
purposes for each year are certified,
extended and collected. That tax
shall be placed before and in preference to all other items and for the full
amount thereof. The funds derived
from the tax levies required by this
Ordinance shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account, and those funds, together
with the interest collected on them,
shall be irrevocably pledged for the
payment of the principal and interest
of the Notes or the Bonds in anticipation of which they are issued, when
and as the same falls due; provided,
however, that in each year to the
extent that revenues are available
from other sources for the payment of
the Notes and Bonds and are appropriated for such purpose, the amount of
such direct tax upon all of the taxable
property in the City may be reduced
by the amount of such revenues so
available and appropriated.
Section 11. Official Statement; Continuing Disclosure.
If, in the judgment of the Director
of Finance, a disclosure document
(each, an “Official Statement”) is
appropriate or necessary in connection with the sale of the Notes or the
Bonds, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare or cause to be
prepared on behalf of the City an Official Statement with respect to the
Notes or the Bonds, as the case may
be, and any necessary supplements
and to authorize the use and distribution of each Official Statement and
any supplements. The Director of
Finance is authorized to sign on
behalf of the City and in her official
capacity each Official Statement and
any supplements approved by her.
The Director of Finance is authorized
to sign and deliver on behalf of the
City and in her official capacity such
certificates in connection with the
accuracy of each Official Statement
and any supplements as may, in the
judgment of the Director of Finance,
be necessary or appropriate. The
Director of Finance is also authorized
to determine and certify on behalf of
the City that such disclosure document is “deemed final” by the City
within the meaning of Securities and
Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12
(the “SEC Rule”). The Director of
Finance is authorized to contract for
services for the production and distribution of preliminary and final Official Statements, including by printed
and electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time of
the Notes or the Bonds, the City
agrees, in accordance with, and as the
only obligated person with respect to
the Notes and the Bonds under the
SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be
provided such financial information
and operating data and notices, in

The City Record
such manner as may be required for
purposes of the SEC Rule. In order to
describe and specify certain terms of
the City’s continuing disclosure
agreement for that purpose, and
thereby to implement that agreement,
including provisions for enforcement,
amendment and termination, the
Director of Finance is authorized and
directed to prepare, or cause to be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of the City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the
continuing
disclosure
agreement
made by the City for the benefit of the
holders and beneficial owners of the
Notes or the Bonds, as the case may
be, in accordance with the SEC Rule.
The performance of that agreement
shall be subject to the availability of
funds and their annual appropriation
to meet costs the City would be
required to incur to perform it. The
Director of Finance is further authorized and directed to establish procedures in order to ensure compliance
by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely
provision of information and notices.
Section 12. Miscellaneous.
(a) Any provisions of the Codified
Ordinances of the City that are inconsistent with the provisions of this
Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance shall not apply to the Bonds or
the Notes authorized herein.
(b) All covenants, terms and provisions of the General Bond Ordinance
are fully applicable to the Bonds and
the Notes authorized herein, and nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed
to alter or restrict such full application of the General Bond Ordinance,
except for the exclusion from application to the Bonds and the Notes authorized herein of the provisions of the
third paragraph of Section 13(a) and
the third paragraph of Section 4 of the
General Bond Ordinance, pursuant to
Section 2 hereof.
Section 13. Captions.
The captions or headings in this
Ordinance are for convenience only
and in no way define, limit or describe
the scope or intent of any provisions
or sections of this Ordinance.
Section 14. Federal Tax Covenants.
The City covenants that it will use,
and will restrict the use and investment of, the proceeds of the Notes and
the Bonds in such manner and to such
extent as may be necessary so that
(a) the Notes and the Bonds will not
(i) constitute private activity bonds,
arbitrage bonds or hedge bonds under
Sections 141, 148 or 149 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the “Code”) or (ii) be treated other
than as bonds to which Section 103(a)
of the Code applies, and (b) the interest thereon will not be treated as an
item of tax preference under Section 57 of the Code.
The City further covenants that (a)
it will take or cause to be taken such
actions that may be required of it for
the interest on the Notes and the
Bonds to be and to remain excluded
from gross income for federal income
tax purposes, (b) it will not take or
authorize to be taken any actions that
would adversely affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting for
it, will, among other acts of compliance, (i) apply the proceeds of the
Notes and the Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing, (ii)
restrict the yield on investment property acquired with those proceeds,
(iii) make timely and adequate payments to the federal government, (iv)
maintain books and records and make
calculations and reports, and (v)

239

21
refrain from certain uses of those proceeds, and, as applicable, of property
financed with such proceeds, all in
such manner and to the extent necessary to assure such exclusion of that
interest under the Code.
Each covenant made in this Section
with respect to the Notes and the
Bonds is also made with respect to all
issues any portion of the debt service
on which is paid from proceeds of the
Notes or the Bonds (and, if different,
the original issue and any refunding
issues in a series of refundings), to
the extent such compliance is necessary to assure exclusion of interest on
the Notes and the Bonds from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, and the officers identified above
are authorized to take actions with
respect to those issues as they are
authorized in this Section to take with
respect to the Notes and the Bonds.
The Director of Finance, as the fiscal officer, or any other officer of the
City
having
responsibility
for
issuance of the Notes and the Bonds is
hereby authorized (a) to make or
effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or
waiver on behalf of the City with
respect to the Notes and the Bonds as
the City is permitted or required to
make or give under the federal
income tax laws, including, without
limitation thereto, any of the elections
provided
for
in
Section  148(f)(4)(C) of the Code or
available under Section  148 of the
Code, for the purpose of assuring,
enhancing or protecting favorable
tax treatment or status of the Notes
and the Bonds or interest thereon or
assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose, reducing the
burden or expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or
payments or penalties, or making
payments of special amounts in lieu
of making computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as
rebate, or obviating those amounts or
payments, as determined by that officer, which action shall be in writing
and signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf of
the City, as may be appropriate to
assure the exclusion of interest from
gross income and the intended tax
status of the Notes and the Bonds, and
(c) to give one or more appropriate
certificates of the City, for inclusion
in the transcript of proceedings for
the Notes and the Bonds, setting forth
the reasonable expectations of the
City regarding the amount and use of
all the proceeds of the Notes and the
Bonds, the facts, circumstances and
estimates on which they are based,
and other facts and circumstances relevant to the tax treatment of the
interest on and the tax status of the
Notes and the Bonds.
Section 15. Credit Enhancement and
Ratings.
If, in the judgment of the Director
of Finance, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, the filing of an application for a rating on
the Bonds or designated portion
thereof by one or more nationally recognized rating agencies is in the best
interest of the City, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare and
submit those applications and to provide to each such agency such information as may be required for the purpose. The Director of Finance is
authorized to contract for one or more
Credit Support Instruments for the
Bonds or designated portions thereof

22
if the Director determines, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, that the Credit Support
Instruments will result in debt service savings to the City. As used in
this Section,
“Credit
Support
Instrument” means an insurance policy, surety, letter of credit, or other
instrument used to enhance or provide for the security of Bonds. The
cost of obtaining each rating and the
cost of obtaining each Credit Support
Instrument, except to the extent paid
by the Original Purchasers in accordance with the Bond Purchase Agreement, shall be paid from the proceeds
of Bonds or funds appropriated for
that purpose.
Section 16. Financial Advisor.
The Director of Finance may obtain
the services of one or more financial
advisors, from time to time, to assist
the Director of Finance in making
any of the determinations required by
this Ordinance to be determined by
the Director of Finance. The Director
of Finance may rely on the written
advice of any financial advisor so
retained. Any financial advisor
employed under the authority of this
Ordinance shall be disinterested in
the transaction and be independent of
the Original Purchasers and any

Ord. No. 130-11.
By Council Member Sweeney (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the issuance and sale of bonds in
the maximum principal amount of
$15,155,000 for the purpose of providing funds to improve the municipal
street system and related facilities
and authorizing related matters.
Whereas, this Council desires to

amount not to exceed Fifteen Million
One Hundred Fifty-Five Thousand
Dollars ($15,155,000) (the “Bonds”) to
finance the costs of certain permanent improvements described in Section  1 of this ordinance (this “Ordinance”); and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of this City, has previously certified to this Council that
the estimated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be financed with the
proceeds of the Bonds is at least five
years and that the maximum maturity of the Bonds is 18  years, as evidenced by the Certificate contained in

passed May 6, 1983, and Ordinance No.
944-96, passed June 10, 1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so amended and
as the same may further be amended
from time to time in accordance with
its provisions, is referred to as the
“General Bond Ordinance”), providing the general terms and provisions
for the issuance of unvoted general
obligations of the City, with the specific terms of each series of Bonds to
be contained in ordinances authorizing the issuance of Bonds in accordance with the provisions thereof
(the “Series Bond Ordinances”); and
Whereas, the authorization for
issuance of the Bonds is necessary to
provide funds to pay the costs of certain
permanent
improvements
described in Section 1 hereof that are
urgently needed for the benefit of the
City, and as a result, this Ordinance
constitutes an emergency measure
providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health and safety, and for the usual
daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose.
It is deemed necessary to issue the
Bonds in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed Fifteen Million
One Hundred Fifty-Five Thousand
Dollars ($15,155,000) for the purpose
of providing funds to improve the
municipal street system and related
facilities, including streets, expressways, roadways, driveways, underground vaults, sidewalks, bikeways
and walkways, by acquiring, constructing, reconstructing, opening,
extending, widening, grading, draining, paving, resurfacing, lighting and
curbing, removing or reconstructing
underground vaults to preserve the
public right of way, installing gutters, sidewalks and related pedestrian improvements, constructing and
improving culverts, resetting and
constructing catch basins and other
storm drainage facilities, constructing, reconstructing, replacing, renovating and rehabilitating bridges,
acquiring any real estate and interests in real estate, including easements, necessary for such purpose,
and installing signs, signals, markings and other devices for traffic control purposes, together with all necessary and incidental appurtenances,
and to pay any capitalized interest
and all expenses incurred in connection with the issuance of the securities, including all financing costs
within
the
meaning
of
Section  133.01(K) of the Ohio Revised
Code and such other costs of the foregoing permanent improvements that
may be financed with the proceeds of
securities as permitted by Section  133.15(B) of the Ohio Revised
Code and as otherwise permitted by
law.
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Chapter 133
of the Ohio Revised Code and other
applicable provisions of the Ohio
Revised Code, the Charter of the City,
the General Bond Ordinance and this
Ordinance for the purpose stated in
Section 1 hereof. The Bonds shall be
designated “Bridges and Roadways
Improvement Bonds” and may contain such further designation as provided in the certificate of award providing for the final terms of the Bonds
and the sale of the Bonds signed by
the Director of Finance in accordance

February 23, 2011
with this Ordinance (the “Certificate
of Award”). The Bonds shall be issued
in one lot as fully registered Bonds in
denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. The Bonds
shall be numbered as determined by
the Director of Finance.
The Bonds shall be issued in the
principal amount specified in the Certificate of Award, which shall not
exceed the amount stated in Section 1
hereof. The Bonds shall be dated the
date and shall bear interest from their
date until the principal amount is
paid at the rate or rates per year specified in the Certificate of Award, provided that the weighted average of
such rates (taking into account the
principal amount and maturity of
each Bond to which a rate applies)
shall not exceed seven percent (7%)
per year. Interest on the Bonds shall
be payable when due, or until the
principal amount is paid, semiannually as specified in the Certificate of
Award as the dates on which interest
on the Bonds shall be payable (the
“Interest Payment Dates”), beginning
on the date specified in the Certificate
of Award as the first Interest Payment Date.
The Bonds shall mature in the
years and principal amounts as shall
be permitted by law and determined
by the Director of Finance and specified in the Certificate of Award, based
on the written advice of a Financial
Advisor to be in the best interests of
the City, provided that (i) each principal payment shall occur on an Interest Payment Date, (ii) the first principal payment on the Bonds shall be
no earlier than November 15, 2011 and
no later than December 31, 2013, (iii)
the final maturity date of the Bonds
shall be no later than 18 years from
that date which is 12 months prior to
the first date on which provision for
payment of principal is made, and
(iv) the principal amount thereof
shall be payable in annual installments such that the total principal
and interest payments on the Bonds
in any fiscal year in which principal
is payable is not more than three
times the amount of those payments
in any other fiscal year.
The Bonds stated to mature in any
year may be issued as term bonds (the
“Term Bonds”), payable pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements as defined and further
described below. The Director of
Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award whether any of the
Bonds shall be issued as Term Bonds,
any dates (the “Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable pursuant to mandatory sinking fund installments rather than at
stated maturity and the amount of
principal to be paid on each Mandatory Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption or purchase prior to stated maturity as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory
sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100%
of the principal amount redeemed,
plus interest accrued to the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to be
deposited with the Escrow Agent, currently The Huntington National

The City Record
Bank, for payment of principal of and
interest on any Term Bonds shall
include amounts sufficient to redeem
on the Mandatory Redemption Dates
the principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided
below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined in
Section  3 hereof) for cancellation
Term Bonds in any aggregate principal amount and to receive a credit
against the then-current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City for
any Term Bonds. That option shall be
exercised by the City on or before the
forty-fifth day preceding the applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, by
furnishing the Escrow Agent a certificate, signed by the Registrar, setting forth the extent of the credit to
be applied with respect to the thencurrent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement. If the certificate is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the thencurrent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding
mandatory
redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds that
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and cancelled
by the Registrar, to the extent not
applied theretofore as a credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and cancelled, shall be credited by the
Escrow Agent at 100% of the principal amount thereof against the thencurrent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding
mandatory
redemption
obligation). Any excess of that
amount over the then-current Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirement
shall
be
credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligations) in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(b) Optional Redemption. The
Bonds may be subject to redemption
prior to maturity by and at the option
of the City, in whole or in part on any
date, in integral multiples of $5,000,
on the optional redemption dates and
at the redemption prices (expressed
as a percentage of the principal
amount redeemed) specified in the
Certificate of Award, plus, in each
case, accrued interest to the redemption date. The first optional redemption date shall not be later than ten
years from the first Interest Payment
Date, and the highest redemption
price shall not be greater than 102%
of the principal amount redeemed
plus accrued interest to the redemption date. Based on the written advice
of a financial advisor, the Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that it is in the best
interests of the City for some or all of
the Bonds not to be callable prior to
their stated maturity.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take

241

23
place as of any applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, the Bonds, or portions thereof, to be redeemed optionally shall be selected by lot prior to
the selection by lot of the Bonds to be
redeemed on the same date by operation of the Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds shall be
redeemed pursuant to this paragraph
only upon written notice from the
Director of Finance to the Registrar.
That notice shall specify the redemption date and the principal amount of
each maturity of Bonds to be
redeemed, and shall be given at least
45 days prior to the redemption date
or such shorter period as shall be
acceptable to the Registrar. There
shall be deposited with the Registrar
on or prior to the redemption date
funds sufficient to redeem at the
redemption
price
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice of
redemption has been given.
(c) Purchase in Lieu of Redemption. If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the City may
elect to purchase Bonds called for
optional redemption in lieu of redeeming those Bonds. That election shall
be exercised by written direction
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar and the Escrow Agent.
That written direction shall state
whether all or less than all of the
Bonds called for optional redemption
are to be purchased by the City in lieu
of redemption, shall identify the
Bonds to be purchased by their maturity date and shall specify the principal amount of each maturity to be purchased in lieu of redemption. If less
than all of the Bonds called for optional redemption are to be purchased in
lieu of redemption, the amount of
each maturity to be purchased shall
be in amounts of $5,000 or integral
multiples of $5,000. Any Bonds called
for optional redemption that are not
to be purchased shall be redeemed in
accordance with their redemption provisions. The purchase price of the
Bonds to be purchased in lieu of
redemption shall be equal to the principal of, any accrued but unpaid interest on, and any premium that would
have been payable on the Bonds on
the redemption date if the Bonds had
been optionally redeemed instead of
being purchased. No notice of the purchase in lieu of redemption is
required to be given to the owners of
the Bonds in addition to the notice of
redemption required by this Ordinance. The Escrow Agent or Registrar, as paying agent, shall not purchase Bonds if sufficient moneys
have not been deposited with the
Escrow Agent or Registrar, as paying
agent, by the City for the purpose. On
or prior to the scheduled date for
optional redemption, the City may
rescind its direction to purchase the
Bonds in lieu of redemption by written notice from the Director of
Finance to the Registrar and the
Escrow Agent. In the event that the
direction to purchase is rescinded, the
Bonds shall be redeemed on the
redemption date set forth in the notice
of redemption delivered to the owners
of the Bonds and in accordance with
the provisions of this Ordinance.
(d) Partial Redemption or Purchase. If fewer than all of the outstanding Bonds are called for redemption at one time (whether for redemption or purchase in lieu of redemption), they shall be called in the order
of maturities directed by the Director
of Finance. If fewer than all Bonds of
a single maturity are to be redeemed
or purchased in lieu of redemption,

24
the selection of Bonds to be redeemed
or purchased, or portions thereof in
amounts of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof, shall be made by the
Registrar by lot in a manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of
a partial redemption or purchase of
Bonds by lot when Bonds of denominations greater than $5,000 are then
outstanding, each $5,000 unit of principal thereof shall be treated as
though it were a separate Bond of the
denomination of $5,000. If it is determined that one or more, but not all of
the $5,000 units of principal amount
represented by a Bond are to be called
for redemption, then upon notice of
redemption of a $5,000 unit or units,
the registered owner of that Bond
shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i) for payment of the redemption
or purchase price of the $5,000 unit or
units called for redemption (including, without limitation, the interest
accrued to the date fixed for redemption and any premium), and (ii) for
issuance, without charge to the registered owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured portion of the Bond not
redeemed or purchased and bearing
interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date as the Bond surrendered.
(e) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii) the
redemption price to be paid, (iii) the
date fixed for redemption, and (iv)
the place or places where the amounts
due upon redemption are payable.
The notice shall be given by the Registrar on behalf of the City by mailing
a copy of the redemption notice by
first-class mail, postage prepaid, at
least 30 days prior to the date fixed
for redemption (or such period specified in the Certificate of Award), to
the registered owner of each Bond
subject to redemption in whole or in
part at the registered owner’s address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close of
business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing and to any provider
of a Credit Support Instrument (as
defined in Section 15 hereof) for the
Bonds or designated portions thereof.
Failure to receive notice by mail or
any defect in that notice regarding
any Bond, however, shall not affect
the validity of the proceedings for the
redemption of any Bond. Any notice
of redemption of any Bonds may specify that the redemption is contingent
on the deposit of moneys with the
Escrow Agent or Registrar, as paying
agent, on or prior to the redemption
date in an amount sufficient to pay
the redemption price of the Bonds to
be redeemed.
(f) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the manner provided in the preceding paragraph, and moneys having been
deposited by the City with the Escrow
Agent or Registrar, as paying agent,
in an amount sufficient to pay the
redemption price, the Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption
shall become due and payable on the
redemption date, and, upon presentation and surrender at the place or
places specified in that notice, shall
be paid. If money for the redemption
of all of the Bonds and portions thereof to be redeemed, including interest
accrued to the redemption date, is
held by the Registrar on the redemp-

The City Record
tion date, and, if notice of redemption
has been deposited in the mail, then
from and after the redemption date
those Bonds and portions thereof
called for redemption shall cease to
bear interest and no longer shall be
considered to be outstanding. If that
money shall not be so available on the
redemption date, or that notice shall
not have been deposited in the mail,
those Bonds and portions thereof
shall continue to bear interest, until
they are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money held
by the Registrar for the redemption of
particular Bonds shall be held in trust
for the account of the registered owners and shall be paid to them, respectively, upon presentation and surrender of those Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without
deduction for the services of the Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent. Principal shall be payable
when due upon presentation and surrender of the Bonds at the principal
corporate trust office of the Registrar. Interest on a Bond shall be paid
on each Interest Payment Date by
check or draft mailed to the person in
whose name the Bond was registered,
and to that person’s address appearing, on the Bond Register (as defined
in Section  3 hereof) at the close of
business on the date provided in the
Registrar Agreement authorized and
defined in Section  3 hereof (the
“Record Date”). Notwithstanding any
contrary provision in the General
Bond Ordinance, so long as the Bonds
are held by a Depository in a book
entry system (as described in Section  3 hereof), debt charges on the
Bonds will be payable in lawful
money of the United States by wire
transfer to the Depository made by
the Escrow Agent on each Interest
Payment Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance. The General Bond Ordinance, except for the third paragraph
of Section 13(a) (pertaining generally to an adjustment of the interest
rate in an event of default) and the
third paragraph of Section 4 (pertaining generally to the periods during
which the City is not required to make
any transfers or exchanges of bonds
issued under the General Bond Ordinance), will apply to the Bonds.
Except for those provisions, the General Bond Ordinance is included as a
part of this Ordinance as fully as if
restated in this Ordinance. Words and
terms not otherwise defined in this
Ordinance shall have the same meaning as set forth in the General Bond
Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of the
Bonds; Paying Agents.
The Bonds shall express upon their
faces the purpose for which they are
issued and that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to
Section  4 of the General Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be authenticated by the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee (as
defined therein). The Bonds shall be
signed by the City’s Mayor and by the
City’s Director of Finance, and, consistent with Section 133.27 of the Ohio
Revised Code and notwithstanding
Section  177.02 of the Codified Ordinances of the City, either or both of
those signatures may be a facsimile.
The Bonds shall bear the seal of the
City, which seal may be a facsimile

242

February 23, 2011
seal. Pursuant to Section  83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
shall prepare the Bonds and shall
endorse thereon his approval of the
form and correctness thereof by his
manual or facsimile signature.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating
agent, bond registrar, transfer agent
and paying agent for the Bonds (the
“Registrar”). The Registrar shall also
act as paying agent for the Bonds so
long as the Bonds are held in a book
entry system. The Director of Finance
is authorized to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City, an
agreement between the City and the
Registrar (the “Registrar Agreement”), approved as to form and correctness by the Director of Law, providing for services relating to the registration, transfer, exchange and payment of the Bonds on terms approved
by the Director of Finance on behalf
of the City and consistent with this
Ordinance and not substantially
adverse to the City. That approval
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Registrar Agreement by the Director of Finance. The
Director of Finance shall provide for
the payment of the services rendered
and for reimbursement of expenses
incurred pursuant to the Registrar
Agreement from the proceeds of the
Bonds to the extent available and
then from other money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds remain
outstanding, the City will cause the
Registrar to maintain and keep at its
principal corporate trust office all
books and records necessary for the
registration, exchange and transfer
of Bonds as provided in this Section
(the “Bond Register”). The person in
whose name a Bond is registered on
the Bond Register shall be regarded
as the absolute owner of that Bond for
all purposes of this Ordinance. Payment of or on account of the debt
charges on any Bond shall be made
only to or upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar
shall be affected by any notice to the
contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid and
effectual to satisfy and discharge the
City’s liability upon the Bond, including interest, to the extent of the
amount or amounts so paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender
at the principal corporate trust office
of the Registrar, together with a
request for exchange signed by the
registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. A Bond may
be transferred only on the Bond Register upon presentation and surrender
of the Bond at the principal corporate
trust office of the Registrar together
with an assignment signed by the registered owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner equal
in the aggregate to the unmatured
principal amount of the Bond surrendered and bearing interest at the
same rate and maturing on the same
date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new

February 23, 2011
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any tax or
other governmental charge required
to be paid with respect to the
exchange or transfer. The City or the
Registrar may require that those
charges, if any, be paid before the procedure is begun for the exchange or
transfer. All Bonds issued and
authenticated upon any exchange or
transfer shall be valid obligations of
the City, evidencing the same debt,
and entitled to the same security and
benefit under this Ordinance, as the
Bonds
surrendered
upon
that
exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds and the principal of and interest on the Bonds may
be transferred only through a book
entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are
issued by the City only to a Depository or its nominee as registered owner,
with the Bonds “immobilized” in the
custody of the Depository. The book
entry maintained by others than the
City is the record that identifies the
owners of beneficial interests in those
Bonds and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited
purpose trust company), New York,
New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers,
banks and trust companies, and clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized: (i) the Bonds
may be issued in the form of a single,
fully registered Bond representing
each maturity and registered in the
name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository;
(ii) the beneficial owners in book
entry form shall have no right to
receive Bonds in the form of physical
securities or certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book
entry form shall be shown by book
entry on the system maintained and
operated by the Depository and its
Participants, and transfers of the
ownership of beneficial interests
shall be made only by book entry by
the Depository and its Participants;
and (iv) the Bonds as such shall not
be transferable or exchangeable,
except for transfer to another Depository or to another nominee of a Depos-

The City Record
itory, without further action by the
City.
If any Depository determines not to
continue to act as a Depository for the
Bonds for use in a book entry system,
the Director of Finance may attempt
to
establish
a
securities
depository/book entry relationship
with another qualified Depository. If
the Director of Finance does not or is
unable to do so, the Registrar, after
making provision for notification of
the beneficial owners by the then
Depository and any other arrangements deemed necessary, shall permit
withdrawal of the Bonds from the
Depository, and the Trustee and Registrar shall authenticate and deliver
bond certificates in registered form to
the assigns of the Depository or its
nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to the
extent necessary or required to enter
into any agreements determined necessary in connection with the book
entry system for the Bonds, after
determining that the signing thereof
will not endanger the funds or securities of the City and after the approval
of the form of any such agreement by
the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds.
The Bonds shall first be offered for
purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by
them, shall be offered to the Treasury
Investment Account for purchase and,
if not purchased for that Account,
shall be sold to one or more firms that
have proposed to underwrite the
Bonds and have been selected by the
Director of Finance based on an evaluation of the qualifications of those
firms (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”).
The Bonds shall be awarded to the
Original Purchaser in the Certificate
of Award which shall specify the
final terms of the Bonds in accordance with law, the provisions of this
Ordinance, the written advice of a
financial advisor retained under
authority of Section 16 hereof and the
Original Purchaser’s offer to purchase the Bonds, including: the principal amount of the Bonds, the purchase price (which shall be not less
than 97% of the principal amount of
the Bonds plus any accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate or

principal installments are payable
(at stated maturity or pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements), the Interest Payment
Dates and the date of the Bonds and
any other matters required in this
Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. As appropriate under the
Charter, the Mayor, Director of
Finance, Director of Law, Clerk of
Council and other appropriate officers of the City are, and each of them
is, authorized to take such actions as
are necessary, appropriate and in the
best interest of the City to establish
the terms and requirements for delivery of the Bonds and to make such
arrangements as are necessary with
the Original Purchaser in order to
establish the date, location, procedures, and conditions for the delivery
of the Bonds to the Original Purchaser, to give all appropriate notices and
certificates, to cause a true transcript
of proceedings with reference to the
issuance of the Bonds to be delivered
to the Original Purchaser, to sign any

statements and other documents and
instruments and to take such actions
as are necessary or appropriate to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take
all steps necessary to effect the due
execution, authentication and delivery of the Bonds. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to sign
and deliver on behalf of the City a
bond purchase agreement between
the City and the Original Purchaser
(the “Bond Purchase Agreement”),
approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, setting forth
the terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell the Bonds and the
Original Purchaser agrees to buy the
Bonds, which shall be consistent with
this Ordinance, not substantially
adverse to the City, and approved by
the Director of Finance and Director
of Law on behalf of the City, all of
which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of the Bond
Purchase Agreement by the Director
of Finance. It is determined that the
terms of the Bonds, as provided in this
Ordinance and as may be provided in
or pursuant to the Certificate of
Award, are in the best interest of the
City and in compliance with all legal
requirements.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B) of the
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds with
other bonds into a single consolidated
issue of bonds for purposes of their
sale as a single issue to be designated
“Various Purpose General Obligation
Bonds, Series 2011” or such other designation as may be set forth in the
Certificate of Award. Such bonds
shall contain a summary statement of
purposes encompassing the purpose
for which the Bonds are issued and
shall state that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax.
For the purpose of providing the
necessary funds to pay the interest on
the Bonds promptly when and as the
same falls due, and also to provide for
the discharge of the Bonds at maturity, there shall be and is levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes, a direct
tax annually during the period the
Bonds are outstanding, in an amount
sufficient to provide for the payment
of that interest, when and as the same
shall fall due, and also to discharge
the principal of the Bonds at maturity, which tax shall not be less than
the interest and sinking fund tax
required by Section 11 of Article XII
of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is ordered computed, certified, levied and extended
upon the tax duplicate and collected
by the same officers, in the same manner and at the same time that taxes
for general purposes for each of those
years are certified, extended and collected. The tax shall be placed before
and in preference to all other items
and for the full amount thereof. The
funds derived from those tax levies
shall be placed in the Unvoted Tax
Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund as required by the General Bond Ordinance, and those funds,
together with the interest collected on
them, shall be irrevocably pledged for
the payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds when and as the
same fall due; provided, however,
that, subject to the provisions of Section 8 of the General Bond Ordinance,
in each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the Bonds
and are appropriated for such pur-

26
pose, the amount of such tax shall be
reduced by the amount of such revenues so available and appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections  133.25(B)(1) and 5705.51 of
the Ohio Revised Code, and in accordance with the provisions of and to
the extent required or permitted by
the General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt charges
for the Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended and applied for the objects
and purposes for which the Bonds are
issued. The proceeds of the Bonds to
be applied to pay costs of any Credit
Support Instruments obtained pursuant to Section 15 hereof shall be
paid to the provider or providers of
those Credit Support Instruments.
The proceeds of the Bonds to be used
to pay costs of issuing the Bonds shall
be deposited with the Registrar in a
separate account under the Registrar
Agreement pending their application
to the payment of such costs. Pursuant to Chapter 133 of the Ohio
Revised Code and this Ordinance, and
notwithstanding Chapter 179 of the
Codified Ordinances, any accrued
interest and any premium received
from the sale of the Bonds shall be
deposited in the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund to be applied to the payment of the principal of and interest
on the Bonds.
Section 7. General Obligation.
The Bonds are secured by a pledge
and lien on a parity with the pledges
and liens authorized by the General
Bond Ordinance and, in addition to
the taxes and revenues specifically
pledged pursuant to this Ordinance
and the General Bond Ordinance and
the other covenants, terms and agreements provided hereunder and in the
General Bond Ordinance to secure
payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds, the City hereby
determines, declares, warrants and
covenants that the Bonds are general
obligations of the City and that the
full faith and credit of the City are
hereby pledged for the payment of the
principal of and interest on the Bonds
in accordance with the laws and Constitution of the State of Ohio, this
Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid and
discharged all the outstanding Bonds,
or there shall otherwise be paid to the
holders of the outstanding Bonds all
debt charges due or to become due
thereon, and provision shall also be
made for paying all other sums
payable hereunder, then and in that
event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of
further effect, and the covenants,
agreements and other obligations of
the City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the request
of the City execute and deliver to the
City such instruments in writing as
shall discharge the lien hereof and
enter on the record such discharge of
the lien and such other instruments as
may be reasonably required by the
City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and dis-

The City Record
charged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if:
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or subaccounts, in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold in
special accounts or subaccounts, in
trust for and irrevocably committed
solely thereto, direct obligations of
the United States certified by an independent public accounting firm of
national reputation to be of such
maturities and interest payment
dates and to bear such interest, without further investment or reinvestment of either the principal amount
thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held in trust and
committed, except as hereinafter provided), as will be sufficient, together
with moneys referred to in (i) above,
for the payment, at their maturities or
redemption dates, of all debt charges
on the Bonds to their date of maturity
or redemption, as the case may be, or
if default in such payment shall have
occurred on such date then to the date
of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds are to be
redeemed prior to the maturity thereof, notice of such redemption shall
have been duly given or irrevocable
provision satisfactory to the Trustee
shall have been duly made for the giving of such notice. Any moneys held
by the Escrow Agent in accordance
with the provisions of this Section
shall be invested by the Escrow
Agent in direct obligations of the
United States of America maturing, or
redeemable at the option of the holder, at times and in amounts sufficient
to meet payment of debt charges on
the Bonds, as directed by the Director
of Finance. Any income or interest
earned by, or increment to, the investments held under this Section shall, to
the extent determined from time to
time by the Escrow Agent to be in
excess of the amount required to be
held by it for the purposes of this Section, be transferred at the time of
such determination as provided in
Section  17(a) of the General Bond
Ordinance for unclaimed funds held
by a Paying Agent. In the event of
nonpresentment of any Bond as
described in Section 17(a) of the General Bond Ordinance, the moneys held
pursuant to this Section shall be held
and paid as provided in said Section  17(a) for unclaimed funds held
by a Paying Agent.
Section 9. Bond Anticipation Notes.
For the purpose of raising money in
anticipation of the issuance of the
Bonds for the purpose set forth in Section 1 hereof, notes of the City may be
issued in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed Fifteen Million
One Hundred Fifty-Five Thousand
Dollars ($15,155,000) (the “Notes”)
upon the direction of the Director of
Finance to be set forth in a certificate
providing for the final terms of the
Notes and the sale of the Notes and
signed by the Director of Finance
(the “Note Certificate of Award”).
(a) Terms of the Notes. The Notes
shall bear interest at such rate, not
exceeding seven percent (7%) per
year, as may be fixed by the Director
of Finance of the City in the Note Certificate of Award; shall be dated their
date of issuance; shall mature on the
date set forth in the Note Certificate
of Award, which shall be no later than
five years from such date of issuance;
shall be subject to redemption by the
City at any time prior to maturity
without penalty, provided that, if the

244

February 23, 2011
Director of Finance, based on the
advice of a financial advisor, determines that it is in the best interest of
the City in order to enhance the marketability of the Notes, the Director of
Finance may cause the Notes to not be
redeemable for a period which ends
no later than the date which is two
years following the date of issuance
of the Notes; shall be designated
“Bridges and Roadways Improvement
Bond Anticipation Notes”; shall be
issued in such numbers and denominations as may be requested by the
Note Purchaser (hereinafter defined);
and shall be issued in fully registered
form (which may be in a book entry
only system) in denominations of
$5,000 or integral multiples thereof.
Interest shall be payable semiannually on the dates set forth in the Note
Certificate of Award; provided that if
the Notes mature on or before the end
of the twelfth month following their
date of issuance, interest on the Notes
shall be payable at maturity.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating
agent, registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Notes (the “Note
Registrar”). The Escrow Agent also
shall act as paying agent for the
Notes if the Notes are held in a book
entry system. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, an agreement among the City, the Note Registrar and the Escrow Agent (the “Note
Registrar Agreement”) providing for
services relating to the registration,
transfer, exchange and payment of
Notes on terms that are approved by
the Director of Finance on behalf of
the City. That approval shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the Note Registrar Agreement by the
Director of Finance. The Director of
Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and for
reimbursement of expenses incurred
pursuant to the Note Registrar Agreement from the proceeds of the Notes to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Notes remain
outstanding, the City will cause the
Note Registrar to maintain and keep
at its principal corporate trust office
all books and records necessary for
the registration, exchange and transfer of Notes as provided in this Section
(the “Note Register”). The person in
whose name a Note is registered on
the Note Register shall be regarded as
the absolute owner of that Note for all
purposes of this Ordinance. Payment
of or on account of the debt charges
on any Note shall be made only to or
upon the order of that person; neither
the City nor the Note Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid and
effectual to satisfy and discharge the
City’s liability upon the Note, including interest, to the extent of the
amount or amounts so paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for
Notes of any authorized denomination
upon presentation and surrender at
the principal corporate trust office of
the Note Registrar, together with a
request for exchange signed by the
registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Note Registrar. A Note
may be transferred only on the Note
Register upon presentation and surrender of the Note at the principal corporate trust office of the Note Registrar together with an assignment

February 23, 2011
signed by the registered owner or by
a person legally empowered to do so
in a form satisfactory to the Note Registrar. Upon exchange or transfer the
Note
Registrar
shall
complete,
authenticate and deliver a new Note
or Notes of any authorized denomination or denominations requested by
the owner equal in the aggregate to
the unmatured principal amount of
the Note surrendered and bearing
interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Note Registrar shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Notes only after the new
Notes are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Notes exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Note Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Notes
in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Note Registrar may make a charge
sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to the
exchange or transfer. The City or the
Note Registrar may require that those
charges, if any, be paid before the procedure is begun for the exchange or
transfer. All Notes issued and authenticated upon any exchange or transfer shall be valid obligations of the
City, evidencing the same debt, and
entitled to the same security and benefit under this Ordinance, as the Notes
surrendered upon that exchange or
transfer.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B) of the
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Notes with
other bond anticipation notes of the
City for purposes of their sale as a single issue to be designated “Various
Purpose General Obligation Bond
Anticipation Notes.” The Notes shall
contain a summary statement of purposes encompassing the purpose for
which the Notes are issued and shall
state that they are issued pursuant to
this Ordinance.
(b) Execution and Payment of the
Notes. The Notes shall express upon
their faces the purpose for which they
are issued and that they are issued
pursuant to this Ordinance. Each Note
shall be authenticated by the manual
signature of an authorized officer of
the Trustee (as defined therein). The
Notes shall be signed by the City’s
Mayor and by the City’s Director of
Finance, and, consistent with Section
133.27 of the Ohio Revised Code and
notwithstanding Section 177.02 of the
Codified Ordinances of the City,
either or both of those signatures may
be a facsimile. The Notes shall bear
the seal of the City, which seal may be
a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section 83 of the City’s Charter, the Director of Law shall prepare the Notes and
shall endorse thereon his approval of
the form and correctness thereof by
his manual or facsimile signature.
(c) Sale of the Notes. The Notes
shall first be offered for purchase to
the Trustees of the Sinking Fund and,
if not purchased by them, shall be
offered to the Treasury Investment
Account for purchase and, if not purchased for that Account, shall be sold
to one or more firms that have proposed to underwrite the Notes and
have been selected by the Director of
Finance based on an evaluation of the
qualifications of those firms (the
“Note Purchaser”) in the principal
amount set forth in a certificate of
award to be executed by the Director
of Finance (the  “Note Certificate of

The City Record
Award”) at not less than par and
accrued interest and at a rate not
exceeding that set forth in Section 10
hereof. The proceeds of such sale
shall be paid into the proper fund and
used for the purpose for which the
Notes are being issued under the provisions of this Ordinance.
(d) Security for the Notes. The
Notes shall be the full general obligations of the City, and the full faith,
credit and revenue of the City are
hereby pledged for the prompt payment of the same. The par value to be
received from the sale of the Notes
and any excess funds resulting from
the issuance of the Notes shall, to the
extent necessary, be used for the
retirement of the Notes at maturity,
together with the interest thereon,
and are hereby pledged for such purpose.
Section 10. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax.
During the year or years while the
Notes are outstanding there shall be
levied on all the taxable property in
the City, in addition to all other taxes
but within tax limitations, a direct
tax annually not less than that which
would have been levied if bonds had
been issued therefor without the prior
issue of the Notes. That tax shall be
and is ordered computed, certified,
levied and extended upon the tax
duplicate and collected by the same
officers, in the same manner and at
the same time that taxes for general
purposes for each year are certified,
extended and collected. That tax
shall be placed before and in preference to all other items and for the full
amount thereof. The funds derived
from the tax levies required by this
Ordinance shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account, and those funds, together
with the interest collected on them,
shall be irrevocably pledged for the
payment of the principal and interest
of the Notes or the Bonds in anticipation of which they are issued, when
and as the same falls due; provided,
however, that in each year to the
extent that revenues are available
from other sources for the payment of
the Notes and Bonds and are appropriated for such purpose, the amount of
such direct tax upon all of the taxable
property in the City may be reduced
by the amount of such revenues so
available and appropriated.
Section 11. Official Statement; Continuing Disclosure.
If, in the judgment of the Director
of Finance, a disclosure document
(each, an “Official Statement”) is
appropriate or necessary in connection with the sale of the Notes or the
Bonds, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare or cause to be
prepared on behalf of the City an Official Statement with respect to the
Notes or the Bonds, as the case may
be, and any necessary supplements
and to authorize the use and distribution of each Official Statement and
any supplements. The Director of
Finance is authorized to sign on
behalf of the City and in her official
capacity each Official Statement and
any supplements approved by her.
The Director of Finance is authorized
to sign and deliver on behalf of the
City and in her official capacity such
certificates in connection with the
accuracy of each Official Statement
and any supplements as may, in the
judgment of the Director of Finance,
be necessary or appropriate. The
Director of Finance is also authorized
to determine and certify on behalf of
the City that such disclosure document is “deemed final” by the City
within the meaning of Securities and

245

27
Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12
(the “SEC Rule”). The Director of
Finance is authorized to contract for
services for the production and distribution of preliminary and final Official Statements, including by printed
and electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time of
the Notes or the Bonds, the City
agrees, in accordance with, and as the
only obligated person with respect to
the Notes and the Bonds under the
SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be
provided such financial information
and operating data and notices, in
such manner as may be required for
purposes of the SEC Rule. In order to
describe and specify certain terms of
the City’s continuing disclosure
agreement for that purpose, and
thereby to implement that agreement,
including provisions for enforcement,
amendment and termination, the
Director of Finance is authorized and
directed to prepare, or cause to be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of the City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the
continuing
disclosure
agreement
made by the City for the benefit of the
holders and beneficial owners of the
Notes or the Bonds, as the case may
be, in accordance with the SEC Rule.
The performance of that agreement
shall be subject to the availability of
funds and their annual appropriation
to meet costs the City would be
required to incur to perform it. The
Director of Finance is further authorized and directed to establish procedures in order to ensure compliance
by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely
provision of information and notices.
Section 12. Miscellaneous.
(a) Any provisions of the Codified
Ordinances of the City that are inconsistent with the provisions of this
Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance shall not apply to the Bonds or
the Notes authorized herein.
(b) All covenants, terms and provisions of the General Bond Ordinance
are fully applicable to the Bonds and
the Notes authorized herein, and nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed
to alter or restrict such full application of the General Bond Ordinance,
except for the exclusion from application to the Bonds and the Notes authorized herein of the provisions of the
third paragraph of Section 13(a) and
the third paragraph of Section 4 of the
General Bond Ordinance, pursuant to
Section 2 hereof.
Section 13. Captions.
The captions or headings in this
Ordinance are for convenience only
and in no way define, limit or describe
the scope or intent of any provisions
or sections of this Ordinance.
Section 14. Federal Tax Covenants.
The City covenants that it will use,
and will restrict the use and investment of, the proceeds of the Notes and
the Bonds in such manner and to such
extent as may be necessary so that
(a) the Notes and the Bonds will not
(i) constitute private activity bonds,
arbitrage bonds or hedge bonds under
Sections 141, 148 or 149 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the “Code”) or (ii) be treated other
than as bonds to which Section 103(a)
of the Code applies, and (b) the interest thereon will not be treated as an
item of tax preference under Section 57 of the Code.
The City further covenants that (a)
it will take or cause to be taken such
actions that may be required of it for

28
the interest on the Notes and the
Bonds to be and to remain excluded
from gross income for federal income
tax purposes, (b) it will not take or
authorize to be taken any actions that
would adversely affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting for
it, will, among other acts of compliance, (i) apply the proceeds of the
Notes and the Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing, (ii)
restrict the yield on investment property acquired with those proceeds,
(iii) make timely and adequate payments to the federal government, (iv)
maintain books and records and make
calculations and reports, and (v)
refrain from certain uses of those proceeds, and, as applicable, of property
financed with such proceeds, all in
such manner and to the extent necessary to assure such exclusion of that
interest under the Code.
Each covenant made in this Section
with respect to the Notes and the
Bonds is also made with respect to all
issues any portion of the debt service
on which is paid from proceeds of the
Notes or the Bonds (and, if different,
the original issue and any refunding
issues in a series of refundings), to
the extent such compliance is necessary to assure exclusion of interest on
the Notes and the Bonds from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, and the officers identified above
are authorized to take actions with
respect to those issues as they are
authorized in this Section to take with
respect to the Notes and the Bonds.
The Director of Finance, as the fiscal officer, or any other officer of the
City
having
responsibility
for
issuance of the Notes and the Bonds is
hereby authorized (a) to make or
effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or
waiver on behalf of the City with
respect to the Notes and the Bonds as
the City is permitted or required to
make or give under the federal
income tax laws, including, without
limitation thereto, any of the elections
provided
for
in
Section  148(f)(4)(C) of the Code or
available under Section  148 of the
Code, for the purpose of assuring,
enhancing or protecting favorable
tax treatment or status of the Notes
and the Bonds or interest thereon or
assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose, reducing the
burden or expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or
payments or penalties, or making
payments of special amounts in lieu
of making computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as
rebate, or obviating those amounts or
payments, as determined by that officer, which action shall be in writing
and signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf of
the City, as may be appropriate to
assure the exclusion of interest from
gross income and the intended tax
status of the Notes and the Bonds, and
(c) to give one or more appropriate
certificates of the City, for inclusion
in the transcript of proceedings for
the Notes and the Bonds, setting forth
the reasonable expectations of the
City regarding the amount and use of
all the proceeds of the Notes and the
Bonds, the facts, circumstances and
estimates on which they are based,
and other facts and circumstances relevant to the tax treatment of the
interest on and the tax status of the
Notes and the Bonds.

Section 15. Credit Enhancement and
Ratings.
If, in the judgment of the Director
of Finance, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, the filing of an application for a rating on
the Bonds or designated portion
thereof by one or more nationally recognized rating agencies is in the best
interest of the City, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare and
submit those applications and to provide to each such agency such information as may be required for the purpose. The Director of Finance is
authorized to contract for one or more
Credit Support Instruments for the
Bonds or designated portions thereof
if the Director determines, based on

Advisor, that the Credit Support
Instruments will result in debt service savings to the City. As used in

cost of obtaining each Credit Support
Instrument, except to the extent paid
by the Original Purchasers in accordance with the Bond Purchase Agreement, shall be paid from the proceeds
of Bonds or funds appropriated for
that purpose.
Section 16. Financial Advisor.
The Director of Finance may obtain
the services of one or more financial
advisors, from time to time, to assist
the Director of Finance in making
any of the determinations required by
this Ordinance to be determined by
the Director of Finance. The Director
of Finance may rely on the written
advice of any financial advisor so
retained. Any financial advisor
employed under the authority of this
Ordinance shall be disinterested in
the transaction and be independent of
the Original Purchasers and any
other party interested in the transaction.
Section 17. Open Meeting Determination.
It is found and determined that all
formal actions of this Council and of
any of its committees concerning and

the Ohio Revised Code.
Section 18. Findings and Recitals of

precedent to and in the issuing of the
Bonds and the Notes in order to make
them legal, valid and binding obligations of the City have happened, been
done and been performed in regular
and due form as required by law; and
that no limitation of indebtedness or
taxation, either statutory or constitutional, will have been exceeded in the
issuance of the Bonds or the Notes. It
is further found and determined, and

Section 20. Severability.
Each section and each part of each
section of this Ordinance is hereby
declared to be an independent section
or part of a section and, notwithstanding any other evidence of legislative
intent, it is hereby declared to be the
controlling legislative intent that if
any such section or part of a section
or any provision thereof, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the
remaining sections or parts of sections and the application of such provisions to any other person or circumstance, other than those as to which it
is held invalid, shall not be affected
thereby, and it is hereby declared to
be the legislative intent that the other
provisions of this Ordinance would
have been passed independently of
such section, or parts of a section, so
held to be invalid.
Section 21. Legislative Intent.
All terms, conditions, pledges,
covenants or agreements on the part
of the City provided for in this Ordinance are made by the voluntary act
of the City under its lawful authority,
including its authority under its Charter and Article XVIII of the Constitution of Ohio.
Nothing in this Ordinance is intended to, and no provision hereof shall be
applied in any manner as would,
impair the obligation of contract of

Ord. No. 136-11.
By Council Member Sweeney (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the issuance and sale of bonds in
the maximum principal amount of
$14,230,000 for the purpose of providing funds to improve buildings and
structures housing and providing for
the discharge of governmental functions and services otherwise benefiting the public safety, health and welfare and authorizing related matters.
Whereas, this Council desires to
issue bonds in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed Fourteen Million Two Hundred Thirty Thousand
Dollars ($14,230,000) (the “Bonds”) to
finance the costs of certain permanent improvements described in Section  1 of this ordinance (this “Ordinance”); and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of this City, has previously certified to this Council that
the estimated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be financed with the
proceeds of the Bonds is at least five
years and that the maximum maturity of the Bonds is 18  years, as evidenced by the Certificate contained in
File No. 136-11-A; and
Whereas, this Council passed Ordinance No. 1749-80 on October 8, 1980,
and thereafter amended that ordinance by Ordinance No. 1112-83,
passed May 6, 1983, and Ordinance No.
944-96, passed June 10, 1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so amended and
as the same may further be amended
from time to time in accordance with
its provisions, is referred to as the
“General Bond Ordinance”), providing the general terms and provisions
for the issuance of unvoted general
obligations of the City, with the specific terms of each series of Bonds to
be contained in ordinances authorizing the issuance of Bonds in accordance with the provisions thereof
(the “Series Bond Ordinances”); and

247

29
Whereas, the authorization for
issuance of the Bonds is necessary to
provide funds to pay the costs of certain
permanent
improvements
described in Section 1 hereof that are
urgently needed for the benefit of the
City, and as a result, this Ordinance
constitutes an emergency measure
providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health and safety, and for the usual
daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose.
It is deemed necessary to issue the
Bonds in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed Fourteen Million Two Hundred Thirty Thousand
Dollars ($14,230,000) for the purpose
of providing funds for constructing,
reconstructing,
rehabilitating,
installing, renovating, enlarging and
otherwise improving buildings and
structures housing and providing for
the discharge of governmental functions and services otherwise benefiting the public safety, health and welfare, including facilities in, of and for
the City Hall, police stations, fire stations, service stations, centers and
facilities, waste collection, market
facilities, transfer and disposal facilities, correctional facilities, and
health and other facilities, and the
provision of necessary fixtures, furnishings, equipment, appurtenances,
utilities, and site improvements for
the purpose, and to pay any capitalized interest and all expenses
incurred in connection with the
issuance of the securities, including
all financing costs within the meaning of Section 133.01(K) of the Ohio
Revised Code and such other costs of
the foregoing permanent improvements that may be financed with the
proceeds of securities as permitted by
Section 133.15(B) of the Ohio Revised
Code and as otherwise permitted by
law.
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Chapter 133
of the Ohio Revised Code and other
applicable provisions of the Ohio
Revised Code, the Charter of the City,
the General Bond Ordinance and this
Ordinance for the purpose stated in
Section 1 hereof. The Bonds shall be
designated
“Public
Facilities
Improvement Bonds” and may contain such further designation as provided in the certificate of award providing for the final terms of the Bonds
and the sale of the Bonds signed by
the Director of Finance in accordance
with this Ordinance (the “Certificate
of Award”). The Bonds shall be issued
in one lot as fully registered Bonds in
denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. The Bonds
shall be numbered as determined by
the Director of Finance.
The Bonds shall be issued in the
principal amount specified in the Certificate of Award, which shall not
exceed the amount stated in Section 1
hereof. The Bonds shall be dated the
date and shall bear interest from their
date until the principal amount is
paid at the rate or rates per year specified in the Certificate of Award, provided that the weighted average of
such rates (taking into account the
principal amount and maturity of
each Bond to which a rate applies)
shall not exceed seven percent (7%)
per year. Interest on the Bonds shall
be payable when due, or until the
principal amount is paid, semiannually as specified in the Certificate of

30
Award as the dates on which interest
on the Bonds shall be payable (the
“Interest Payment Dates”), beginning
on the date specified in the Certificate
of Award as the first Interest Payment Date.
The Bonds shall mature in the
years and principal amounts as shall
be permitted by law and determined
by the Director of Finance and specified in the Certificate of Award, based
on the written advice of a Financial
Advisor to be in the best interests of
the City, provided that (i) each principal payment shall occur on an Interest Payment Date, (ii) the first principal payment on the Bonds shall be
no earlier than November 15, 2011 and
no later than December 31, 2013, (iii)
the final maturity date of the Bonds
shall be no later than 18 years from
that date which is 12 months prior to
the first date on which provision for
payment of principal is made, and
(iv) the principal amount thereof
shall be payable in annual installments such that the total principal
and interest payments on the Bonds
in any fiscal year in which principal
is payable is not more than three
times the amount of those payments
in any other fiscal year.
The Bonds stated to mature in any
year may be issued as term bonds (the
“Term Bonds”), payable pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements as defined and further
described below. The Director of
Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award whether any of the
Bonds shall be issued as Term Bonds,
any dates (the “Mandatory Redemption Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable pursuant to mandatory sinking fund installments rather than at
stated maturity and the amount of
principal to be paid on each Mandatory Redemption Date (the “Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption or purchase prior to stated maturity as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory
sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100%
of the principal amount redeemed,
plus interest accrued to the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to be
deposited with the Escrow Agent, currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of and
interest on any Term Bonds shall
include amounts sufficient to redeem
on the Mandatory Redemption Dates
the principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided
below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined in
Section  3 hereof) for cancellation
Term Bonds in any aggregate principal amount and to receive a credit
against the then-current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City for
any Term Bonds. That option shall be
exercised by the City on or before the
forty-fifth day preceding the applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, by
furnishing the Escrow Agent a certificate, signed by the Registrar, set-

The City Record
ting forth the extent of the credit to
be applied with respect to the thencurrent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement. If the certificate is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the thencurrent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding
mandatory
redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds that
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and cancelled
by the Registrar, to the extent not
applied theretofore as a credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and cancelled, shall be credited by the
Escrow Agent at 100% of the principal amount thereof against the thencurrent Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding
mandatory
redemption
obligation). Any excess of that
amount over the then-current Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirement
shall
be
credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligations) in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(b) Optional Redemption. The
Bonds may be subject to redemption
prior to maturity by and at the option
of the City, in whole or in part on any
date, in integral multiples of $5,000,
on the optional redemption dates and
at the redemption prices (expressed
as a percentage of the principal
amount redeemed) specified in the
Certificate of Award, plus, in each
case, accrued interest to the redemption date. The first optional redemption date shall not be later than ten
years from the first Interest Payment
Date, and the highest redemption
price shall not be greater than 102%
of the principal amount redeemed
plus accrued interest to the redemption date. Based on the written advice
of a financial advisor, the Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that it is in the best
interests of the City for some or all of
the Bonds not to be callable prior to
their stated maturity.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, the Bonds, or portions thereof, to be redeemed optionally shall be selected by lot prior to
the selection by lot of the Bonds to be
redeemed on the same date by operation of the Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds shall be
redeemed pursuant to this paragraph
only upon written notice from the
Director of Finance to the Registrar.
That notice shall specify the redemption date and the principal amount of
each maturity of Bonds to be
redeemed, and shall be given at least
45 days prior to the redemption date
or such shorter period as shall be
acceptable to the Registrar. There
shall be deposited with the Registrar
on or prior to the redemption date
funds sufficient to redeem at the
redemption
price
all
of
the
redeemable Bonds for which notice of
redemption has been given.

248

February 23, 2011
(c) Purchase in Lieu of Redemption. If and to the extent provided in
the Certificate of Award, the City may
elect to purchase Bonds called for
optional redemption in lieu of redeeming those Bonds. That election shall
be exercised by written direction
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar and the Escrow Agent.
That written direction shall state
whether all or less than all of the
Bonds called for optional redemption
are to be purchased by the City in lieu
of redemption, shall identify the
Bonds to be purchased by their maturity date and shall specify the principal amount of each maturity to be purchased in lieu of redemption. If less
than all of the Bonds called for optional redemption are to be purchased in
lieu of redemption, the amount of
each maturity to be purchased shall
be in amounts of $5,000 or integral
multiples of $5,000. Any Bonds called
for optional redemption that are not
to be purchased shall be redeemed in
accordance with their redemption provisions. The purchase price of the
Bonds to be purchased in lieu of
redemption shall be equal to the principal of, any accrued but unpaid interest on, and any premium that would
have been payable on the Bonds on
the redemption date if the Bonds had
been optionally redeemed instead of
being purchased. No notice of the purchase in lieu of redemption is
required to be given to the owners of
the Bonds in addition to the notice of
redemption required by this Ordinance. The Escrow Agent or Registrar, as paying agent, shall not purchase Bonds if sufficient moneys
have not been deposited with the
Escrow Agent or Registrar, as paying
agent, by the City for the purpose. On
or prior to the scheduled date for
optional redemption, the City may
rescind its direction to purchase the
Bonds in lieu of redemption by written notice from the Director of
Finance to the Registrar and the
Escrow Agent. In the event that the
direction to purchase is rescinded, the
Bonds shall be redeemed on the
redemption date set forth in the notice
of redemption delivered to the owners
of the Bonds and in accordance with
the provisions of this Ordinance.
(d) Partial Redemption or Purchase. If fewer than all of the outstanding Bonds are called for redemption at one time (whether for redemption or purchase in lieu of redemption), they shall be called in the order
of maturities directed by the Director
of Finance. If fewer than all Bonds of
a single maturity are to be redeemed
or purchased in lieu of redemption,
the selection of Bonds to be redeemed
or purchased, or portions thereof in
amounts of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof, shall be made by the
Registrar by lot in a manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of
a partial redemption or purchase of
Bonds by lot when Bonds of denominations greater than $5,000 are then
outstanding, each $5,000 unit of principal thereof shall be treated as
though it were a separate Bond of the
denomination of $5,000. If it is determined that one or more, but not all of
the $5,000 units of principal amount
represented by a Bond are to be called
for redemption, then upon notice of
redemption of a $5,000 unit or units,
the registered owner of that Bond
shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i) for payment of the redemption
or purchase price of the $5,000 unit or
units called for redemption (including, without limitation, the interest
accrued to the date fixed for redemp-

February 23, 2011
tion and any premium), and (ii) for
issuance, without charge to the registered owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured portion of the Bond not
redeemed or purchased and bearing
interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date as the Bond surrendered.
(e) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii) the
redemption price to be paid, (iii) the
date fixed for redemption, and (iv)
the place or places where the amounts
due upon redemption are payable.
The notice shall be given by the Registrar on behalf of the City by mailing
a copy of the redemption notice by
first-class mail, postage prepaid, at
least 30 days prior to the date fixed
for redemption (or such period specified in the Certificate of Award), to
the registered owner of each Bond
subject to redemption in whole or in
part at the registered owner’s address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close of
business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing and to any provider
of a Credit Support Instrument (as
defined in Section 15 hereof) for the
Bonds or designated portions thereof.
Failure to receive notice by mail or
any defect in that notice regarding
any Bond, however, shall not affect
the validity of the proceedings for the
redemption of any Bond. Any notice
of redemption of any Bonds may specify that the redemption is contingent
on the deposit of moneys with the
Escrow Agent or Registrar, as paying
agent, on or prior to the redemption
date in an amount sufficient to pay
the redemption price of the Bonds to
be redeemed.
(f) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the manner provided in the preceding paragraph, and moneys having been
deposited by the City with the Escrow
Agent or Registrar, as paying agent,
in an amount sufficient to pay the
redemption price, the Bonds and portions thereof called for redemption
shall become due and payable on the
redemption date, and, upon presentation and surrender at the place or
places specified in that notice, shall
be paid. If money for the redemption
of all of the Bonds and portions thereof to be redeemed, including interest
accrued to the redemption date, is
held by the Registrar on the redemption date, and, if notice of redemption
has been deposited in the mail, then
from and after the redemption date
those Bonds and portions thereof
called for redemption shall cease to
bear interest and no longer shall be
considered to be outstanding. If that
money shall not be so available on the
redemption date, or that notice shall
not have been deposited in the mail,
those Bonds and portions thereof
shall continue to bear interest, until
they are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money held
by the Registrar for the redemption of
particular Bonds shall be held in trust
for the account of the registered owners and shall be paid to them, respectively, upon presentation and surrender of those Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without
deduction for the services of the Reg-

The City Record
istrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent. Principal shall be payable
when due upon presentation and surrender of the Bonds at the principal
corporate trust office of the Registrar. Interest on a Bond shall be paid
on each Interest Payment Date by
check or draft mailed to the person in
whose name the Bond was registered,
and to that person’s address appearing, on the Bond Register (as defined
in Section  3 hereof) at the close of
business on the date provided in the
Registrar Agreement authorized and
defined in Section  3 hereof (the
“Record Date”). Notwithstanding any
contrary provision in the General
Bond Ordinance, so long as the Bonds
are held by a Depository in a book
entry system (as described in Section  3 hereof), debt charges on the
Bonds will be payable in lawful
money of the United States by wire
transfer to the Depository made by
the Escrow Agent on each Interest
Payment Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General Bond
Ordinance. The General Bond Ordinance, except for the third paragraph
of Section 13(a) (pertaining generally to an adjustment of the interest
rate in an event of default) and the
third paragraph of Section 4 (pertaining generally to the periods during
which the City is not required to make
any transfers or exchanges of bonds
issued under the General Bond Ordinance), will apply to the Bonds.
Except for those provisions, the General Bond Ordinance is included as a
part of this Ordinance as fully as if
restated in this Ordinance. Words and
terms not otherwise defined in this
Ordinance shall have the same meaning as set forth in the General Bond
Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution,
Authentication,
Approval
and
Recording of the Bonds; Exchange
and Transfer of the Bonds; Paying
Agents. The Bonds shall express upon
their faces the purpose for which they
are issued and that they are issued
pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant
to Section 4 of the General Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be authenticated by the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee (as
defined therein). The Bonds shall be
signed by the City’s Mayor and by the
City’s Director of Finance, and, consistent with Section 133.27 of the Ohio
Revised Code and notwithstanding
Section  177.02 of the Codified Ordinances of the City, either or both of
those signatures may be a facsimile.
The Bonds shall bear the seal of the
City, which seal may be a facsimile
seal. Pursuant to Section  83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
shall prepare the Bonds and shall
endorse thereon his approval of the
form and correctness thereof by his
manual or facsimile signature.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating
agent, bond registrar, transfer agent
and paying agent for the Bonds (the
“Registrar”). The Registrar shall also
act as paying agent for the Bonds so
long as the Bonds are held in a book
entry system. The Director of Finance
is authorized to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City, an
agreement between the City and the
Registrar (the “Registrar Agreement”), approved as to form and correctness by the Director of Law, providing for services relating to the registration, transfer, exchange and payment of the Bonds on terms approved
by the Director of Finance on behalf
of the City and consistent with this

249

31
Ordinance and not substantially
adverse to the City. That approval
shall be conclusively evidenced by
the signing of the Registrar Agreement by the Director of Finance. The
Director of Finance shall provide for
the payment of the services rendered
and for reimbursement of expenses
incurred pursuant to the Registrar
Agreement from the proceeds of the
Bonds to the extent available and
then from other money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds remain
outstanding, the City will cause the
Registrar to maintain and keep at its
principal corporate trust office all
books and records necessary for the
registration, exchange and transfer
of Bonds as provided in this Section
(the “Bond Register”). The person in
whose name a Bond is registered on
the Bond Register shall be regarded
as the absolute owner of that Bond for
all purposes of this Ordinance. Payment of or on account of the debt
charges on any Bond shall be made
only to or upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar
shall be affected by any notice to the
contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid and
effectual to satisfy and discharge the
City’s liability upon the Bond, including interest, to the extent of the
amount or amounts so paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender
at the principal corporate trust office
of the Registrar, together with a
request for exchange signed by the
registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. A Bond may
be transferred only on the Bond Register upon presentation and surrender
of the Bond at the principal corporate
trust office of the Registrar together
with an assignment signed by the registered owner or by a person legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner equal
in the aggregate to the unmatured
principal amount of the Bond surrendered and bearing interest at the
same rate and maturing on the same
date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any tax or
other governmental charge required
to be paid with respect to the
exchange or transfer. The City or the
Registrar may require that those
charges, if any, be paid before the procedure is begun for the exchange or
transfer. All Bonds issued and
authenticated upon any exchange or
transfer shall be valid obligations of
the City, evidencing the same debt,
and entitled to the same security and
benefit under this Ordinance, as the
Bonds
surrendered
upon
that
exchange or transfer.

32
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds and the principal of and interest on the Bonds may
be transferred only through a book
entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are
issued by the City only to a Depository or its nominee as registered owner,
with the Bonds “immobilized” in the
custody of the Depository. The book
entry maintained by others than the
City is the record that identifies the
owners of beneficial interests in those
Bonds and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited
purpose trust company), New York,
New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers,
banks and trust companies, and clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized: (i) the Bonds
may be issued in the form of a single,
fully registered Bond representing
each maturity and registered in the
name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository;
(ii) the beneficial owners in book
entry form shall have no right to
receive Bonds in the form of physical
securities or certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book
entry form shall be shown by book
entry on the system maintained and
operated by the Depository and its
Participants, and transfers of the
ownership of beneficial interests
shall be made only by book entry by
the Depository and its Participants;
and (iv) the Bonds as such shall not
be transferable or exchangeable,
except for transfer to another Depository or to another nominee of a Depository, without further action by the
City.
If any Depository determines not to
continue to act as a Depository for the
Bonds for use in a book entry system,
the Director of Finance may attempt
to
establish
a
securities
depository/book entry relationship
with another qualified Depository. If
the Director of Finance does not or is
unable to do so, the Registrar, after
making provision for notification of
the beneficial owners by the then
Depository and any other arrangements deemed necessary, shall permit
withdrawal of the Bonds from the
Depository, and the Trustee and Registrar shall authenticate and deliver
bond certificates in registered form to
the assigns of the Depository or its
nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.

The City Record
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to the
extent necessary or required to enter
into any agreements determined necessary in connection with the book
entry system for the Bonds, after
determining that the signing thereof
will not endanger the funds or securities of the City and after the approval
of the form of any such agreement by
the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds.
The Bonds shall first be offered for
purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking Fund and, if not purchased by
them, shall be offered to the Treasury
Investment Account for purchase and,
if not purchased for that Account,
shall be sold to one or more firms that
have proposed to underwrite the
Bonds and have been selected by the
Director of Finance based on an evaluation of the qualifications of those
firms (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”).
The Bonds shall be awarded to the
Original Purchaser in the Certificate
of Award which shall specify the
final terms of the Bonds in accordance with law, the provisions of this
Ordinance, the written advice of a
financial advisor retained under
authority of Section 16 hereof and the
Original Purchaser’s offer to purchase the Bonds, including: the principal amount of the Bonds, the purchase price (which shall be not less
than 97% of the principal amount of
the Bonds plus any accrued interest to
their date of delivery), interest rate or
rates, the amounts and years in which
principal installments are payable
(at stated maturity or pursuant to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements), the Interest Payment
Dates and the date of the Bonds and
any other matters required in this
Ordinance to be set forth in that Certificate. As appropriate under the
Charter, the Mayor, Director of
Finance, Director of Law, Clerk of
Council and other appropriate officers of the City are, and each of them
is, authorized to take such actions as
are necessary, appropriate and in the
best interest of the City to establish
the terms and requirements for delivery of the Bonds and to make such
arrangements as are necessary with
the Original Purchaser in order to
establish the date, location, procedures, and conditions for the delivery
of the Bonds to the Original Purchaser, to give all appropriate notices and
certificates, to cause a true transcript
of proceedings with reference to the
issuance of the Bonds to be delivered
to the Original Purchaser, to sign any
transcript
certificates,
financial
statements and other documents and
instruments and to take such actions
as are necessary or appropriate to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take
all steps necessary to effect the due
execution, authentication and delivery of the Bonds. The Director of
Finance is further authorized to sign
and deliver on behalf of the City a
bond purchase agreement between
the City and the Original Purchaser
(the “Bond Purchase Agreement”),
approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, setting forth
the terms and conditions on which the
City agrees to sell the Bonds and the
Original Purchaser agrees to buy the
Bonds, which shall be consistent with
this Ordinance, not substantially
adverse to the City, and approved by
the Director of Finance and Director
of Law on behalf of the City, all of
which shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of the Bond

250

February 23, 2011
Purchase Agreement by the Director
of Finance. It is determined that the
terms of the Bonds, as provided in this
Ordinance and as may be provided in
or pursuant to the Certificate of
Award, are in the best interest of the
City and in compliance with all legal
requirements.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B) of the
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds with
other bonds into a single consolidated
issue of bonds for purposes of their
sale as a single issue to be designated
“Various Purpose General Obligation
Bonds, Series 2011” or such other designation as may be set forth in the
Certificate of Award. Such bonds
shall contain a summary statement of
purposes encompassing the purpose
for which the Bonds are issued and
shall state that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax.
For the purpose of providing the
necessary funds to pay the interest on
the Bonds promptly when and as the
same falls due, and also to provide for
the discharge of the Bonds at maturity, there shall be and is levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes, a direct
tax annually during the period the
Bonds are outstanding, in an amount
sufficient to provide for the payment
of that interest, when and as the same
shall fall due, and also to discharge
the principal of the Bonds at maturity, which tax shall not be less than
the interest and sinking fund tax
required by Section 11 of Article XII
of the Constitution of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is ordered computed, certified, levied and extended
upon the tax duplicate and collected
by the same officers, in the same manner and at the same time that taxes
for general purposes for each of those
years are certified, extended and collected. The tax shall be placed before
and in preference to all other items
and for the full amount thereof. The
funds derived from those tax levies
shall be placed in the Unvoted Tax
Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund as required by the General Bond Ordinance, and those funds,
together with the interest collected on
them, shall be irrevocably pledged for
the payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds when and as the
same fall due; provided, however,
that, subject to the provisions of Section 8 of the General Bond Ordinance,
in each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the Bonds
and are appropriated for such purpose, the amount of such tax shall be
reduced by the amount of such revenues so available and appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections  133.25(B)(1) and 5705.51 of
the Ohio Revised Code, and in accordance with the provisions of and to
the extent required or permitted by
the General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt charges
for the Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended and applied for the objects
and purposes for which the Bonds are
issued. The proceeds of the Bonds to
be applied to pay costs of any Credit
Support Instruments obtained pur-

February 23, 2011
suant to Section 15 hereof shall be
paid to the provider or providers of
those Credit Support Instruments.
The proceeds of the Bonds to be used
to pay costs of issuing the Bonds shall
be deposited with the Registrar in a
separate account under the Registrar
Agreement pending their application
to the payment of such costs. Pursuant to Chapter 133 of the Ohio
Revised Code and this Ordinance, and
notwithstanding Chapter 179 of the
Codified Ordinances, any accrued
interest and any premium received
from the sale of the Bonds shall be
deposited in the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund to be applied to the payment of the principal of and interest
on the Bonds.
Section 7. General Obligation.
The Bonds are secured by a pledge
and lien on a parity with the pledges
and liens authorized by the General
Bond Ordinance and, in addition to
the taxes and revenues specifically
pledged pursuant to this Ordinance
and the General Bond Ordinance and
the other covenants, terms and agreements provided hereunder and in the
General Bond Ordinance to secure
payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds, the City hereby
determines, declares, warrants and
covenants that the Bonds are general
obligations of the City and that the
full faith and credit of the City are
hereby pledged for the payment of the
principal of and interest on the Bonds
in accordance with the laws and Constitution of the State of Ohio, this
Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid and
discharged all the outstanding Bonds,
or there shall otherwise be paid to the
holders of the outstanding Bonds all
debt charges due or to become due
thereon, and provision shall also be
made for paying all other sums
payable hereunder, then and in that
event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of
further effect, and the covenants,
agreements and other obligations of
the City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the request
of the City execute and deliver to the
City such instruments in writing as
shall discharge the lien hereof and
enter on the record such discharge of
the lien and such other instruments as
may be reasonably required by the
City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if:
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or subaccounts, in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold in
special accounts or subaccounts, in
trust for and irrevocably committed
solely thereto, direct obligations of
the United States certified by an independent public accounting firm of
national reputation to be of such
maturities and interest payment
dates and to bear such interest, without further investment or reinvestment of either the principal amount
thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held in trust and
committed, except as hereinafter provided), as will be sufficient, together
with moneys referred to in (i) above,

The City Record
for the payment, at their maturities or
redemption dates, of all debt charges
on the Bonds to their date of maturity
or redemption, as the case may be, or
if default in such payment shall have
occurred on such date then to the date
of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds are to be
redeemed prior to the maturity thereof, notice of such redemption shall
have been duly given or irrevocable
provision satisfactory to the Trustee
shall have been duly made for the giving of such notice. Any moneys held
by the Escrow Agent in accordance
with the provisions of this Section
shall be invested by the Escrow
Agent in direct obligations of the
United States of America maturing, or
redeemable at the option of the holder, at times and in amounts sufficient
to meet payment of debt charges on
the Bonds, as directed by the Director
of Finance. Any income or interest
earned by, or increment to, the investments held under this Section shall, to
the extent determined from time to
time by the Escrow Agent to be in
excess of the amount required to be
held by it for the purposes of this Section, be transferred at the time of
such determination as provided in
Section  17(a) of the General Bond
Ordinance for unclaimed funds held
by a Paying Agent. In the event of
nonpresentment of any Bond as
described in Section 17(a) of the General Bond Ordinance, the moneys held
pursuant to this Section shall be held
and paid as provided in said Section  17(a) for unclaimed funds held
by a Paying Agent.
Section 9. Bond Anticipation Notes.
For the purpose of raising money in
anticipation of the issuance of the
Bonds for the purpose set forth in Section 1 hereof, notes of the City may be
issued in an aggregate principal
amount not to exceed Fourteen Million Two Hundred Thirty Thousand
Dollars ($14,230,000) (the “Notes”)
upon the direction of the Director of
Finance to be set forth in a certificate
providing for the final terms of the
Notes and the sale of the Notes and
signed by the Director of Finance
(the “Note Certificate of Award”).
(a) Terms of the Notes. The Notes
shall bear interest at such rate, not
exceeding seven percent (7%) per
year, as may be fixed by the Director
of Finance of the City in the Note Certificate of Award; shall be dated their
date of issuance; shall mature on the
date set forth in the Note Certificate
of Award, which shall be no later than
five years from such date of issuance;
shall be subject to redemption by the
City at any time prior to maturity
without penalty, provided that, if the
Director of Finance, based on the
advice of a financial advisor, determines that it is in the best interest of
the City in order to enhance the marketability of the Notes, the Director of
Finance may cause the Notes to not be
redeemable for a period which ends
no later than the date which is two
years following the date of issuance
of the Notes; shall be designated “Public Facilities Improvement Bond
Anticipation Notes”; shall be issued in
such numbers and denominations as
may be requested by the Note Purchaser (hereinafter defined); and
shall be issued in fully registered
form (which may be in a book entry
only system) in denominations of
$5,000 or integral multiples thereof.
Interest shall be payable semiannually on the dates set forth in the Note
Certificate of Award; provided that if
the Notes mature on or before the end
of the twelfth month following their

251

33
date of issuance, interest on the Notes
shall be payable at maturity.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating
agent, registrar, transfer agent and
paying agent for the Notes (the “Note
Registrar”). The Escrow Agent also
shall act as paying agent for the
Notes if the Notes are held in a book
entry system. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, an agreement among the City, the Note Registrar and the Escrow Agent (the “Note
Registrar Agreement”) providing for
services relating to the registration,
transfer, exchange and payment of
Notes on terms that are approved by
the Director of Finance on behalf of
the City. That approval shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the Note Registrar Agreement by the
Director of Finance. The Director of
Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and for
reimbursement of expenses incurred
pursuant to the Note Registrar Agreement from the proceeds of the Notes to
the extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Notes remain
outstanding, the City will cause the
Note Registrar to maintain and keep
at its principal corporate trust office
all books and records necessary for
the registration, exchange and transfer of Notes as provided in this Section
(the “Note Register”). The person in
whose name a Note is registered on
the Note Register shall be regarded as
the absolute owner of that Note for all
purposes of this Ordinance. Payment
of or on account of the debt charges
on any Note shall be made only to or
upon the order of that person; neither
the City nor the Note Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid and
effectual to satisfy and discharge the
City’s liability upon the Note, including interest, to the extent of the
amount or amounts so paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for
Notes of any authorized denomination
upon presentation and surrender at
the principal corporate trust office of
the Note Registrar, together with a
request for exchange signed by the
registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Note Registrar. A Note
may be transferred only on the Note
Register upon presentation and surrender of the Note at the principal corporate trust office of the Note Registrar together with an assignment
signed by the registered owner or by
a person legally empowered to do so
in a form satisfactory to the Note Registrar. Upon exchange or transfer the
Note
Registrar
shall
complete,
authenticate and deliver a new Note
or Notes of any authorized denomination or denominations requested by
the owner equal in the aggregate to
the unmatured principal amount of
the Note surrendered and bearing
interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Note Registrar shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Notes only after the new
Notes are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Notes exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Note Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Notes
in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The exchange or

34
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Note Registrar may make a charge
sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to the
exchange or transfer. The City or the
Note Registrar may require that those
charges, if any, be paid before the procedure is begun for the exchange or
transfer. All Notes issued and authenticated upon any exchange or transfer shall be valid obligations of the
City, evidencing the same debt, and
entitled to the same security and benefit under this Ordinance, as the Notes
surrendered upon that exchange or
transfer.
Pursuant to Section 133.30(B) of the
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Notes with
other bond anticipation notes of the
City for purposes of their sale as a single issue to be designated “Various
Purpose General Obligation Bond
Anticipation Notes.” The Notes shall
contain a summary statement of purposes encompassing the purpose for
which the Notes are issued and shall
state that they are issued pursuant to
this Ordinance.
(b) Execution and Payment of the
Notes. The Notes shall express upon
their faces the purpose for which they
are issued and that they are issued
pursuant to this Ordinance. Each Note
shall be authenticated by the manual
signature of an authorized officer of
the Trustee (as defined therein). The
Notes shall be signed by the City’s
Mayor and by the City’s Director of
Finance, and, consistent with Section
133.27 of the Ohio Revised Code and
notwithstanding Section 177.02 of the
Codified Ordinances of the City,
either or both of those signatures may
be a facsimile. The Notes shall bear
the seal of the City, which seal may be
a facsimile seal. Pursuant to Section 83 of the City’s Charter, the Director of Law shall prepare the Notes and
shall endorse thereon his approval of
the form and correctness thereof by
his manual or facsimile signature.
(c) Sale of the Notes. The Notes
shall first be offered for purchase to
the Trustees of the Sinking Fund and,
if not purchased by them, shall be
offered to the Treasury Investment
Account for purchase and, if not purchased for that Account, shall be sold
to one or more firms that have proposed to underwrite the Notes and
have been selected by the Director of
Finance based on an evaluation of the
qualifications of those firms (the
“Note Purchaser”) in the principal
amount set forth in a certificate of
award to be executed by the Director
of Finance (the  “Note Certificate of
Award”) at not less than par and
accrued interest and at a rate not
exceeding that set forth in Section 10
hereof. The proceeds of such sale
shall be paid into the proper fund and
used for the purpose for which the
Notes are being issued under the provisions of this Ordinance.
(d)Security for the Notes. The Notes
shall be the full general obligations
of the City, and the full faith, credit
and revenue of the City are hereby
pledged for the prompt payment of
the same. The par value to be received
from the sale of the Notes and any
excess funds resulting from the
issuance of the Notes shall, to the
extent necessary, be used for the
retirement of the Notes at maturity,
together with the interest thereon,
and are hereby pledged for such purpose.

The City Record
Section 10. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax.
During the year or years while the
Notes are outstanding there shall be
levied on all the taxable property in
the City, in addition to all other taxes
but within tax limitations, a direct
tax annually not less than that which
would have been levied if bonds had
been issued therefor without the prior
issue of the Notes. That tax shall be
and is ordered computed, certified,
levied and extended upon the tax
duplicate and collected by the same
officers, in the same manner and at
the same time that taxes for general
purposes for each year are certified,
extended and collected. That tax
shall be placed before and in preference to all other items and for the full
amount thereof. The funds derived
from the tax levies required by this
Ordinance shall be placed in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account, and those funds, together
with the interest collected on them,
shall be irrevocably pledged for the
payment of the principal and interest
of the Notes or the Bonds in anticipation of which they are issued, when
and as the same falls due; provided,
however, that in each year to the
extent that revenues are available
from other sources for the payment of
the Notes and Bonds and are appropriated for such purpose, the amount of
such direct tax upon all of the taxable
property in the City may be reduced
by the amount of such revenues so
available and appropriated.
Section 11. Official Statement; Continuing Disclosure.
If, in the judgment of the Director
of Finance, a disclosure document
(each, an “Official Statement”) is
appropriate or necessary in connection with the sale of the Notes or the
Bonds, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare or cause to be
prepared on behalf of the City an Official Statement with respect to the
Notes or the Bonds, as the case may
be, and any necessary supplements
and to authorize the use and distribution of each Official Statement and
any supplements. The Director of
Finance is authorized to sign on
behalf of the City and in her official
capacity each Official Statement and
any supplements approved by her.
The Director of Finance is authorized
to sign and deliver on behalf of the
City and in her official capacity such
certificates in connection with the
accuracy of each Official Statement
and any supplements as may, in the
judgment of the Director of Finance,
be necessary or appropriate. The
Director of Finance is also authorized
to determine and certify on behalf of
the City that such disclosure document is “deemed final” by the City
within the meaning of Securities and
Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12
(the “SEC Rule”). The Director of
Finance is authorized to contract for
services for the production and distribution of preliminary and final Official Statements, including by printed
and electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time of
the Notes or the Bonds, the City
agrees, in accordance with, and as the
only obligated person with respect to
the Notes and the Bonds under the
SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be
provided such financial information
and operating data and notices, in
such manner as may be required for
purposes of the SEC Rule. In order to
describe and specify certain terms of
the City’s continuing disclosure
agreement for that purpose, and

252

February 23, 2011
thereby to implement that agreement,
including provisions for enforcement,
amendment and termination, the
Director of Finance is authorized and
directed to prepare, or cause to be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of the City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the
continuing
disclosure
agreement
made by the City for the benefit of the
holders and beneficial owners of the
Notes or the Bonds, as the case may
be, in accordance with the SEC Rule.
The performance of that agreement
shall be subject to the availability of
funds and their annual appropriation
to meet costs the City would be
required to incur to perform it. The
Director of Finance is further authorized and directed to establish procedures in order to ensure compliance
by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely
provision of information and notices.
Section 12. Miscellaneous.
(a)Any provisions of the Codified
Ordinances of the City that are inconsistent with the provisions of this
Ordinance and the General Bond Ordinance shall not apply to the Bonds or
the Notes authorized herein.
(b) All covenants, terms and provisions of the General Bond Ordinance
are fully applicable to the Bonds and
the Notes authorized herein, and nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed
to alter or restrict such full application of the General Bond Ordinance,
except for the exclusion from application to the Bonds and the Notes authorized herein of the provisions of the
third paragraph of Section 13(a) and
the third paragraph of Section 4 of the
General Bond Ordinance, pursuant to
Section 2 hereof.
Section 13. Captions.
The captions or headings in this
Ordinance are for convenience only
and in no way define, limit or describe
the scope or intent of any provisions
or sections of this Ordinance.
Section 14. Federal Tax Covenants.
The City covenants that it will use,
and will restrict the use and investment of, the proceeds of the Notes and
the Bonds in such manner and to such
extent as may be necessary so that
(a) the Notes and the Bonds will not
(i) constitute private activity bonds,
arbitrage bonds or hedge bonds under
Sections 141, 148 or 149 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the “Code”) or (ii) be treated other
than as bonds to which Section 103(a)
of the Code applies, and (b) the interest thereon will not be treated as an
item of tax preference under Section 57 of the Code.
The City further covenants that (a)
it will take or cause to be taken such
actions that may be required of it for
the interest on the Notes and the
Bonds to be and to remain excluded
from gross income for federal income
tax purposes, (b) it will not take or
authorize to be taken any actions that
would adversely affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting for
it, will, among other acts of compliance, (i) apply the proceeds of the
Notes and the Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing, (ii)
restrict the yield on investment property acquired with those proceeds,
(iii) make timely and adequate payments to the federal government, (iv)
maintain books and records and make
calculations and reports, and (v)
refrain from certain uses of those proceeds, and, as applicable, of property
financed with such proceeds, all in
such manner and to the extent necessary to assure such exclusion of that
interest under the Code.

February 23, 2011
Each covenant made in this Section
with respect to the Notes and the
Bonds is also made with respect to all
issues any portion of the debt service
on which is paid from proceeds of the
Notes or the Bonds (and, if different,
the original issue and any refunding
issues in a series of refundings), to
the extent such compliance is necessary to assure exclusion of interest on
the Notes and the Bonds from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, and the officers identified above
are authorized to take actions with
respect to those issues as they are
authorized in this Section to take with
respect to the Notes and the Bonds.
The Director of Finance, as the fiscal officer, or any other officer of the
City
having
responsibility
for
issuance of the Notes and the Bonds is
hereby authorized (a) to make or
effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or
waiver on behalf of the City with
respect to the Notes and the Bonds as
the City is permitted or required to
make or give under the federal
income tax laws, including, without
limitation thereto, any of the elections
provided
for
in
Section  148(f)(4)(C) of the Code or
available under Section  148 of the
Code, for the purpose of assuring,
enhancing or protecting favorable
tax treatment or status of the Notes
and the Bonds or interest thereon or
assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose, reducing the
burden or expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or
payments or penalties, or making
payments of special amounts in lieu
of making computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as
rebate, or obviating those amounts or
payments, as determined by that officer, which action shall be in writing
and signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf of
the City, as may be appropriate to
assure the exclusion of interest from
gross income and the intended tax
status of the Notes and the Bonds, and
(c) to give one or more appropriate
certificates of the City, for inclusion
in the transcript of proceedings for
the Notes and the Bonds, setting forth
the reasonable expectations of the
City regarding the amount and use of
all the proceeds of the Notes and the
Bonds, the facts, circumstances and
estimates on which they are based,
and other facts and circumstances relevant to the tax treatment of the
interest on and the tax status of the
Notes and the Bonds.
Section 15. Credit Enhancement and
Ratings.
If, in the judgment of the Director
of Finance, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, the filing of an application for a rating on
the Bonds or designated portion
thereof by one or more nationally recognized rating agencies is in the best
interest of the City, the Director of
Finance is authorized to prepare and
submit those applications and to provide to each such agency such information as may be required for the purpose. The Director of Finance is
authorized to contract for one or more
Credit Support Instruments for the
Bonds or designated portions thereof
if the Director determines, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, that the Credit Support
Instruments will result in debt service savings to the City. As used in
this Section, “Credit Support Instru-

The City Record
ment” means an insurance policy,
surety, letter of credit, or other instrument used to enhance or provide for
the security of Bonds. The cost of
obtaining each rating and the cost of
obtaining each Credit Support Instrument, except to the extent paid by the
Original Purchasers in accordance
with the Bond Purchase Agreement,
shall be paid from the proceeds of
Bonds or funds appropriated for that
purpose.
Section 16. Financial Advisor.
The Director of Finance may obtain
the services of one or more financial
advisors, from time to time, to assist
the Director of Finance in making
any of the determinations required by
this Ordinance to be determined by
the Director of Finance. The Director
of Finance may rely on the written
advice of any financial advisor so
retained. Any financial advisor
employed under the authority of this
Ordinance shall be disinterested in
the transaction and be independent of
the Original Purchasers and any
other party interested in the transaction.
Section 17. Open Meeting Determination.
It is found and determined that all
formal actions of this Council and of
any of its committees concerning and
relating to the passage of this Ordinance were taken, and that all deliberations of this Council and any of its
committees that resulted in these formal actions were held, in meetings
open to the public in compliance with
all legal requirements, including,
without limitation, Section  121.22 of
the Ohio Revised Code.
Section 18. Findings and Recitals of

It is hereby determined, represented and recited that all acts, conditions
and things necessary to be done
precedent to and in the issuing of the
Bonds and the Notes in order to make
them legal, valid and binding obligations of the City have happened, been
done and been performed in regular
and due form as required by law; and
that no limitation of indebtedness or
taxation, either statutory or constitutional, will have been exceeded in the
issuance of the Bonds or the Notes. It
is further found and determined, and
is hereby represented and recited,

September 30, 2011, for a period of five

254

February 23, 2011
years, with one five-year option to
renew, exercisable by the Director of
Public Safety.
Whereas, the USS Cleveland (LPD7) was placed in commission on April
21, 1967, at Norfolk, Virginia; and
Whereas, after commissioning, the
USS Cleveland changed its homeport
to San Diego, California, became a
member
of
the
Pacific
Fleet’s
Amphibious force, and performed a
wide variety of missions in both the
Eastern and Western Pacific; and
Whereas, the USS Cleveland has
had a proud and honorable 35-year
history beginning in 1967, where she
first saw action during the TET
Offensive and later assisted in the
mine-clearing efforts of Haiphong
Harbor and Operation End Sweep following the Vietnam War cease fire;
and
Whereas, hallmarking her diversity and professionalism, from November 1988 through 2000, the USS Cleveland was assigned duties as the Third
Fleet flagship, assisted with the
Exxon Valdez disaster, deployed to
Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, supported law
enforcement operations in Central
America, became the first LPD to
embark an SH-60 Seahawk helicopter,
played a key role in the largest maritime cocaine seizure to date involving the “Sea Chariot”, participated in
United Nations relief efforts in Rwanda, participated in the relocation of
the
U.S.
Liaison
office
from
Mogadishu, Somalia, assisted in the
North Persian Gulf with Operation
Vigilant Warrior, and participated in
the recovery and salvage efforts of
Alaska Airlines Flight 261; and
Whereas, in her 35 years of service,
the USS Cleveland has received two
Combat Action Ribbons, the Joint
Meritorious Unit Award, the Navy
Unit Commendation, three Meritorious Unit Commendations, eight Navy
Excellence Ribbons, three Armed
Forces Expeditionary Medals, twenty-three Vietnam Service Medals, the
Southwest Asia Service Medal, the
Humanitarian Service Medal, the
Coast Guard Unit Commendation with
Operational Distinguishing Device,
and three Vietnam Gallantry Cross
Unit Citations; and
Whereas, the USS Cleveland will
continue on active duty until decommissioned on or about September 30,
2011; and
Whereas, part of the ship’s inventory is the bronze bell which once may
have been onboard an earlier USS
Cleveland warship, the USS Cleveland
(CL-55, 1942 to 1960), and quite possibly the first USS Cleveland (Cruiser
19, later PG-33 and CL-21, 1903 to
1030); and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
Ohio, would like to have the bell designated to our City so that we may
display it, or other memorabilia from
the USS Cleveland, in a prominent and
secure location to be viewed by our
citizens and visitors to honor and celebrate the proud history of the USS
Cleveland; and
Whereas, the somber decommissioning of the USS Cleveland may
mark the end of a line of United States
ships named Cleveland, and it would
be fitting and appropriate that the
bell, or other memorabilia, be entrusted to the citizens of the City of Cleveland, Ohio, when, and if, a new USS
Cleveland is commissioned; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
