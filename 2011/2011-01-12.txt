An emergency resolution opposing
any possible cuts in the FY 2012 federal
budget
to
Community
Development Block Grant funding
and strongly urging the Obama
Administration in the FY2012 budget
to freeze CDBG formula funding at
the FY 2010 level of $3.9 billion.
Whereas, in recent discussions
about the federal budget for 2012, it
has been stated by the Obama administration that all federal programs
are on the table for possible cuts; and
Whereas, Community Development
Block Grant (CDBG) funding could
be facing a funding reduction of up to
25 % or $1 billion dollars in the
President’s Budget; and
Whereas, this, or any reduction, in
CDBG funding would severely slow
down or eliminate thousands of local
and state projects and programs that
are directly contributing to local and
regional recovery; and

The City Record
Whereas, without CDBG funds, the
City would not be able to assist
Cleveland’s community development
corporations and similar organizations to encourage economic development, business creation and expansion, housing projects, community
and neighborhood revitalization and
community services programs; and
Whereas, CDBG funds enable the
City of Cleveland to deliver essential
services including:
Community
Housing Solutions (the furnace
repair program, the home repair loan
program, tool loan program, credit
counseling and foreclosure prevention counseling); and
Whereas, CDBG funds enable the
City to assist non-profit organizations
providing social service programs
including AIDS prevention services,
at-risk youth services, elderly services, family services and local homeless shelter and homeless prevention
services; and
Whereas, CDBG funds provide community development corporations in
Cleveland with funding for new market-rate and affordable housing construction and acquisition for redevelopment of single family vacant substandard housing; and
Whereas, CDBG funds are critical
in helping deal with the foreclosure
crisis impacting our community, from
blight elimination to foreclosure
counseling, and in helping manage
the negative impact this crisis has on
our neighborhoods; and
Whereas, in the City, CDBG funds
were essential in these development
projects:
Cogswell Hall (a 41-unit
rehab for low income adults completed to green building standards);
Detroit Avenue Streetscape in the
Gordon Square District; Morgana
East Infrastructure (site improvements and project support for 90 units
of new construction market-rate housing); and the Flats East Bank project
(a large scale mixed-use project of
hotel, office and retail commercial
space, housing and public use and
green space); and
Whereas, in the City of Cleveland,
CDBG funds have been instrumental
in helping the Ohio City area open
over a dozen new businesses in the
last two years – with more than $40
million dollars in new investment and
hundreds of new jobs created in the
neighborhood; and
Whereas, CDBG funds were essential in creating Ohio City Farm, a sixacre farm developed through a partnership between the local development corporation, the local housing
authority, the Great Lakes Brewing
Company
and
local
nonprofits
focused on workforce development
for resettled refugees - this farm has
garnered
national
attention
on
thoughtful development and sustainability; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby
opposes any possible cuts in the FY
2012 federal budget to Community
Development Block Grant funding
and strongly urges the Obama
Administration in the FY2012 budget
to freeze CDBG formula funding at

THE
AND

The following rules and regulations concerning the privilege of
parking occupancy subject to tax
under Chapter 196 are hereby promulgated by the Commissioner of
Assessments and Licenses pursuant
to section 196.13(a) authorizing the
Commissioner to adopt, promulgate
and enforce rules and regulations
relating to any matter pertaining to
the administration and enforcement
of Chapter 196 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio. The rules
and regulations herein shall be
effective upon publication in The
City Record. The rules and regulations promulgated on August 21,
1996 in Vol. 83, No. 4315 of The City

Parking Fee Paid by Anoth-

(a) Meaning of “Patron.” The
term “patron” includes a person who
pays a parking fee to an operator
in exchange for the parking occupancy of another by way of validation or discount.
(b) Collection. The operator must
collect the tax due from the person
making payment in lieu of the occupant in the instance the parking fee
is fully paid by the patron; or must
collect the tax due from both the
person making payment in lieu of
the occupant and the occupant in
the instance the parking fee is discounted and only partially paid by
the occupant.
196-3-2

19
charges descriptions meant to avoid
the parking occupancy tax, including, but not limited to service fee,
transportation fee, storage fee, or
words of similar import, will not be
respected. The parking fee includes
the total consideration required to
be paid by a patron to a parking
service in exchange for parking
occupancy. A charge shall not avoid
classification as a parking fee by its
designation as an ancillary charge
for any other purported purpose separate from parking occupancy. See
CO § 196.03(n).
(c) Meaning of “Location” and
“Place.” The terms “location” and
“place” as used in § 196.02(y) mean
the immediate and actual area occupied by the motor vehicle. Such
terms shall not be construed to
mean the parcel, postal address, or
any other larger geographical division that may encompass both the
location of surrender and place of
occupancy.

196-4-4 Valet Service Transaction
Utilizing a Third Party Parking
Facility.
A valet service that utilizes a
third party parking facility for
parking space is considered to be
two distinct transactions. The primary transaction is between (1) the
valet service, as operator, and (2)
the party having possession of the
motor vehicle, as patron. The secondary
wholesale
transaction
is
between (1) the parking facility, as
operator, and (2) the valet service,
as
patron.
Assuming
all
other
requirements are otherwise satisfied, § 196.03(d)(1)(C) exempts the
valet service from paying parking
occupancy tax in its capacity as a
patron to the parking facility operator in the secondary wholesale
transaction. No exemption applies to
the primary transaction between (1)
the valet service, as operator, and
(2) the party having possession of
the motor vehicle, as patron.

Valet Services.
Chapter 5 – Collection of Tax.

(a) Status as Operator.
CO §
196.02(p) includes valet services, as
that term is defined by CO §
196.02(y), within the definition of a
parking service. Valet service operators are parking service operators
for purposes of the parking occupancy tax. The status of a valet service as a parking service is not
avoided by separating transaction
components into “service” and “parking space” or “storage” sub-charges.
Separately stating these sub-charges
does not overcome the primary purpose of the transaction, whereby the
patron pays a fee to the valet service for the use, or the right of use,
of parking space in or on a parking
facility for parking, housing, or storing a motor vehicle. The fact that
the valet service may engage an
independent parking facility for the
procurement
of
space
does
not
change the valet service’s status as
an operator.
(b) Parking Fee. The amount of
the parking fee includes the total
amount charged to the patron in
exchange for parking service. Separately stating the parking fee into
sub-charges and assigning such sub-

27

196-5-1 Tax to be Separately Stated.
(a) Evidence of Tax. Where the
operator issues a receipt of payment
or any other document memorializing the transaction, the tax due and
collected shall be separately stated
on such document.
(b) Notice of Tax. Where the operator does not separately state the
amount of tax charged and collected, or does not issue a receipt of
payment or any other document
memorializing the transaction, the
operator must conspicuously post
signage in plain sight that contains
the applicable parking fees and
indicate
that
the
parking
fee
includes a parking occupancy tax of
eight percent (8%).

Claim Checks.

(a) Definition. The term “claim
check” shall include, but not be lim-

The City Record

20
ited to, parking ticket, stub, voucher, or any other proof of purchase
issued by the operator to the patron
at the time of transaction.
(b) Issuance Required. Each operator is required to issue a distinctive claim check to each patron at
the time of the transaction. Claim
checks shall be issued by an operator in numerical sequence, except
that, where practical for the operator, a numerical sequence may mean
a sequence fitting for the day, week
or period involved. Where an operator conducts business at more than
one location, separate claim checks
shall be issued for each location.
(c) Exceptions.
(1) Subsection (b) of this section
shall not apply where any of the following conditions apply:
A. the patron has reserved his/her
space in the parking facility for a
period of more than one day by
means of a lease, contract or similar arrangement;
B. the parking facility operates as
an un-attended honor lot; or
C.
the
operator
demonstrates
another reasonable method of ascertaining the number of patrons and
the tax due, and has received
approval of the Commissioner to use
such method.
(2) An operator who is exempted
under paragraph (1) of this subsection (c) may be required, upon
audit,
to
submit
federal,
state
and/or city income or net profits tax
returns
and
schedules
relating
thereto. Such returns shall be kept
confidential.
