Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
Ohio
(“hereinafter
Municipality”)
owns and operates an electric utility system for the sale of electric
power and associated energy for the
benefit of its citizens and taxpayers;
and
Whereas, in order to satisfy the
electric power and energy requirements of its electric utility system,
Municipality has heretofore purchased, or desires to do so in the
future,
economical
and
reliable
power and energy from, or arranged
by, American Municipal Power, Inc.
(hereinafter
“AMP”),
of
which
Municipality is a Member; and
Whereas,
Municipality,
acting
individually and, along with other
municipalities which own and operate electric utility systems, jointly,
endeavors to arrange for reliable,
reasonably priced supplies of electric power and energy for ultimate
delivery to its customers; and
Whereas, it is efficient and economical to act jointly in such
regard; and
Whereas, AMP is an Ohio nonprofit corporation, organized to own
and operate facilities, or to provide
otherwise, for the generation, transmission or distribution of electric
power and energy, or any combination thereof, and to furnish technical services on a cooperative, nonprofit basis, for the mutual benefit
of

such
Members,
including the Municipality, being,
and to be, political subdivisions of

electric systems in, as of the date of
adoption hereof, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia
and West Virginia; and
Whereas, each of the Members
owns and operates its electric system for the benefit of its customers;
and
Whereas, certain of the Members,
including the Municipality, have
determined it requires additional,
long-term sources of reliable, environmentally sound and reasonably
priced electric capacity and energy

5
and
has
requested
that
AMP
arrange for the same; and
Whereas, in furtherance of such
purpose, Municipality, along with
other Members (collectively “Participants”) request and AMP agrees
and intends to finance, construct,
operate and own up to a one hundred percent (100%), and in any
case not less than an eighty percent
(80%), undivided ownership interest, in the Fremont Energy Center
having an expected net rated electric generating capacity of approximately
seven
hundred
seven
megawatts (707 MW), to be known
collectively as the American Municipal Power Fremont Energy Center
(as hereinafter defined, “AMP Fremont Energy Center”); and
Whereas, AMP has resolved, in
accordance herewith, to develop,
including,
as
appropriate,
the
financing, acquisition, construction,
ownership and operation of, and
arrangements for the acquisition,
financing, payment and prepayment
of fuel for, its ownership interest in
the AMP Fremont Energy Center
(the “Project”) as well as other
arrangements related thereto, which
AMP and, in certain cases, the Participants, deem necessary to enable
AMP to fulfill its obligations hereunder to sell and transmit, or otherwise
make
available,
electric
capacity and energy to the Participants pursuant to the Fremont Energy Center Power Sales Contract
(hereinafter “PSC”); and
Whereas, in order to obtain such
sources of electric capacity and
energy, the Participants are willing
to pay AMP for their respective
rights to such electric capacity and
energy and transmission service at
rates that are sufficient, but only
sufficient, to enable AMP to (i)
recover
all
costs
and
expenses
incurred
with
respect

arrangements for the acquisition,
financing, payment and prepayment
of fuel for, the Project as set forth
herein, all other Power Sales Contract Resources obtained by AMP to

authorized hereunder; and
Whereas, AMP has investigated
both a self-build of a natural gas
combined cycle project as well as
the acquisition of one of several
existing natural gas combined cycle
projects either operating or in various stages of construction; and
Whereas, AMP and certain Members have determined that the purchase of the nearly complete Fremont Energy Center from FirstEnergy is the best option for AMP
Members; and
Whereas, because the expected in
service date of the Fremont Energy
Center is on or about January 1,
2012, certain Participants may need
to have AMP rearrange their current
power supply portfolio by selling
certain already purchased power,
principally for 2012 through 2015,
into the market (“Buy-Out”) and
finance the cost of such transaction
pursuant to the PSC; AND

shall not apply in any administrative
hearing or ex-parte review. The ticket
charging the offense shall constitute
prima facia evidence that the offense
identified in the ticket occurred and
that the parcel owner(s) to whom the
ticket was mailed are the responsible
parties as defined in division (m) and
are liable to the City of Cleveland for
the costs imposed by this section.
If the Director finds by a preponderance of evidence that an appellant
is liable under this section for the
costs assessed, then the Director shall
dismiss the appeal and order the
appellant to pay the costs identified
in the ticket.
If the Director finds by a preponderance of evidence that an appellant
is liable under this section for the
costs assessed but that there are reasons for the commission of the infraction that mitigate the offense, then
the Director shall dismiss the appeal
and order the appellant to pay the
costs identified in the ticket, but may
in the interest of equity reduce the
costs assessed.
If the Director finds by a preponderance of evidence that the appellant is not liable under this section for
the costs assessed, then the Director
shall dismiss the ticket and grant the
appeal.
(j) Appeal of the Director’s decision. Any person subject to an
adverse decision of the Director may
appeal that decision to the Board of

Director.

shall
approve, modify or annul the finding
from which the appeal is taken.

by this section may be enforced and
collected by means of a civil action or
any other means provided for in these
Codified Ordinances or the Revised

this resolution showing the amount of
the assessment against each lot or
