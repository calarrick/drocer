An emergency resolution opposing
Sub. S.B. 17 that would allow concealed weapons in bars, restaurants
other liquor permit premises.
Whereas, last week, the Ohio Senate passed Sub. S.B. 17, allowing
concealed weapons in any premises
that have been issued a liquor permit, including carry outs, restaurants, nightclubs, clubs, hotels, shopping malls, marinas, museums and
sports stadiums; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that allowing concealed weapons in
establishments such as these will
not make workers or clientele any
more safe or secure; and
Whereas, this council encourages
the Ohio House to use common sense
and vote no on this bill because passage would make liquor permit
premises unsafe and make patronizing these establishments risky and
dangerous; and
Whereas, Sub. S. B. 17 is solidly
opposed by the Ohio Association of
Chiefs of Police, the Fraternal Order
of Police and by the Ohio Restaurant Association; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the

Res. No. 553-11.
By Mayor Jackson and Council
Member Zone.
An emergency resolution establishing a Citywide taskforce to 1) plan
how the City of Cleveland facilities
will accept and dispose of phone
books in a way that reduces waste
and encourages recycling, 2) educate
residents on ways to stop the delivery
of unwanted phone books, 3) study
the economic benefits that phone
books provide to the small and midsized businesses of Cleveland, and 4)
study if legislative solutions are
needed to reduce the volume of
unwanted phone books and the costs
associated with disposing of phone
books.
Whereas, unwanted phone books
create a tremendous amount of
waste and cost the City of Cleveland
approximately $37,000 in 2010 to dispose of 1,100 tons of phone books in
land-fills; and
Whereas, in an age when the
internet is used increasingly as a
method
of
information-gathering,
phone books continue to provide
small and mid-sized Cleveland businesses with an effective means of
promoting their businesses and providing vital information to consumers; and
Whereas, similar to other opt-out
programs with which consumers are
familiar, the phone book industry
has
created
www.yellowpagesoptout.com as a single site that permits citizens to stop future directory deliveries; and
Whereas, voluntary industry and
individual
publisher
efforts
to
reduce waste have resulted in significant reductions in paper usage
over the past four years; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
recognizes that after learning of
efforts by phone book publishers to
address the unwanted delivery of
phone books, some municipalities
and states have rejected a legislative approach to the issue; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
also recognizes that other municipalities, such as Seattle and San
Francisco, have introduced legislation creating opt-out programs, optin programs, bans on unsolicited distribution,
and
reimbursement
requirements for publishers to cities
for the cost of disposing and recycling,
and
presently
Cambridge,
Massachusetts is studying these initiatives; and
Whereas, demonstrating its commitment to reduce waste, the City of
Cleveland
instituted
a
curb-side
recycling program in 2007 that will
be expanded in the third quarter of
2011 to include 40% of Cleveland
residents; and
Whereas, although phone books
are
not
currently
disposed
of
through Cleveland’s recycling program, the City coordinates with the
Cuyahoga County Solid Waste District to offer a phone book round-up

16
program from June 1st through September 30th annually at dumpsters
twelve
Cleveland
Metroparks
in
locations in Cuyahoga County; and
Whereas, this Council and representatives from the Jackson Administration’s Office of Sustainability,

XII. REINSTATEMENT OF DISMISSED APPEAL
A request for reinstatement of an

XIII.
REFILING
OF
APPEAL
FOR
VARIANCE
PREVIOUSLY
DENIED OR FOR MODIFICATION
OF EXISTING VARIANCE.
Any appeal which is identical or
substantially similar to a previously filed appeal will be considered a
re-filing of an appeal. Any appeal to
modify an existing variance will
also be considered a re-filing of an
appeal.
The Board will dismiss any re-filing of an appeal for a variance as
res judicata unless the appellant
demonstrates a basis that would prevent the application of res judicata
including: substantially changed circumstances, substantial new relevant evidence that was not available at the hearing on the prior
appeal, or that the application of res
judicata
would
create
manifest
injustice.
The Secretary will notify the
appellant when an appeal has been
deemed a re-filing. The appellant
may file with the Board an affidavit
or any supporting documentation
demonstrating a basis which prevents application of res judicata.

The City Record
The affidavit or supporting documentation must be filed within thirty (30) days of the date when the
Secretary mailed the notice. The
Board may dismiss the appeal if the
appellant fails to submit the affidavit or any supporting documentation within thirty (30) days demonstrating a basis that prevents application of res judicata.
XIV. PERMITS
In all matters where the decision
of the Board allows the issuance of
a permit or license by the City, the
Secretary shall forward a written
notice of the decision to the proper
department. The department shall
incorporate the conditions, if any,
imposed by the Board upon the permit or license.
The permit or license shall not be
issued earlier than seven (7) days
after the granting of an appeal
unless, for good cause shown, the
Board waives the waiting period.
A resolution of the Board granting an appeal shall become void
unless
permits
or
licenses
are
obtained from the proper department or departments, or the rights
granted therein are exercised or otherwise vested by the appellant, within six (6) months after the date of
the resolution. However, the Board
may affirm its decision and extend
the time to invoke the resolution for
an additional six (6) months if the
appellant so requests prior to the
expiration of the preceding sixmonth period upon a showing of
good cause for the Board to grant
the extension.
XV. ANNUAL REPORT
Upon completion of the annual
report of the work of the Board, the
Secretary shall send a copy to each
of the members, to the Director of
City Planning and any additional
distribution at the discretion and/or
request of the City Planning Director.
XVI. AMENDMENTS
These Rules and Regulations may
be amended or supplemented by a
majority vote of the Board at any
regular meeting, provided that the
Members of the Board have received
a copy of the proposed amendment
at least seven (7) days prior to the
meeting.

44113, Permanent Number 8980087;
and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is

An emergency resolution opposing
the closing of regional Taxpayers
Service Centers.
Whereas, 9.4 million Ohioans living in 73 of Ohio’s 88 counties have
local access to the seven Ohio
Department of Taxation regional
Taxpayer Service Centers and over
one million taxpayers a year call for
help and another 79,000 Ohioans,
approximately 300 a day, visit the
Service Centers on a walk-in basis;
and

The City Record
Whereas, the regional Taxpayers
Service Centers serve all taxpayers,
from individuals to large corporations, and cover all types of Ohio
taxes
with
services
particularly
vital to Ohio’s individual taxpayers,
small businesses, and start-ups; and
Whereas, the regional Taxpayers
Service Centers license or register
taxpayers and file returns for all of
Ohio’s taxes and provide assistance
to Ohioans having tax problems,
helping them respond to issues
raised by the Department of Taxation, and in many cases resolving
issues during visits to the offices;
and
Whereas, the regional Taxpayers
Service Centers offer an avenue for
face to face between the State and
the taxpayer making the process of
resolution easier where the taxpayer can present their documentation
and discuss the situation with one
of the agents from the Service Centers while both are looking over the
same information; and
Whereas, these services are particularly helpful for those individual
and small business taxpayers for
whom tax compliance is a daunting
challenge and of whom many are
elderly and/or low-income wage
earners; and
Whereas, regional Taxpayer Service Centers collected or billed $73
million in revenue in 2010, and
billed millions more that were collected by other means with the
largest portion of this money coming from sales tax filings; depending on which county is considered,
up to 30% of the sales tax collected
is directly used to fill the coffers of
counties and public transit districts;
and
Whereas, in 2010, about $20 million went to fund government services at the local level; and
Whereas, the regional Taxpayer
Service Centers operate compliance
programs aimed at helping vendors
and individuals to comply with the
requirement that they collect and
remit sales tax which produced a
combined $9.1 million in sales tax
revenue; and
Whereas, the taxpayer assistance
programs for individual income taxpayers put additional dollars, in the
form of tax refunds, into the local
economy, many in the hands of the
lowest-income taxpayers; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes the closing of regional Taxpayers Service Centers.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
Governor John Kasich and all members of the Ohio General Assembly.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
