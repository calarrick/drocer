Whereas, Board of Control Resolution No. 143-11, adopted March 30, 2011 authorized charges by the Division of

Be it resolved by the Board of Control of the City of Cleveland, that Board of Control Resolution No. 143-11,
adopted March 30, 2011, is amended by changing the effective date for the new water rates fixed therein from
“7/1/2011” and “July 1” to “7/16/2011” and “July 16”, respectively, where appearing.
Be it further resolved that under Section 112 of the Charter of the City of Cleveland, charges of the Division

megawatts (707 MW), to be known
collectively as the American Municipal Power Fremont Energy Center

1124

June 29, 2011
(as hereinafter defined, “AMP Fremont Energy Center”); and
Whereas, AMP has resolved, in
accordance herewith, to develop,
including,
as
appropriate,
the
financing, acquisition, construction,
ownership and operation of, and
arrangements for the acquisition,
financing, payment and prepayment
of fuel for, its ownership interest in
the AMP Fremont Energy Center
(the “Project”) as well as other
arrangements related thereto, which
AMP and, in certain cases, the Participants, deem necessary to enable
AMP to fulfill its obligations hereunder to sell and transmit, or otherwise
make
available,
electric
capacity and energy to the Participants pursuant to the Fremont Energy Center Power Sales Contract
(hereinafter “PSC”); and
Whereas, in order to obtain such
sources of electric capacity and
energy, the Participants are willing
to pay AMP for their respective
rights to such electric capacity and
energy and transmission service at
rates that are sufficient, but only
sufficient, to enable AMP to (i)
all
costs
and
expenses
recover
with
respect
to,
and
incurred
arrangements for the acquisition,
financing, payment and prepayment
of fuel for, the Project as set forth
herein, all other Power Sales Contract Resources obtained by AMP to
supplement the Project, and related
service arrangements undertaken by
AMP to enable it to fulfill its obligations hereunder, and (ii) recover
any other expenditures or revenues
authorized hereunder; and
Whereas, AMP has investigated
both a self-build of a natural gas
combined cycle project as well as
the acquisition of one of several
existing natural gas combined cycle
projects either operating or in various stages of construction; and
Whereas, AMP and certain Members have determined that the purchase of the nearly complete Fremont Energy Center from FirstEnergy is the best option for AMP
Members; and
Whereas, because the expected in
service date of the Fremont Energy
Center is on or about January 1,
2012, certain Participants may need
to have AMP rearrange their current
power supply portfolio by selling
certain already purchased power,
principally for 2012 through 2015,
into the market (“Buy-Out”) and
finance the cost of such transaction
pursuant to the PSC; AND
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the PSC between
Municipality and AMP, substantially
in the form placed in File No. 68011-A, including Appendices thereto
is approved, and the Director of Public Utilities (hereinafter “Director”)
of Municipality is hereby authorized
to execute and deliver such Power

deliver any and all documents necessary to become a Participant in the
AMP Fremont Energy Center project
pursuant to the conditions set forth
herein and in the PSC and to carry out
its obligations thereunder and to
arrange for the Buy-Out of any excess
power and energy currently under
contract with AMP as the Director
deems in the best interests of the
Municipality.
Section 3. That the Director, in connection with the execution and delivery of the PSC, is authorized and
directed to acquire Municipality’s
PSCR Share (not taking into account

be set forth in Appendix A of the PSC.
Section 4. That the Director of this
Municipality, as a part of such officer’s official duties, is hereby appointed as Municipality’s representative
for any meetings or determinations of
the Participants or the Participants
Committee pursuant to the PSC and is
authorized and directed, acting for, in
the name of and on behalf of this
Municipality, to vote Municipality’s
PSCR Share with regard to any deter-

minations regarding the AMP Fremont Energy Center project as set
forth in the PSC.
Section 5. That the Director may
appoint, in writing from time to time
as necessary, another representative
of the Municipality as his alternate to
carry out the duties set forth in Section 4 hereof.
Section 6. That the price of power
from the AMP Fremont Energy Center project may include recovery of up
to 50%, or $3,986,624 plus accrued
interest, of Cleveland Public Power’s
pro rata share of the estimated, maximum potential costs of the American
Municipal Power Generating Station
(AMPGS) associated with Cleveland
Public Power’s participation in that
project. Such costs shall be recoverable through the PSC as set forth

of the estimated other 50% of such
costs, or up to $3,986,624 plus accrued
from
Cleveland
Public
interest,
Power’s operating fund (Fund 58 SF
001) is authorized to compensate AMP

the passage of this ordinance were

part thereof of this ordinance shall be
finally adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the
remainder of this ordinance shall be
unaffected by such adjudication and
all the remaining provisions of this
ordinance shall remain in full force
and effect as though such section,
subsection, paragraph, clause or provision or any part thereof so adjudicated to be invalid had not, to the
extent of such invalidity, been included herein.

and, provided it receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take
effect and be in force immediately

the time it is closed, the deposit shall be applied to any final amount outstanding, and the balance, if any, shall
be returned to the depositor.
Section 535.21 Charges for Unmetered Fire Protection Service within the City and Direct Service Metropolitan
Area
Water shall be furnished to an unmetered fire protection service connection only for fire protection, testing and
maintenance purposes. A charge shall be made for each unmetered fire supply connection within the limits of
the City and direct service suburbs. The charge shall be determined by the size of the fire supply connection
through which water passes for use on the premises so supplied at the rate for unmetered fire line service under
Section 535.06 (p) of the Codified Ordinances. Unauthorized water use through unmetered fire protection service
connections shall be billed and charged at the additional MCF rate in the applicable service district. Additional
penalties and charges based on consumption may be charged for unauthorized uses of an unmetered fire protection service connection.
Charges shall be collected monthly or quarterly for each fire supply connection to cover inspection, testing,
sealing and resealing of such service connections, stand-by pumpage capacity, and replacement or cleaning of distribution or trunk water mains to improve the water supply for fire protection purposes.
Section 535.24 Charges for Water from Fire Hydrants
(a) In addition to other charges, if water is used from a public fire hydrant, upon special permit only, a charge
for the permit and a hydrant rental must be paid in advance under Section 535.06 of the Codified Ordinances. A
separate permit shall be issued for each hydrant which shall identify its location.
(b) Water may be furnished from a fire hydrant for any special purpose authorized by the Commissioner of
the Division of Water. The charge for water so furnished shall be at the additional MCF rate under Section 535.04
for the service district in which the fire hydrant is located. The quantity of water used may be estimated by the
Commissioner based on information provided by the user as to the user’s purpose and needs, or the Commissioner
may require the installation of a meter at the connection to the hydrant to be used, in which event the user shall
pay the cost of installing the meter and the cost of all water measured.
