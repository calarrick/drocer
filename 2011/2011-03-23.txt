strong economic future and a more
secure nation; and

the world from all walks of life
turned off their lights and came
together in celebration and contemplation of the one thing we all have in
common – our planet; and
Whereas, in past years, landmarks
from around the world went dark for
Earth Hour, including: the Empire
