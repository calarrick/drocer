Res. No. 1299-11.
By Council Members Cleveland,
Cimperman, Kelley, Sweeney, Miller,
Brady, Brancatelli, J. Johnson, Westbrook, Mitchell, Conwell, Dow, Zone
and Reed.
An emergency resolution recognizing the month of October as a month
dedicated to educating our community on the importance of health literacy and further recognizing the first
statewide conference on Health Literacy to be held on October 11-13, 2011
by the Institute for Health Literacy at
St. Vincent Charity Medical Center.
Whereas, health literacy is the
capacity to obtain, process, and
understand basic health information
and services allowing individuals to
make appropriate health decisions;
and
Whereas, according to the Institute
of Medicine report titled Health Literacy: A Prescription to End Confusion,
nearly half of all American adults - 90
million people - have difficulty understanding and using health information; and
Whereas, persons with limited
health literacy skills have higher utilization of treatment services such as
hospitalization and emergency services and lower utilization of preventive services; and
Whereas, health literacy is a
stronger predictor of a person’s
health than age, income, employment
status, education level and race; and
Whereas, approximately half of all
Medicare/Medicaid recipients and 20
percent of all American adults read at
or below the fifth grade level, yet
most health information materials
are written at the tenth grade level or
above; and
Whereas, 81 percent of patients age
60 and older have difficulty compre-

hending medical instructions such as
prescription labels; and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
the Institute for Health Literacy at St.
Vincent Charity Medical Center for
its outstanding leadership and service in educating healthcare professionals, community engagement leaders, and the general populace on the
importance of health literacy in the
delivery of health care; and
Whereas, this Council understands
the importance of Healthy Cleveland
and its efforts to advance programs,
educational opportunities, and services that improve the health and
health literacy of the residents of the
City; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council recognizes the month of October as a
month dedicated to educating our
community on the importance of
health literacy and further recognizes the first statewide conference
on Health Literacy to be held on
