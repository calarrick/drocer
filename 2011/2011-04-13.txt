By Council Member Keane.
An emergency resolution opposing
the closing of regional Taxpayers
Service Centers.
Whereas, 9.4 million Ohioans living in 73 of Ohio’s 88 counties have
local access to the seven Ohio
Department of Taxation regional
Taxpayer Service Centers and over
one million taxpayers a year call for
help and another 79,000 Ohioans,
approximately 300 a day, visit the
Service Centers on a walk-in basis;
and
Whereas, the regional Taxpayers
Service Centers serve all taxpayers,
from individuals to large corporations, and cover all types of Ohio
taxes
with
services
particularly
vital to Ohio’s individual taxpayers,
small businesses, and start-ups; and
Whereas, the regional Taxpayers
Service Centers license or register
taxpayers and file returns for all of
Ohio’s taxes and provide assistance
to Ohioans having tax problems,
helping them respond to issues
raised by the Department of Taxation, and in many cases resolving
issues during visits to the offices;
and
Whereas, the regional Taxpayers
Service Centers offer an avenue for
face to face between the State and
the taxpayer making the process of
resolution easier where the taxpayer can present their documentation
and discuss the situation with one
of the agents from the Service Centers while both are looking over the
same information; and
Whereas, these services are particularly helpful for those individual
and small business taxpayers for
whom tax compliance is a daunting
challenge and of whom many are
elderly
and/or
low-income
wage
earners; and
Whereas, regional Taxpayer Service Centers collected or billed $73
million in revenue in 2010, and
billed millions more that were collected by other means with the
largest portion of this money coming from sales tax filings; depending on which county is considered,
up to 30% of the sales tax collected
is directly used to fill the coffers of
counties and public transit districts;
and
Whereas, in 2010, about $20 million went to fund government services at the local level; and
Whereas, the regional Taxpayer
Service Centers operate compliance
programs aimed at helping vendors
and individuals to comply with the
requirement that they collect and

16
remit sales tax which produced a
combined $9.1 million in sales tax
revenue; and
Whereas, the taxpayer assistance
programs for individual income taxpayers put additional dollars, in the
form of tax refunds, into the local
economy, many in the hands of the
lowest-income taxpayers; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes the closing of regional Taxpayers Service Centers.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
Governor John Kasich and all
members
of
the
Ohio
General
Assembly.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 446-11.
By Council Member Kelley.
An emergency resolution urging
the Governor, the Ohio Senate and
the Ohio House to support and maintain the current process of funding
the Ohio Consumers’ Council.
Whereas, Governor John Kasich
desires to reduce the budget of the
Ohio Consumers’ Counsel from $8.5
million to $4.1 million in the next
Biennial Budget; and
Whereas, Governor Kasich believes that the Ohio Consumers’
Counsel provides services duplicative to those provided by the Public
Utilities Commission of Ohio (the
“PUCO”); and
Whereas, the Ohio Consumers’
Counsel’s operating budget is funded
independently
by
mandatory
assessments filed against revenue of
the state’s utilities and not from tax
revenues; and
Whereas, the Ohio Consumers’
Counsel is charged under state law
with the responsibility to represent
consumers’ interests regarding activities of both regulated utilities and
the PUCO; and
Whereas, the PUCO is not legally
charged with advocating on behalf

health and nutrition goals, and exercise mobility goals as well; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
