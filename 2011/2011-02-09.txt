ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 145-11.
By Council Members Cleveland,
Sweeney, Kelley, Westbrook, Brancatelli, Mitchell, J. Johnson, Reed,
Miller, Cummins, Pruitt, Dow, Westbrook and Mayor Jackson.
An emergency resolution objecting
to the proposed closing of the East
55th Street state driver license testing
station.
Whereas, on January 28, 2011, the
Ohio Highway Patrol announced the
closing of the state driver license testing station located at East 55th Street
in Cleveland; and
Whereas, closing the E. 55th Street
testing station will leave the City
without a station within its city limits; and
Whereas, closing this station will
pose a hardship on residents of the
inner city in that the suburban locations may be difficult for inner-city
residents on both the east and west
sides of Cleveland to get to; and
Whereas, the $40,000 a year allegedly saved by closing the testing station
will have minimal impact on the state
budget; and
Whereas, no notice was given to
local and state elected officials prior
to the announcement and two weeks’
notice to the public of the closing is
inadequate; and
Whereas, the Ohio Highway Patrol
should delay taking action until they
meet with local elected officials; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby
objects to the proposed closing of the
East 55th Street state driver license
testing station.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to forward a copy
of this resolution to Governor John
Kasich and to the appropriate persons at the Ohio Highway Patrol.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted January 31, 2011.

Cleveland, Ohio 44115, Permanent

Whereas, the granting of this application for a liquor permit to this high

community; and

qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard of
the laws, regulations or local ordinances of this state or any other state;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed to
the building, safety or health requirements of the governing body of this
County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or constructed that law enforcement officers or agents of the Department of
Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based on
other legal grounds as set forth in
Revised Code Section 4303.292; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of
the public peace, prosperity, safety
and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.

must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of notification; now, therefore,

An emergency resolution opposing
House Bill 45 of the 129th Ohio General Assembly that would amend the
Ohio Revised Code to allow concealed

person does not consume alcohol, and
would repeal specific prohibitions
against
improperly
handling
firearms in a motor vehicle.

For purposes of this Chapter, “special event” means a preplanned event
or series of events of less than a
week’s duration, sponsored by a public or private person or entity, which
is: (1) located wholly or partially on
property which is owned or maintained by the City of Cleveland; or (2)
located on any other property and
requires for its successful execution,
the provision and coordination of
municipal services to a degree significantly over and above that which the
City of Cleveland routinely provides
under ordinary everyday circumstances.
City buildings, parks and all other
real estate under control of the Director which have been constructed or
maintained for the benefit of the public shall be for the use of the public in
general under the Charter and ordinances of the City of Cleveland. To
that end, no person or entity shall be
given any special or exclusive privilege to use any public property under
the control of the Director without
first obtaining a permit under this
section. Additionally, the Director
shall ensure that proper coordination

165

21
occurs among necessary city departments to facilitate the use of city
streets for special event activities
including parades, marathons, foot
races/bike-a-thons, and all other
events requiring closure of a right-ofway.
All closures of city streets in conjunction with a special event shall be
approved by the Police Traffic Commissioner, Commissioner of Streets,
and Manager of Special Events, and
Marketing.

rules and regulations for the use of
public property under his control.

events other than City-sponsored
events, shall be limited to after normal business hours and weekends.
The Director’s prior notice requirement may not exceed five days for
special event permits not subject to
the requirements of Section 131.08.
(c) The Director may place reasonable place restrictions on the issuance
of special event permits, which
restrictions may consider the historic
use of the property, recreational use
policies adopted in the director’s rules
and regulations, the size of the property and the degree to which the special event would interfere with the
historic use and adopted recreational
use policies for the property.
(d) The Director may deny or
revoke a special event permit whenever he finds:
(1) the applicant person or entity
