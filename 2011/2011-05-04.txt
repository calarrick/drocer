FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 608-11.
By Council Members Sweeney and
Cleveland.
An emergency resolution supporting Space Laboratory Associates, a
joint non-profit entity of Universities
Space Research Association and Battelle, in efforts to gain NASA approval
of their headquarters in Cleveland to
manage the International Space Station National Laboratory.
Whereas, NASA is considering
Cleveland as the site of a new nonprofit, Space Laboratory Associates
(SLA) that would manage scientific
and commercial testing on the International Space Station National Laboratory (ISS NL); and
Whereas, the Greater Cleveland
Partnership (GCP) is working in
partnership with Team NEO and
several other Northeast Ohio organizations to gain NASA approval for
SLA, a joint non-profit entity of Universities Space Research Association (USRA) and Battelle, to be
headquartered in Cleveland to manage the ISS NL for ten years; and
Whereas, NASA’s selection of SLA
and Northeast Ohio as a headquarters location will greatly assist management of the ISS NL for four primary reasons: 1) business, research,
and education climate, 2) regional
expertise in microgravity research
and space operations, 3) promotion
of STEM Education, and 4) state
and local commitment; and
Whereas, first, Northeast Ohio has
an outstanding business climate for
entrepreneurial,
research-oriented
organizations that thrive using our
proposed “Research to Application”
approach; and
Whereas, the region has the “economic ecosystem,” which networks
together major research universities, with nonprofit research centers
with
extensive
business
assets
posed to move quickly on commercialization in key research areas

The City Record
and industry sectors that include
medicine and life sciences, advanced
materials and advanced energy, and
agriculture; and
Whereas, this is the environment
required
to
translate
ISS
NL
research into applications that will
deliver real economic and societal
value to the Nation; and
Whereas, second, Northeast Ohio
has a strong base of knowledge and
experience in microgravity research
and space operations that few other
regions in the country possess that
SLA will capitalize on to grow the
ISS NL program, substantially over
the coming decade; and
Whereas, third, Ohio is leading
the charge on STEM education and
has
made
nationally-recognized
progress, and Cleveland organizations have committed to contributing directly to STEM education associated with the ISS NL, both regionally and nationally; and
Whereas, this includes the new
Great Lakes Science Center, the official site of the NASA Glenn Visitor
Center, which just completed Phase
I and anticipates completing the second phase in 2012 featuring major
exhibits dedicated to ISS and the
National Laboratory; and
Whereas, the Great Lakes Science
Center
has
also
committed
to
advancing the connectivity of STEM
for
ISS,
nationally,
through
its
active board position with the American Science and Technology Centers (ASTC), a professional organization of over 250 science centers
worldwide; and
Whereas, lastly, recognizing the
large potential economic impact of
the ISS NL headquarters being located in Northeast Ohio, the Ohio
Department of Development, the
City of Cleveland, Cuyahoga County, and other civic economic development entities in Ohio have demonstrated strong support for our proposal to NASA; and
Whereas, the regions commitment
to provide more than $6 million in
financial and in-kind support for the
ISS NL significantly strengthens the
ability of SLA to manage the ISS NL
program; and
Whereas, if NASA selects the
Cleveland-based
proposal
next
month, SLA will build headquarters
at 7000 Euclid Avenue, in Ward 5
near the Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals, and next to the
128,000-square-foot MidTown Tech
Park now under construction at
East 69th Street between Euclid and
Carnegie Avenues; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports Space Laboratory Associates, a
joint non-profit entity of Universities
Space Research Association and Battelle, in efforts to gain NASA approval
of their headquarters in Cleveland to
manage the International Space Station National Laboratory.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 144-11.
By Council Members Kelley and
Sweeney (by departmental request).
An emergency resolution authorizing participation by Cleveland Public
Power customers in demand response
programs in the PJM Interconnection
LLC market and determining the initial criteria and conditions governing
such participation.
Whereas, Cleveland Public Power
(CPP) is a member of the PJM Interconnection LLC, (PJM) a regional
transmission organization that operates the region’s electric transmission grid, provides transmission services to its members, and operates
regional markets for capacity, energy
and other electricity services; and
Whereas, as required by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC), PJM has adopted “Demand
Response” programs that allow customers to offer to reduce their electricity use in certain circumstances
including during an emergency
event; and
Whereas, currently a customer’s
Demand Response may be offered
into PJM’s markets if the Demand
Response resource meets PJM’s technical requirements and if the laws or
regulations of the relevant electric
retail regulatory authority (RERRA)
permit such offers; and

The City Record
Whereas, retail customers participate in Demand Response in PJM
through members called curtailment
service providers (CSPs), who act as
agents for the customers; and
Whereas, under PJM’s Demand
Response program, a customer whose
Demand Response registration is
approved is entitled to be compensated for being on call and ready to
reduce energy usage on request; and
Whereas, CPP customers will be eligible to participate in the PJM
Demand Response programs beginning June 1, 2011, and CPP desires to
provide its customers with the opportunity to do so; and
Whereas, in the case of utilities
(such as CPP) that distributed 4 million megawatt-hours or less in the
previous fiscal year, a CSP may register Demand Response as resources in
the PJM markets only with the permission of the utility’s RERRA,
which for CPP is this Council; and
Whereas, this Council has determined that it is desirable to authorize
the participation of CPP retail customers, acting through a CSP, in
PJM’s Demand Response programs,
provided that the CSP satisfies eligibility criteria and certain other specified requirements that are deemed
necessary to protect other CPP customers and the CPP system from
adverse effects; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council establishes the following procedures for
authorization of a Curtailment Service Provider (CSP) to register enduse customer Demand Response capability in the markets operated by PJM
Interconnection, L.L.C. beginning
June 1, 2011:
(a) The aggregate amount of
Demand Response capability that
may be offered into PJM’s Demand
Response programs by all CSPs shall
not exceed 30 megawatts at any given
time, unless the 30 megawatt limit is
waived by CPP in its discretion.
(b) Registrations to participate in
PJM’s Demand Response programs
shall be processed in the order
received until the aggregate amount
of Demand Response capability that
cleared the market (not to exceed 30
megawatts) is reached, after which
no further registrations may be
accepted by PJM or CPP, unless the 30
megawatt limit is waived by CPP. If a
CSP cancels a previously approved
PJM Demand Response registration,
or if the CSP or a customer’s participation in PJM’s Demand Response
programs is terminated, the difference between 30 megawatts and the
aggregate amount of remaining
Demand Response capability authorized by CPP shall be made available
to other CSPs through notice posted
on CPP’s website.
(c) The Demand Response may be
offered in the PJM market only with
respect to PJM’s Emergency Load
Response Program, including both
the Full Emergency and Capacity
Only Options, and not PJM’s other
markets unless approved by CPP.
(d) The criteria and detailed procedures governing CSP applications for
authorization to participate in PJM’s
Demand Response programs shall be
posted on the CPP website along with

697

31
a list of authorized CSPs and the total
CPP customer load currently subject
to reduction through CSP participation in PJM’s Demand Response programs. CPP may revise the posted criteria and detailed procedures at any
time, as and when CPP may deem it
necessary or appropriate to do so.
(e) (i) A CPP end-use customer that
wishes to register its Demand
Response capability for participation
in the PJM market may do so only
through a CSP that has been authorized, following application to CPP,
to engage in such activity. To obtain
such authorization, a CSP must submit a written application to CPP
using the form for such applications
posted on CPP’s website. The application shall provide, at a minimum, the
following information:
(A) the name, address, and contact
information
for
the
individual
employed by the CSP who is assigned
responsibility for interacting with
CPP regarding customer participation in PJM Demand Response;
(B) complete emergency contact
information for the CSP, if different
from (A);
(C) the registration deadline, if
any, for such program; and
(D) to the extent known at the time
of application, the amount of the enduse customer’s Demand Response
capability that will be registered in
each PJM-operated market.
(ii) A CSP application for authorization also shall include a statement that the CSP is in good standing
with PJM, that the CSP has executed
all necessary PJM documents and has
met all PJM requirements for participation in PJM’s Demand Response
programs, that the CSP has obtained
any and all required state regulatory
authorizations or approvals, and that
the CSP is not the subject of any
active investigation or any complaint
proceeding conducted by or before
any local, state or federal agency,
including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or by the PJM
Independent Market Monitor. If such
an investigation or complaint is pending, CPP may request additional
information to assist in evaluating
the application.
(iii) The authorization of a CSP
granted by CPP shall remain in force
for a period of five (5) years after
which the CSP must submit a renewal
application on a form to be provided
by CPP. During the five-year period a
CSP shall update the information contained in its application, including
increases or decreases in participation by end-use customer(s) in PJM’s
Demand Response programs, as and
to the extent necessary so that the
information contained in the application remains accurate and complete
and so that CPP has a current and
accurate record of the aggregate
demand of all CPP customers participating in PJM programs.
(iv) All information contained in a
CSP application submitted in accordance with these procedures shall be
true, accurate and complete, and shall
be verified as such by the sworn and

receiving a completed application,
CPP shall notify the CSP in writing
whether its application has been
approved.

available to CPP through the PJM

32
(eLRS) all information regarding the

not included in the information posted through eLRS, each CSP also shall
advise CPP of the date and time of
each curtailment directive, the identity of the customers curtailed and the
amount and duration of each such
customer’s curtailment.
(g) CPP’s approval of an application submitted by a CSP hereunder
does not constitute or confer a franchise, grant, exclusive license, or
other property right. Rather, the right
created by CPP’s approval of an application submitted by a CSP hereunder
is in the nature of a revocable nonexclusive license.
(h) If CPP revokes a previously
approved authorization, the participation of any affected end-use customer
in PJM’s Demand Response programs
shall be terminated in a manner consistent with applicable provisions of
the PJM Operating Agreement, the
PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff, and the PJM Reliability Assurance Agreement.
(i) If, at any time after its adoption,
this Resolution is withdrawn by
action of the Council without adoption of superseding procedures, CPP
thereafter shall reject any application submitted by a CSP hereunder.
Further, in such event, the participation in PJM’s Demand Response programs by any end-use customer under
a previously approved CSP application shall be terminated in a manner
consistent with applicable provisions
of the PJM Operating Agreement, the
PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff, and the PJM Reliability Assurance Agreement.
(j) Neither CPP nor the City shall
have any obligation to hold financially harmless any CSP or end use customer that is affected by the withdrawal of this Resolution, the revocation of a previously approved CSP
application, CPP’s revision of its posted criteria or detailed procedures, or
any other action taken by CPP or the
City that is claimed to adversely

requirements.

to submit to the Division of Police
each day the records of transactions
required to be kept under Sections
676.06, 676.061, 676.062 and 676.063 utilizing a computer program to be provided by the Division of Police for use

January 1, 2013 with respect to oils,
shortenings and margarines containing industrially-produced trans fat
that are used for frying or in spreads;
