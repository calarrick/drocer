representative or successor in interest having power to assent thereto.

so accepted shall be evidenced by an
agreement in form prescribed and
approved by the Director of Law, executed by the purchaser in his or her
own behalf and by the Commissioner

and the Director of Finance on behalf
of the City. For the purpose of custody
and investment, but not otherwise,
the principal amount of the trust
funds, whether created prior to the
enactment of this section or under its
terms, shall be treated as a permanent
part of the Cleveland City Cemetery
Endowment Fund. The earnings of
the permanent funds shall be applied
exclusively to the perpetual care and
beautification of the designated lot
for which the funds were accepted.

VENDOR DEBARMENT AND
SUSPENSION POLICY
MAYOR FRANK G. JACKSON
EFFECTIVE DATE: July 20, 2011
Prepared
by:
Department
of
Finance
Sharon
Dumas,
Director
of
Finance
James Hartley, Assistant Director
of Finance
James E. Hardy, Commissioner of
Purchases and Supplies

Direct Questions to: The Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies at
(216) 664-2629
Vendor Debarment and Suspension
Policy
1. General; Purpose of Policy
a) In contracting with private parties to carry out its usual daily operations, the City of Cleveland (the
“City) has legal and ethical responsibilities to its citizens to secure the
best bargain for the goods, services,
labor and materials it needs. For
that reason, the City strives to solicit bids and proposals from and
award contracts only to responsible
and qualified firms or persons. From
time to time, the exercise of due
care requires the City to suspend or
debar, either temporarily or permanently, a defaulting, unfaithful, or
non-performing party to a City contract. The purpose of this document
is to set forth the policies and procedures to be followed in all cases
to determine when and how to suspend or debar a contracting party
(generally, a “Contractor”) and what
conditions apply to a suspension or
debarment.
b) Debarred and suspended Contractors are not eligible to submit
bids, offers, or proposals to, or to
receive any contract from, the City.
Accordingly, a City department may
not solicit or accept a bid, offer, proposal, or other contract prerequisite
from, recommend an award to, or
a
contract
with
any
execute
debarred or suspended contractor.
2. Authority to Debar or Suspend
a) Under Charter Section 108 and
Sections 181.08 and 181.10 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio,
1976 (“C.O.”), the City may award
contracts for the purchase of goods
and services only to a lowest and
best bidder. Under Charter Section
167 and Section 185.01 C.O., contracts
for Public Improvements may be
awarded only to the lowest responsible bidder. Sections 181.27 and
185.08 C.O. both prohibit a contract
award to any person, firm, or corporation that is in arrears to the
City, has defaulted on any debt, contract or obligation owed to the City,
or has failed to perform faithfully
any previous City contract.
b) To carry out the letter and spirit of those sections, the City may
need to investigate the background
and qualifications of persons or
firms doing business with the City
to obtain all information necessary
to make reasoned administrative
decisions, after due process, and
take administrative actions necessary to protect the best interests of
the City, up to and including debarment.
c)
Debarment
and
suspension
have serious consequences for the
debarred or suspended person or
firm and, therefore, should be taken
only when required for protection of
the City’s best interests. These
actions are not to be construed as
punishment. Rather, they are remedies available to the City in addition to, but not as substitutes for,
other remedies such as the rejection
of bids, cancellation of contracts for
non-responsive or irresponsible performance, or filing a claim or an
action for recovery under a contract
or the bond(s) guaranteeing contract performance. The City will

1250

July 27, 2011
also retain all other rights and
remedies it has under any federal,
state, or local statutes or ordinances
and under the contract.
d) Debarment is available with
respect to any type of City contract
or transaction, including but not
limited to public improvement, procurement of goods or services, professional services, concession agreement, or lease, irrespective of the
form, e.g., written contract, purchase
order, electronic, or authorized verbal order. In addition, the City may
debar a firm for a period of up to 2
years for violation or default of its
Cleveland
under
the
obligations
Area Business Code (see C.O. Chapter 187) and for a period of up to 5
years if a Contractor is convicted of
violating the Fannie M. Lewis Cleveland Resident Employment Law
(see C.O. Chapter 188).
3. Authority: The Commissioner of
Purchases and Supplies
a) The Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies (“Commissioner”)
may suspend or debar a Contractor
from eligibility for award of a City
contract as provided in this Policy.
b) When an emergency occurs or
exists requiring an immediate purchase under the authority of Section
181.12 C.O. to prevent an interruption of public service that would
endanger public health, safety or
the
Commissioner
may
welfare,
solicit a bid or an offer from, or
enter into contract with a debarred
or suspended Contractor when no
other reasonably available course of
action is possible.
4. Imputed Liability
a) The City will impute to the
Contractor all liability, and hold a
Contractor liable to the City, for all
acts of an owner, officer, principal,
director, shareholder, partner, agent,
employee, associate, representative,
affiliate, subcontractor, or supplier
of the Contractor, or other person(s)
acting on behalf of the Contractor
in performance of a City contract.
The City will consider a Contractor’s receipt and acceptance of any
benefit derived under or arising out
of performance of a City contract
including, but not limited to, compensation,
as
evidence
of
its
approval, ratification, knowledge of
and/or acquiescence in the act of
any of the above-mentioned persons
that may be a basis for debarment
or suspension.
b) Partnerships/Joint Ventures.
The City will consider the act of one
Contractor in a partnership or a
joint venture or any person in a
relation to it named in sub-section
a) above acting on behalf of that
Contractor as the act of every other
partner or joint venturer.
c) Affiliates. Debarment of a Contractor shall include debarment of
any of its divisions, organizational
elements, or any wholly-owned or
controlled affiliate or subsidiary
that participated in performance of
the City contract.
5. Restrictions on Contracting and
Subcontracting
a) The City will not accept or
approve a bid, proposal, or other
communication intended to be the
basis of a City contract, or enter
into any contract for goods or ser-

The City Record

vices, including professional services, or a public improvement, or
granting a concession, permission,
privilege, or license, or other privilege or right, with a bidder, proposer, or other Contractor, person, or
firm that is debarred or suspended
by the City, the state of Ohio, or the
federal government.
b) The City will not approve for
participation in the performance or
benefits of a City contract or for
grant of a concession, permission,
privilege, or license, or other privilege or right, whether as partner,
affiliate, subcontractor, supplier, or
otherwise, any firm that is debarred
or suspended by the City, the state
of Ohio, or the federal government.
c) The list of Vendors Ineligible
to Contract or Subcontract with the
City may be accessed at:
http://www.city.cleveland.oh.us/
CityofCleveland/Home/Business/
BusinesswithCOC
or may be furnished in other form
upon request to the Commissioner.

www.auditor.state.oh.us/resources
/findings/certified/default.aspx.
The Federal government Excluded Parties List System (EPLS) may
be accessed at:
https://www.epls.gov.
d) The City shall neither accept
nor be liable for any increase in
costs, or other expenses, delay, loss,
or subsequent ineligibility to contract with the City, incurred by a
Contractor as a result of the City
rejecting any proposed person, firm,
partner, affiliate, subcontractor or
supplier that is debarred or suspended after the submission of a
bid, proposal, or other communication leading to a contract, but before
the approval or award of the contract.
6. Reasons
Debarment

for

Suspension

or

a) The City may suspend or debar
a person or firm if any of the following occur within the three (3)
years immediately prior to the City’s
determination to suspend or debar
the person or firm:
1. Conviction of a crime or misdemeanor incident to seeking, executing, or performing a public or private contract or any subcontract to
the public or private contract;
2. Conviction, whether under federal, state or local law, of embezzlement, theft, perjury, forgery, falsification or destruction of records,
receiving stolen property, conflict of
interest or any other offense of
moral turpitude, business ethics,
integrity or honesty;
3. Conviction under federal, state
or local law pertaining to submission of bids or proposals for a public contract;
4. Violation of the ethical standards set forth in the Ohio Revised
Code or any rules, regulations or
code of ethics applicable to the person or firm;
5. Filing of a lawsuit against the
City that a court finds to be frivo-

lous or filed in bad faith;
6. Violation of contract terms, conditions, or provisions, as set forth
below, of a character which the
Commissioner, in consultation with
the contracting department director,
determines to be so serious as to
justify debarment;
7. Failure, absent good cause, to
perform any City contract according
to its specifications, terms, and conditions, including the time to complete performance. A finding of noncompliance by the Director of OEO,
with subsequent notification of the
contractor by OEO and then a failure to correct may be considered a
failure to perform on the contract;
8. A record of repeated failure
within the last three years to perform or of unsatisfactory performance under one or more contracts,
or a recurrence of marginal performance in one or more contracts,
except when the failure to perform
or unsatisfactory performance is
determined by the City to have been
caused by acts beyond control of the
Contractor;
9. Breach of contract or default or
failure to cure deficiencies or discrepancies
in
performance
after
notice and opportunity to cure under
the contract terms; or
10. Any other cause the Commissioner determines to be sufficiently
serious and compelling as to represent lack of good faith or responsibility by a City Contractor including, but not limited to, debarment by
any other governmental entity.
b) The City may suspend or debar,
without additional review, a Contractor or prospective Contractor
currently suspended or debarred by
any of the following:
1. The United States Government
or any agency thereof;
2. The State of Ohio; or
3. Any of the 50 states or any
department,
political
subdivision,
agency, district, or other authority
thereof having jurisdiction and control over Contractor.
7. Period of Debarment
a) The Commissioner shall fix the
debarment period at a specific duration not exceeding five (5) years
from the debarment determination,
according to the guidelines in subsection b) of this section, unless the
reason(s) for debarment remain(s)
fundamentally
unchanged
after
expiration of the debarment period.
In that case, the Commissioner may
extend the debarment period until
occurrence of an event set forth in
Section 15 a) below.
b) Except when the Commissioner determines that mitigating or
aggravating circumstances existed
that justify deviation from the following guidelines, the Commissioner shall fix the debarment period
according to the reason in sub-section 6. a), as follows:
1. Reason 1, 2, or 3 - five (5) years;
2. Reason 4 or 5 - three (3) years;
3. Reason 6, 7, 8 or 9 - two (2)
years; and,
4. Reason 10 - two (2) to five (5)
years, depending upon the circumstances and the gravity of the
cause.
8. Suspension
a) The Commissioner, upon concurrence of the Director of Law,

1251

61
may immediately suspend a Contractor from eligibility for award of
a City contract upon finding probable cause for debarment, pending
the debarment determination. “Probable cause”, as used in this Policy,
means a preponderance of evidence
that
demonstrates
a
reasonable
probability that the facts upon
which suspension is based are true.
The Contractor will be suspended
for the lesser of an initial period of
90 calendar days or until the Commissioner makes a final determination with respect to the debarment.
The Commissioner may extend the
initial suspension period by up to
three (3) additional 30 calendar-day
periods. During the period of suspension, the City will not solicit bids
or proposals from or approve or
award a contract to the suspended
person or firm, and will not open or
consider for a contract any bid or
proposal received.
b) The Commissioner shall send
written notice of suspension, with a
copy of his/her determination, to the
suspended Contractor or prospective
Contractor by certified mail, return
receipt requested, or other method
providing proof of receipt. The
notice shall inform the Contractor of
the provisions in sub-section a)
above.
9. Request for Hearing
A Contractor or prospective Contractor receiving a Notice of Suspension and/or a Notice of Proposed
Debarment may, within 10 calendar
days after receipt of a Notice, submit a written objection and request
for a hearing to the Commissioner.
If the Contractor or prospective Contractor submits a timely request, the
Commissioner will hold a hearing on
the objection within a reasonable
time after receipt of the request, but
not more than 30 days, unless the
Contractor and the Commissioner
agree otherwise. If the Contractor
does not submit a timely objection
and request, it waives any right to
objection or a hearing, and the City
may make a final decision as set
forth in Section 11, Decision.
10. Hearing
The Commissioner shall send a
written notice, by certified mail,
return receipt requested, or other
method providing proof of receipt,
stating the date, time, and place of
the hearing. The Commissioner or
his/her designee shall be the hearing officer. A hearing shall be informal and shall afford the Contractor
a reasonable opportunity to show
why the City should not suspend or
debar Contractor from eligibility to
bid or propose to, or enter into contract with, the City. The Commissioner shall permit the Contractor to
furnish, at a time before or during
the hearing, as the Commissioner
determines, such other documentation as the Contractor wishes to
establish facts relevant to the determination of suspension or debarment.
11. Decision
a) Within ten (10) calendar days
after the hearing, unless circumstances require otherwise or the
Commissioner needs time to investigate further, the Commissioner shall
issue a final written determination

The City Record

62
to the Contractor including a recommendation of any action(s) the
City should take consistent with the
determination and the reasons for
the determination and recommended
action(s). If unable to issue a determination within 10 days, the Commissioner shall give the Contractor
a written notice of delay stating the
reason and when the determination
will issue. The Commissioner shall
concurrently copy the determination
or the delay notice to the contracting department director(s) and the
Director of Law.
b) Existence of reason for debarment of a Contractor does not necessarily require the City to determine to suspend or debar. In determining whether to suspend or debar
a Contractor, the City shall consider the seriousness of the Contractor’s actions or failure to act together with any mitigating factors.
12. Appeal
The decision of the Commissioner
shall be final. The decision may be
appealed in writing to the Board of
Zoning Appeals within ten (10) calendar days after receipt of the decision.
13. List of Vendors Ineligible to
Contract or Subcontract with the
City
a) The Commissioner shall maintain, disseminate, and make publicly
available a current list of debarred
and suspended persons and firms
(List of Vendors Ineligible to Contract or Subcontract with the City
(the “List”)) . The List shall clearly state the name of each suspended or debarred person or firm(s),
the date of the debarment or suspension determination, and the term
of debarment or suspension.
b) The Commissioner will update
the List within three (3) working
days after any official debarment,
suspension or reinstatement action.
c) Publication on the City of
Cleveland website will satisfy the
publication requirements of subsection a) above of this Section.
d) The Commissioner shall establish procedures for the internal distribution and use of the List to
ensure adherence to the policy set
forth in Section 5 above precluding
soliciting, accepting offers from, or
contracting with a debarred or suspended Contractor.
e) The Commissioner may, with
concurrence
of
the
contracting
department
director,
respond
to
inquiries concerning the List.
14. Reduction or Termination of
Debarment Period; Reinstatement
Upon occurrence of an event set
forth in sub-section a) below, a
debarred Contractor may, in writing,
request
that
the
Commissioner
reduce or terminate the debarment
period and, subject to Contractor
first satisfying the requirements of
sub-section b), reinstate the Contractor to eligibility.
a) Upon a debarred Contractor’s
request, the Commissioner, with concurrence of the contracting department director, may reduce or terminate a debarment period by reason
of:

1. Discovery of new material evidence pertaining to the reason(s)
for debarment;
2. Reversal of a conviction or civil
judgment that was the basis for
debarment;
3. Bona fide change in business
ownership; and
4. Cure or elimination of all reafor
which
debarment
was
sons
imposed.
b) Expiration of the debarment
alone does not reinstate a Contractor’s eligibility to contract with the
City. Before granting a Contractor’s
reinstatement request, the Commissioner shall require, as applicable:
1. Prompt and complete financial
restitution to the City, including all
expenses the City incurred to complete any contract on which Contractor has defaulted or breached,
and all interest computed on late
payments;
2. Written proof of completion of
all criminal sentences and payment
of all penalties;
3. Written proof of payment of all
civil penalties imposed, such as
fines or damages;
4. Payment of all currently due
City taxes;
5. Elimination of current suspension or debarment by any other public entity;
6. If a Contractor has had a complete or significant (over 50%)
change of ownership since debarment, proof that all debarred parties
have no financial or management
participation in control or conduct
of Contractor’s business;
7. Three (3) references, at least
one of which must be a public entity, confirming that Contractor has
satisfactorily performed a similar
contract within the immediately preceding two (2) years; and,
8. Evidence of the Contractor’s
financial capacity to perform a City
contract of the type it customarily
would seek, including but not limited to, two (2) years’ audited financial statements or comparable business documents. Access to the Contractor’s place(s) of business must
be provided to City representatives
during usual business hours to visit,
inspect, and evaluate Contractor’s
conduct of business and operational
capacity.
15. Contract Requirement
The Commissioner and all contracting departments shall distribute and disseminate this Policy to
all present and prospective Contractors and subcontractors by reference
in Invitations to Bid and Requests
for Proposals, at all Pre-bid, Pre-proposal, or other similar meetings preceding
a
City
contract,
by
or
through the City’s website, official
City publications, with all notices of
suspension or debarment, or other
means sufficient to enable compliance. After notice of the Policy, a
Contractor is responsible for conforming to the Policy. A Contractor’s
failure or refusal to apprise itself of
or to understand this policy shall
not excuse compliance where it is
required to establish, preserve, or
implement any right or privilege
afforded or sought under it.
