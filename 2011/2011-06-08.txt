Res. No. 841-11.
By Mayor Jackson and Council
Members Reed, J. Johnson, Cimperman, Westbrook, Polensek, Brancatelli, Mitchell, Zone, Cleveland, Kelley, Keane and Brady.
An emergency resolution endorsing
a Healthy Cleveland through violence
prevention strategies to improve the
public health of Cleveland and individual Clevelanders.
Whereas, in Resolution No. 257–11,
adopted on March 28, 2011, this Council and Mayor Jackson endorsed a
partnership with the four hospital
systems in Cleveland to create a
Healthy Cleveland with healthy
neighborhoods and residents who
enjoy longer and healthier lives by
combating chronic health conditions
like chronic pulmonary disease, heart
disease, diabetes, obesity and behavioral health; and
Whereas, this Healthy Cleveland
initiative addresses smoking cessation, diet and nutrition, exercise and
mobility issues, and behavioral and
mood disorders; and
Whereas, in addition to these
important health issues, violence is a
real and present threat to the health
and lives of many Cleveland residents, especially disproportionately
people of color;
Whereas, in the City of Cleveland
alone, there were 6,451 violent crimes
committed in 2009; and
Whereas, violence is among the
leading causes of death for people
aged 15 to 44 years worldwide, and
violence also contributes significantly to post-traumatic stress, permanent
injury, and morbidity; and
Whereas, in 1998 approximately 2.3
million people died worldwide as a
result of violence; and
Whereas, many more people die
from homicide than from attack in a
war, and even more die from suicide;
worldwide for every death due to war,
there are three deaths due to homicide
and five deaths due to suicide; and
Whereas, we must address behavioral and mood disorders of perpetrators in order to prevent violence, as
well as the psychological and physical impact on victims and their families of violence and resulting mental
health issues; and
Whereas, while African Americans
comprise 14% of the United States
population, 43% of all murder victims
in 2007 were African American, 93.1%
of whom were killed by African Americans; and
Whereas, African American males
between the ages of 18 and 35 have a
40 to 50% chance they will either die
or be incarcerated by their 36th birthday as a result of a shooting, violent
crime or murder; and
Whereas, the effects of violence
extend far beyond the impact on individuals’ health and livelihoods – they
shape the well-being and social fabric
of families and communities, and can
have a negative impact on a city’s economic prospects; and
Whereas, each year, nearly $4.5 billion is spent nationally on healthcare
related to violence, including burial
costs, counseling services, healthcare
costs, property damage, lost jobs and
lost industry; and
Whereas, alcohol and drug addictions significantly contribute to the
commission of violent crime; and
Whereas, though violence is pervasive, evidence suggests that the factors
that
contribute
to
violent
responses – whether they are factors

28
of attitude and behavior or related to
larger social, economic, political and
cultural conditions – can be changed,
and that violence can be prevented;
and
Whereas, the World Health Organization has documented scientific evidence that the following interventions effectively prevent violence: 1)
developing safe, stable, and nurturing relationships between children
and their parents and caregivers
through home visiting programs and
child-rearing education; 2) developing life skills in children and adolescents; 3) reducing the availability
and harmful use of alcohol by reducing the number of alcohol retail outlets and offering interventions and
treatment for problem drinkers; 4)
reducing access to guns and knives
through enforced bans on carrying
firearms in public; and 5) promoting
gender equality to prevent violence
against women through school and
community interventions and education; and
Whereas, the City will collaborate
with local health institutions, agencies and advocates to study the cost of
healthcare related to violence in
Cleveland; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
encourages public-private partnerships, including local health care
institutions, social service agencies,
and local schools, to create solutions
responding to the causes and impacts
of violence; and
Whereas, the City will collaborate
with local health institutions and
public safety groups to identify and
secure funding for proven anti-violence programs and activities, including sports, recreation centers, arts
and music, and mentoring programs;
and
Whereas, in collaboration with the
City’s Departments of Public Safety
and Public Health, Cleveland City
Council’s Public Safety and Health
committees will ensure the existence
of neighborhood-based anti-violence
projects, such as surveillance cameras, street club development, and
mentoring programs including the
Police Athletic League; and
Whereas, in collaboration with
Mayor Jackson, local health institutions, the City’s Community Relations
Department, and Boys and Girls Club
of Cleveland, Cleveland City Council’s Health and Human Services committee will hold the Second Healthy
Cleveland Summit in September to
address violence prevention strategies to improve the public health of
Clevelanders; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council endorses a Healthy Cleveland through violence
prevention
strategies
to
improve the public health of Cleveland and individual Clevelanders.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it

and

An emergency resolution disagreeing with the Cleveland Clinic in its
announcement that it intends to close
Huron Hospital in the next 90 days.
Whereas, the Cleveland Clinic
announced today that it would be
closing Huron Hospital in East Cleveland in 90 days; and
Whereas,
when
the
Clinic
announced the closing of the level 2
trauma center at Huron Hospital last
October, it stated that it had no intention to close the entire hospital facility; and
Whereas, the closing of Huron Hospital will negatively impact the
entire east side of the City of Cleveland, both medically and economically, placing a tremendous burden on
Cleveland’s critical care protocols for
Fire and EMS; and
Whereas, in 2010 Cleveland EMS
transported 3,000 patients to Huron
Road Hospital, with 800 of these

984

June 8, 2011
patients being transported for emergency trauma care; and,
Whereas, that the Clinic chose to
close Huron Hospital with little
advance notice shows the disingenuousness of its previous negotiations
with the City regarding the closing of
the level 2 trauma center there and its
blatant disregard of the ramifications
of the closing of the entire hospital on
the citizens living in the Glenville
and Collinwood communities on the
east side of the City of Cleveland, as
well as on the people of the entire City
of Cleveland and of East Cleveland;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council overwhelmingly disagrees with Cleveland
Clinic in its announcement that it
intends to close the vital Huron Road
Hospital in 90 days.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council

Section 535.21 Charges for Unmetered Fire Protection Service within the City and Direct Service Metropolitan
Area
Water shall be furnished to an unmetered fire protection service connection only for fire protection, testing and
maintenance purposes. A charge shall be made for each unmetered fire supply connection within the limits of
the City and direct service suburbs. The charge shall be determined by the size of the fire supply connection
through which water passes for use on the premises so supplied at the rate for unmetered fire line service under
Section 535.06 (p) of the Codified Ordinances. Unauthorized water use through unmetered fire protection service
connections shall be billed and charged at the additional MCF rate in the applicable service district. Additional
penalties and charges based on consumption may be charged for unauthorized uses of an unmetered fire protection service connection.
Charges shall be collected monthly or quarterly for each fire supply connection to cover inspection, testing,
sealing and resealing of such service connections, stand-by pumpage capacity, and replacement or cleaning of distribution or trunk water mains to improve the water supply for fire protection purposes.
Section 535.24 Charges for Water from Fire Hydrants
(a) In addition to other charges, if water is used from a public fire hydrant, upon special permit only, a charge
for the permit and a hydrant rental must be paid in advance under Section 535.06 of the Codified Ordinances. A
separate permit shall be issued for each hydrant which shall identify its location.
(b) Water may be furnished from a fire hydrant for any special purpose authorized by the Commissioner of
the Division of Water. The charge for water so furnished shall be at the additional MCF rate under Section 535.04
for the service district in which the fire hydrant is located. The quantity of water used may be estimated by the
Commissioner based on information provided by the user as to the user’s purpose and needs, or the Commissioner
may require the installation of a meter at the connection to the hydrant to be used, in which event the user shall
pay the cost of installing the meter and the cost of all water measured.
