The selection of the consultants for

Res. No. 1226-11.
By Council Members Brancatelli,
Reed, Cummins, Keane, Cimperman,
Polensek, Zone, Kelley, J. Johnson,
Cleveland, Pruitt, Mitchell, Brady,
Westbrook, Sweeney and Miller.
An emergency resolution strongly
supporting the renewal and reauthorization of the Clean Ohio Fund, and
urging the Ohio legislature to reinstate full funding to all four components of the Clean Ohio Program:
Clean Ohio Revitalization Fund,

September 14, 2011
Clean Ohio Agricultural Easement
Purchase Program, Clean Ohio Green
Space Conservation Program, and
Clean Ohio Trails Fund.
Whereas, the Clean Ohio Fund is a
$400 million state bond initiative
approved by Ohio voters in 2000 and
overwhelmingly renewed in all 88
counties in 2008 with strong bipartisan support from the executive and
legislative leadership; and
Whereas, the Governor and Ohio
legislature are considering limiting
the bond authorization and, in particular, the “Green Field” capital appropriations in the Clean Ohio Program;
and
Whereas, the Clean Ohio Fund is a
public-private partnership, the program invests in local communities by
preserving green space and farmland,
improving outdoor recreation, and
cleaning up brown fields; and
Whereas, the Clean Ohio Green
Space Conservation appropriations
have been vital to the City of Cleveland’s redevelopment efforts in making the city competitive with other
national urban areas with high quality open space and outdoor recreational areas; and
Whereas, all 88 counties have
received Clean Ohio funding, resulting in projects that have stimulated
local economies while simultaneously
attracting private capital investments; and
Whereas, in the City of Cleveland,
the Clean Ohio Greenfield projects
have supported the development of
Canal Basin Park, the Lake Link
Trail & Greenway Corridor, the Cuyahoga American Heritage River Habitat Restoration and the Towpath
Trail-Harvard Avenue to Steelyard
Commons; and
Whereas, many of the Cleveland
recreational trail projects are not yet
completed and had assumed future
funding from the Clean Ohio Program
for completion; and
Whereas, the Clean Ohio Fund has
been credited with creating close to
15,000 jobs, and leveraged additional
investments in the State of Ohio to
create a total economic impact of
approximately $2.6 billion in public
and private investments to date; and,
Whereas, renewal of the Clean Ohio
Fund would help keep Ohio economically viable, environmentally sound,
and poised for the future, while maintaining and enhancing the quality of
life of all Ohioans; and,
Whereas, for these reasons, we
strongly urge the General Assembly
to approve a capital appropriation for
all of the programs of the Clean Ohio
Fund so that this investment can continue to contribute to the state’s economy and quality of life of all of its citizens; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Cleveland City
Council strongly supports the renewal and reauthorization of the Clean
Ohio Fund, and urges the Ohio legislature to reinstate full funding to
all four components of the Clean
Ohio Program: Clean Ohio Revitalization Fund, Clean Ohio Agricultural Easement Purchase Program,
Clean Ohio Green Space Conservation Program, and Clean Ohio Trails
Fund.

An emergency resolution supporting Cuyahoga County Executive Ed
FitzGerald’s effort to continue the
vote by mail program.
Whereas, since 2006 the Cuyahoga
County Board of Elections has regularly mailed ballot applications to
about 650,000 voters; and
Whereas, in Cuyahoga County, 47%
of people who voted in the 2010 general election cast absentee ballots; and
Whereas, Cuyahoga County Executive Ed FitzGerald defended the voteby-mail program, saying it has simplified voting for thousands of residents,
including senior citizens who have
trouble getting to voting sites; it has
also helped the county avoid situations outside the polls like long lines
and waiting times from voters; and
Whereas, a controversial state law
will prevent county boards of election
from paying return postage on applications or paying postage for completed ballots unless efforts to trigger
a referendum are successful; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports Cuyahoga County Executive
Ed FitzGerald’s effort to continue
the vote by mail program.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to transmit a copy of this
resolution to County Executive Ed
FitzGerald.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency

approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from

Donald Payne (New Jersey – 10), is a
comprehensive approach to addressing the obesity crisis by improving
the quality of and access to food,
advancing preventative measures,
expanding treatment of obesity in
children, and encouraging physical
activity in underserved communities;
and
Whereas, one in three children are
obese or overweight, and this bill
addresses many of the factors that
impact the high rate of obesity specifically in minority communities, such

places to exercise, according to Congresswoman Fudge; and
Whereas, the legislation has support from more than 20 organizations,
including the American College of
Sports Medicine, American Beverage
Association, and America SCORES
Cleveland; and
Whereas, citing the fact that our
country spends almost $150 billion per
year to treat obesity-related conditions in adults, Congresswoman
Fudge says, “this bill addresses
excess costs through preventative
measures and altering external circumstances to reduce the number of
children who will become obese,
therefore reducing the likelihood
they will become obese adults”; and
Whereas, this legislation tackles
the lack of supermarkets in underserved communities by creating a program to award grants to local partnerships to establish or enhance
existing supermarkets that sell fresh
fruits and produce in low income communities located in food deserts; and
Whereas, it also expands the Fresh
Fruit and Vegetable Program, by
amending the National School Lunch
Act to include secondary schools,
child care centers, and family child
care homes, while increasing access
to the Summer Food Service Programs for Children; and
Whereas, this Council, together
with Mayor Jackson, created the
Healthy Cleveland Initiative by Resolution No. 257-11, passed February 28,
2011, and supports the efforts of the
Fit for Life Act of 2011 to combat
childhood obesity especially in under-

20
served communities through preventative health; and
Whereas, this Council also supports
U.S. House of Representatives Resolution 339, also introduced by Congresswoman Fudge, designating September 2011 as National Childhood Obesity Awareness Month; and
Whereas, during National Childhood Obesity Awareness Month this
September, parents, schools, and
health care providers will promote fitness and nutrition for our kids; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety, now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
