FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES REFERRED
Ord. No. 1431-11.
By Mayor Jackson and Council
Members Brancatelli, Cleveland, J.
Johnson, Mitchell, Dow, Zone and
Sweeney.
An emergency ordinance to extend
the moratorium on the review and
issuance of zoning permits, certificates of occupancy, and other license
or permit applications for internet
sweepstakes operations in the City of
Cleveland.
Whereas, under Ordinance No. 136710, passed October 10, 2010, this Council declared a moratorium on the
review and issuance of zoning permits, certificates of occupancy, and
other license or permit applications

1648

for internet sweepstakes operations
in the City of Cleveland, until April
18, 2011; and
Whereas, under Ordinance No. 50811, passed April 11, 2011, this Council
extended the moratorium declared by
Ordinance No. 1367-10 until October 24,
2011; and
Whereas, this Council is considering an ordinance to regulate internet
sweepstakes operations including
their classification under the City’s
zoning code, and possible regulations
associated with their activities,
including but not limited to spacing
requirement, parking requirements
and hours of operation; and;
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure for the immediate preservation of the public peace,
property, health, safety, or welfare in
that an extension of the moratorium
on such internet sweepstakes operations for another six month period
will allow Council to continue to consider reasonable regulations of internet sweepstakes operations; now,
therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the moratorium on
the review and issuance of zoning
permits, certificates of occupancy,
and other license or permit applications for internet sweepstakes operations in the City of Cleveland
declared under Ordinance No. 136710 passed October 18, 2010, is hereby extended until the effective date
of an ordinance or law regulating
internet sweepstakes operations, or
until April 24, 2012, whichever date
occurs first.
Section 2. That, as used in this ordinance, “internet sweepstakes operations” shall have the same meaning as
in Ordinance 1367-10.
Section 3. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately upon its passage and approval
by the Mayor; otherwise it shall take
effect and be in force from and after
the earliest period allowed by law.

Ord. No. 1432-11.
By Council Member Sweeney (by

61152 with AT & T for Centrex support,
maintenance,

design, and repair of circuits, special
circuits, relocation of demarcation

Whereas, under the authority of

No. 403-08, passed April 7, 2008, the
Director of Finance entered into Contract Nos. 61149, 61150, 61151, and
61152 with AT & T for Centrex support,
maintenance,
installation,
design, and repair of circuits, special

Whereas, Ordinance No. 1881-07,
passed November 26, 2007, as amended
by Ordinance No. 403-08, passed April
7, 2008, requires further legislation
before exercising the fourth one-year
option to renew each of these contracts; and

October 12, 2011
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of

Section 5. That the cost of the services to be performed during the
