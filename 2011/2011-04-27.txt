ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS

Res. No. 543-11.
By Council Member Kelley.
An emergency resolution withdrawing objection to the renewal of a
D1, D2, D3 and D3A Liquor Permit at
3314 Broadview Road, 1st floor and
basement, and repealing Resolution
No. 1107-10, objecting to said renewal.
Whereas, this Council objected to
a D1, D2, D3 and D3A Liquor Permit to 3314 Broadview Road, 1st
floor and basement by Resolution
No. 1107-10 adopted by the Council
on August 18, 2010; and
Whereas, this Council wishes to
withdraw its objection to the above
renewal and consents to said renewal; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That objection to a D1,
D2, D3 and D3A Liquor Permit to N
Yuk Yuk’s Bar & Grill, Inc., DBA N
Yuk N Yuk’s, 3314 Broadview Road,

the same is hereby repealed and that
this Council consents to the immediate renewal thereof.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency

upon
its

Adopted April 18, 2011.
Effective April 21, 2011.

Res. No. 544-11.
By Council Members Brancatelli,
Westbrook, Zone and Conwell.
An emergency resolution opposing
Sub. S.B. 17 that would allow concealed weapons in bars, restaurants
other liquor permit premises.
Whereas, last week, the Ohio Senate passed Sub. S.B. 17, allowing
concealed weapons in any premises
that have been issued a liquor permit, including carry outs, restaurants, nightclubs, clubs, hotels, shopping malls, marinas, museums and
sports stadiums; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that allowing concealed weapons in
establishments such as these will
not make workers or clientele any
more safe or secure; and
Whereas, this council encourages
the Ohio House to use common sense
and vote no on this bill because passage would make liquor permit
premises unsafe and make patronizing these establishments risky and
dangerous; and
Whereas, Sub. S. B. 17 is solidly
opposed by the Ohio Association of

Chiefs of Police, the Fraternal Order
of Police and by the Ohio Restaurant Association; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby
opposes Sub. S.B. 17 that would allow
concealed weapons in bars, restaurants other liquor permit premises.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby directed to transmit copies
of this resolution to Governor John
Kasich and all members of the Ohio
legislature.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immeupon
its
adoption
and
diately
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted April 18, 2011.
Effective April 21, 2011.

Res. No. 553-11.
By Mayor Jackson and Council
Member Zone.
An emergency resolution establishing a Citywide taskforce to 1) plan
how the City of Cleveland facilities
will accept and dispose of phone
books in a way that reduces waste
and encourages recycling, 2) educate
residents on ways to stop the delivery
of unwanted phone books, 3) study
the economic benefits that phone
books provide to the small and midsized businesses of Cleveland, and 4)
study if legislative solutions are
needed to reduce the volume of
unwanted phone books and the costs
associated with disposing of phone
books.
Whereas, unwanted phone books
create a tremendous amount of
waste and cost the City of Cleveland
approximately $37,000 in 2010 to dispose of 1,100 tons of phone books in
land-fills; and
Whereas, in an age when the
internet is used increasingly as a
method
of
information-gathering,
phone books continue to provide
small and mid-sized Cleveland businesses with an effective means of
promoting their businesses and providing vital information to consumers; and
Whereas, similar to other opt-out
programs with which consumers are
familiar, the phone book industry
has
created
www.yellowpagesoptout.com as a single site that permits citizens to stop future directory deliveries; and
Whereas, voluntary industry and
individual
publisher
efforts
to
reduce waste have resulted in significant reductions in paper usage
over the past four years; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
recognizes that after learning of
efforts by phone book publishers to
address the unwanted delivery of
phone books, some municipalities

640

April 27, 2011
and states have rejected a legislative approach to the issue; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
also recognizes that other municipalities, such as Seattle and San
Francisco, have introduced legislation creating opt-out programs, optin programs, bans on unsolicited distribution,
and
reimbursement
requirements for publishers to cities
for the cost of disposing and recycling,
and
presently
Cambridge,
Massachusetts is studying these initiatives; and
Whereas, demonstrating its commitment to reduce waste, the City of
Cleveland
instituted
a
curb-side
recycling program in 2007 that will
be expanded in the third quarter of
2011 to include 40% of Cleveland
residents; and
Whereas, although phone books
are
not
currently
disposed
of
through Cleveland’s recycling program, the City coordinates with the
Cuyahoga County Solid Waste District to offer a phone book round-up
program from June 1st through September 30th annually at dumpsters
in
twelve
Cleveland
Metroparks
locations in Cuyahoga County; and
Whereas, this Council and representatives from the Jackson Administration’s Office of Sustainability,
Division of Waste Collection, and
Department of Law, Cuyahoga County Solid Waste District, and AT&T
will study ways for the City and residents to reduce phone book waste;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council establishes a Citywide taskforce to 1) plan
how the City of Cleveland facilities
will accept and dispose of phone
books in a way that reduces waste
and encourages recycling, 2) educate
residents on ways to stop the delivery
of unwanted phone books, 3) study
the economic benefits that phone
books provide to the small and midsized businesses of Cleveland, and 4)
study if legislative solutions are
needed to reduce the volume of
unwanted phone books and the costs
associated with disposing of phone
books.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is directed to send copies of this resolution to the Product Stewardship
Institute Inc., The Yellow Pages
Association, AT&T, Cuyahoga County Solid Waste District, Cuyahoga
County Managers and Mayors Association, County Executive Ed Fitzgerald, and Zero Waste NEO.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force immediately
upon
its
adoption
and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force from
and after the earliest period allowed

later than fourteen days prior to adoption of this ordinance; and
Whereas, under Ordinance No. 94895, passed June 19, 1995, this Council
designated an area, which is in the

Revised Code; and
Whereas, Midtown Acquisition,
LLC, or its designee (the “Enterprise”) has proposed to redevelop a
large vacant building at 6900 and 7000
Euclid Avenue in the Cleveland Area
Enterprise Zone; and
Whereas, the Enterprise has certified to the City that it would be at a
competitive disadvantage operating
at this location if taxes on certain real
property improvements located at
6900 and 7000 Euclid Avenue were not
abated; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the immediate preservation of the
public peace, safety, property, and
welfare and that its enactment is a
necessary prerequisite to providing
immediate assistance to create and
preserve
job
opportunities
and
advance and promote commercial and
economic development in the City of

immediately necessary or jobs will be
lost; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of the
City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this

of the City of Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Director of Economic Development is authorized to
enter into an Enterprise Zone Agreement with the Enterprise to provide
for a ten-year, sixty percent (60%)
tax abatement for real property
improvements located at 6900 and
7000 Euclid Avenue; provided that if
the project site does not become certified to be “LEED Silver” within three
years of the effective date of this ordinance, then the authorized abatement
will decrease to 50% for the remainder of the ten-year period; the abatement shall be subject to annual
review of the Tax Incentive Review
Council.
Section 3. That the terms of the tax
abatement shall be in accordance
with the terms in the Summary contained in File No. 421-11-B. These
terms shall not be amended, nor shall
the tax abatement be assignable or
transferable to any entity, without
the prior legislative authorization by
Cleveland City Council.
Section 4. That the Director of Economic Development is authorized to
charge and accept fees in an amount
not to exceed the maximum allowable
under Chapter 5709 of the Revised
Code and the funds are appropriated

of the Revised Code. The fees shall be
deposited to and expended from Fund
No. 17 SF 305.
Section 5. That the contract and
other appropriate documents needed
to complete the transaction authorized by this legislation shall be prepared by the Director of Law.
Section 6. That any contract authorized by this legislation must require
the recipient of financial assistance

The City Record
to work with, and/or cause their Tenants to work with, The Workforce
Investment Board for Workforce
Area No. 3 to identify and solicit qualified candidates for job opportunities
related to the City’s contracts. The
identification process shall place special emphasis on the hard to employ,
including people who are disabled
and people who have been convicted
of or who have pled guilty to a criminal offense which is unrelated to the
duties of the job opportunity.
Section 7. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure
and, provided it receives the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to Council, it shall take
effect and be in force immediately
upon its passage and approval by the
Mayor; otherwise it shall take effect
