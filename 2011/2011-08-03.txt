improper use of social media to
induce persons to commit a criminal
offense.
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
seeks to discourage the use of social
media to induce unruly flash mob
activity and induce persons to commit a criminal offense; and
Whereas, after unruly flash mobs
organized through social media in
Cleveland Heights, Shaker Heights,
and Cleveland, Cuyahoga County
sheriff Bob Reid’s office is seeking
tips about flash mob activity to coordinate with local police; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
Department of Public Safety is also
seeking tips about flash mob activity to provided appropriate police
response; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, are hereby supplemented
by enacting new Section 605.091 to
read as follows:
Section 605.091 Improper Use of
Social Media
No person shall use social media
to induce persons to commit the
offense described in Codified Ordinance Sections 605.01 Riot, 605.02
Failure to Disperse, 605.03 Disorderly
Conduct;
Intoxication,
and/or
605.09 Unlawful Congregation.
Whoever violates this section is
guilty of improper use of social
media, a minor misdemeanor.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

I return to you Ordinance No. 101211, disapproved and with my veto
noted thereon.
Ordinance No. 1012-11 enacts new
Codified Ordinance Section 605.191 to
prohibit the use of social media so
as to induce persons to commit certain criminal offenses. The ordinance was introduced and passed on
one reading under suspension of
Council’s rules without any public
committee hearings or the benefit of
public comment from law enforce-

ment or interested members of the
community. Passing legislation under
suspension is sometimes an appropriate and necessary tool.
I am sympathetic with the goal of
the Council to identify appropriate
tools to deal with the increasing
occurrence of unlawful mob activity
fueled by the proliferation of cell
phone use and other technology to
communicate quickly with large
numbers of people. However, like
any criminal prohibition, the law
needs to be narrowly tailored to
combat the illegal activity, be an
effective deterrent to wrongdoers,
and not unduly interfere with the
rights of law-abiding citizens.
Numerous legal and policy concerns have been expressed regarding the new criminal offense enacted by Ordinance No. 1012-11. Even
prior to its introduction and passage, the Law Department raised
and expressed concerns to City
Council’s attorney about:

• The need for an additional
criminal offense when unlawful
activity such as riot, disorderly
conduct and unlawful congregation are already prohibited in
the criminal code;

August 3, 2011
In the meantime and for the above
reasons, I hereby veto Ordinance No.
1012-11.
Sincerely,
Frank G. Jackson
Mayor

• The lack of clarity in the use
of the term “social media;” and,

Received.

• The enforceability of the new
code section.

COUNCIL COMMITTEE
MEETINGS

For these reasons, the Law Department was not supportive of the
ordinance.

Wednesday, August 3, 2011
10:00 a.m.

The members of my Administration stand ready to work with the
Council to explore effective tools for
dealing with these issues should the
Council sponsors decide to reintroduce an ordinance and hold public
hearings to publically discuss the
scope of the problem and any legal
or policy concerns with the proposed
legislation.
