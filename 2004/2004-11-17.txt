(a) Except as otherwise provided
in division (b), for taxable years
beginning on or after January 1,
2004, the net profits from a business
or profession conducted both within
and without the City shall be considered as having a taxable situs in
the City for purposes of imposing
the city income tax to the extent of
the amount determined by multiplying the entire net profits by a business allocation percent determined
by the average ratio of the following:
(1) The average original cost of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer
in the business or profession in the
City during the taxable period to the
average original cost of all the real
and
tangible
personal
property
owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during
the same period, wherever situated.
As used in this division (a)(1),
“real
property”
means
property
rented or leased by the taxpayer
and the value of such property shall
be determined by multiplying the
annual rental thereof by eight (8).
(2) Wages, salaries and other
compensation paid during the taxable period to persons employed in
the business or profession for services performed in the City to
wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the same period
to persons employed in the business

or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the City to gross
receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales and services, wherever made
or performed.
(b) In the event that the foregoing apportionment formula does not
produce an equitable result, another
basis may be substituted, under uniform rules and regulations, so as to
produce an equitable result.
(c) For taxable years beginning
on or after January 1, 2004, no taxpayer shall use the books and
records method of apportionment.
Except as otherwise provided in Section 718.02 of the Revised Code, all
taxpayers shall use the statutory
apportionment formula set forth in
this Chapter.
Section 191.0702 Sales Made in
the City
As used in Section 191.0701(a)(3),

regardless of where title passes if
shipped or delivered from a stock of
goods within the City;
(b) All sales of tangible personal
property delivered within the City
regardless of where title passes

solicitation or promotion; or
(c) All sales of tangible personal
property shipped from a place within the City to purchasers outside of
the City regardless of where title
passes if the taxpayer is not,

Section 191.0703 Total Allocation
Add together the percentages determined in accordance with Section
191.0701(a), or such of the aforesaid
percentages as are applicable to the
particular taxpayer, and divide the
total so obtained by the number of
percentages used in deriving the
total in order to obtain the business

A factor is applicable even though
it may be allocable entirely within
or without the City.

(a) Rental income received by a
taxpayer shall be included in the
computation of net profits from
business activities under divisions

if and to the extent that the rental,
ownership, management or operations of the real estate from which
such rentals are derived, whether so
rented, managed or operated by a
taxpayer individually or through
agents or other representatives, constitutes a business activity of the
taxpayer in whole or in part.
(b) Where the gross monthly
rental of any and all real properties,
regardless of number and value,
aggregates in excess of one hundred
twenty-five
dollars
($125.00)
per
month, it shall be prima-facie evidence that the rental, ownership,
management or operation of such
properties, is a business activity of
such taxpayer, and the net income

2218

November 17, 2004
of such rental property shall be subject to tax. However, in the case of
commercial
property,
the
owner
shall be considered engaged in a
business activity when the rental is

receipts or profits, of the lessee,
whether or not such rental exceeds
one
hundred
twenty-five
dollars
($125.00) per month; provided further that in the case of farm property, the owner shall be considered

month. It is provided further that
the person who operates a licensed
rooming house shall be considered
in business whether or not the gross
income exceeds one hundred twentyfive dollars per month ($125.00).

in division (d) of this section, for
taxable years beginning on or after

the same taxable year provided that,
the requirements of Section 718.051

that net profits are not properly
allocated to the City by reason of
transactions with stockholders or
with other corporations related by
stock ownership, interlocking directorates or transactions with such

other municipality allows a credit to
its non-residents, and the rate of
Cleveland’s municipal income tax is
less than two and one-half percent
(2.5%), such resident may claim a
credit of the amount of income tax
paid to the other municipality, but
not in excess of fifty percent (50%)
of the tax imposed by this chapter.
When a resident is subject to and
has paid a municipal income tax in
another municipality on the same
income taxable under this chapter
regardless of whether such other
municipality allows a credit to its
non-residents and the rate of Cleveland’s municipal income tax is two
and one-half percent (2.5%) or more,
such resident may claim a credit of
the amount of income tax paid to
the other municipality, which credit
shall not exceed the tax assessed by
this chapter on the resident’s taxable income subject to tax by another municipality.
(b) In the event a resident is entitled to credit for taxes paid another municipality, such resident is
required to file a return on a form
in such manner as the Tax Administrator may prescribe.
(c) Assignment of any claim for
refund to which a resident may be
entitled from another municipality
shall be tentatively accepted as payment of that portion of city income
tax represented by such assignment.
However, if satisfactory evidence is
offered that the taxpayer is entitled
to the claim covered by the assignment, such taxpayer shall not be
deprived of credit therefor because
of fault or neglect on the part of
either municipality.
(d) In the event such resident
fails, neglects or refuses to file such
return or form as is prescribed by
the Tax Administrator, such resident shall not be entitled to such
credit and shall be considered in violation of this chapter for failure to
file a return and make payment of
taxes due hereunder.
(e) A resident owner of a passthrough entity that does not conduct
business in the City and that has
paid an income tax to another
municipality may claim a credit
equal to the lesser of (i) the resident owner’s proportionate share of

2222

November 17, 2004
the amount, if any, of income tax
paid by the pass-through entity to
another municipality in the State;
(ii) the resident owner’s proportionate share of the amount of city
income tax that would be imposed
on the pass-through entity if the
pass-through entity conducted business in the City.

where such nonresident resides, no
credit against the city income tax
levied by this chapter shall be
allowed.

and void and the resident shall be
liable for the full amount of tax
assessed by this chapter, together

An emergency ordinance disapproving Adelphia’s Proposed Monthly Network Upgrade Surcharge
Whereas, Cleveland Adelphia LLC,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adelphia Communications Corporation
(collectively, “Adelphia”), has the
right to own, operate and maintain
a cable system in the City of Cleveland, Ohio (the “City”) pursuant to
a franchise agreement granted on or
about September 16, 1986, as further
amended; and
Whereas,
in
accordance
with
applicable provisions of the Cable
Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, as amended (hereinafter the “Cable Act”) and regulations adopted by the Federal Communications
Commission
(the
“FCC”), the City is certified to regulate the basic cable service tier
rate and related equipment rental,
service and installation rates; and
Whereas, on or about November 26,
2003, the City received from Adelphia
an Abbreviated Cost of Service Filing
for Cable Network Upgrades on FCC
Form 1235 for pre-approval (the “FCC
Form 1235”) proposing a Maximum
Permitted
Network
Upgrade
Surcharge of $0.47 per month, per subscriber to be assessed against basic
service tier subscribers (in addition
to the Basic Tier Rate) over the next
12 years in order to recover the cost,
plus a rate of return, related to the
network upgrade completed in the
City in 2003; and
Whereas, pursuant to FCC regulations, the City issued a tolling order
on December 24, 2003, notifying
Adelphia that additional time in
which to review the FCC Form 1235
was required; and
Whereas, Adelphia’s filing of its
FCC Form 1235 on a pre-approval
basis is contrary to FCC regulations
because the system-wide upgrade
had been completed at the time of
filing; and
Whereas, in response to correspondence and discussions with the City’s
representatives, Adelphia filed an
amended
FCC
Form
1235
(the
“Amended FCC Form 1235”) on July
17, 2004 changing the FCC Form 1235
from a pre-approval to a final filing;
and
Whereas, Adelphia has not implemented the FCC Form 1235 Monthly
Network Upgrade surcharge of $0.47;
and
Whereas, it was necessary for the
City to make several requests to
Adelphia for additional information
and clarification in connection with
the FCC Form 1235 and the Amended FCC Form 1235; and
Whereas, interested parties, including Adelphia, were afforded an
opportunity to present information to
the City regarding these rates; and
Whereas, Adelphia’s FCC Form
1235 and Amended FCC Form 1235,
as well as other rate justification
information requested of Adelphia
and supplied to the City by Adelphia
are on file with the Clerk of Council in File No. 2209-04-A and incorporated into this Ordinance by reference; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that disapproving the
proposed
Network
Upgrade
Surcharge protects the City of Cleve-

2225

19
land’s cable television subscribers
from excessive rates to the fullest
extent permitted by law and enables
the City to act upon such proposal
within the federally mandated time
requirements for review of Adelphia’s cable television rate proposals; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That based on the information presented to City Council,
the information submitted by Adelphia, the documents on file with the
Clerk of Council and contained in
File No. 2209-04-A, and the advice of
the City’s cable television legal consultants
regarding
Adelphia’s
Amended FCC Form 1235, the City
makes the below listed findings and
orders:
1. For the reasons stated in the
November
5,
2004
memorandum
attached to and incorporated into
this Ordinance by reference, Adelphia has failed to provide sufficient
information in the Amended FCC
Form 1235 and supporting documentation from which to determine
whether the Network Upgrade Surcharge of $0.47 per month, per subscriber as proposed in the Amended
FCC Form 1235 is calculated in
accordance with FCC regulations.
2. For the reasons stated in the
attached
memorandum,
Adelphia
has failed to provide sufficient
information in the Amended FCC
Form 1235 and supporting documentation from which the City can calculate, in accordance with FCC regulations, an appropriate Network
Upgrade Surcharge and the one-year
time period in which the City must
rule on Adelphia’s Network Upgrade
Surcharge
as
proposed
in
the
Amended FCC Form 1235 will expire
on November 25, 2004.
3. The proposed Network Upgrade
Surcharge of $0.47 per month, per
subscriber as calculated in the
Amended FCC Form 1235 is, therefore, disapproved.
4. If Adelphia intends to justify
its
Network
Upgrade
Surcharge,
Adelphia is ordered to refile its FCC
Form 1235 with supporting documentation and information in conformance with the attached memorandum.
Section 2. That the City reserves
the right to reconsider this Ordinance for the sole purpose of further
reducing rates should new information arise which was not disclosed
by Adelphia or should modifications
or clarifications to FCC rules and
regulations so provide and permit.
Section 3. That it is found and
determined that all formal actions
of this Council concerning and relating to the adoption of this Ordinance were adopted in an open
meeting of this Council, and that all
deliberations of this Council and of
any of its committees or subcommittees that resulted in such formal
action, were in meetings open to the
public, in compliance with all legal
requirements
including
Section
121.22 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Section 4. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earlier period
allowed by law.

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 2211-04.
By Council Member Coats.
An
emergency
resolution
condemning the atrocities committed by
the Janjaweed against Sudanese villagers; urging the United States
Government to support the African
Union with resources to end the
genocide; and urging the United
Nations
to
supply
humanitarian
goods to the Sudanese refugees.
Whereas, Sudan obtained its independence from the United Kingdom
in 1956; and
Whereas, since obtaining its independence, Sudan has been embroiled
in civil wars for all but ten years
(1972-1982); and
Whereas, the civil wars are rooted in northern economic, political,
and social domination of non-Muslim, non-Arab southern Sudanese;
and
Whereas, since 1983, the war and
war related famines have led to
more than two million deaths and
the displacement of over 4 million
people; and

Whereas, in the past year, more
than one million people have been
forced from their homes in the
region of Darfur by a government
backed militia known as the Janjaweed; and
Whereas, the Janjaweed has raided villages, killed villagers and
raped village women; and
Whereas, the violence carried out
by the Janjaweed has created a serious humanitarian crisis as refugees
lack access to food, clothing, shelter, and health care; and
Whereas, the United States Congress passed a resolution declaring
the Sudan situation genocide; and
Whereas, Secretary of State Colin
Powell in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on
Thursday, September 9, 2004, stated
that “genocide has been committed
in Darfur and that the government
of Sudan and the Janjaweed bear
responsibility, and that genocide
may still be occurring”; and
Whereas, Secretary of State Powell’s declaration occurred one day
after the United Sates circulated a
draft Security Council resolution on
Sudan threatening economic penalties if the Sudanese government did

2228

not control its militias and permit a
large force from the African Union
to patrol the area; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby condemns the atrocities committed
by
the
Janjaweed
against
Sudanese villagers.
Section 2. That this Council urges
the United States Government to
support the African Union with
resources to end the genocide.
Section 3. That this Council urges
the United Nations to supply humanitarian goods, such as food, clothing,
shelter, and health care, to the
Sudanese refugees.

An emergency resolution strongly
opposing the proposed rate increase
in natural gas sought by Dominion
East Ohio Gas Company and Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. and urging the
PUCO to reject such proposals.
Whereas, on November 12, 2004,
Dominion East Ohio Gas Company
(Dominion) filed a request with the
Public Utilities Commission of Ohio
(the PUCO) to increase rates for
their customers by more than $1.00
per 1,000 cubic feet; and
Whereas, just last month, the
PUCO allowed Dominion to increase
its rate by $0.44 to $8.79 for November through January; and
Whereas, the proposed new rate
would add another $1.19 to gas
costs, boosting the rate to $9.98 per
1,000 cubic feet; and
Whereas, Columbia Gas of Ohio
Incorporated (Columbia) has requested an 11.5-cent increase, which
would cause its rates to go from
$8.79 to $9.94; and
Whereas, rate increases such as
those proposed by Dominion and
Columbia impose an extreme financial hardship on many of the City’s
residents and most severely impact
those citizens on fixed incomes; and
Whereas, such extreme increases
could force some families to choose
between paying their utility bills,
buying food, or purchasing prescription drugs; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that forcing citizens to make such
choices is reprehensible and further
believes that utility companies serving Cleveland residents should place
the health, safety, and welfare of
their customers above their bottomline during our coldest months of
the year; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council

The City Record
strongly opposes the proposed rate
increase in natural gas sought by
Dominion East Ohio Gas Company
and Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. and
urges the PUCO to reject such proposal.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby directed to transmit certified
copies of this resolution to representatives from Dominion East Ohio
Gas Company and Columbia Gas of
Ohio Incorporated, to each of the
Commissioners of the PUCO and to
the Consumers Counsel.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency

Whereas, the place for which the

and
Whereas, the place for which the

Whereas, this objection is based

Liquor Control within 30 days of

Res. No. 2214-04.
By Council Member O’Malley.
An emergency resolution requesting that the Cuyahoga County Court
of Common Pleas, in Housing Advocates, Inc. v. American Fire & Casualty Company, et. al., order appellee
insurance companies to produce certain documents and evidence necessary to fully investigate
housing
discrimination charges and requesting that the Director of Law of the
City of Cleveland review the brief
and exhibits submitted by Housing
Advocates and file a brief supporting the position of Housing Advocates.
Whereas, Federal and Ohio law
prohibits discrimination in the sale
of fire, extended coverage or homeowners insurance because of race,
color, religion, sex, familial status,
ancestry, handicap, or national origin or because of the racial composition of the neighborhood in which
housing accommodations are located; and
Whereas, Section 665.03(e) of the
Codified Ordinances of the City of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, prohibits dis-

24
crimination against any person in
the provision of property and casualty insurance; and
Whereas, it has been brought to
the attention of members of Cleveland City Council that insurance
companies require residents of the
City of Cleveland to pay higher premiums for property and casualty
insurance than residents of surrounding communities are required
to pay; and
Whereas, such premiums are, in
many instances, significantly higher;
and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland is
a diverse City with a greater number of persons of color compared to
the remainder of Cuyahoga County;
and
Whereas, the practice of requiring
higher insurance premiums for City
of Cleveland residents has a discriminatory impact on City of Cleveland residents; and
Whereas, The Housing Advocates,
Inc.
(“Housing
Advocates”),
has
undertaken an investigation and did
several studies to review base rate
premiums and geographical territorial rating zones for the City of
Cleveland and the remainder of
Cuyahoga County; and
Whereas, this investigation has
shown that City of Cleveland residents pay more for homeowners
insurance than residents living in
surrounding cities and this has a
racial and ethnic disparate impact
on City of Cleveland residents; and
Whereas, Housing Advocates filed
a total of twenty-five charges of
housing
discrimination
against
twenty-eight insurance companies
based on its investigation with the
Ohio Civil Rights Commission; and
Whereas, the Ohio Civil Rights
Commission completed its investigation of these charges and found that
there is no probable cause to believe
that discrimination occurred; and
Whereas, during this investigation the Ohio Civil Rights Commission failed to request certain documents from the insurance companies; and
Whereas, these documents are
only available from the insurance
companies and are relevant to the
charges of housing discrimination
filed by Housing Advocates; and
Whereas, it appears that the Commission’s
investigation
failed
to
address Housing Advocates suggestion for a less restrictive alternative
methods to avoid or at least reduce
the imposition of much higher premiums on our residents; and
Whereas, it appears that Housing
Advocates have made a case for disparate impact by the insurance companies in the pricing of insurance
products in the City of Cleveland
versus the remainder of Cuyahoga
County; and
Whereas, Housing Advocates has
filed a lawsuit under the Ohio
Revised Code entitled The Housing
Advocates, Inc. v. American Fire &
Casualty Company, et. al. in the
Cuyahoga County Common Pleas
Court requesting that the no probable cause determination of the Ohio
Civil Rights Commission be reversed
and that the Court compel the
appellee insurance companies to provide the requested documents in
order to enable a full and fair inves-

The City Record
tigation of the housing discrimination charges; and
Whereas, this Council is concerned about all persons receiving a
full and fair investigation of their
claims before the Ohio Civil Rights
Commission; and
Whereas, the Ohio Civil Rights
Commission is mandated by State
law to carry out and enforce the fair
housing laws of the State of Ohio;
and
Whereas, the Ohio Civil Rights
Commission has authority to demand access to records, documents,
and evidence in the course of investigations; and
Whereas, the Ohio Civil Rights
Commission should have compelled
the appellee insurance companies to
provide certain documents and other
evidence as part of its investigation
in order to determine the validity of
the housing discrimination charges
filed by Housing Advocates; and
Whereas, members of Cleveland
City Council, after being provided
information about the scope and
findings of the Commission investigation, urge the Cuyahoga County
Common Please Court to order that
appellee insurance companies produce certain documents and evidence necessary to investigate the
housing discrimination charges filed
by Housing Advocates; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes and emergency measure for
the immediate preservation of public peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby requests that the Cuyahoga
County Court of Common Pleas, in
Housing Advocates, Inc. v. American
Fire & Casualty Company, et. al.,
order appellee insurance companies
to produce certain documents and
evidence necessary to fully investigate
housing
discrimination
charges.
Section 2. That this Council hereby requests that the Director of Law
of the City of Cleveland review the
brief and exhibits submitted by
Housing Advocates and file a brief
supporting the position of Housing
Advocates.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to Ohio Governor Bob Taft, Pastor Aaron Wheeler Sr., Chairperson and Commissioner, Ohio Civil Rights Commission;
Jeanine P. Donaldson, Commissioner, Ohio Civil Rights Commission;
Altagracia
Ramos,
Commissioner,

Civil Rights Commission; Charles
Winburn, Commissioner, Ohio Civil
Rights Commission; G. Michael Peyton, Executive Director, Ohio Civil
Rights Commission; and Jim Petro,
Attorney General, State of Ohio.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
