RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL

Res. No. 1689-04.
By Council Member Coats.
An emergency resolution declaring the need for greater homeless
funding and health care and related
supportive services by the United
States government; the need for collaboration between the Veterans
Administration and community organizations; the need for affordable
housing development and community development; and the need for job
training and technical assistance
that will assist in transitioning
homeless veterans.
Whereas, America’s veterans deserve our gratitude for their service
and our assistance: and
Whereas, veterans are twice as
likely to be among the chronically
homeless; and
Whereas, one study revealed that
eighty-one percent (81%) of America’s homeless veterans suffer from
serious
psychiatric
or
substance
abuse disorders and thirty-three percent (33%) suffer from both; and
Whereas, this study also revealed
that forty-six percent (46%) of
homeless veterans assessed in 2001
were African Americans, in contrast
to eleven percent (11%) in the general veterans population, indicating
that African American veterans are
over four (4) times more likely to
be homeless than other veterans;
and

The City Record
Whereas, America’s homeless veterans face many challenges; and
Whereas, veterans are disproportionately represented among homeless men and existing programs and
resources are inadequate; and
Whereas, the National Survey of
Homeless
Service
Providers
and
Clients reports that fifty-seven percent (57%) of homeless veterans
have sought needed health care from
the Veterans Administration; and
Whereas, The Veterans Administration is shifting from inpatient to
outpatient services and such shift
does not appear to be in the best
interests of America’s homeless veterans; and
Whereas,
minority
community
based providers may welcome the
opportunity to provide services to
homeless veterans, but there is a
need for collaboration between these
providers and the Veterans Administration; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby declares the need for greater
homeless funding and health care
and related supportive services by
the United States government; the
need for collaboration between the
Veterans Administration and community organizations; the need for
affordable housing development and
community development; and the
need for job training and technical
assistance that will assist in transitioning homeless veterans.

Market, 2886 Woodhill Road, 1st

44104, Permanent Number 9804492;
and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to

Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to
Section 4303.26 of the Ohio Revised

An emergency resolution opposing
the intended relocation of the Glidden Company from the City of Cleveland to Strongsville and opposing
the Glidden Company’s application
to the State of Ohio for a personal
property tax exemption.
Whereas, it has come to this Council’s attention that the Glidden Company intends to relocate its operations from the City of Cleveland to

The City Record
property located in the City of
Strongsville; and
Whereas, the Glidden Company’s
intended relocation will cause Cleveland to lose the Company’s corporate
headquarters and its 415 employees;
and
Whereas, the Glidden Company
has applied for a personal property
tax exemption from the State of
Ohio; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby opposes the intended relocation
of the Glidden Company from the
City of Cleveland to Strongsville
and opposes the Glidden Company’s
application to the State of Ohio for
a personal property tax exemption.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby
directed to transmit copies of this resolution to the Thomas P. Perciak,

Res. No. 1693-04.
By Council Member Westbrook.
An emergency resolution opposing
an increase in truck size and weight
on United States highways and supporting an increased use of freight
railroad transportation as an effective solution to highway congestion
and poor air quality and to improve
quality of life.
Whereas, trucking lobbyists want
federal law to allow triple-trailer
trucks over 100 feet long and weighing up to 135,000 pounds to be able
to
drive
on
federal
highways
throughout the country; and
Whereas, bigger, heavier trucks
are harder to steer and more likely
to suffer brake failure and runaway
crashes; the longer the truck, the
greater the chance of rollover and
jackknifing; at highway speeds, the
back end of a triple trailer truck
can swing back and forth, endangering traffic in adjoining lanes;
and in an emergency, truck drivers
have virtually no control over a
third trailer; and
Whereas, bigger, longer trucks,
combined with the U.S.’s increasing
amount of freight that must be
transported, will worsen an already
severe national problem with deteriorating, crowded highways and

1807

19
will exacerbate the nation’s bridge
problem – 30% of the nation’s
bridges are structurally deficient or
functionally obsolete; and
Whereas, GO21 is a non-profit,
public interest organization whose
goals are to reduce traffic congestion, motor vehicle emissions and
costly wear and tear on our nation’s
highways
by
counteracting
the
effort to allow triple-trailer trucks
and promoting increased use of
freight rail transportation; and
Whereas, how our nation’s freight
is transported directly impacts our
quality of life – the strength of our
economy and the number of available jobs; the safety of our highways; the amount of traffic congestion we encounter; the prices we pay
for
everything
from
household
goods to electricity; the air we
breathe; and the efficient use of our
tax dollars; and
Whereas, rail intermodal is the
fastest growing segment of the U.S.
freight railroad industry, combining
the long haul efficiency of rail with
the
door-to-door
convenience
of
trucks; and
Whereas, one intermodal train can
carry 280 truck trailers which is the
equivalent of more than 1000 automobiles in terms of highway congestions; and
Whereas, rail moves a ton of
freight more than 400 miles on just
one gallon of fuel, thus reducing
harmful air pollutants by 6 to 12
times; and
Whereas, rail is the “preferred
mode” for hauling hazardous materials because of fewer spills and
accidents; and
Whereas, according to the American Association of State Highway
and Transportation Officials, rail
investments are an efficient use of
tax dollars, providing as much as a
12 to 1 return on investment; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby opposes an increase in truck size
and weight on United States highways and supports an increased use
of freight railroad transportation as
an effective solution to highway
congestion and poor air quality and
to improve quality of life.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to the appropriate
members of Ohio’s Congressional
delegation.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
