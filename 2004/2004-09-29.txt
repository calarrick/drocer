ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 1577-04.
By Council Member Pierce Scott.
An emergency resolution declaring that the issuance of a D-5f permit to Poseidon Investment Group
LLC dba East 55th Street Marina is
not inconsistent with the City of
Cleveland’s comprehensive development plan or other economic development goals as established by
Cleveland City Council.
Whereas,
Poseidon
Investment
Group LLC dba East 55th Street
Marina applied for a F-5f permit
from the Ohio Division of Liquor
Control; and
Whereas, Ohio Revised Code Section 4304.18.1 requires each application for a D-5f permit to be accompanied by a certification from the
local legislative authority that the
issuance of the D-5f permit is not
inconsistent with the political subdivision’s
comprehensive
development plan or other economic development goal as officially established
by
the
local
legislative
authority; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the issuance of a
D-5f permit to Poseidon Investment
Group LLC dba East 55th Street
Marina is not inconsistent with the
City of Cleveland’s comprehensive
development plan or other economic
development goals as established by
Cleveland City Council.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period

Adopted September 20, 2004.
Effective September 23, 2004.

Res. No. 1786-04.
By Council Members Coats, O’Malley, Cintron, Polensek, Jones, Conwell, Lewis.
An emergency resolution encouraging the United States House of
Representatives and United States
Senate to conduct a review of the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and take such action as may be
necessary to ensure the solvency of
the Pension Benefit Guaranty.
Whereas,
the
Pension
Benefit
Guaranty Corporation (“PBGC”) was
created by Congress in 1974 to
encourage the growth of defined
benefit pensions plans, provide timely and uninterrupted payment of
pension benefits, and keep pension
insurance premiums at a minimum;
and
Whereas, the PBGC ensures that
retirees receive pensions that they
have worked for; and

Whereas, defined benefit pension
plans promise to pay a specified
monthly benefit at retirement, commonly based on salary and years on
the job; and
Whereas, the PBGC is not funded
by general tax revenues; and
Whereas, the PBGC collects insurance premiums from employers that
sponsor insured pension plans, earns
money from investments and receives funds from pension plans it
takes over; and
Whereas, according to the PBGC’s
website, the PBGC pays monthly
retirement benefits, up to a guaranteed maximum, to about 459,000
retirees in 3,287 pension plans that
ended; and
Whereas, according to the PBGC’s
website, including those who have
not yet retired and participants in
multiemployer plans receiving financial assistance, PBGC is responsible
for the current and future pensions
of about 934,000 people; and
Whereas, 15,000 recipients in the
Greater Cleveland area receive pension payments from the PBGC; and
Whereas, it is estimated that more
than 8,700 future retirees in the
Greater Cleveland area may depend
on the PBGC for future pension payments; and
Whereas, at the end of its current
fiscal year in September, the PBGC
will have made about $3 billion in
pension payments, with more than
$105 billion being distributed among
more than 15,000 recipients in the
Greater Cleveland area; and
Whereas, the PBGC is in danger
of needing a government bailout as
companies backed by the PBGC are
under funded by $400 billion and it
is estimated that $85 billion will be
passed on the PBGC; and
Whereas, a review of the PBGC
and appropriate restructuring is necessary in order to ensure the solvency of the PBGC and, thereby,
enable the PBGC to continue its
function of ensuring that workers
receive
the
pensions
that
they
worked for; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
encourages the United States House
of
Representatives
and
United
States Senate to conduct a review of
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and take such action as
may be necessary to ensure the solvency of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to
U.S. Senator Michael DeWine, U.S. Senator
George Voinovich, Congresswoman
Stephanie Tubbs Jones, Congressman Dennis Kucinich, Congressman
Sherrod Brown, and Congressman
Steven LaTourette.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it

shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted September 20, 2004.
Effective September 21, 2004.

Res. No. 1787-04.
By Council Members Coats, Pierce
Scott, Jones, Conwell, Lewis.
An emergency resolution opposing
the provisional ballot order issued
by Secretary of State J. Kenneth
Blackwell as such order is contrary
to the letter and spirit of the Help
America Vote Act of 2002 and
encouraging
Secretary
of
State
Blackwell to issue an order that is
consistent with the Help America
Vote Act of 2002.
Whereas, the right to vote is fundamental to democracy; and
Whereas, the Voting Rights Act of
1965 requires uniform standards for
voting qualifications and prohibits
race discrimination in both voter
registration and the voting process;
and
Whereas, the Help America Vote
Act of 2002 was a bipartisan effort
addressing voting concerns, including the casting and counting of provisional ballots, that arose out of
the November 2000 election; and
Whereas, Section 302 of the Help
America Vote Act of 2002 governs
provisional voting and states that
an individual shall be permitted to
cast a provisional ballot in an election for a Federal office if an individual declares that he or she is a
registered voter in the jurisdiction
in which the individual desires to
vote and the individual’s name does
not appear on the official list of eligible voters for the polling place or
an election official asserts that the
individual is not eligible to vote;
and
Whereas, when signing the Help
America Vote Act of 2002, President
George W. Bush stated “When people show up at the polls, and their
voting registration is in doubt, they
should not be turned away, but
allowed to cast a provisional ballot
so their vote can be counted if it is
later verified that they are properly
registered”; and
Whereas, Ohio Secretary of State
J. Kenneth Blackwell last week
issued an order to all local election
officials in Ohio indicating that provisional ballots will be issued only
to voters, who, after giving their
address, appear to be in the correct
precinct but do not show up in registration rolls; and
Whereas, the recent order on provisional ballots issued by Ohio Secretary of State Blackwell is contrary
to both the letter and the spirit of
the Help America Vote Act of 2002;
and
Whereas, 7,900 provisional ballots
were cast in the city of Cleveland
in the last presidential election; and
Whereas,
many
precincts
and
polling places changed after the
2000 census and after the last federal election, thereby increasing the
likelihood that more properly registered voters in 2004 than in 2000 will
be confused about their proper voting location; and
Whereas, this Council is concerned that properly registered vot-

September 29, 2004
ers will not be permitted to vote on
November 2, 2004 because of Secretary of State Blackwell’s order; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes
the
provisional
ballot
order
issued by Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell that permits the
issuance of provisional ballots only
to voters who, after giving their
address,
appear
in
the
correct
precinct but do not show up in registration rolls as such order is contrary to the letter and spirit of the
Help America Vote Act of 2002.
Section
2.
That
this
Council
encourages Secretary of State Blackwell to issue an order governing
provisional ballots that is consistent
with the Help America Vote Act of
2002.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
certified copy of this resolution to
Ohio Secretary of State J. Kenneth
Blackwell,
U.S.
Senator
Michael
DeWine, U.S. Senator George Voinovich,
Congresswoman
Stephanie
Tubbs Jones, Congressman Dennis
Kucinich,
Congressman
Sherrod
Brown, and Congressman Steven
LaTourette.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted September 20, 2004.
Effective September 21, 2004.

Res. No. 1788-04.
By Council Member White.
An emergency resolution withdrawing objection to the transfer of
ownership of a C1 Liquor Permit at
7910 Harvard Avenue, and repealing
Resolution No. 282-04, objecting to
said transfer.
Whereas, this Council objected to
the transfer of ownership of a C1
Liquor Permit to 7910 Harvard
Avenue by Resolution No. 282-04
adopted by the Council on February
23, 2004; and
Whereas, this Council wishes to
withdraw its objection to the above
transfer and consents to said transfer; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That objection to the
transfer of ownership of a C1 Liquor
Permit to Amer Alahmad, DBA Open
Pantry, 7910 Harvard Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44105, Permanent Number
0092793 be and the same is hereby
withdrawn and Resolution No. 28204, containing such objection, be and

The City Record
the same is hereby repealed and
that this Council consents to the
immediate transfer thereof.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency

affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
