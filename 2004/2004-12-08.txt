requirement contracts of the purchase or lease of Group I and II
color photocopiers for the various
divisions of City government, for a
period not to exceed five years.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Finance is authorized to make one
or more written requirement contracts under the Charter and the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, for the requirements for
the period of five years of the necessary items of the purchase or
lease of Group I and II color photocopiers,
in
the
approximate
amount as procured during the preceding term, to be purchased or procured by the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies on a unit basis
for the various divisions of City government. Bids shall be taken in a
manner that permits an award to be
made for all items as a single contract, or by separate contract for
each or any combination of the
items as the Board of Control determines. Alternate bids for a period
less than the specified term may be
taken if desired by the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies
until provision is made for the
requirements for the entire term.
Section 2. That the costs of the
contract
or
contracts
shall
be
charged against the proper appropriation accounts and the Director
of Finance shall certify the amount
of the initial purchase or procurement, which purchase or procurement, together with all later purchases or procurements, shall be
made on order of the Commissioner
of Purchases and Supplies under a
requisition against the contract or
contracts certified by the Director of
Finance. (RL 150991)
Section 3. That under Section
108(b) of the Charter, the purchases or procurements authorized
by this ordinance may be made
through
cooperative
agreements
using state procedures. The Director of Finance may sign all documents with the State of Ohio or any
of its political subdivisions that
are necessary to make the purchases or procurement, and may
enter into one or more contracts
with the vendors selected through
that cooperative process.
Section 4. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

An emergency resolution urging
Governor Taft and the Ohio State
Legislature to provide full funding
for the Clean Ohio Fund in the 2005

Ohio voters approved State Issue 1,
the Clean Ohio Fund, allowing the

communities, through the sale of
state bonds, for local environmental
projects; and

Issue 1 and the enabling legislation
promised a $400 million program to

amount approved by voters in 2000;

projects

across the state; and

the local level; and

Ohio
projects
have generated positive civic involvement in the communities where
projects have been funded; and

funding will ensure that the benefits promised to Ohio voters in 2000
continue; and

Governor Taft and the State Legislature honor the promises and commitments made to Ohio voters when
approving State Issue 1; and

Res. No. 2258-04.
By Council Members Sweeney,
Brady and O’Malley.
An emergency resolution urging
the state of Ohio to fund the construction of noise walls on all highways where noise levels exceed the
standard decibel level, including
highways
going
through
urban
neighborhoods.
Whereas, there are many areas
throughout northeast Ohio where
noise levels from interstate traffic
exceed the threshold 67 dBA, thus
qualifying those areas for noise
abatement; and
Whereas, the biggest problem in
constructing the noise walls in the
state is the unavailability of funds
with which to complete the noise
abatement program; and
Whereas, funding for the Noise
Wall Retrofit Program has been
eliminated in 2006 due to budget
constraints; and
Whereas, noise walls continue to
be constructed in suburban areas of
Ohio while the state has consistently ignored urban neighborhoods,
although urban areas are affected
just as much, if not more, by highway traffic; and
Whereas, the state’s noise abatement program should be funded in
order to help ensure a better quality of life for those living near interstates, including those living near
interstates in urban areas of Ohio;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the state of Ohio to fund
the construction of noise walls on
all highways where noise levels exceed the standard decibel level,
including highways going through
urban neighborhoods.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Governor
Taft, the Ohio State House and Senate representatives from Cuyahoga
County
and
to
Gordon
Proctor,

2372

December 8, 2004
Director, Ohio Department of Transportation.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted November 22, 2004.
Effective November 30, 2004.

Whereas, the place for which the

officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based on
other legal grounds as set forth in
Revised Code Section 4303.292; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
