An emergency resolution opposing
the plan of President George W.
Bush to eliminate Community Development Block Grant funding in
year 2005.
Whereas,
Community
Development Block Grant (“CDBG”) funding
provides the City of Cleveland and
other eligible metropolitan cities
and urban counties with annual
direct grants that they can use to
revitalize
neighborhoods,
expand
affordable housing and economic
opportunities, and improve community facilities and services, principally to benefit low and moderate
income persons; and
Whereas, the White House released a list of programs that it
wants to eliminate in 2005 and programs that it hopes to cut back significantly; and
Whereas, one of the programs listed was the elimination of the Community Development Block grant
program as the White House proposes a reduction in funding from
$334 million in 2004 to $0 in 2005;
and
Whereas, elimination of the Community Development Block Grant
program will have a devastating
effect on the City of Cleveland and
other cities; and
Whereas, the United States Housing and Urban Development’s web-

32
site indicates that “the impact of
CDBG-funded projects can be seen
in the housing stock, the business
environment, the streets and the
public facilities of entitlement communities” and indicates that “the
program is also an increasingly
important
catalyst
for
economic
development activities that expand
job and business opportunities for
lower income persons and neighborhoods”; and
Whereas, in these challenging economic times, it is important to continue programs that benefit low and
moderate income persons and communities; and
Whereas, in these challenging economic times, it is also important to
provide adequate funding of programs that increase economic development opportunities; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of

An emergency resolution opposing
House Bill 386, which creates a
statewide uniform building code as
adopted by the State Board of Building Standards, and House Bill 175,
which would establish a statewide
uniform building code for all residential buildings.
Whereas,
state
representatives
recently introduced House Bill 386,
which specifies that the building
code adopted by the state Board of
Building Standards is a statewide
uniform building code; and
Whereas, the House is also considering a previously introduced
bill, H.B. 175, which would establish
a uniform building code for all residential buildings; and
Whereas, both bills prohibit local
governments from adopting rules or
regulations in conflict with the
statewide code; and
Whereas, additionally, local governments may not set standards
higher than those established in the
proposed statewide standards; and
Whereas, Ohio is an extremely
diverse
state
and
neither
bill
reflects the differences that exist
among Ohio communities in everything from snowfall to topography,
to community preference to history;
and
Whereas, while it may be beneficial to have statewide building code
standards to set minimum regulations, these bills establish the only
standards a community may have,
which will be difficult, if not impossible to enforce in all Ohio communities; and
Whereas, H.B. 175 removes local
government’s authority to require
licensing of residential contractors
which diminishes the ability of local
governments to set minimum contractor standards; and

The City Record
Whereas, H.B. 386 and H.B. 175
may violate the Home Rule provisions
of
the
Ohio
Constitution,
which give communities the right to
govern themselves; and

An emergency resolution opposing

Whereas, House Bill 278 gives all
power to regulate the placement and
operation of oil and gas wells to the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources; and
Whereas, municipalities in Ohio,
such as the City of Cleveland, exercising their constitutional home rule
powers may regulate oil and gas
wells; and
Whereas, House Bill 278 is contrary to the Ohio Constitution in
that it violates the right of municipalities to exercise home rule powers as House Bill 278 declares that
the Division of Mineral Resources
Management, in the Department of
Natural Resources, has exclusive
authority to regulate the permitting,
location, and spacing of oil and gas
wells in the State of Ohio; and
