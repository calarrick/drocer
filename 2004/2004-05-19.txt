Res. No. 957-04.
By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency resolution supporting Ohio House Bill 245 which
would create a special “Share the
Road” license plate to fund bicycling education in Ohio.
Whereas, thousands of cyclists
share Ohio’s roads with motor vehicle drivers daily; and
Whereas, cyclists, like motor vehicle drivers, must obey the traffic
laws of the state; and
Whereas, too often, motor vehicle
drivers
become
impatient
with
cyclists who are on the same road;
and
Whereas, this impatience can end
in tragedy for both the cyclist and
the motor vehicle driver, as in the
case of one experienced cyclist
killed May 1, 2004 by an impatient
motorist who crossed a double yellow line to pass the cyclist as the
cyclists signaled to make a left
turn; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports Ohio House Bill 245
which would create a special “Share
the Road” license plate to fund bicycling education in Ohio.
Section 2. That the Clerk is directed to transmit copies of this resolution to Governor Bob Taft and the
Cuyahoga County delegation in the
Ohio House and Senate.

An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Governor Bob Taft and
members of the Ohio General Assembly to support the spirit of the
Brown v. Board of Education ruling
to end school segregation and promote diversity and quality education
for all public school students regardless of race.
Whereas, fifty-years ago today
marks the anniversary of the national landmark case of Brown v.
Board of Education, where the
United States Supreme Court ruled
that school segregation was unconstitutional and that by its very
nature was considered unequal; and
Whereas, Fifty years after the historic Brown decision, many students
still remain segregated between pre-

26
dominantly white suburbs and cities
of color; and
Whereas, racial isolation exists in
the nation’s suburban communities
as reflected in the fact that the
number of minority children attending virtually all-minority suburban
schools have more than doubled in
the past decade; and
Whereas, in Northeast Ohio, 20
suburban
schools
in
2001
were
racially isolated, which is an increase from nine schools in 1991;
and
Whereas, the public school system
in the City of Cleveland and Northeast Ohio still remains very segregated; and
Whereas, the number of minority
schools in Cleveland has dramatically increased from six in 1987 to
sixty-eight in 2001, with fewer than
2,200
students
attending
such
schools in 1987, while nearly 39,000
were attending such schools in 2001;
and
Whereas,
research
shows
that
school districts, which educate the
greatest numbers of disadvantaged
and minority students do not receive
the local and state funding they
need to overcome the social economic obstacles their students face;
and
Whereas, Society must not abandon its goals of equality and justice
that drove the Civil Rights Movement, efforts must be made to promote policies that encourage diversity in our schools, so that all students of color have fair access to
quality education and that efforts be
made to recommit establishing a
genuinely desegregated and equal
society; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby declares its support for promoting
multiracial
and
diversified
schools in order to promote diversity and fairness in the public school
system in order to achieve equal
education for all individuals regardless of race.
Section 2. That this Council urges
Ohio Governor Bob Taft and members of the Ohio General Assembly
to support the spirit of Brown v.
Board of Education by actively taking the necessary steps to promote
policies that encourage multiracial
diversity in our public schools and
to promote quality education for all
students regardless of race or ethnicity.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to Ohio Governor Bob Taft, and to the members
of the Ohio General Assembly to
actively end racial segregation in
Ohio public schools and to promote
diversity and quality education for
all students.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it

An emergency resolution supporting the Hagel-Harkin Amendment to
the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act (IDEA), which would
provide an additional, mandatory $2
billion per year to the IDEA.

948

May 19, 2004
Whereas, the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)
was passed by the United States
Congress in 1975; and
Whereas, the IDEA guarantees
disabled students a free and public
education in the least restrictive
environment possible; and
Whereas, the IDEA authorized
the federal government to pay for
40% of the costs school districts
spend to educate a disabled student; and
Whereas, however, Congress has
never appropriated the full 40%; and
Whereas, President Bush’s FY
2005 education budget proposes a $1
billion increase in IDEA funding,
which would bring the total funding
to IDEA to $11.7 billion; and
Whereas, this increase would provide 19.7% of the national average
per pupil expenditure, which is
still only half of the “full funding”
level that Congress committed to
paying when the IDEA passed in
1975; and
Whereas, funding for special education affects all students, not just
those with disabilities because in
order to make up for the federal
funding shortfall, many schools are
forced to take money from their general education budgets to provide
for services within their IDEA budget, which they are obligated to provide by law; and
Whereas, although President Bush
has increased funding for IDEA in
the past several years, the annual
increase of $1 billion a year will not
reach the promised level of 40%
until 2035; and
Whereas, local governments cannot afford to wait that long for
funding; and
Whereas,
the
Hagel-Harkin
Amendment to the IDEA, which will
be introduced this week to the U.S.
Senate, will provide $2 billion per
year in mandatory funding to IDEA
in addition to the amount appropriated by Congress; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby
supports
the
Hagel-Harkin
Amendment to the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)
which would provide an additional,
mandatory $2 billion per year to the
IDEA.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
all appropriate members of United
States Congress and the appropriate
representatives
of
the
National
League of Cities.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Ord. No. 2404-03.
By
Council
Members
Gordon,
White and Jackson (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Oh, 1976, by enacting new
Sections
3116.01,
3116.02,
3116.03,
3116.04,
3116.05,
3116.06,
3116.07,
3116.08, 3116.09, 3116.10, 3116.11, and
3116.12 relating to construction and
post-construction site runoff control
to municipal separate storm sewer
system.
Whereas, storm water runoff from
lands modified by human activities
can harm surface water and, in turn,
cause
or
contribute
to
an
exceedance of water quality standards
by changing natural hydrologic patterns, accelerating natural stream
flows, destroying aquatic habitat,
and elevating pollutant concentrations and loadings; and
Whereas, runoff may contain high
levels of contaminants, such as sediment, suspended solids, nutrients,
heavy metals, pathogens, toxins,
oxygen-demanding substances, and
floatables; and
Whereas, if unregulated, storm
water runoff carries these pollutants
into nearby streams, rivers, lakes,
estuaries, and wetlands; and
Whereas, individually and combined, these pollutants impair water
quality, threatening designated beneficial uses and causing habitat
alteration and destruction; and
Whereas, through rules adopted
under the provisions of the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act, as
amended (33 U.S.C. 1251 et. seq.) and
the Ohio Water Pollution Control
Act (Ohio Revised Code Chapter
6111), the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the
Ohio
Environmental
Protection
Agency have mandated that the City
adopt ordinances controlling runoff
from construction activities; and,
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
supplemented by enacting new Sections 3116.01, 3116.02, 3116.03, 3116.04,
3116.05,
3116.06,
3116.07,
