FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 548-04.
By Council Members Westbrook
and Sweeney.
An emergency resolution supporting the reauthorization of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st
Century (TEA-21) by the U.S. Congress and urging Congress to fund
the reauthorization bill at no less
than $318 billion.
Whereas, the U.S. Congress has
not completed its work to reauthorize federal transportation programs
and policies necessary to improve
our nation’s mobility; and
Whereas,
reauthorizing
federal
transportation programs is essential
to improve our nation’s economy
because transportation infrastructure is the system through which
consumers and commerce flow in
and through our nation’s cities and
regions; and
Whereas,
reauthorizing
federal
transportation programs will save
and create jobs; and

The City Record
Whereas,
the
longer
Congress
debates TEA-21, the greater the risk
that transportation projects and programs
currently
underway
will
either slow down or stop, jeopardizing existing jobs and the creation of
new ones; and
Whereas,
reauthorizing
federal
transportation programs pay for
themselves because federal gas tax
revenues collected at the pump help
pay the bill; and
Whereas,
reauthorizing
federal
transportation programs will help
reduce roadway congestion that pollutes our environment and steals peoples’ time from more productive activities at home, work, and play; and
Whereas,
reauthorizing
federal
transportation programs is an investment in homeland security because our nation’s transportation
systems help move people out of
harm’s way and transport emergency personnel where needed; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland, as
well as cities and towns across our
nation desire a six-year rather than
a two-year bill because transportation projects require long-term planning and funding stability that, in
turn, helps ensure cost effective projects; and
Whereas, Congress must build on
the legacy of the Transportation
Equity Act for the 21st Century
(“TEA-21”), and improve the longterm funding and program flexibility of federal transportation programs and policies at the state and
local levels; and
Whereas, the reauthorizing federal
transportation
programs
are
essential to improving and maintaining Cleveland’s local transportation infrastructure which is vital to
consumers and commerce flowing in
and about the Northeast Ohio region;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports the reauthorization of
the Transportation Equity Act for
the 21st Century (TEA-21) by the
U.S. Congress and urges Congress to
fund the reauthorization bill at no
less than $318 billion.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to the members of the Ohio U.S. House of Representatives House Transportation
& Infrastructure Committee: Steven
C. LaTourette and Robert W. Ney
and U.S. Representatives Stephanie
Tubb-Jones, Dennis Kucinich and
Sherrod Brown.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

An emergency resolution demanding that the Campbell administration uphold and enforce all valid
laws of the City, most importantly
the Fannie M. Lewis Cleveland Resident Employment Law, Chapter 188
of the Codified Ordinances of the
City of Cleveland; demanding that
the administration provide documentation and all relevant information pertaining to the propriety of
any of the City’s current laws,
including the Fannie M. Lewis
Cleveland Resident Employment Law;
demanding that the Board of Control not award any contract that
fails to include standards and procedures effectuating the Fannie M.
Lewis Cleveland Resident Employment Law; reaffirming this Council’s commitment to the purposes
and goals set forth in said Fannie
M. Lewis Cleveland Resident Employment
Law;
and
urging
the
Mayor to be likewise committed to
enforcing said law.
Whereas, the Fannie M. Lewis
Cleveland
Resident
Employment
Law, effective January 2004, was
passed by this Council in order to
ensure that residents of this City,
especially
low
income
workers,
obtain meaningful employment; and
Whereas, this Council enacted the
Fannie M. Lewis Cleveland Resident
Employment Law also to ensure
that money spent by the taxpayers
of this city benefits those who live
in this city; and
Whereas, the Fannie M. Lewis
Cleveland
Resident
Employment

The City Record

28
Law applies to all city construction
contracts of $100,000 or more and
requires that residents of the City
perform 20% of the total construction worker hours; and
Whereas, it has come to the attention of this Council that the Campbell administration may award the
public improvement contract for the
rehabilitation
of
Kinsman
Road
without enforcing Chapter 188 of the
City’s Codified Ordinances, the Fannie M. Lewis Cleveland Resident
Employment Law; and
Whereas, the apparent ignoring of
the Fannie M. Lewis Cleveland Resident Employment Law in the pending award of this public improvement contract, and any other applicable city construction contracts, is
an affront to this Council and to the
residents of this City, especially
those who are willing and able to
work on such a project and who
need such employment; and
Whereas, the Campbell administration cannot unilaterally ignore
duly enacted laws of the City and
is bound by duty and by law to
uphold this City’s valid laws unless

and until said laws are found
unlawful; and
Whereas, this Council questions
whether the Campbell administration will ignore the Fannie M. Lewis
Cleveland
Resident
Employment
Law as it applies to all city construction contracts, thus rendering
the law irrelevant; and
Whereas, the Campbell administration is strongly advised to stay
in contact with this Council, as the
legislative body of this City, so that
it knows and understands which of
its laws are being questioned; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby
demands
that
the
Campbell
administration uphold and enforce all
valid laws of the City, most importantly the Fannie M. Lewis Cleveland
Resident Employment Law, Chapter
188 of the Codified Ordinances of the
City of Cleveland; demands that the
administration provide documenta-

City’s current laws, including the
Fannie M. Lewis Cleveland Resident
Employment Law, demands that the
Board of Control not award any contract that fails to include standards
and procedures effectuating the Fannie M. Lewis Cleveland Resident Employment Law; reaffirms this Council’s commitment to the purposes and
goals set forth in said Fannie M.
Lewis
Cleveland
Resident
Employment Law; and urges the Mayor
to be likewise committed to enforcing said law.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and provided it receives the
