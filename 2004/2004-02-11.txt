An emergency ordinance giving
consent of the City of Cleveland to
the County of Cuyahoga and the
Ohio Department of Transportation
to paint the structural steel on the
Main Avenue Bridge over the Cuyahoga River; authorizing the Director
of Public Service to enter into any
agreements relative to the improvement; and to apply for and accept
an allocation of County Motor Vehicle License Tax Funds for the
improvement.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,

Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That it is declared to be
in the public interest that the consent of the City of Cleveland is
given to the Board of County Commissioners (the “County”) and the
Director of Transportation of the
State of Ohio (the “Director of
Transportation”) to construct the
following improvement under plans,
specifications and estimated by the
County and the Director of Transportation: to paint the structural
steel on the Main Avenue Bridge
over
the
Cuyahoga
River
(the
“Improvement”).
Section 2. That the City proposes
to cooperate with the County and
the Director of Transportation in the
cost of the Improvement by cooperating to the extent of funds received
by an allocation from the County
Motor Vehicle $5.00 License Tax
Fund; and by applying to the Board
of County Commissioners to use the
License Tax Fund for the Improvement.
Section 3. That the Director of
Public Service is authorized to enter
into agreements with the County
and the Director of Transportation
that are necessary to complete the
planning and construction of the
Improvement.
Section 4. That on completion of
the Improvement, the City will:
(a) Keep the affected highway
open to traffic at all times;
(b) Maintain the Improvement
under the provisions of the statutes
relating thereto and make ample
financial and other provisions for
the maintenance;
(c) Maintain the right-of-way and
keep it free of obstruction in a manner satisfactory to the County and
hold the right-of-way inviolate for
public highway purposes and permit
no signs, posters, billboards, roadside stands or other private installations within the limits of the
right-of-way;
(d) Place and maintain all traffic
control devices in accordance with
the Ohio Manual of Uniform Traffic
Control Devices under the provisions
of Section 4511.11 and related sections of the Ohio Revised Code; and
(e) Regulate parking by maintaining existing parking restrictions
within the limits of the Improvement.
Section 5. a) That all existing
streets
and
public
rights-of-way
within the City that are necessary
for the Improvement shall be made
available.
b) That in the event any additional right-of-way is required for
the Improvement, the County will
arrange for the acquisition thereof.
c) That the County shall continue
to maintain the structural elements
of any bridge (defined as a structure with a span of twenty (20) feet
or grater) within the limits of the
Improvement under applicable sections of the Ohio Revised Code.
d) That the street within the limits of the Improvement is designated a through highway within the
meaning of division (F) of Section
4511.07 of the Revised Code.
e) That arrangements have been
or will be made with and agreements obtained from all public util-

172

February 11, 2004
ity companies whose lines or structures
will
be
affected
by
the
Improvement, that the companies
have agreed to make any and all
necessary rearrangements in such
manner as to be clear of any construction called for by the plans for
the Improvement and that the companies have agreed to make necessary rearrangements immediately
after notification by the City.
f) That the City, at its own
expense, shall make all rearrangements of water mains, service lines,
fire hydrants, valve boxes, sanitary
sewers or other City-owned utilities
and appurtenances thereto which do
not comply with the provisions of
ODOT directive No. 28-A, whether
inside or outside the corporate limits of the City, as may be necessary
to conform to the Improvement, and
that the rearrangements shall be
done at a time that is requested by
the County.
g) That the County will participate in the costs of alterations of
governmentally-owned utility facilities which come within the provisions of ODOT directive No. 28-A to
the same extent that it participates
in the other costs of the Improvement, provided that such participation will not extend to additions or
betterments of existing facilities.
h) That the construction, reconstruction and rearrangement of all
utilities shall be done in such a
manner as not to interfere unduly
with the operations of the contractor constructing the Improvement,
and all backfilling of trenches made
necessary by such utility rearrangements shall be performed under the
provisions of the ODOT Construction
and
Material
Specifications
and
shall be subject to approval by the
County.
i) That the City agrees that the
County shall be saved harmless
from any and all damages or claims
arising from or growing out of the
certification or obligations made or
agreed to in divisions a), e), f) and
h) of this section.
j) That stop signs affecting the
movement of traffic on any street
within the limits of the Improvement shall be removed and no stop
signs will be erected except at
intersections with another through
highway where traffic does not
warrant the installation of a traffic
control signal but where the warrants for a “Four-way Stop” as provided in the above-mentioned Manual are met.
k) That no rule or regulation may
be enacted restricting the use of the
Improvement by any class of vehicle or vehicle load permitted by the
Ohio Revised Code to use a public
highway. Any existing rule or regulation so restricting road usage is
rescinded.
Section 6. That the Council of the
City requests the County to proceed
with the Improvement.
Section 7. That the Director of
Public Service is authorized to enter
into an agreement with the County
concerning the financing of the
Improvement, which agreement shall
contain without limitation terms
substantially similar to the following:

for the preparation of construction
plans and specifications for the
Improvement, including necessary
engineering reports, under current
County Engineer standards for construction
of
County

b) That the County will arrange
for the supervision and administration of the construction contract for
the Improvement, and will review
the construction plans for conformance with division a) of this section, and make an inspection of the
completed project.
c) That if, by ordinance of this
Council, the City requests the County, to include in the Improvement
the construction of sanitary sewers,
water lines, sewers for drainage of
the area surrounding the Improvement, sidewalks, alternate bid items
or other items that are in addition
to those now existing in the plans
for the Improvement and not provided for elsewhere in the agreement, the County will do so, provided that the construction of the additional items is approved by the
County and the City, and provided
further that the City agrees to pay
or cause to be paid the cost of the
additional construction and of preliminary and design engineering,
but the City shall not be responsible for the cost of supervision of the
additional construction.
d) That the City agrees to participate with the County in the cost of
the Improvement by an allocation
from the County Motor Vehicle
License Tax Fund to pay the County portion of the project.
e) That if the project is financed
as a Federal-aid project, eligible
costs of the Improvement shall be
financed from the funds.
Section 8. That the Director of

to the County for an allocation from
the County Motor Vehicle License
Tax fund to pay the County portion
of the project, and to enter into
agreements with the County as are
