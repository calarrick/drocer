By Council Member Dolan.
An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting
new Section 170.06 relating to residential property tax abatement limitation.
Whereas, Ohio Revised Code Chapter 1728 authorizes tax exemption for
improvements made in the development or redevelopment of blighted
areas in the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, state law permits a tax
exemption of up to seventy-five percent (75%) of the assessed value of
such improvements; and

The City Record
Whereas, state law permits, with
the approval of the local school district, a tax exemption of up to one
hundred percent (100%) of the
assessed value of such improvements; and
Whereas, residential property values are categorized by market value
and assessed value; and
Whereas, assessed value is the
value to which tax rates are applied;
and
Whereas, the assessed value is
equal to thirty-five (35%) of a residential property’s market value; and
Whereas, this Council feels that
residential properties with a tax
assessed value of $50,000.00 or more,
or a market value of $142,857.00 or
more, should not receive tax abatement; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, are hereby supplemented
by enacting new Section 170.06
thereof, to read as follows:
Section 170.06 Residential Property Tax Abatement Limitation
Each application for residential
tax abatement shall state the market value of the residential property and the assessed value of the residential property.
Tax abatement
applications with residential property values assessed at $50,000.00 or
higher shall not be approved.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

the cost of the improvement not specially assessed, as provided, shall be
paid by the City of Cleveland out of
funds made available to it by other
sources and appropriated for such

authorized to prepare and file in the
Office of the Clerk of Council an

be assessed. Such estimated assessments shall be based on the
estimated cost of the improvement
under the plans, specifications (including the specifications incorporated by reference under this Resolution) and profiles now on file in

The estimated assessment shall be
filed in the Office of the Clerk and
kept available for public inspection.
After filing the estimated assessments in the Office of Clerk of
Council, the Commissioner of Assessments and Licenses is authorized and directed to cause notice of
passage of this Resolution and of
the filing of said estimated assessments to be served upon the
owners of all lots and lands to be
assessed in the manner provided by
law.

immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period

An emergency resolution declaring Cleveland City Council’s support
of the proposal of the Phyllis
Wheatley Association to the Ohio
Housing Finance Agency for the use
of Housing Development Assistance
Program funds to develop affordable
for-sale housing units in the city of
Cleveland by rehabilitating Emeritus House.
Whereas, each year the Ohio
Housing Finance Agency allocates
funding for affordable housing developments throughout Ohio using a
competitive proposal process; and
Whereas, the Council of the city
of Cleveland has recognized the
need to maintain affordable housing
in Cleveland’s neighborhoods; and
Whereas, the Phyllis Wheatley
Association is proposing to rehabilitate the real property known as
Emeritus House, an existing historic, FHA insured Section 8 complex located at 4450 Cedar Avenue
in the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, the Phyllis Wheatley
Association is proposing to develop
up to fifty-six (56) units in the
Emeritus House; and
Whereas,
one
hundred
percent
(100%) of these units will be affordable to and occupied by families
earning sixty percent (60%) or less
of the area median gross income; and
Whereas, the proposed development meets the special needs category for the elderly with a one hundred percent (100%) set aside for
the elderly; and
Whereas, the property will maintain its Section 8 subsidy; and
Whereas, the Emeritus House project, proposed by the Phyllis Wheatley Association, will benefit the citizens of the City; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
city of Cleveland supports the proposal of the Phyllis Wheatley Association to provide affordable housing for the citizens of Cleveland
through the use of funding from the
Housing
Development

Res. No. 356-04.
By Council Member Jones.
An emergency resolution encouraging the Administration to establish a cost recovery system that
enables the City of Cleveland to bill

March 17, 2004
motor vehicle insurance companies
for costs associated with the Division of Fire responding to motor
vehicle collisions and incidents.
Whereas, national statistics show
that forty percent (40%) of motor
vehicle accidents are caused by nonresident drivers; and
Whereas,
the
costs
associated
with responding to these motor vehicle accidents are placed upon the
taxpayers of the City of Cleveland;
and
Whereas, with increased response
to motor vehicle accidents comes
increased demands on all operational areas of the Division of Fire;
and
Whereas, municipalities in Ohio
are able to acquire costs associated
with emergency runs by the Division of Fire; and
Whereas, the establishment of a
program enabling the City of Cleveland to bill motor vehicle insurance
companies for costs associated with
the Division of Fire’s response to
motor vehicle collision and incidents
will reduce the burden placed upon
the City’s taxpayers; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
encourages the Administration to
establish a cost recovery system
that enables the City of Cleveland
to bill motor vehicle insurance companies for costs associated with the
Division of Fire responding to motor
vehicle collisions and incidents.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period

An emergency resolution requesting that the Ohio Civil Rights Commission allocate time during Housing Advocates reconsideration hearing in a fair and equitable manner;
requesting
that
the
Ohio
Civil
Rights Commission grant the Housing Advocates request for reconsideration; requesting that the Ohio
Civil Rights Commission, upon a
probable cause determination, immediately refer the seven charges of
discrimination for conciliation as
required by state law; and reconvening Council’s special committee
on Insurance Discrimination.
Whereas, Federal and Ohio law
prohibits discrimination in the sale
of fire, extended coverage or homeowners insurance because of race,
color, religion, sex, familial status,
ancestry, handicap, or national origin or because of the racial compo-

The City Record
sition of the neighborhood in which
housing accommodations are located; and
Whereas, Section 665.03(e) of the
Codified Ordinances of the City of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, prohibits discrimination against any person in
the provision of property and casualty insurance; and
Whereas, it has been brought to
the attention of members of Cleveland City Council that insurance
companies require residents of the
City of Cleveland to pay higher premiums for property and casualty
insurance than residents of surrounding communities are required
to pay; and
Whereas, such premiums are, in
many instances, significantly higher; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland is
a diverse City with a greater number of persons of color compared to
the remainder of Cuyahoga County;
and
Whereas, the practice of requiring
higher insurance premiums for City
of Cleveland residents has a discriminatory impact on City of Cleveland residents; and
Whereas, The Housing Advocates,
Inc.
(“Housing
Advocates”),
has
undertaken an investigation and did
several studies to review base rate
premiums and geographical territorial rating zones for the City of
Cleveland and the remainder of
Cuyahoga County; and
Whereas, this investigation has
shown that City of Cleveland residents pay more for homeowners
insurance than residents living in
surrounding cities and this has a
racial and ethnic disparate impact
on City of Cleveland residents; and
Whereas, Housing Advocates has
filed a total of twenty-eight charges
of housing discrimination against
twenty-eight insurance companies
based on its investigation with the
Ohio Civil Rights Commission; and
Whereas, the Ohio Civil Rights
Commission completed its investigation of the first seven (7) charges
and found that there is no probable
cause to believe that discrimination
occurred; and
Whereas, it appears the investigation failed to request certain documents from the respondents which
may have an impact on the outcome
of the investigation; and
Whereas, it appears that the Commission’s
investigation
failed
to
address Housing Advocates suggestion for a less restrictive alternative
methods to avoid or at least reduce
the imposition of much higher premiums on our residents; and
Whereas, it appears that Housing
Advocates have made a case for disparate impact by the insurance companies in the pricing of insurance
products in the City of Cleveland
versus the remainder of Cuyahoga
County; and
Whereas, in a written request to
the Ohio Civil Rights Commission
for an oral hearing to reconsider the
no probable cause determination,
Housing Advocates requested a total
of thirty-five minutes or five minutes per charge to outline the
unique
factual
circumstances
of
each charge; and
Whereas, the Ohio Civil Rights
Commission notified Housing Advocates that they will be provided
with a total of fifteen minutes to
present their request for reconsideration on all seven (7) charges; and

451

27
Whereas, the Ohio Civil Rights
Commission is providing the insurance industry with ten minutes of
time to respond to each of the seven
(7) charges; and
Whereas, the Ohio Civil Rights
Commission’s allocation of time at
the
oral
hearing
scheduled
for
March 11, 2004 is unbalanced and
appears to be biased in favor of the
insurance companies as Housing
Advocates is provided with approximately two minutes per charge to
outline the reasons probable cause
of discrimination exists and the
insurance industry is provided with
ten minutes per charge to rebut any
claim of Housing Advocates; and
Whereas, this Council is concerned about equity and fairness in
appeals before the Ohio Civil Rights
Commission; and
Whereas, the Ohio Civil Rights
Commission is mandated by State
law to carry out and enforce the fair
housing laws of the State of Ohio;
and
Whereas, members of Cleveland
City Council, after being provided
information about the scope and
findings of the Commission investigation, urge the Ohio Civil Rights
Commission members to overturn
the initial determination and find
that there is probable cause to
believe that discrimination occurred
regarding these first seven charges
filed by Housing Advocates.; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes and emergency measure for
the immediate preservation of public peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby requests that the Ohio Civil
Rights Commission allocate time
during Housing Advocates reconsideration hearing in a fair and equitable manner.
Section 2. That this Council hereby requests that the Ohio Civil
Rights Commission carefully review
the brief and exhibits submitted by
the Housing Advocates and grant
the Housing Advocates’ request for
reconsideration.
Section 3. That, if this request for
reconsideration
is
granted,
this
Council requests that the Ohio Civil
Rights
Commission
immediately
refer the seven charges of discrimination for conciliation in an attempt
to resolve the charges, as mandated
by State law.
Section 4. That this Council hereby reconvenes its special committee on Insurance Discrimination,
chaired by Councilman O’Malley, to
closely
monitor
the
conciliation
process and the investigation of the
remaining twenty-one charges of
discrimination filed by the Housing
Advocates
with
the
Ohio
Civil
Rights Commission.
Section 5. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to Ohio Governor Bob Taft, Pastor Aaron Wheeler Sr., Chairperson and Commissioner, Ohio Civil Rights Commission;

it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

By Council Members Zone, Westbrook and Jones.
An emergency resolution opposing
House Bill 218, which revises the
declaration of the boundaries of the
land and waters of Lake Erie that
are within the Public Trust and
specifies by definition that littoral
owners have increased rights of submerged lands and waters fronting
their land.
Whereas,
state
representatives
recently introduced House Bill 218,
which would weaken the authority
of the State and local government to
manage the Lake Erie shoreline in
the public interest by removing the
authority of both the State and local
government
to
authorize
and
approve projects; and
Whereas, the bill would limit the
State’s ability to adequately protect
vulnerable coastal areas by removing the states authority to manage
and protect coastal erosion; and
Whereas, the bill would redefine
the littoral rights to allow construction of private structures below
the “natural low watermark”; and
Whereas, the bill would cede title
to hundreds of acres of land that it
holds in trust for the people of Ohio,
placing
the
individual
property
rights of 15,000 private property
owners above the common interests
of the 11 million citizens of Ohio;
and
Whereas, the State of Ohio would
be the only Great Lake State to not
recognize the average high water
mark as the boundary separating
public property and private property; and
Whereas, the bill would severely
limit the State’s stewardship of the
Lake Erie shore on behalf of the
public trust; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby opposes House Bill 218 which
revises the declaration of the boundaries of the land and waters of Lake
Erie that are within the Public
Trust and specifies by definition
that littoral owners have increased
rights of submerged lands and
waters fronting their land.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to the
appropriate members of the Ohio
Senate Energy, Natural Resources
and Environmental Committees and
those members of the Ohio General
Assembly representing residents of
Cuyahoga County.

An emergency resolution objecting to the transfer of ownership of
a D1, D2, D3, D3A and D6 Liquor
Permit to 10510-12 Madison Avenue,
1st Floor and Basement.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Department of Liquor
Control of an application for the
transfer of ownership of a D1, D2,
D3, D3A and D6 Liquor Permit from
16800 Lorain Avenue, Inc., Sol Tushman Receiver, 10510-12 Madison Avenue, 1st Floor and Basement, Cleveland, Ohio 44102, Permanent Number
8202608 to WB Holdings, Inc., 1051012 Madison Avenue, 1st Floor and
Basement, Cleveland, Ohio 44102,
Permanent Number 9279409; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of
notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby record its objection to the transfer of ownership of a D1, D2, D3,
D3A and D6 Liquor Permit from
16800 Lorain Avenue, Inc., Sol Tushman
