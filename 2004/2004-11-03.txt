such
insurance
carrier

or Customer is responsible to repair
damage in the streets or public
grounds caused by Grantee or due
to defects or leaks in the Steam System, Grantee shall promptly make
any necessary repairs pending resolution of such dispute. The cost of
such repairs may be part of any
such resolution, and may be charged
to the Customer if it is determined
that the repairs were the responsibility of the Customer. The Grantee
acknowledges its obligation to operate and maintain the Steam System
so that it is not in such condition as
to be a hazard to the health, safety

the
public,

to reasonably require the Grantee to
make necessary repairs or improvements
to
abate
said
condition.

8, 1999, and a $4,998,680.50 Nontax
Revenue Bond, Series 1999B (Cleveland Stadium Project) delivered on

this ordinance as the “Prior Bonds”);
and
Whereas, the City seeks to obtain
debt service savings by refunding
the Prior Bonds by the obligations

26
authorized in this Ordinance (the
“Bonds”); and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of the City, has certified to this Council that the estimated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be refinanced with
the proceeds of the Bonds is at least
five (5) years and the maximum
maturity of the Bonds is August 1,
2029; and
Whereas, the issuance of the
Bonds is necessary to provide funds
to refund the Prior Bonds and
obtain debt service savings at the
earliest possible time, and as a
result, this Ordinance constitutes an
emergency measure providing for
the immediate preservation of the
public peace, property, health and
safety, and for the usual daily operation of a municipal department;
now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is necessary
to issue the Bonds in an aggregate
principal amount not to exceed
$15,000,000 for the purpose of refunding the Prior Bonds, including payment of financing costs within the
meaning of Section 133.01(K) of the
Revised Code. The City shall obtain
aggregate net present value savings
of not less than three percent (3%)
as a result of refunding the Prior
Bonds by the Bonds authorized by
this Ordinance.
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Sections
133.01 to 133.70, inclusive, and other
applicable provisions of the Revised
Code, the Charter of the City and
this Ordinance in the principal
amount and for the purpose stated
in Section 1. The Bonds shall be designated “Nontax Revenue Refunding
Bonds, Series 2004.” The Bonds shall
be issued in one lot as fully registered Bonds in denominations of
$5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. The Bonds shall be numbered as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance.
The Bonds shall be dated as of
December 1, 2004, or such other date
specified in the certificate of the
Director of Finance providing for
the final terms of the Bonds and the
sale of the Bonds in accordance
with this Ordinance (the “Certificate
of Award”). The Bonds shall bear
interest at the rate or rates per year
specified
in
the
Certificate
of
Award; provided that if all the
Bonds bear interest at the same rate
per year, then such rate shall not
exceed six percent (6%) per year,
and if the Bonds bear interest at
more than one rate per year, then
the weighted average of such rates
(taking into account the principal
amount and maturity of each Bond
to which a rate applies) shall not
exceed six percent (6%) per year.
Interest on the Bonds shall be
payable, until the principal amount
is paid, semi-annually on June 1 and
December 1 of each year or on the
days specified in the Certificate of
Award as the dates on which interest on the Bonds shall be payable
(the
“Interest
Payment
Dates”),
beginning June 1, 2005 or on such
other Interest Payment Date specified in the Certificate of Award as
the first Interest Payment Date.

The City Record
The Bonds shall mature on December 1 in the years and amounts set
forth in the Certificate of Award,
provided that (i) each principal payment shall occur on an Interest Payment Date, (ii) the final maturity
date of the Bonds shall be no later
than August 1, 2029, and (iii) the
principal amount payable in any fiscal year shall not exceed $2,000,000.
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the
“Mandatory
Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
Section 3. Redemption. The Bonds
shall be subject to redemption prior
to stated maturity as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates. The aggregate of the moneys to be deposited
in the Debt Service Fund for payment of principal of and interest on
any
Term
Bonds
shall
include
amounts sufficient to redeem on the
Mandatory Redemption Dates the
principal amount of Term Bonds
payable on those dates pursuant to
the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements (less the
amount of any credit as provided
below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 4) for cancellation Term
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City
for any Term Bonds. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing a
certificate to the Registrar, signed
by the Director of Finance, setting
forth the extent of the credit to be
applied with respect to the then current
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirement. If the certificate is not timely furnished to
the Registrar, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding
mandatory
redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds which
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of

2152

November 3, 2004
the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption
Requirements)
or
purchased for cancellation and canceled
by the Registrar, to the extent not
applied
theretofore
as
a
credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of
the principal amount thereof against
the then current Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement (and
corresponding mandatory redemption obligation). Any excess of that
amount
over
the
then
current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement shall be credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligations) in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(b)
Optional
Redemption.
The
Bonds may be subject to redemption
prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole or in
part on any date, in integral multiples of $5,000, on the optional
redemption dates and at the redemption prices (expressed as a percentage
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed) specified in the Certificate of Award, plus, in each case,
accrued interest to the redemption
date, provided the first optional
redemption date shall not be later
than December 1, 2014 and the highest redemption price shall not be
greater than 102%. The Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that it is in the
best interests of the City for the
Bonds not to be callable prior to
their stated maturity.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar. That notice shall specify
the redemption date and the principal amount of each maturity of
Bonds to be redeemed, and shall be
given at least forty-five (45) days
prior to the redemption date or such
shorter period as shall be acceptable
to the Registrar. There shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date funds
sufficient to redeem at the redemption price all of the redeemable
Bonds for which notice of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Bonds by lot when Bonds of

November 3, 2004
denominations greater than $5,000
are then outstanding, each $5,000
unit of principal thereof shall be
treated as though it were a separate
Bond of the denomination of $5,000.
If it is determined that one or more,
but not all of the $5,000 units of
principal amount represented by a
Bond are to be called for redemption, then upon notice of redemption
of a $5,000 unit or units, the registered owner of that Bond shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i)
for payment of the redemption price
of the $5,000 unit or units called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption and any
premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing and to any
municipal bond insurance company
that has issued a policy insuring
some or all of the Bonds. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity
of
the
proceedings
for
the
redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph, the Bonds and portions
thereof called for redemption shall
become due and payable on the
redemption date, and, upon presentation and surrender at the place or
places specified in that notice, shall
be paid. If money for the redemption of all of the Bonds and portions
thereof to be redeemed, including
interest accrued to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, and, if notice of
redemption has been deposited in
the mail, then from and after the
redemption date those Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall cease to bear interest and
no longer shall be considered to be
outstanding. If that money shall not
be so available on the redemption
date, or that notice shall not have
been deposited in the mail, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money

The City Record
held
by
the
Registrar
for
the
redemption of particular Bonds shall
be held in trust for the account of
the registered owners and shall be
paid to them, respectively, upon presentation and surrender of those
Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar as paying agent. Principal
shall be payable when due upon presentation
and
surrender
of
the
Bonds at the principal corporate
trust office of the Registrar. Interest on a Bond shall be paid on each
Interest Payment Date by check or
draft mailed to the person in whose
name the Bond was registered, and
to that person’s address appearing,
on the Bond Register (as defined in
Section 4) at the close of business
on the date provided in the Agreement authorized in Section 4 (the
“Record Date”).
Section 4. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agent. The Bonds
shall express upon their faces the
purpose for which they are issued
and that they are issued pursuant to
this Ordinance. The Bonds shall be
signed by the Mayor and by the
Director of Finance. Either or both
of those signatures may be a facsimile. The Bonds shall bear the
seal of the City, which may be a facsimile. The Director of Law shall
prepare the Bonds and shall evidence approval of the form and correctness of the Bonds by his or her
manual or facsimile signature.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating agent, bond registrar, transfer
agent and paying agent for the
Bonds (the “Registrar”). The Director of Finance shall sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City,
the
Registrar
Agreement
between the City and the Registrar
(the “Agreement”) in substantially
the form as is now on file with the
Clerk of Council in File No. 1769-04A. The Agreement is approved,
together
with
any
changes
or
amendments that are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and not
substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Agreement or amendments to the
Agreement
by
the
Director
of
Finance. The Director of Law shall
determine and approve the form and
correctness of the Agreement. The
Director of Finance shall provide for
the payment of the services rendered and for reimbursement of
expenses incurred pursuant to the
Agreement from the proceeds of the
Bonds to the extent available and
then from other money lawfully
available and appropriated or to be
appropriated for that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its designated corporate
trust office all books and records
necessary
for
the
registration,
exchange and transfer of Bonds as
provided in this Section (the “Bond
Register”). Subject to the provisions
of Section 5 with respect to beneficial owners, the person in whose

2153

27
name a Bond is registered on the
Bond Register shall be regarded as
the absolute owner of that Bond for
all purposes of this Ordinance. Payment of or on account of the debt
charges on any Bond shall be made
only to or upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall be affected by any notice
to the contrary, but the registration
may be changed as provided in this
Section. All such payments shall be
valid and effectual to satisfy and
discharge the City’s liability upon
the Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Bond at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner
or
by
a
person
legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of
this Ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Bonds
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
Ordinance, as the Bonds surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully regis-

28
tered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized: (i) the
Bonds may be issued in the form of
a single, fully registered Bond representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the beneficial
owners in book entry form shall
have no right to receive Bonds in
the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for
transfer to another Depository or to
another nominee of a Depository,
without further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Bonds from the Depository,
and the Registrar shall authenticate
and deliver bond certificates in registered form to the assigns of the
Depository or its nominee, all at the
cost and expense (including any
costs of printing), if the event is not
the result of City action or inaction,
of those persons requesting such
issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
authorized
and
directed
to
the
extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form

The City Record
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 5. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking
Fund and, if not purchased by them,
shall be offered to the Treasury
Investment Account for purchase
and, if not purchased for that
Account, shall be sold to A.G.
Edwards & Sons, Inc. and SBKBrooks Investment Corp. (together,
the “Original Purchaser”).
The Certificate of Award shall
specify the final terms of the Bonds
in accordance with law, the provisions of this Ordinance, the written
advice of either Government Capital
Management,
LLC
or
Columbia
Equity Financial Corporation or
both (the “Financial Advisor”), and
the Original Purchaser’s offer to
purchase the Bonds, including: the
principal amount of the Bonds, the
purchase price (which shall be not
less than 97% of the principal
amount plus accrued interest to
their date of delivery), the interest
rate or rates, the amounts and years
in which principal is payable (at
stated
maturity
or
pursuant
to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements), the Interest
Payment Dates and the date of the
Bonds (if different from those set
forth in Section 2) and any other
matters required in this Ordinance
to be set forth in that Certificate.
The Mayor, the Director of Finance,
and the Director of Law, as appropriate, and other appropriate City
officials are, and each of them is,
authorized and directed to take such
actions as are necessary, appropriate and in the best interest of the
City to establish the terms and
requirements for delivery of the
Bonds and to make such arrangements as are necessary with the
Original Purchaser in order to establish the date, location, and procedure, and conditions for the delivery
of the Bonds to the Original Purchaser,
to
give
all
appropriate
notices and certificates, to cause a
true transcript of proceedings with
reference to the issuance of the
Bonds to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Director of Finance is
further authorized and directed to
sign and deliver on behalf of the
City a bond purchase agreement
(the “Bond Purchase Agreement”),
approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, between the
City and the Original Purchaser setting forth the terms and conditions
on which the City agrees to sell the
Bonds and the Original Purchaser
agrees to buy the Bonds on terms
consistent with this Ordinance. The
Bond
Purchase
Agreement
is
approved substantially in the form
now on the file with the Clerk of
Council in the File referenced in
Section 4, together with any changes
or amendments that are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and not
substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Direc-

2154

November 3, 2004
tor of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Bond
Purchase
Agreement
or
amendments to the Bond Purchase
Agreement
by
the
Director
of
Finance. It is determined that the
terms of the Bonds, as provided in
this Ordinance and as may be provided in or pursuant to the Certificate of Award, are in the best interest of the City and in compliance
with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an
Official Statement is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
original issuance of the Bonds, those
officers in their official capacities
are authorized to prepare or cause
to be prepared on behalf of the City
an Official Statement and any necessary supplements and to authorize
the use and distribution of that Official Statement and any supplements.
Each of those officers is authorized
to sign on behalf of the City and in
his or her official capacity that Official Statement and any supplements
approved by that officer. Those officers are, and each of them is, authorized to sign and deliver, on behalf
of the City and in their official
capacities, such certificates in connection with the accuracy of the
Official Statement and any supplements as may, in their judgment, be
necessary or appropriate. Those officers are also authorized to determine and certify on behalf of the
City that such disclosure document
is “deemed final” by the City within the meaning of Securities and
Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12
(the “SEC Rule”). The Director of
Finance is authorized to contract for
services for the production and distribution of preliminary and final
official statements, including by
printed and electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under, the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
and directed to prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Bonds in accordance
with the SEC Rule. The performance
of that Agreement shall be subject
to the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of informa-

November 3, 2004
tion and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of the
occurrence of any other events, the
Director of Finance shall consult
with, as appropriate, the Financial
Advisor and legal counsel.
Section 6. Source of Payment of
the Bonds. The Bonds shall be special obligations of the City, and the
debt charges on the Bonds shall be
payable solely from moneys of the
City which are not moneys raised by
taxation, to the extent available for
the purpose of paying debt charges
on the Bonds, including, but not limited to the following: (a) grants
from the United States of America
and the State; (b) payments in lieu
of taxes now or hereafter authorized
by State statute; (c) fines and forfeitures which are deposited in the
City’s
General
Fund;
(d)
fees
deposited in the City’s General Fund
for services provided and from properly imposed licenses and permits;
(e) investment earnings on the
City’s General Fund; (f) investment
earnings on other funds of the City
that are credited to the City’s General Fund; (g) proceeds from the
sale of assets which are deposited
in the City’s General Fund; (h) gifts
and donations; and (i) all rental
payments which are deposited in the
City’s General Fund (collectively,
the “Nontax Revenues”). The Bonds
are not and shall not be secured by
an obligation or pledge of any
money raised by taxation. The
Bonds do not and shall not represent
or constitute a debt or pledge of the
faith and credit or taxing power of
the City, and the owners thereof
have and shall have no right to
have taxes levied by the City for the
payment of debt charges thereon.
The Bonds shall contain a statement
to that effect and to the effect that
the Bonds are payable solely from
the Nontax Revenues and are not
secured by an obligation or pledge
of any money raised by taxation.
The City covenants and agrees
that while the Bonds are outstanding, it will appropriate and maintain
Nontax Revenues at such times and
in such amounts as will be sufficient, together with any other funds
available for the purpose, to pay the
debt charges on the Bonds and will
so restrict other obligations payable
from Nontax Revenues prior to or on
a parity with the Bonds as will
ensure the continuing availability
for appropriation of sufficient Nontax Revenues to pay debt charges
when due.
Section 7. Debt Service Fund; Payment of Debt Charges on the Bonds.
There is created by the City a separate fund or account designated as
the “Series 2004 Nontax Revenue
Refunding Bonds (Cleveland Stadium Project) Debt Service Fund”
(referred to in this Ordinance as the
“Debt Service Fund”). There shall be
deposited in the Debt Service Fund,
on or prior to the date debt charges
on the Bonds are due, Nontax Revenues in an amount sufficient to pay
those debt charges. Money in the
Debt Service Fund shall be invested
in accordance with the City’s investment policies then in effect. The
payment of debt service on the
Bonds is secured by a pledge of and
lien on the Debt Service Fund. The
City shall not be required to use or
apply
to
the
payment
of
debt

The City Record
charges on the Bonds any funds or
revenues from any source other than
the Nontax Revenues. However, the
City, of its own volition, is not prohibited from using, to the extent
that it is authorized by law to do
so, any other resources for the fulfillment of any of the terms, conditions or obligations of this Ordinance or of the Bonds.
The City will, solely from the proceeds of the Bonds or from the Nontax Revenues, pay or cause to be
paid the debt charges on the Bonds
on the dates, at the places and in
the manner provided in this Ordinance and in the Bonds. For that
purpose, in each year while the
Bonds are outstanding, this Council,
after providing for the payment of
debt charges payable on the City’s
general obligation securities in that
year from sources available for that
purpose, will appropriate Nontax
Revenues required to pay, and for
the purpose of paying, the debt
charges due in that year on the
Bonds (less other money available
for the purpose) and any outstanding parity obligations payable from
Nontax
Revenues.
Further,
this

prior to passage of the ordinance
authorizing such parity obligations,
the Director of Finance shall have
certified to this Council that the
Nontax Revenues during the preceding calendar year, adjusted to
reflect, if necessary, changes in the
rates or charges resulting in the
Nontax
Revenues,
aggregate
in
amount not less than 100% of the
highest amount of (a) debt charges
on the Bonds and (b) required payments on such proposed parity obligations and any outstanding parity
obligations due in any succeeding
calendar year.
Each
obligation
of
the
City
required to be undertaken pursuant
to this Ordinance and the Bonds is
binding upon the City, and upon
each officer or employee of the City
as may from time to time have the
authority under law to take any
action on behalf of the City as may
be necessary to perform all or any
part of such obligation, as a duty of
the City and of each of those officers and employees resulting from
an office, trust or station within the
meaning of Section 2731.01 of the
Revised Code, providing for enforcement by writ of mandamus.
Section 8. Refunding of Prior
Bonds. The Prior Bonds are subject
to prepayment by the City in whole
or in part on any date, without
penalty or premium, upon three
business days’ notice to the registered owner, together with interest
accrued but unpaid on the amount

prepaid
(the
compound
accreted
amount) to the date of prepayment.
Upon the sale of the Bonds, the
Director of Finance is authorized
and directed to give notice of prepayment of the Prior Bonds on the
date determined by the Director of
Finance to be the earliest practicable date for that prepayment. The
Director of Finance is authorized
and directed to take such other
actions as may be necessary or
appropriate to accomplish the prepayment of the Prior Bonds.
Section 9. Application of Proceeds
of Bonds. The proceeds of the Bonds
shall be applied as follows: (i) any
amount received as accrued interest
or premium on the Bonds shall be
deposited in the Debt Service Fund
created in Section 7 of this Ordinance, (ii) an amount determined by
the calculation agent for the Prior
Bonds to be sufficient to prepay the

Prior Bonds on the prepayment date
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance pursuant to Section 8 of
this Ordinance shall be applied to
that prepayment, and (iii) the balance of the proceeds shall be used
to pay financing costs within the
meaning of Section 133.01(K) of the
Revised Code, including the cost of
any bond insurance or other credit
support with respect to the Bonds.
Section 10. Defeasance of the
Bonds.

City shall pay or make provision for
payment of the principal, any premium and interest on all the outstanding

this
Ordinance
(except for Sections 3 and 10(b))
shall cease to be of further effect,
and the covenants, agreements and
other obligations of the City under
this Ordinance shall be discharged
and satisfied.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 10(a), if:
(i) the Paying Agent shall hold in
trust for and irrevocably committed
solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Paying Agent shall hold
in trust for, and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations of the United States certified
by an independent firm of national
reputation to be of such maturities
and interest payment dates and to
bear such interest, without further
investment or reinvestment of either
the principal amount thereof or the
interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held in trust and committed, except as hereinafter provided), as will be sufficient, together with moneys referred to in (i)
above, for the payment, at their
maturities or redemption dates, of
all debt charges on the Bonds to
their date of maturity or redemption, as the case may be, or if
default in such payment shall have
occurred on such date then to the
date of the tender of such payment;
provided, that if any Bonds are to
be redeemed prior to the maturity
thereof, notice of such redemption
shall have been duly given or irrevocable provision satisfactory to the
Trustee shall have been duly made
for the giving of such notice. Any
moneys held by the Paying Agent in
accordance with the provisions of
this Section may be invested in

30
direct obligations of the United
States of America maturing, or
redeemable at the option of the holder, at times and in amounts sufficient to meet payment of debt
charges on the Bonds, as directed by
the Director of Finance.
Section 11. Ratings, Insurance,
and Other Credit Enhancement. If,
in the judgment of the Director of
Finance, based on written advice of
a Financial Advisor, the filing of an
application for a rating on the
Bonds by one or more nationally recognized rating agencies, or the
obtaining of an insurance policy or
other credit support instrument is in
the best interest of, and financially
advantageous to, the City, the Director of Finance is authorized to prepare and submit those applications
and to obtain that credit support
instrument. The cost of obtaining
each rating and any credit support
instrument, except to the extent
paid by the Original Purchaser in
accordance
with
the
Purchase
Agreement, shall be paid from the
proceeds of the Bonds. The Director
of Finance may enter into any written agreements he determines are
necessary to obtain a credit support
instrument,
consistent
with
this
Ordinance. The form and correctness
of any such agreement shall be
determined and approved by the
Director of Law.
Section 12. Federal Tax Covenants. The City covenants that it
will use, and will restrict the use
and investment of, the proceeds of
the Bonds in such manner and to
such extent as may be necessary so
that (a) the Bonds will not (i) constitute private activity bonds, arbitrage bonds or hedge bonds under
Sections 141, 148 or 149 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) or (ii) be treated
other than as bonds to which Section 103(a) of the Code applies, and
(b) the interest thereon will not be
treated as an item of tax preference
under Section 57 of the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the Bonds
to be and to remain excluded from
gross income for federal income tax
purposes, (b) it will not take or
authorize to be taken any actions
that would adversely affect that
exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting for it, will, among other acts of
compliance, (i) apply the proceeds
of the Bonds to the governmental
purpose
of
the
borrowing,
(ii)
restrict the yield on investment
property acquired with those proceeds, (iii) make timely and adequate payments to the federal government, (iv) maintain books and
records and make calculations and
reports, and (v) refrain from certain
uses of those proceeds, and, as
applicable,
of
property
financed
with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the extent necessary to
assure such exclusion of that interest under the Code.
Each covenant made in this section with respect to the Bonds is
also made with respect to all issues
any portion of the debt service on
which is paid from proceeds of the
Bonds (and, if different, the original
issue and any refunding issues in a
series of refundings), to the extent
such compliance is necessary to
assure exclusion of interest on the

The City Record
Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes, and the officers identified above are authorized
to take actions with respect to those
issues as they are authorized in this
Section to take with respect to the
Bonds.
The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer of
the City having responsibility for
issuance of the Bonds is authorized
(a) to make or effect any election,
selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or waiver on behalf
of the City with respect to the
Bonds as the City is permitted or
required to make or give under the
federal income tax laws, including,
without limitation thereto, any of
the elections provided for in Section
148(f)(4)(C) of the Code or available under Section 148 of the Code,
for the purpose of assuring, enhancing or protecting favorable tax
treatment or status of the Bonds or
interest thereon or assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose,
reducing
the
burden
or
expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or payments
or penalties, or making payments of
special amounts in lieu of making
computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as rebate, or
obviating those amounts or payments, as determined by that officer,
which action shall be in writing and
signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf
of the City, as may be appropriate
to assure the exclusion of interest
from gross income and the intended
tax status of the Bonds, and (c) to
give one or more appropriate certificates of the City, for inclusion in
the transcript of proceedings for the
Bonds, setting forth the reasonable
expectations of the City regarding
the amount and use of all the proceeds of the Bonds, the facts, circumstances and estimates on which
they are based, and other facts and
circumstances relevant to the tax
treatment of the interest on and the
tax status of the Bonds.
Section 13. Interest Rate Hedges
and Other Arrangements. For the
purpose of achieving the optimal
available debt structure for the
Bonds, the Director of Finance may,
based on the written advice of a
financial advisor (which may be the
Financial Advisor identified in Section 5 or may be another firm experienced in advising municipalities
concerning hedging arrangements),
enter into one or more agreements
in anticipation of, in connection
with or subsequent to the issuance
of the Bonds for an interest rate
swap, an interest rate cap or other
arrangements to lower the effective
interest rate on the obligations of
the City or to hedge the exposure of
the City against fluctuations in prevailing interest rates or to optimize
the City’s cash flow, provided, however, that: (i) the counterparty to
any such agreement or arrangement
shall have a rating of at least “A”
by either Moody’s Investors Service,
Inc., or Standard & Poor’s Corporation; (ii) no such agreement or
arrangement shall purport to entitle
the counterparty or provider to payment by the City from any source
other than the sources of payment
for the Bonds as described in this

2156

November 3, 2004
Ordinance; (iii) the terms of the
agreements or arrangements shall
have been determined by the Director of Finance, based on the written
advice of a financial advisor, to be
justified by the corresponding benefit to the City and to be commercially reasonable based on then current market conditions. The form
and correctness of any agreement
entered into under authority of this
Section shall be approved by the
Director of Law.

that all formal actions of this Council and any of its committees concerning and relating to the passage

of this Ordinance is declared to be
an independent section or part of a
section and, notwithstanding any
other evidence of legislative intent,
it is declared to be the controlling
legislative intent that if any such
section or part of a section or any
