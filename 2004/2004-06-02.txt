An emergency ordinance to amend
Section 3103.09 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as
amended by Ordinance No. 2370-01,
passed May 13, 2002, relating to the
unsafe structure and exterior property nuisances.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 3103.09 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended by
Ordinance No. 2370-01, passed May
13, 2002, is amended to read as follows:
Section 3103.09 Unsafe Structures
and Exterior Property Nuisances;
Violation
and
Remedial
Notices;
Cost Recovery
(a) Legislative Findings.
Council of the City of Cleveland
finds that:
(1) Structures that are vacant and
open to entry at doors, windows or
other points accessible to the general public:
A. Attract children to enter;
B. Become harborage for vermin;
C. Serve as temporary abode for
derelicts, vagrants and criminals;
and
D. Are likely to be damaged by
vandals or set ablaze by arsonists.
(2) Unkept grounds surrounding
such vacant, open structures invite
the dumping of garbage and rubbish
thereupon;
(3) Thousands of structures in
this City are made of wood-frame
construction that is more flammable
than other building types;
(4) Thousands of structures in
this City are situated on narrow lots
and in close proximity to one another, thereby increasing the risk of
conflagration and spread of insect
and rodent infestation;
(5) Population loss and economic
decline experienced by the City in
recent years has caused the incidence of vacant, open structures,
high grass, weeds, junk, debris, and
junk motor vehicles to increase significantly;
(6) Such vacant, open structures
often become dilapidated because
they are not repaired by the owners
or persons in control of said structures;
(7) Structures that are vacant and
open to entry, high grass, weeds,
junk, debris, and junk motor vehicles depress the market value of
surrounding properties;
(8) The existence of certain hazardous conditions may require a
structure to be vacated; such conditions include but are not limited to:
A. Danger of structural collapse;
B. Inadequate heat or use of dangerous heating mechanism;
C. Danger of fire; and
D. Lack of plumbing in safe working order.
(9) Structures that remain boarded for an extended period of time
contribute to blight, cause a decrease in neighboring property val-

The City Record
ues, create targets for arson, and
lead to the cancellation of homeowners’ insurance for neighboring
property owners.
(10) The following conditions provide
harborage
and
breeding
grounds for pests or otherwise create human-health problems:
A. Grass over 8 inches in height.
B. Noxious weeds including Russian, Canadian, or common thistle;
wild lettuce; wild mustard; wild
parsley; ragweed; milk weed; iron
weed; wild plants that can cause
skin reaction upon contact or produce or aggravate hay fever, asthma, allergic respiratory reaction, or
similar conditions; and all other noxious weeds.
C. Refuse including trash, junk,
garbage and food waste, offal, animal wastes, tires, and all other
waste materials.
D. Stagnant surface water.
(11) As used in this Chapter,
“junk motor vehicle” means a motor
vehicle that meets all of the following criteria:
A. Three model years old or older;
B. Apparently inoperable;
C. Extensively damaged, including, but not limited to, any of the
following: missing wheels, tires,
engine, or transmission.
D. Having a fair market value of
one-thousand five-hundred dollars or
less. (R.C. § 4513.65)
(b) Declaration of Nuisance.
(1) All buildings or structures
that are injurious to or a menace to
the public health, safety or welfare,
or are structurally unsafe, unsanitary or not provided with adequate
safe egress, or which constitute a
fire hazard, or which are vacant and
open to public entry, or which are
otherwise dangerous to human life
or injurious to the public, or which
in relation to existing use constitute
a hazard to the public health, safety or welfare by reason of inadequate
maintenance,
dilapidation,
obsolescence or abandonment, are,
severally, for the purposes of this
Building
Code,
declared
to
be
“unsafe structures”. All such unsafe
structures or conditions are hereby
declared to be public nuisances. The
public nuisance shall be abated by
correction of the violations to the
minimum standards of the Codified
Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
applicable City rules and regulations, the Ohio Revised Code, and
Ohio Administrative Code including
the Ohio Building Code, or by demolition.
(2) The conditions listed in division (a)(10) of this section are
declared to be nuisances that shall
be removed, destroyed, or abated
from any property on which they
are found.
(3) Junk motor vehicles as defined in division (a)(11) of this
section are declared to be nuisances that shall be removed or
abated from any property on which
they are found. Junk motor vehicles are declared to be a nuisance
because:
A. They harbor rodents, vermin,
and other pests;
B. They contain toxic substances
and flammable liquids and fumes;

1080

June 2, 2004
C. They attract children to enter;
D. They serve as temporary abode
for derelicts, vagrants and criminals;
E. They diminish neighboring
property values; and,
F. They are likely to be damaged
by vandals or set ablaze by arsonists.
(c) Effective Boarding Pending
Rehabilitation.
(1) Permits:
Pending the correction of the violations to the minimum standards of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, applicable City
rules and regulations, the Ohio
Revised Code, and the Ohio Administrative Code, including the Ohio
Building Code, the owner of a structure
may
secure
the
structure
through effective boarding. In order
to effectively board the structure,
the owner of the structure shall
apply, within seven (7) days of
receiving a notice of violation, to
the Division of Building and Housing for a permit to board. The Division of Building and Housing shall
review the condition of the structure, determine if it can be effectively boarded, and grant or deny
the owner’s permit to board, setting
forth special requirements, if any,
necessary for compliance with minimum standards for effective boarding. The owner shall effectively
board the structure within seven (7)
days of the issuance of a boarding
permit, or within such other time
limit that the Director deems appropriate. Structures which are boarded
without first obtaining a boarding
permit shall continue to be considered public nuisances subject to
demolition. Within thirty (30) days
of the issuance of a permit to board,
the owner of the structure shall
apply for a rehabilitation permit
pursuant to Section 3105.06 of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976. The Director may grant
an extension of time for acquiring
a rehabilitation permit upon the
owner's written request and for
good cause shown. Failure of the
owner to obtain a rehabilitation permit subsequent to effective boarding
will result in the structure being
deemed
a
public
nuisance,
and
scheduled for demolition.
(2) Materials:
The effective boarding of a structure shall include, but not be limited to, doors, windows, or other areas
of the structure open to ingress and
egress and to weather elements at
any and all levels of the structure.
Such openings shall be secured by
plywood, not less than one-half inch
(1/2") thick, or other material of
equal strength, cut and fit into the
openings. Openings in excess of
forty-eight inches (48") wide shall
be framed with two inch by four
inch (2" x 4") lumber and plywood,
or
equivalent
material
fastened
twenty-four inches (24") on center
onto frame. The plywood or equivalent material shall be fastened into
the openings by screw type nails or
lag screws.
(3) Maintenance:
Upon
effectively
boarding
the
structure, the owner shall monitor

June 2, 2004
and maintain the structure and its
surrounding premises in a safe, sanitary and secured condition. Any
portion of the exterior structure
which is deemed to be potentially
hazardous due to deteriorated conditions, or to be structurally unsound shall be removed or treated in
such a manner so as to eliminate
the hazard. The exterior premises
shall be maintained free of high
weeds, debris, junk vehicles, and
conditions that may provide harborage for rodents. Failure of the
owner to properly maintain the
building in the above condition, will
result in the structure being deemed
a public nuisance, and scheduled for
demolition.
(4) Rehabilitation:
Rehabilitation of the structure
shall commence within ninety (90)
days of receiving a rehabilitation
permit pursuant to Section 3105.06 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976. If rehabilitation of
the effectively boarded structure
does not commence within this time
period, or if the rehabilitation permit is otherwise invalidated or
revoked, then the Director may
declare that the nuisance has not
been abated and schedule the structure for demolition.
(d) Examination and Condemnation.
(1) The Director is authorized to
examine or cause to be examined
every building or other structure
reported to be unsafe or damaged or
injurious to or a menace to the public, and shall make a written record
of such examination.
(2) The Director may designate as
a public nuisance those particular
structures or conditions found to be
unsafe pursuant to division (b) of
this section.
(3)
The
Director
may
also
declare that a nuisance structure
which, due to its advanced state of
dilapidation, substantial fire damage or structural infirmity, is an
immediate hazard to human life or
health, may only be abated by
immediate repair and rehabilitation
to the minimum standards of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, applicable City rules
and regulations, the Ohio Revised
Code,
and
Ohio
Administrative
Code including the Ohio Building
Code, or by demolition.
(4) Whenever the Director finds a
vacant structure open to entry at
doors, windows or other points
accessible to the general public, he
may cause the structure to be
secured at those points of entry. The
Director shall be authorized at any
time to enter upon the premises to
secure the structure in order to
lessen the severity of the public nuisance. In securing such structure,
the Director may call upon any
department, division or bureau of
the City for whatever assistance
may be necessary, or may, by private contract, secure such structure.
Such securing shall not be deemed
to constitute “effective boarding”
pursuant to division (b) of this section, and it does not abate the nuisance condition of an unsafe struc-

The City Record
ture, as declared pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section, unless so
declared in writing by the Director.
Subsequent notice, issued pursuant
to
division
(e)(1)
below,
shall
include the fact that the Director
has found it necessary to take
appropriate action to secure the
structure.
