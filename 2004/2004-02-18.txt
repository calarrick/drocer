the Council of the City of Cleveland
on December 15, 2003, authorizes the
submission to the electors of the
City
of
Cleveland
on

amend Sections 116 and 126 of the
Charter of the City of Cleveland, to
read as follows:
§116 Police Force; Control by
Chief
The Police Force shall consist of
a Chief, three Deputy Chiefs of
Police,
eleven
Commanders
of
Police, and such other officers,

221

13
patrolmen and employees as may be
provided by ordinance or resolution
of the Council. The Mayor may
appoint a fourth Deputy Chief of
Police for homeland security and a
twelfth Commander of Police for
community policing. In case of riot
or like emergency the Mayor may
appoint additional patrolmen and
officers for temporary service who
need not be in the classified service.
The Chief of Police, the Deputy
Chiefs of Police, and the Commanders of Police shall be appointed by
the Mayor from the division of
police or they may be persons
appointed from outside the division
who shall have had training and
experience in law enforcement and
they shall serve at the pleasure of
the Mayor; provided, however, that
the Mayor shall appoint to the positions of Deputy Chief of Police and
Commander of Police from among
persons recommended by the Chief
of Police with the concurrence of
the executive head of the police
force if such executive head be
other than the Mayor. The Council
may, by ordinance, direct the Mayor
to make appointments of minorities
to the positions of Deputy Chief of
Police and Commander of Police.
Upon the termination of their service as Chief of Police, Deputy Chief
of Police, or Commander of Police
they shall, if appointed from the
division of police, revert to the civil
service status held by them at the
time of their appointment, in so far
as it is competent for this charter
so to provide. The Chief of Police
shall have exclusive control of the
stationing and transfer of patrolmen
and other officers and employees
constituting the Police Force, under
such rules and regulations as may
be established by the Mayor or by
the director of the department to
whom the Chief of Police may be
immediately responsible.
§126 Division into Classified and
Unclassified Service
The civil service of the City is
hereby divided into the unclassified
and classified service.
1. The unclassified service shall
include:
(a) All officers elected by the people.
(b) All directors of departments.
(c) The Clerk of Council.
(d) The Chief of Police, four
Deputy Chiefs of Police, and twelve
Commanders of Police.
(e) The members of all boards or
commissions appointed by the Mayor
and of advisory boards appointed by
the director of a department.
(f) The secretary to the mayor
and one secretary for each director
of a department.
(g) Eight (8) executive assistants
to the Mayor, provided, however,
that there shall be no restrictions as
to their duties or assignments.
(h) Students enrolled in a recognized college or university in a
course of training in preparation for
an administrative or professional
career in the public service and
employed upon the recommendation
of the official in charge of personnel administration as student aides

(i) School crossing guards.

The City Record

14
(j) Members of the auxiliary police
force.
2. The classified service shall comprise all positions not specifically
included by this charter in the unclassified service. There shall be in
the classified service three classes
to be known as the competitive
class, the noncompetitive class and
the ordinary unskilled labor class.
(a) The competitive class shall
include all positions and employment for which it is practicable to
determine the merit and fitness of
applicants by competitive tests.
(b) The
noncompetitive
class
shall include all positions requiring
peculiar and exceptional qualifications of a scientific, managerial, professional or educational character,
as may be determined by the Commission, the fitness of applicants for
which may be determined by noncompetitive tests.
(c) The ordinary unskilled labor
class shall include all ordinary
unskilled labor positions for which
it is impractical to give competitive
tests. Such positions shall be filled
from unskilled labor eligible lists
established and maintained by the
Commission. The Commission shall
register applicants for positions in
the labor class either continuously
or at such times as there are vacancies to be filled, provided, however,
that no registration may be accepted until public notice of the intention to so accept registrations shall
be made by the Commission. Priority of such registration shall determine an applicant’s place on the eligible list, provided the applicant
meets required standards as to age,
citizenship, physical fitness and residence as established by the Commission. Eligibility to be called for
examination following registration
shall expire one year following the
date of registration.
The
Civil
Service
Commission
shall be the sole authority under the
Charter to determine the grade and
classification of positions as to
duties and responsibilities in all
branches of the classified service.

by the Department of Liquor Control
of an application for a New C1 Liquor

Road, Cleveland, Ohio 44104, Permanent Number 4118409; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and

qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard

state; and

permit is sought has not conformed

permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department

permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based on
other legal grounds as set forth in
Revised Code Section 4303.292; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.

must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of
notification; now, therefore,
