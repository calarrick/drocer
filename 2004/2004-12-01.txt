Whereas, the Budget Commission of Cuyahoga County, Ohio, has certified its action on the Tax Budget to this
Council together with an estimate by the County Auditor of the rate of each tax necessary to be levied by this

Res. No. 2258-04.
By Council Members Sweeney,
Brady and O’Malley.
An emergency resolution urging
the state of Ohio to fund the construction of noise walls on all highways where noise levels exceed the
standard decibel level, including
highways
going
through
urban
neighborhoods.
Whereas, there are many areas
throughout northeast Ohio where
noise levels from interstate traffic
exceed the threshold 67 dBA, thus
qualifying those areas for noise
abatement; and
Whereas, the biggest problem in
constructing the noise walls in the
state is the unavailability of funds
with which to complete the noise
abatement program; and
Whereas, funding for the Noise
Wall Retrofit Program has been
eliminated in 2006 due to budget
constraints; and
Whereas, noise walls continue to
be constructed in suburban areas of
Ohio while the state has consistently ignored urban neighborhoods,
although urban areas are affected
just as much, if not more, by highway traffic; and
Whereas, the state’s noise abatement program should be funded in
order to help ensure a better quality of life for those living near interstates, including those living near
interstates in urban areas of Ohio;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the state of Ohio to fund
the construction of noise walls on
all highways where noise levels exceed the standard decibel level,
including highways going through
urban neighborhoods.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Governor
Taft, the Ohio State House and Senate representatives from Cuyahoga
County
and
to
Gordon
Proctor,
Director, Ohio Department of Transportation.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

service and installation rates; and
Whereas, on or about November
26, 2003, the City received from Adelphia an Abbreviated Cost of Service
Filing for Cable Network Upgrades
on FCC Form 1235 for pre-approval
(the “FCC Form 1235”) proposing a
Maximum
Permitted
Network
Upgrade Surcharge of $0.47 per
month, per subscriber to be assessed
against
basic
service
tier
subscribers (in addition to the Basic
Tier Rate) over the next 12 years in
order to recover the cost, plus a rate
of return, related to the network
upgrade completed in the City in
2003; and
Whereas, pursuant to FCC regulations, the City issued a tolling order
on December 24, 2003, notifying
Adelphia that additional time in
which to review the FCC Form 1235
was required; and
Whereas, Adelphia’s filing of its
FCC Form 1235 on a pre-approval
basis is contrary to FCC regulations
because the system-wide upgrade
had been completed at the time of
filing; and
Whereas, in response to correspondence and discussions with the
City’s
representatives,
Adelphia
filed an amended FCC Form 1235
(the “Amended FCC Form 1235”) on
July 17, 2004 changing the FCC
Form 1235 from a pre-approval to a
final filing; and
Whereas, Adelphia has not implemented the FCC Form 1235 Monthly
Network Upgrade surcharge of $0.47;
and
Whereas, it was necessary for the
City to make several requests to
Adelphia for additional information
and clarification in connection with
the FCC Form 1235 and the Amended FCC Form 1235; and
Whereas, interested parties, including Adelphia, were afforded an
opportunity to present information
to the City regarding these rates;
and
Whereas, Adelphia’s FCC Form
1235 and Amended FCC Form 1235,
as well as other rate justification
information requested of Adelphia
and supplied to the City by Adelphia
are on file with the Clerk of Council in File No. 2209-04-A and incorporated into this Ordinance by reference; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that disapproving the
proposed
Network
Upgrade
Surcharge protects the City of Cleveland’s cable television subscribers
from excessive rates to the fullest
extent permitted by law and enables
the City to act upon such proposal
within the federally mandated time
requirements for review of Adel-

16
phia’s cable television rate proposals; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That based on the information presented to City Council,
the information submitted by Adelphia, the documents on file with the
Clerk of Council and contained in
File No. 2209-04-A, and the advice of
the City’s cable television legal consultants
regarding
Adelphia’s
Amended FCC Form 1235, the City
makes the below listed findings and
orders:
1. For the reasons stated in the
November
5,
2004
memorandum
attached to and incorporated into
this Ordinance by reference, Adelphia has failed to provide sufficient information in the Amended
FCC Form 1235 and supporting documentation from which to determine whether the Network Upgrade
Surcharge of $0.47 per month, per
subscriber
as
proposed
in
the
Amended FCC Form 1235 is calculated in accordance with FCC regulations.
2. For the reasons stated in the
attached
memorandum,
Adelphia
has failed to provide sufficient
information in the Amended FCC
Form 1235 and supporting documentation from which the City can calculate, in accordance with FCC regulations, an appropriate Network
Upgrade Surcharge and the one-year
time period in which the City must
rule on Adelphia’s Network Upgrade
Surcharge
as
proposed
in
the
Amended FCC Form 1235 will expire
on November 25, 2004.
3. The proposed Network Upgrade
Surcharge of $0.47 per month, per
subscriber as calculated in the
Amended FCC Form 1235 is, therefore, disapproved.
4. If Adelphia intends to justify
its
Network
Upgrade
Surcharge,
Adelphia is ordered to refile its FCC
Form 1235 with supporting documentation and information in conformance with the attached memorandum.
Section 2. That the City reserves
the right to reconsider this Ordinance for the sole purpose of further reducing rates should new
information arise which was not
disclosed by Adelphia or should
modifications or clarifications to
FCC rules and regulations so provide and permit.
Section 3. That it is found and
determined that all formal actions
of this Council concerning and
relating to the adoption of this
Ordinance were adopted in an open
meeting of this Council, and that
all deliberations of this Council
and of any of its committees or
subcommittees
that
resulted
in
such formal action, were in meetings open to the public, in compliance with all legal requirements
including Section 121.22 of the Ohio
Revised Code.
Section 4. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earlier period
allowed by law.
Passed November 22, 2004.
Effective November 22, 2004.
