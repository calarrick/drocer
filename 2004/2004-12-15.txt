An emergency resolution urging
Governor Taft and the Ohio State
Legislature to provide full funding
for the Clean Ohio Fund in the 2005

Whereas, in November of 2000,
Ohio voters approved State Issue 1,
the Clean Ohio Fund, allowing the

revitalize blighted neighborhoods by
cleaning up and redeveloping polluted properties; and
Whereas, Governor Taft is planning to ask for $100 million for the

Whereas, this job creation has created a positive economic impact at
the local level; and

projects have been funded; and
Whereas,
continuous
and
full
funding will ensure that the benefits promised to Ohio voters in 2000
continue; and
Whereas, it is imperative that
Governor Taft and the State Legislature honor the promises and commitments made to Ohio voters when
approving State Issue 1; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges Ohio Governor Bob Taft and the Ohio State
Legislature to provide full funding
for the Clean Ohio Fund in the 2005
