permitted to become contributing
citizens to our society; and
Whereas, the Council of Cleveland
has a genuine interest in preventing
persons with previous criminal convictions from repeating criminal

An emergency resolution declaring this Council’s support of the
“Women Honoring Women” movement to obtain more than 10 million
signatures supporting the declaration of Rosa Parks’ birthday as a
national holiday.

January 28, 2004
Whereas, “Women Honoring Women” is an organization that was
formed for the sole purpose of promoting a campaign to declare a
national
holiday
that
honors
a
woman; and
Whereas, all national holidays
currently honor men; and
Whereas, Rosa Parks refused to
give up her seat to a white person
on a Montgomery Alabama bus and
this refusal sparked the bus boycott
that later led to the Civil Rights
Movement in this country; and
Whereas, this heroic action by
Rosa Parks is worthy of honor: and
Whereas, Rosa Parks continues to
dedicate her life to the cause of universal human rights; and
Whereas, “Women Honoring Women” is proposing that the United
States Congress proclaim a national
holiday on Rosa Parks’ birthday,
February 4th, to honor her as American hero while she still lives, to
give recognition to a female hero,
and
to
celebrate
the
powerful
impact that one person’s activities
can have in the world; and
Whereas, “Women Honoring Women” is working to obtain more
than 10 million signatures in support of declaring Rosa Parks’ birthday, February 4th, a national holiday; and

Whereas, each year the Ohio

competitive proposal process; and
Whereas, the Council of the city
of Cleveland has recognized the
need to maintain affordable housing
in Cleveland’s neighborhoods; and
Whereas, Northeastern Neighbor-

The City Record
hood
Development
Corporation
HDAP Homes is proposing to develop up to eleven (11) new single-family homes in the city of Cleveland
by utilizing the Housing Development
Assistance
Program
(“HDAP”); and
Whereas, one hundred percent
(100%) of these units will be sold
to and occupied by families with
incomes at or below eighty percent
(80%) of the area median income;
and
Whereas, the Northeastern Neighborhood Development Corporation
HDAP Homes project will benefit
the citizens of the City; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
city of Cleveland supports the proposal of Northeastern Neighborhood
Development HDAP Homes to provide affordable housing for the citizens of Cleveland through the use
of funding from the Housing Development Assistance Program of the
Ohio Housing Finance Agency.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to transmit

Director
of
Cleveland

Section 3. That this resolution is

An emergency resolution urging
Senator George Voinovich to reconsider introducing amendments to
Senate
Bill
1072,
which
would
diminish or even eliminate statutory environmental protections for
parks, wildlife areas and historic
sites across the country in the
name of speeding up delivery of
highway transportation projects.
Whereas, Senate Bill 1072, the
reauthorization of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century
(“TEA-21”),
currently
allows
highway
construction
to
impact
parks, wildlife refuges and historic
sites only if there is no prudent or
feasible alternative; and
Whereas, Senator George Voinovich wants to introduce amendments
to Senate Bill 1072, specifically to
Section 4(f), to “streamline the environmental review process” to speed
up delivery of highway projects; and
Whereas, these amendments to
Section 4(f) would actually reduce
or even eliminate hard fought statutory environmental protections for

103

23
public parks, historic sites and
wildlife refuges during highway
construction; and
Whereas, in reality, no more than
8% of projects have been delayed by
historic, cultural, or environmental
reviews currently mandated by the
TEA-21; and
Whereas, many states have made
progress using existing laws and
regulations, including Section 4(f),
and have delivered highway projects in a timely manner, without
sacrificing environmental concerns;
and
Whereas, it is important to maintain the statutory protection that
our historic sites, wildlife refuges
and parks have had in the past; and
Whereas, while there is legitimate
interest in streamlining highway
project delivery, improvements may
be found by changing other areas of
federal law, not by eliminating environmental protections desperately
needed by the nation’s parks, historic sites and wildlife refuges; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges Senator George Voinovich
to reconsider introducing amendments to Senate Bill 1072, which
would diminish, or even eliminate,
statutory environmental protections
for parks, wildlife areas and historic
sites across the country in the name
of speeding up delivery of highway
transportation projects.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Senator
George Voinovich, Senator Mike DeWine, the National Recreation and
Park Association,
ParkWorks, the
National League of Cities and the
Ohio Municipal League.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of

it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

An emergency resolution strongly
urging the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation to suspend any
plans to avoid payment of pensions
promised to former Republic Technologies International employees
and strongly urging the Pension
Benefit Guarantee Corporation not
to appeal the federal court decision
on this matter.
Whereas, this Council adopted
Resolution No. 1434-02 on July 17,
2002 urging the Pension Benefit
Guarantee Corporation to pay steelworkers who contributed to the
Republic Technologies International
Pension Plan shutdown benefits as

24
such benefits were earned by the
steelworkers; and
Whereas, a federal judge has
ruled in favor of paying shutdown
benefits to the steelworkers; and
Whereas,
the
Pension
Benefit
Guarantee
Corporation
plans
to
appeal this ruling; and
Whereas,
many
families
were
forced to postpone their retirement
and other plans for their families
during the wait for pension payments; and
Whereas, many families are struggling to make ends meet as they
have not received the benefits they
earned; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of

strongly urges the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation to suspend any plans to avoid payment
