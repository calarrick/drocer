inheritance rights for all unmarried
couples in the City of Cleveland and
the State of Ohio; and

2105

35
(a)(1) and a violation of division
(b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section,
but the person may not be convicted of more than one violation of
these divisions.
(d) (1) In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
a violation of division (a) or (b) of
this section or for an equivalent
offense, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse, or a combination of them in the defendant’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn
within two hours of the time of the
alleged violation. When a person
submits to a blood test at the
request of a law enforcement officer
under
Section
4511.191
of
the
Revised Code, only a physician, a
registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist,
or
phlebotomist
shall withdraw blood for the purpose of determining the alcohol,
drug, or alcohol and drug content of
the whole blood, blood serum, or
blood plasma. This limitation does
not apply to the taking of breath or
urine specimens. A person authorized to withdraw blood under this
division may refuse to withdraw
blood under this division, if in that
person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn
shall be analyzed in accordance
with methods approved by the Ohio
Director of Health by an individual
possessing a valid permit issued by
the Director pursuant to Section
3701.143 of the Revised Code.
(2) In a criminal prosecution or
juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a) of this section
or for an equivalent offense, if there
was at the time the bodily substance
was withdrawn a concentration of
less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions
(a)(2), (3), (4), and (5) of this section, that fact may be considered
with other competent evidence in
determining the guilt or innocence
of the defendant. This division does
not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding
for a violation of division (b) of this
section or for an equivalent offense
that is substantially equivalent to
that division.
(3) Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of
the chemical test shall be made
available to the person or the person’s attorney, immediately upon the
completion of the chemical test
analysis. The person tested may
have a physician, a registered nurse,
or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist of the person’s own
choosing administer a chemical test
or tests, at the person’s expense, in
addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. The form to be read to the person to be tested, as required under
Section 4511.192 of the Revised Code,
shall state that the person may have
an independent test performed at
the person’s expense. The failure or
inability to obtain an additional
chemical test by a person shall not
preclude the admission of evidence
relating to the chemical test or tests
taken at the request of a law
enforcement officer.

shown by clear and convincing evidence that the officer administered
the test in substantial compliance
with the testing standards for any
reliable,

jail term of at least six consecutive
days. The court may require the
offender, under a community control
sanction
imposed
under
Section
2929.25 of the Revised Code, to
