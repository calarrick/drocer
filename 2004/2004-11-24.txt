Whereas, this Council has determined that waiving the eight-month

Res. No. 2258-04.
By Council Members Sweeney,
Brady and O’Malley.
An emergency resolution urging
the state of Ohio to fund the construction of noise walls on all highways where noise levels exceed the
standard decibel level, including
highways
going
through
urban
neighborhoods.
Whereas, there are many areas
throughout northeast Ohio where
noise levels from interstate traffic
exceed the threshold 67 dBA, thus
qualifying those areas for noise
abatement; and
Whereas, the biggest problem in
constructing the noise walls in the
state is the unavailability of funds
with which to complete the noise
abatement program; and
Whereas, funding for the Noise
Wall Retrofit Program has been
eliminated in 2006 due to budget
constraints; and
Whereas, noise walls continue to
be constructed in suburban areas of
Ohio while the state has consistently ignored urban neighborhoods,
although urban areas are affected
just as much, if not more, by highway traffic; and
Whereas, the state’s noise abatement program should be funded in
order to help ensure a better quality of life for those living near interstates, including those living near
interstates in urban areas of Ohio;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the state of Ohio to fund

Res. No. 2211-04.
By Council Member Coats.
An
emergency
resolution
condemning the atrocities committed by
the Janjaweed against Sudanese villagers; urging the United States
Government to support the African
Union with resources to end the
genocide; and urging the United
Nations
to
supply
humanitarian
goods to the Sudanese refugees.

The City Record
Whereas, Sudan obtained its independence from the United Kingdom
in 1956; and
Whereas, since obtaining its independence, Sudan has been embroiled
in civil wars for all but ten years
(1972-1982); and
Whereas, the civil wars are rooted
in northern economic, political, and
social domination of non-Muslim,
non-Arab southern Sudanese; and
Whereas, since 1983, the war and
war related famines have led to
more than two million deaths and
the displacement of over 4 million
people; and
Whereas, in the past year, more
than one million people have been
forced from their homes in the
region of Darfur by a government
backed militia known as the Janjaweed; and
Whereas, the Janjaweed has raided villages, killed villagers and
raped village women; and
Whereas, the violence carried out
by the Janjaweed has created a serious humanitarian crisis as refugees
lack access to food, clothing, shelter, and health care; and
Whereas, the United States Congress passed a resolution declaring
the Sudan situation genocide; and
Whereas, Secretary of State Colin
Powell in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on
Thursday, September 9, 2004, stated
that “genocide has been committed
in Darfur and that the government
of Sudan and the Janjaweed bear
responsibility, and that genocide
may still be occurring”; and
Whereas, Secretary of State Powell’s declaration occurred one day
after the United Sates circulated a
draft Security Council resolution on
Sudan threatening economic penalties if the Sudanese government did
not control its militias and permit a
large force from the African Union
to patrol the area; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby condemns the atrocities committed
by
the
Janjaweed
against
Sudanese villagers.
Section 2. That this Council urges
the United States Government to
support the African Union with
resources to end the genocide.
Section 3. That this Council urges
the United Nations to supply humanitarian goods, such as food, clothing,
shelter, and health care, to the
Sudanese refugees.
Section 4. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to President
George W. Bush, Secretary of State
Colin Powell, U.S. Senator Michael
DeWine, U.S. Senator George Voinovich,
Congresswoman
Stephanie
Tubbs Jones, Congressman Dennis
Kucinich,
Congressman
Sherrod
Brown,
Congressman
Steven
LaTourette, Kofi A. Annan, Secretary—General of the United Nations,
the Executive Director and the
Board of the National League of
Cities, the Executive Director and
Board of the National Black Caucus
of Local Elected Officials, and the

2293

Executive Director of the Ohio
Municipal League.
Section 5. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted November 15 2004.
Effective November 19, 2004.

Res. No. 2212-04.
By Council Members Coats, Dolan,
Jones, Brady, Britt, Cimperman, Cintron,
Conwell,
Gordon,
Jackson,
Johnson, Lewis, O’Malley, Pierce
Scott, Polensek, Reed, Rybka, Sweeney, Westbrook, White, Zone.
An emergency resolution strongly
opposing the proposed rate increase
in natural gas sought by Dominion
East Ohio Gas Company and Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. and urging the
PUCO to reject such proposals.
Whereas, on November 12, 2004,
Dominion East Ohio Gas Company
(Dominion) filed a request with the
Public Utilities Commission of Ohio
(the PUCO) to increase rates for
their customers by more than $1.00
per 1,000 cubic feet; and
Whereas, just last month, the
PUCO allowed Dominion to increase
its rate by $0.44 to $8.79 for November through January; and
Whereas, the proposed new rate
would add another $1.19 to gas
costs, boosting the rate to $9.98 per
1,000 cubic feet; and
Whereas, Columbia Gas of Ohio
Incorporated (Columbia) has requested an 11.5-cent increase, which
would cause its rates to go from
$8.79 to $9.94; and
Whereas, rate increases such as
those proposed by Dominion and
Columbia impose an extreme financial hardship on many of the City’s
residents and most severely impact
those citizens on fixed incomes; and
Whereas, such extreme increases
could force some families to choose
between paying their utility bills,
buying food, or purchasing prescription drugs; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that forcing citizens to make such
choices is reprehensible and further
believes that utility companies serving Cleveland residents should place
the health, safety, and welfare of
their customers above their bottomline during our coldest months of
the year; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
strongly opposes the proposed rate
increase in natural gas sought by
Dominion East Ohio Gas Company
and Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. and
urges the PUCO to reject such proposal.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby directed to transmit certified
copies of this resolution to repre-

28
sentatives from Dominion East Ohio
Gas Company and Columbia Gas of
Ohio Incorporated, to each of the
Commissioners of the PUCO and to
the Consumers Counsel.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted November 15 2004.
Effective November 19, 2004.

Res. No. 2213-04.
By Council Member Brady.
An emergency resolution objecting to the transfer of ownership of
a D5 and D6 Liquor Permit at 11120
& 24 Lorain Avenue, 1st floor only
and 11118 Lorain Avenue, 1st floor
rear.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Department of Liquor
Control of an application for the
transfer of ownership of a D5 and
D6 Liquor Permit from 10410 Lorain
Avenue, Inc., DBA Porky’s Café,
11120 & 24 Lorain Avenue, 1st floor
only and 11118 Lorain Avenue, 1st
floor rear, Cleveland, Ohio 44111,
Permanent Number 8843651 to Lisa
M. Salajcik, DBA Bar 112, 11120 &
24 Lorain Avenue, 1st floor only and
11118 Lorain Avenue, 1st floor rear,
Cleveland, Ohio 44111, Permanent
Number 7679172; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based on
other legal grounds as set forth in
Revised Code Section 4303.292; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of
notification; now, therefore,

The City Record
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby record its objection to the transfer of ownership of a D5 and D6
Liquor Permit from 10410 Lorain
Avenue, Inc., DBA Porky’s Café,
11120 & 24 Lorain Avenue, 1st floor
only and 11118 Lorain Avenue, 1st

Director of Liquor Control to set a

Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she is hereby directed to
transmit two certified copies of this
resolution, together with two copies
of a letter of objection and two
copies of a letter requesting that the
hearing be held in Cleveland, Cuyahoga County.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period

Adopted November 15 2004.
Effective November 19, 2004.

Res. No. 2214-04.
By Council Member O’Malley.
An emergency resolution requesting that the Cuyahoga County Court
of Common Pleas, in Housing Advocates, Inc. v. American Fire & Casualty Company, et. al., order appellee
insurance companies to produce certain documents and evidence necessary to fully investigate housing discrimination charges and requesting
that the Director of Law of the City
of Cleveland review the brief and
exhibits submitted by Housing Advocates and file a brief supporting the
position of Housing Advocates.
Whereas, Federal and Ohio law
prohibits discrimination in the sale
of fire, extended coverage or homeowners insurance because of race,
color, religion, sex, familial status,
ancestry, handicap, or national origin or because of the racial composition of the neighborhood in which
housing accommodations are located; and
Whereas, Section 665.03(e) of the
Codified Ordinances of the City of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, prohibits discrimination against any person in
the provision of property and casualty insurance; and
Whereas, it has been brought to
the attention of members of Cleveland City Council that insurance
companies require residents of the
City of Cleveland to pay higher premiums for property and casualty
insurance than residents of surrounding communities are required
to pay; and
Whereas, such premiums are, in
many instances, significantly higher;
and

2294

November 24, 2004
Whereas, the City of Cleveland is
a diverse City with a greater number
of persons of color compared to the
remainder of Cuyahoga County; and
Whereas, the practice of requiring
higher insurance premiums for City
of Cleveland residents has a discriminatory impact on City of Cleveland residents; and
Whereas, The Housing Advocates,
Inc. (“Housing Advocates”), has undertaken an investigation and did
several studies to review base rate
premiums and geographical territorial rating zones for the City of
Cleveland and the remainder of
Cuyahoga County; and
Whereas, this investigation has
shown that City of Cleveland residents pay more for homeowners
insurance than residents living in
surrounding cities and this has a
racial and ethnic disparate impact
on City of Cleveland residents; and
Whereas, Housing Advocates filed
a total of twenty-five charges of
housing
discrimination
against
twenty-eight insurance companies
based on its investigation with the
Ohio Civil Rights Commission; and
Whereas, the Ohio Civil Rights
Commission completed its investigation of these charges and found that
there is no probable cause to believe
that discrimination occurred; and
Whereas, during this investigation the Ohio Civil Rights Commission failed to request certain documents from the insurance companies; and
Whereas, these documents are
only available from the insurance
companies and are relevant to the
charges of housing discrimination
filed by Housing Advocates; and
Whereas, it appears that the Commission’s
investigation
failed
to
address Housing Advocates suggestion for a less restrictive alternative
methods to avoid or at least reduce
the imposition of much higher premiums on our residents; and
Whereas, it appears that Housing
Advocates have made a case for disparate impact by the insurance companies in the pricing of insurance
products in the City of Cleveland
versus the remainder of Cuyahoga
County; and
Whereas, Housing Advocates has
filed a lawsuit under the Ohio
Revised Code entitled The Housing
Advocates, Inc. v. American Fire &
Casualty Company, et. al. in the
Cuyahoga County Common Pleas
Court requesting that the no probable cause determination of the Ohio
Civil Rights Commission be reversed
and that the Court compel the
appellee insurance companies to provide the requested documents in
order to enable a full and fair investigation of the housing discrimination charges; and
Whereas, this Council is concerned about all persons receiving a
full and fair investigation of their
claims before the Ohio Civil Rights
Commission; and
Whereas, the Ohio Civil Rights
Commission is mandated by State law
to carry out and enforce the fair housing laws of the State of Ohio; and
Whereas, the Ohio Civil Rights
Commission has authority to demand access to records, documents,
and evidence in the course of investigations; and
Whereas, the Ohio Civil Rights
Commission should have compelled

November 24, 2004
the appellee insurance companies to
provide certain documents and other
evidence as part of its investigation
in order to determine the validity of
the housing discrimination charges
filed by Housing Advocates; and
Whereas, members of Cleveland
City Council, after being provided
information about the scope and
findings of the Commission investigation, urge the Cuyahoga County
Common Please Court to order that
appellee insurance companies produce certain documents and evidence necessary to investigate the
housing discrimination charges filed
by Housing Advocates; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes and emergency measure for
the immediate preservation of public peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby requests that the Cuyahoga
County Court of Common Pleas, in
Housing Advocates, Inc. v. American
Fire & Casualty Company, et. al.,
order appellee insurance companies
to produce certain documents and
evidence necessary to fully investigate
housing
discrimination
charges.
Section 2. That this Council hereby requests that the Director of Law
of the City of Cleveland review the
brief and exhibits submitted by
Housing Advocates and file a brief
supporting the position of Housing
Advocates.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to Ohio
Governor Bob Taft, Pastor Aaron
Wheeler Sr., Chairperson and Commissioner, Ohio Civil Rights Commission;
Jeanine
P.
Donaldson,
Commissioner, Ohio Civil Rights
Commission;
Altagracia
Ramos,
Commissioner, Ohio Civil Rights
Commission; Nirmal K. Sinha, Commissioner, Ohio Civil Rights Commission; Charles Winburn, Commissioner, Ohio Civil Rights Commission; G. Michael Peyton, Executive
Director, Ohio Civil Rights Commission; and Jim Petro, Attorney
General, State of Ohio.
