An emergency resolution declaring this Council’s support of the
“Women Honoring Women” movement to obtain more than 10 million
signatures supporting the declaration of Rosa Parks’ birthday as a
national holiday.
Whereas, “Women Honoring Women” is an organization that was
formed for the sole purpose of promoting a campaign to declare a
national
holiday
that
honors
a
woman; and
Whereas, all national holidays
currently honor men; and
Whereas, Rosa Parks refused to
give up her seat to a white person
on a Montgomery Alabama bus and
this refusal sparked the bus boycott
that later led to the Civil Rights
Movement in this country; and
Whereas, this heroic action by
Rosa Parks is worthy of honor: and
Whereas, Rosa Parks continues to
dedicate her life to the cause of universal human rights; and
Whereas, “Women Honoring Women” is proposing that the United
States Congress proclaim a national
holiday on Rosa Parks’ birthday,
February 4th, to honor her as American hero while she still lives, to
give recognition to a female hero,

145

25
and
to
celebrate
the
powerful
impact that one person’s activities

of the proposal of Northeastern
Neighborhood Development Corporation HDAP Homes to the Ohio Housing Finance Agency for the use of
Housing
Development
Assistance
Program funds to develop affordable
for-sale housing units in the city of
Cleveland.
Whereas, each year the Ohio
Housing Finance Agency allocates
funding for affordable housing developments throughout Ohio using a
competitive proposal process; and
Whereas, the Council of the city
of Cleveland has recognized the
need to maintain affordable housing
in Cleveland’s neighborhoods; and
Whereas, Northeastern Neighborhood
Development
Corporation
HDAP Homes is proposing to develop up to eleven (11) new single-family homes in the city of Cleveland
by utilizing the Housing Development
Assistance
Program
(“HDAP”); and
Whereas, one hundred percent
(100%) of these units will be sold
to and occupied by families with
incomes at or below eighty percent
(80%) of the area median income;
and
Whereas, the Northeastern Neighborhood Development Corporation
HDAP Homes project will benefit
the citizens of the City; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of

26

An emergency resolution urging
Senator George Voinovich to reconsider introducing amendments to
Senate Bill 1072, which would diminish or even eliminate statutory environmental protections for parks,
wildlife areas and historic sites
across the country in the name of
speeding up delivery of highway
transportation projects.
Whereas, Senate Bill 1072, the
reauthorization of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century
(“TEA-21”),
currently
allows
highway
construction
to
impact
parks, wildlife refuges and historic
sites only if there is no prudent or
feasible alternative; and
Whereas, Senator George Voinovich wants to introduce amendments
to Senate Bill 1072, specifically to
Section 4(f), to “streamline the environmental review process” to speed
up delivery of highway projects; and
Whereas, these amendments to
Section 4(f) would actually reduce
or even eliminate hard fought statutory environmental protections for
public parks, historic sites and
wildlife refuges during highway
construction; and
Whereas, in reality, no more than
8% of projects have been delayed by
historic, cultural, or environmental
reviews currently mandated by the
TEA-21; and
Whereas, many states have made
progress using existing laws and
regulations, including Section 4(f),
and have delivered highway projects in a timely manner, without
sacrificing environmental concerns;
and
Whereas, it is important to maintain the statutory protection that
our historic sites, wildlife refuges
and parks have had in the past; and
Whereas, while there is legitimate
interest in streamlining highway
project delivery, improvements may
be found by changing other areas of
federal law, not by eliminating environmental protections desperately
needed by the nation’s parks, historic sites and wildlife refuges; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,

The City Record
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges Senator George Voinovich
to reconsider introducing amendments to Senate Bill 1072, which
would diminish, or even eliminate,
statutory environmental protections
for parks, wildlife areas and historic
sites across the country in the name
of speeding up delivery of highway
transportation projects.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit

steelworkers; and
Whereas, a federal judge has
ruled in favor of paying shutdown
benefits to the steelworkers; and
Whereas,
the
Pension

plans
to
appeal this ruling; and
Whereas,
many
families
were
forced to postpone their retirement

during the wait for pension payments; and

Ord. No. 1520-03.
By Council Members Brady, Britt,
Cintron, O’Malley and Polensek.
An ordinance to repeal Sections
699.01 through 699.18 and 699.99 as
enacted or amended by various ordinances of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976 relating to Picture Arcades and Live Viewing
Booths; and to enact new Sections
237.01 through 237.09 and 237.99
relating to Adult Video Arcades and
Adult Live Entertainment Arcades.
Whereas, sexually oriented businesses require special supervision in
order to protect and preserve the
health, safety, and welfare of the
patrons of such businesses as well
as the citizens of the communities
where they locate, and
Whereas, the City Council finds
that sexually oriented businesses
are frequently used for unlawful
sexual activities, including prostitution and sexual liaisons of a casual
nature; and
Whereas, the concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health concern of the city that
demands reasonable regulation of
sexually
oriented
businesses
in
order to protect the health and wellbeing of the citizens; and
Whereas, File No. 1520-03-A, contains evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult
uses on the community presented in
reports made available to the City
Council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Erie v.
Pap’s A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 146 L. Ed.
2d 265, 120 S. Ct. 1382 (2000); Barnes
v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560
(1991); Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc.,
478 U.S. 697, (1986); California v.
LaRue, 409 U.S. 109 (1972); DLS, Inc.

(6th Cir. 1997); Doe v. City of Minneapolis, 898 F. 2d 612 (8th Cir.
1990); Ellwest Stereo Theatres, Inc.
v. Wenner, 681 F. 2d 1243 19th Cir.

1986); Doe v. City of Minneapolis,
693 F. Supp. 774 (D. Minn 1988); and
City of Lincoln v. ABC Books, Inc.,
238 Neb. 378, 470 N.W. 2d 760
(Nebraska 1991), as well as studies
conducted in other cities including,
but not limited to, Tuscon City, Arizona, findings reported in the Final
Report of the Attorney General’s
Commission on Pornography (1986),
and statistics obtained from the U.S.
Department of Health and Human

February 4, 2004
Services, Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention; and
Whereas, these studies show that:
(1) Sexually oriented businesses
lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are
presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further,
there is presently no mechanism to
make owners of these establishments responsible for the activities
that occur on their premises;
(2) Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur
at
sexually
oriented
businesses,
especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or
live sex shows. See, e.g. California
v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109, 111 (1972);
(3) Offering and providing such
booths and/or cubicles encourages
such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. See, e.g. Final
Report of the Attorney General’s
Commission on Pornography (1986)
at 376-77;
(4) Persons frequent certain adult
theaters, adult arcades, and other
sexually oriented businesses, for the
purpose of engaging in sex within
the premises of such sexually oriented businesses. See, e.g. Arcara v.
Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697, 698
(1986); see also Final Report of the
Attorney General’s Commission on
Pornography (1986) at 376-77;
(5) At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities
occurring in sexually oriented businesses including, but not limited to,
syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIVAIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B,
Non A Non B amebiasis, salmonella
infections, and shiegella infections.
See, e.g. Study of Fort Meyers, Florida;
(6) As of December, 2000, the total
number of reported cases of AIDS in
the United States caused by the
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was
774,467. See, e.g. Statistics of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human
Services, Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention at www.cdc.gov;
(7) As of March, 2003, there have
been 12,698 reported cases of AIDS
in the State of Ohio. See Ohio Department of Health Quarterly Statistical Summary for March 2003 at
www.odh.state.oh.us;
(8) The total number of cases of
genital chlamydia trachomatis infections in the United States reported in 2000 was 702,093 an 6%
increase over the year 1999. See e.g.
Statistics of the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention
at www.cdc.gov;
(9) The total number of cases of
syphilis in the United States reported during the year 2000 was up 2.1%
from 1999. See, e.g. statistics of the
U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services, Centers for Disease
Control
and
Prevention
at
www.cdc.gov;
(10) The number of cases of
gonorrhea in the United States
reported annually remains at a high
level, with a total of 361,705 cases
reported during 2001. Gonorrhea is
the second most frequently reported
communicable disease in the United
States. See, e.g. Statistics of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human
Services, Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention at www.cdc.gov;

The City Record
(11) The surgeon general of the
United States in his report of October 22, 1986, advised the American
public that AIDS and HIV infection
may be transmitted through sexual
contact, intravenous drug use, exposure to infected blood and blood
components, and from an infected
mother to her newborn;
(12) According to the best scientific evidence available, AIDS and
HIV infection, as well as syphilis
and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. See, e.g. Findings of the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention
at www.cdc.gov;
(13) Sanitary conditions in some
sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy,
and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the
failure of the owners and operators
of the facilities to self-regulate
those activities and maintain those
facilities. See, e.g., Final Report of
the Attorney General’s Commission
on Pornography (1986) at 377;
(14) Numerous studies and reports
have determined that bodily fluids,
including semen and urine, are
found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where person view
“adult” oriented films. See, e.g.,
Final Report of the Attorney General’s Commission on Pornography
(1986) at 377;
Whereas, these findings raise substantial governmental concerns; and
Whereas, sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns; and
Whereas, removal of doors on
adult booths, along with requiring
the interior to be visible from the
outside, and requiring sufficient
lighting on the premises with adult
booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the
illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult establishments by eliminating private areas
where it can occur; and
Whereas, the general welfare and
health of the citizens of this City
will be promoted by enactment of
this ordinance; and
Whereas, the City Council wants
to prevent these adverse effects and
protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizenry; and
Whereas, it is not the intent of
this ordinance to suppress any
speech activities protected by the
First Amendment, but to enact a
content
neutral
ordinance
that
addresses the health problems associated with sexually oriented businesses; and
Whereas, it is not the intent of the
City Council to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene
materials, and the Council recognizes that state and federal laws
prohibits the distribution of obscene
materials and expects and encourages state enforcement officials to
enforce state and federal obscenity
statutes against any such illegal
activities in the City of Cleveland;
now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the following sections of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976:
