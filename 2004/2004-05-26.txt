Section 203.10 and Sections 240.01
through 240.06, and 240.99 of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, as amended or enacted
by various ordinances; to amend Sections 365.01, 365.02, 365.05, 365.06,

375.08 of the codified ordinances, as
amended or enacted by various ordinances; to enact new Sections 240.01
to 240.09 and 240.99 all relating to
lead and lead hazards.
Whereas, according to Ohio Department of Health data for 2002,
there are an estimated 5,100 children
in the City of Cleveland with blood
levels greater than 10 micrograms
of lead per deciliter of blood, the
threshold established by the Centers
for Disease Control (CDC); and
Whereas, Cleveland and Cuyahoga
County have high rates of elevated
blood levels in children relative to
other cities and counties in the U.S.;
and
Whereas, according to the CDC,
lead affects virtually every system
in the body and, even at low levels,
is harmful and associated with
decreased
intelligence,
impaired
neurobehavioral
development,
decreased stature and growth, and
impaired hearing acuity in children;
and
Whereas, the major source of lead
exposure among children is leadbased paint and lead-contaminated
dust found in deteriorating buildings. Lead-based paints were banned
for use in housing in 1978, but thousands of housing units in the City
of Cleveland that are homes to one
or more young children have deteriorated leaded paint and lead-contaminated house dust; and
Whereas, lead poisoning is entirely preventable through proper methods of control of lead hazards; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
desires to prevent lead poisoning
and protect the public health and
safety by prohibiting improper con-

995

21
trol of lead hazards and the inadvertent creation of lead hazards during
repainting,
remodeling,
and
repair in housing units; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
desires to prevent lead poisoning
and protect the public health and
safety through education by ensuring the application of the federal
disclosure rule to residential property constructed before 1978 in the
City limits; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
desires to prevent lead poisoning
and protect the public health and
safety by providing an incentive to
residential property owners to make
their property lead free and lead
safe through the issuance of leadfree and lead-safe maintenance certificates; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
Department of Public Health has
been delegated by the Ohio Department of Health with the duty to
investigate residential units, daycare facilities, and schools, when it
is notified that a child has become
lead poisoned, and order the owners
and managers of residential units,
day-care facilities, and schools that
are contributing to the child’s lead
poisoning to control associated lead
hazards; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the following Sections of the Codified Ordinances of

An emergency ordinance to amend
Section 3103.09 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as
amended by Ordinance No. 2370-01,
passed May 13, 2002, relating to the
unsafe structure and exterior property nuisances.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 3103.09 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended by
Ordinance No. 2370-01, passed May
13, 2002, is amended to read as follows:
Section 3103.09 Unsafe Structures
and Exterior Property Nuisances;
Violation
and
Remedial
Notices;
Cost Recovery
(a) Legislative Findings.
Council of the City of Cleveland
finds that:
(1) Structures that are vacant and
open to entry at doors, windows or
other points accessible to the general public:
A. Attract children to enter;
B. Become harborage for vermin;
C. Serve as temporary abode for
derelicts, vagrants and criminals;
and
D. Are likely to be damaged by
vandals or set ablaze by arsonists.
(2) Unkept grounds surrounding
such vacant, open structures invite
the dumping of garbage and rubbish
thereupon;
(3) Thousands of structures in
this City are made of wood-frame
construction that is more flammable
than other building types;
(4) Thousands of structures in
this City are situated on narrow lots
and in close proximity to one another, thereby increasing the risk of
conflagration and spread of insect
and rodent infestation;
(5) Population loss and economic
decline experienced by the City in
recent years has caused the incidence of vacant, open structures,
high grass, weeds, junk, debris, and
junk motor vehicles to increase significantly;
(6) Such vacant, open structures
often become dilapidated because
they are not repaired by the owners
or persons in control of said structures;
(7) Structures that are vacant and
open to entry, high grass, weeds,
junk, debris, and junk motor vehicles depress the market value of
surrounding properties;
(8) The existence of certain hazardous conditions may require a
structure to be vacated; such conditions include but are not limited to:
A. Danger of structural collapse;
B. Inadequate heat or use of dangerous heating mechanism;
C. Danger of fire; and
D. Lack of plumbing in safe working order.
(9) Structures that remain boarded for an extended period of time
contribute to blight, cause a decrease in neighboring property values, create targets for arson, and

The City Record
lead to the cancellation of homeowners’ insurance for neighboring
property owners.
(10) The following conditions provide
harborage
and
breeding
grounds for pests or otherwise create human-health problems:
A. Grass over 8 inches in height.

(b) Declaration of Nuisance.
(1) All buildings or structures
that are injurious to or a menace to
the public health, safety or welfare,
or are structurally unsafe, unsanitary or not provided with adequate
safe egress, or which constitute a
fire hazard, or which are vacant and
open to public entry, or which are
otherwise dangerous to human life
or injurious to the public, or which
in relation to existing use constitute
a hazard to the public health, safety or welfare by reason of inadequate
maintenance,
dilapidation,
obsolescence or abandonment, are,
severally, for the purposes of this
Building
Code,
declared
to
be
“unsafe structures”. All such unsafe
structures or conditions are hereby
declared to be public nuisances. The
public nuisance shall be abated by
correction of the violations to the
minimum standards of the Codified
Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
applicable City rules and regulations, the Ohio Revised Code, and
Ohio Administrative Code including
the Ohio Building Code, or by demolition.
(2) The conditions listed in division (a)(10) of this section are
declared to be nuisances that shall
be removed, destroyed, or abated
from any property on which they
are found.
(3)
Junk
motor
vehicles
as
defined in division (a)(11) of this
section are declared to be nuisances
that shall be removed or abated
from any property on which they
are found. Junk motor vehicles are
declared to be a nuisance because:
A. They harbor rodents, vermin,
and other pests;
B. They contain toxic substances
and flammable liquids and fumes;
C. They attract children to enter;
D. They serve as temporary abode
for derelicts, vagrants and criminals;

1010

May 26, 2004
E. They diminish neighboring
property values; and,
F. They are likely to be damaged
by vandals or set ablaze by arsonists.
(c) Effective Boarding Pending
Rehabilitation.
(1) Permits:
Pending the correction of the violations to the minimum standards
of
the
Codified
Ordinances
of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, applicable
City rules and regulations, the Ohio
Revised Code, and the Ohio Administrative Code, including the Ohio
Building Code, the owner of a
structure may secure the structure
through
effective
boarding.
In
order to effectively board the structure, the owner of the structure
shall apply, within seven (7) days
of receiving a notice of violation,
to the Division of Building and
Housing for a permit to board. The
Division of Building and Housing
shall review the condition of the
structure, determine if it can be
effectively boarded, and grant or
deny the owner's permit to board,
setting forth special requirements,
if any, necessary for compliance
with minimum standards for effective boarding. The owner shall
effectively
board
the
structure
within seven (7) days of the
issuance of a boarding permit, or
within such other time limit that
the Director deems appropriate.
Structures which are boarded without first obtaining a boarding permit shall continue to be considered
public nuisances subject to demolition. Within thirty (30) days of the
issuance of a permit to board, the
owner of the structure shall apply
for a rehabilitation permit pursuant to Section 3105.06 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio,
1976. The Director may grant an
extension of time for acquiring a
rehabilitation
permit
upon
the
owner's written request and for
good cause shown. Failure of the
owner to obtain a rehabilitation
permit
subsequent
to
effective
boarding will result in the structure being deemed a public nuisance, and scheduled for demolition.
(2) Materials:
The effective boarding of a structure shall include, but not be limited to, doors, windows, or other areas
of the structure open to ingress and
egress and to weather elements at
any and all levels of the structure.
Such openings shall be secured by
plywood, not less than one-half inch
(1/2") thick, or other material of
equal strength, cut and fit into the
openings. Openings in excess of
forty-eight inches (48") wide shall
be framed with two inch by four
inch (2" x 4") lumber and plywood,
or
equivalent
material
fastened
twenty-four inches (24") on center
onto frame. The plywood or equivalent material shall be fastened into
the openings by screw type nails or
lag screws.
(3) Maintenance:
Upon
effectively
boarding
the
structure, the owner shall monitor
and maintain the structure and its
surrounding premises in a safe, sanitary and secured condition. Any

May 26, 2004
portion of the exterior structure
which is deemed to be potentially
hazardous due to deteriorated conditions,
or
to
be
structurally
unsound shall be removed or treated in such a manner so as to eliminate
the
hazard.
The
exterior
premises shall be maintained free of
high weeds, debris, junk vehicles,
and conditions that may provide
harborage for rodents. Failure of
the owner to properly maintain the
building in the above condition, will
result in the structure being deemed
a public nuisance, and scheduled for
demolition.
(4) Rehabilitation:
Rehabilitation of the structure
shall commence within ninety (90)
days of receiving a rehabilitation
permit pursuant to Section 3105.06 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976. If rehabilitation of
the effectively boarded structure
does not commence within this time
period, or if the rehabilitation permit is otherwise invalidated or
revoked, then the Director may
declare that the nuisance has not
been abated and schedule the structure for demolition.
(d) Examination and Condemnation.
(1) The Director is authorized to
examine or cause to be examined
every building or other structure
reported to be unsafe or damaged or
injurious to or a menace to the public, and shall make a written record
of such examination.
(2) The Director may designate as
a public nuisance those particular
structures or conditions found to be
unsafe pursuant to division (b) of
this section.
(3)
The
Director
may
also
declare that a nuisance structure
which, due to its advanced state of
dilapidation, substantial fire damage or structural infirmity, is an
immediate hazard to human life or
health, may only be abated by
immediate repair and rehabilitation
to the minimum standards of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, applicable City rules
and regulations, the Ohio Revised
Code,
and
Ohio
Administrative
Code including the Ohio Building
Code, or by demolition.
(4) Whenever the Director finds a
vacant structure open to entry at
doors, windows or other points
accessible to the general public, he
may cause the structure to be
secured at those points of entry. The
Director shall be authorized at any
time to enter upon the premises to
secure the structure in order to
lessen the severity of the public nuisance. In securing such structure,
the Director may call upon any
department, division or bureau of
the City for whatever assistance
may be necessary, or may, by private contract, secure such structure.
Such securing shall not be deemed
to constitute “effective boarding”
pursuant to division (b) of this section, and it does not abate the nuisance condition of an unsafe structure, as declared pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section, unless so
declared in writing by the Director.
Subsequent notice, issued pursuant

The City Record
to
division
(e)(1)
below,
shall
include the fact that the Director
has found it necessary to take
appropriate action to secure the
structure.

notice served by the Director shall
automatically become a final order
if a written notice of appeal before

actions taken pursuant thereto shall
constitute a valid exercise of the

Res. No. 957-04.
By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency resolution supporting Ohio House Bill 245 which

Road” license plate to fund bicycling education in Ohio.
Whereas, thousands of cyclists
share Ohio’s roads with motor vehicle drivers daily; and

laws of the state; and
Whereas, too often, motor vehicle
drivers
become
impatient
with
cyclists who are on the same road;

in tragedy for both the cyclist and
the motor vehicle driver, as in the
case of one experienced cyclist
killed May 1, 2004 by an impatient
motorist who crossed a double yellow line to pass the cyclist as the
cyclists signaled to make a left
turn; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

Res. No. 958-04.
By Council Members Reed, Zone,
Conwell, Coats, Pierce Scott, Jackson, Dolan, Brady, White, Polensek,
Gordon, Westbrook and Lewis.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Governor Bob Taft and
members of the Ohio General Assembly to support the spirit of the
Brown v. Board of Education ruling
to end school segregation and promote diversity and quality education
for all public school students regardless of race.
Whereas, fifty-years ago today
marks the anniversary of the national landmark case of Brown v.
Board of Education, where the
United States Supreme Court ruled
that school segregation was unconstitutional and that by its very
nature was considered unequal; and
Whereas, Fifty years after the historic Brown decision, many students
still remain segregated between predominantly white suburbs and cities
of color; and
Whereas, racial isolation exists in
the nation’s suburban communities
as reflected in the fact that the
number of minority children attending virtually all-minority suburban
schools have more than doubled in
the past decade; and
Whereas, in Northeast Ohio, 20
suburban
schools
in
2001
were
racially isolated, which is an increase from nine schools in 1991;
and
Whereas, the public school system
in the City of Cleveland and Northeast Ohio still remains very segregated; and
Whereas, the number of minority
schools in Cleveland has dramatically increased from six in 1987 to

The City Record
sixty-eight in 2001, with fewer than
2,200
students
attending
such
schools in 1987, while nearly 39,000
were attending such schools in 2001;
and
Whereas,
research
shows
that
school districts, which educate the
greatest numbers of disadvantaged
and minority students do not receive
the local and state funding they
need to overcome the social economic obstacles their students face;
and
Whereas, Society must not abandon its goals of equality and justice
that drove the Civil Rights Movement, efforts must be made to promote policies that encourage diversity in our schools, so that all students of color have fair access to
quality education and that efforts be
made to recommit establishing a
genuinely desegregated and equal
society; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby declares its support for promoting
multiracial
and
diversified
schools in order to promote diversity and fairness in the public school
system in order to achieve equal
education for all individuals regardless of race.
Section 2. That this Council urges
Ohio Governor Bob Taft and members of the Ohio General Assembly
to support the spirit of Brown v.
Board of Education by actively taking the necessary steps to promote
policies that encourage multiracial
diversity in our public schools and
to promote quality education for all
students regardless of race or ethnicity.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to Ohio Governor Bob Taft, and to the members
of the Ohio General Assembly to
actively end racial segregation in
Ohio public schools and to promote
diversity and quality education for
all students.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
