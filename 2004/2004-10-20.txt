Ord. No. 2005-04.
By Council Member Jackson (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the purchase by one or more
requirement contracts of office supplies, for the various divisions of
City government.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Finance is authorized to make one
or more written requirement contracts under the Charter and the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, for the requirements for
a one or two year period of the necessary items of office supplies, in
the approximate amount as purchased during the preceding term, to
be purchased by the Commissioner
of Purchases and Supplies on a unit
basis for the various divisions of
City government. Bids shall be
taken in a manner that permits an
award to be made for all items as
a single contract, or by separate
contract for each or any combination of the items as the Board of
Control determines. Alternate bids
for a period less than the specified
term may be taken if desired by the
Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies until provision is made for the
requirements for the entire term.
The Director of Finance is authorized to enter into one or more contracts with a term of two years
instead of one year when there is a
financial advantage to the City. For
purposes of this ordinance, a financial advantage shall be determined
by the Director of Finance by comparing the bids received for both
terms.
Section 2. That the costs of the
contract
or
contracts
shall
be
charged against the proper appropriation accounts and the Director
of Finance shall certify the amount
of the initial purchase, which purchase, together with all later purchases, shall be made on order of
the Commissioner of Purchases and
Supplies under a requisition against
the contract or contracts certified by
the Director of Finance. (RL 118702)
Section 3. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and

Section 1. Grant of Franchise.
Under the Charter of the City of
Cleveland (“City”), and subject to
the terms and conditions set forth in
this franchise, CT Acquisitions I
Inc. (“Grantee”), is granted a nonexclusive franchise, until December

a system for the transmission and
supplying of steam and water for
heating, cooling and power purposes (the “Steam System”) in the area
of the City identified in the map
contained in File No. 1519-04-A and
incorporated by reference and as
expanded or extended within the
boundaries of the City (the “Service
Area”) in, under, over, along, across
and upon the streets and public
grounds (including but not limited
to the streets, lanes, alleys, avenues,
easements and other public thoroughfares and public rights of way
of the City in the Service Area) in
that Service Area, with the full and
necessary privileges for the use of
the streets and public grounds in
the Service Area for the purpose of
digging a trench or trenches, and
constructing, installing, maintaining
and operating pipes and conduits for
steam and water lines, together
with the right to maintain such
pipes and conduits, for the purpose
of transmitting steam and water for
heating, cooling and power purposes (“Steam Service”), and to construct, install and maintain all necessary

and other appurtenances necessary
or appropriate to the operation of

cooling water plants of Grantee and
the existing and future transmission
and distribution system extending
to the property line of each customer,
except
where
otherwise
defined
by
agreement
between
Grantee and a particular customer.
The grant of this franchise does not
establish priority or lack of priority
for use of the streets and public
grounds to Grantee over other present or future permit holders or
franchises, or over the City’s own
use. Any extension or expansion of
the Steam System shall be subject
to
all
of
the
obligations
and
reserved rights in favor of the City
set forth in this franchise, and shall
be subject to all of the conditions of
this franchise.

thousand
dollars
($50,000.00)
no
later than seventy-five (75) days
after the effective date of this ordinance. Failure to pay this amount in
full by the date specified shall
cause Grantee to be deemed to have
rejected this franchise, and the
rights and privileges granted shall
cease and terminate, unless such
period is extended by Council by
ordinance passed for that purpose
and before the expiration of the
period of seventy-five (75) days.
This amount, together with any payments or contributions made by

deposited in the City’s general fund
and expended only through legislation passed by City Council.

Section 2. Work on the Streets and
Public Grounds.
The Grantee, in the construction,
installation, maintenance, or operation of the Steam System, shall not
endanger or unnecessarily interfere
with the lives of persons, shall not
unnecessarily interfere with any
installations of the City or any public utility or other person serving
the City or using the streets and
public grounds of the City, and shall
not
unnecessarily
interrupt
or
obstruct the use of any streets and
public grounds and, in connection
with any work, shall obtain any permits and approvals required by the
regulations and ordinances of the
City. Prior to performing any work
which would affect or alter the
City’s
water
mains,
sewage
or
drainage system or any other property of the City, Grantee shall provide written notice to the appropriate affected City agency or office.
When
any
streets
and
public
grounds are entered upon by the
Grantee, or facilities removed by the
Grantee, the Grantee shall at its
cost restore the same to their original condition. Grantee shall clear all
streets
and
public
grounds
of
obstructions or anything that might
constitute a nuisance or prevent
such streets and public grounds
from being open and in repair, if
such obstruction or nuisance was
caused by the Grantee or related to
the operation of the Steam System.
If the Grantee fails to complete such
work within a reasonable period of
time, the appropriate officer of the
City may, in writing, notify the
Grantee that the City will complete
such work if not completed by the
Grantee as soon as practicable as
determined by the City after receipt
of notice by Grantee. Any work not
completed as determined by the
City’s officer may be completed by
the City and the actual out-of-pocket cost of such work shall be
charged to the Grantee. Upon the
doing of such work, the City shall
furnish the Grantee with itemized
bills of the actual out-of-pocket cost
of the work, and Grantee shall pay
the bills within thirty (30) days
after its receipt.
Section 3. Applicable Regulations.
The Grantee shall at all times be
subject to the regulations imposed
by the laws of the United States of

14

of the City as may exist at the effective date of this franchise or later
be adopted, including the continuing
right of the Council to require such
reconstruction,
relocation,
repair,
change or discontinuance of the
appliances used by the Steam System
in
the
streets
and
public
grounds of the Service Area, all at
the cost of the Grantee, as shall, in
the opinion of the Council, be necessary in the public interest. The
Council shall at all times control the
distribution of space in, under, over,
along, across or upon all streets and
public grounds occupied by fixtures
of the Steam System. In the construction, installation, maintenance
or repair of its properties, the
Grantee shall comply with all laws
and regulations existing at the
effective date of this franchise or
that may thereafter be made by the
City applicable to the Grantee and
the Grantee shall be liable for damages caused by its failure or neglect
to comply with such laws and regulations and shall save the City
harmless from any and all claims
for damages by reason of such failure or neglect.
Section 4. Indemnification and
Insurance.
The Grantee shall fully indemnify
and save harmless the City and its
respective
officers,
agents
and
employees from and against all
damages, judgments, decrees, costs,
and expenses for bodily injury or
death to persons, including employees of the City and other persons,
for losses and physical damages to
property of the City or other persons, and for debts incurred or taxes
owed by Grantee or its agents,
employees or contractors, caused by
or as a result of the construction,
installation, maintenance and operation of, or the failure to properly
construct, install, maintain and operate,
the
Steam
System
by
the
Grantee. The Grantee shall carry
insurance to cover and protect itself
and the City as an additional
insured from and against all claims,
demands, actions, judgments, costs,
expenses, and liabilities which may
arise or result, directly or indirectly, from or by reason of loss, injury
or damage to the City, its property
or employees, or to other persons or
their property, which may arise
from the operations of Grantee or its
Steam System. Grantee’s insurance
company shall, at its own expense,
defend the City, if requested by the
City, in all litigation or claims
alleged to result from or arise out
of such activities or failure to act
of Grantee. The City shall duly notify the insurance company of any
claims and shall deal directly with
such
insurance
carrier
to
seek
defense by such insurance company;
provided, however, the City shall not
be required to institute legal proceedings against such insurance
company if the insurance company
fails
to
defend.
In
the
event
Grantee’s insurance company fails
to defend the City, then Grantee, at
its own expense, shall defend the
City, if requested by the City, in all
litigation or claims alleged to result
from or arise out of such activities
or failure to act of Grantee. Copies
of the Grantee’s currently effective
insurance policy and its currently

The City Record
effective certificate of insurance
showing the City as an additional
insured shall be maintained on file
with the Clerk of Council of the City
in the above mentioned file, with a
copy provided to the Director of
Law of the City, beginning with the
effective date of the franchise transfer. The amounts of such insurance
against liability due to physical
damages to property shall not be
less than Twenty Million Dollars
($20,000,000)
per
occurrence
and
aggregate; and against liability due
to bodily injury or to death of persons not less than Twenty Million
Dollars ($20,000,000) per occurrence
and aggregate. Grantee shall not
reduce, cancel, or fail to promptly
replace
the
insurance
described
herein, and should the insurer cancel such insurance the Grantee shall
immediately notify the City. The
City shall notify the Grantee and its
insurance carrier in writing, within
fifteen (15) business days after the
presentation
of
any
claim
or
demand, either by suit or otherwise,
made against the City, or not less
than five (5) business days prior to
the date upon which an answer to
such legal action is due, when the
City determined that the suit, claim
or demand may involve the Grantee
or the operation of the Steam System.
Section 5. Operation, Service and
Rates of the Steam System.
A. Service Connections and Delivery of Steam Service. Grantee shall,
so far as the capacity of its plant
will allow, deliver steam or water to
any person or entity requesting
Steam Service who complies with its
reasonable regulations and whose
property abuts upon its service lines
(“Customer”). At the point of delivery, the steam will be dry and saturated in accordance with the steam
table established by American Society
of
Mechanical
Engineers
(“ASME”). The Grantee shall be
responsible
to
maintain,
at
its
expense, all mains and lines up to
the property line of the Customer’s
facility, except where otherwise set
forth in an agreement between
Grantee and a particular Customer,
and shall keep such lines in sound
operating condition and free of
undue leakage.
B. Abandonment of Services. In
the event Grantee makes an application to the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (“PUCO”), to abandon service to any part or all of its
Service Area, Grantee shall send a
copy of any such application to each
of its then existing customers.
C. Existing Rates. All valid contracts or agreements establishing
rates, charges or billing arrangements
between
Customers
and
Grantee (including but not limited
to agreements combining billings
for one or more premises owned or
operated by a Customer) in effect as
of the effective date of this ordinance, shall remain in effect until
the expiration of the contract or
agreement as set forth in such contract or agreement (or as may have
been extended by PUCO order),
except
as
may
be
allowed
or
required by any Court or arbitration
panel, or as agreed by Customer and
Grantee. All tariff and contract
rates for Steam Service in effect as
of the effective date of this ordinance, shall, except for fuel adjust-

2022

October 20, 2004
ment clause increases and authorized by the PUCO or in accordance
with Ohio law, remain in effect
through the term of the franchise.
D. Rates and Charges. If the
Grantee and any Customer cannot
agree on a contract which sets rates
for Steam Service to that Customer,
the rates and charges for Steam Service rendered by Grantee for such
Customer or Customers shall be set
by the PUCO, by Council, or as otherwise may be provided by law. During the term of this franchise,
Grantee shall, upon the request of
the City or Council, provide such
data and information as the City
reasonably requires to review the
rates, charges, terms and conditions
of
Steam
Service
provided
by
Grantee. Nothing contained in the
subparagraph shall be deemed a
waiver of the Grantee to appeal to
or seek review of PUCO in connection with any rates.
E. Contract Rates. Grantee may
enter into contracts for the provision
of Steam Service to one or more of
its Customers provided that the contracts are entered into under the
requirements of the Revised Code or
filed with the PUCO under the terms
of Section 4905.31 of the Revised
Code and provided that copies of all
contracts for Steam Service are provided to the Clerk of Council of the
City to be maintained in the Council file mentioned above, with copies
provided to the Director of Law of
the City.
F. Quality of Service. The Grantee
shall at all times provide safe, adequate and reliable service to its Customers and shall, except as may otherwise be permitted by law, provide
same without discrimination. In so
doing, Grantee shall maintain the
Steam System in a manner to ensure
such service and to ensure the efficient and safe operation of the
Steam System. Grantee shall maintain the Steam System so as to avoid
substantial
leakage,
and
shall
promptly repair material leaks in
the Steam System. Grantee shall
also promptly repair any pavement,
tree lawn, curb or other portion of
the street or public ground which is
damaged by Grantee or due to
defects in or leaks in or emanating
from the Steam System. If there is
any dispute between Grantee and a
Customer as to whether the Grantee
or Customer is responsible to repair
damage in the streets or public
grounds caused by Grantee or due
to defects or leaks in the Steam System, Grantee shall promptly make
any necessary repairs pending resolution of such dispute. The cost of
such repairs may be part of any
such resolution, and may be charged
to the Customer if it is determined
that the repairs were the responsibility of the Customer. The Grantee
acknowledges its obligation to operate and maintain the Steam System
so that it is not in such condition as
to be a hazard to the health, safety
or
welfare
of
the
public,
and
acknowledges the right of the City
to reasonably require the Grantee to
make necessary repairs or improvements
to
abate
said
condition.
Grantee shall promptly comply with
an order of the Director of the
appropriate department of the City
having custody and control of the
particular property or the responsibility to ensure the health, safety or

October 20, 2004
welfare of the public in the particular situation to make any such
repairs or improvements.
G. Minority Business Enterprise
and Female Business Enterprise
Participation
and
Affirmative
Action. Grantee shall use its best
efforts to meet the goals of the City
in effect on the effective date of this
ordinance with respect to minority
enterprise participation and female
business
enterprise
participation,
i.e., thirty percent (30%) and ten
percent
(10%),
respectively,
in
Grantee’s proposed construction for
the improvement and expansion of
the Steam System; provided, that in
evaluating Grantee’s efforts to meet
such goals, the City shall give consideration to the availability of certain specialty items of equipment
for the Steam System that are not
readily available from minority and
female vendors.
Grantee shall adhere to the standards set forth in division (a) of
Section 187.04 of the Codified Ordinances of the City, as presently in
effect with respect to nondiscrimination in employment, and shall use
its best efforts to improve the percentage of minority and female
employment in the various occupations involved in the performance of
the Grantee’s business.
Section 6. Transfers and Assignments.
The franchise granted to the
Grantee herein shall not be transferable either directly or indirectly
except with the consent of Council.
Additionally,
grantee
shall
not,
without consent of Council, either
directly or indirectly consolidate,
merge or in any other way give or
permit control of the management of
its business to or by any other heating, cooling or power company now
operating or that may in the future
operate in the City, including any
company which would by such
action by Grantee first enter into
the business of providing heating,
cooling or power, nor shall Grantee
assign or transfer so much of the
assets of the Steam System so as to
render Grantee unable to continue
providing
adequate
service
as
required
herein.
Notwithstanding
the provisions of this Sections 6, the
capital stock or all or substantially
all of the assets and business of
Grantee may, without the prior
approval of Council, be (i) transferred to any corporation or other
entity
which
is
affiliated
with
Grantee or Ancora Management LLC
or (ii) consolidated or merged with,
or the control of Grantee’s management may be transferred to, any corporation or other entity which is
affiliated with Grantee or Ancora
Management LLC. For purposes of
this section the term “affiliate” shall
mean any person or entity directly
or indirectly controlling, controlled
by or under common control with
another person or entity.
Section 7. Right of Purchase by
the City.
Under Section 183 of the Charter
of the City of Cleveland, there is
reserved to the City the right to terminate this franchise and to purchase all of the property of the
Grantee in the streets and highways
in the City and elsewhere used in or
useful for the operation of the utility at a price to be fixed in the manner provided in the following sen-

The City Record
tence. If the City and Grantee cannot agree on the price to be paid by
the City for such property, the value
shall
be
determined
by
three
appraisers, one each selected by the
City and Grantee, and the other
selected
by
the
two
appraisers
appointed. If the three appraisers
cannot agree upon a value for such
property, the average of the three
separate appraisals of the appraisers shall be the value of such property. The standard to be used by the
appraisers shall be the fair market
value of such property as a going
concern. Further, to the extent provided in Section 184 of the Charter
of the City, the price to be paid by
the City for the property that may
be acquired by the City from the
Grantee, by purchase, condemnation,
or otherwise, shall exclude all additional value of the grant or renewal of this franchise.
Section 8. Renewal of Franchise.
Council may, by ordinance, renew
the franchise at the expiration of
this franchise upon terms conducive
to the public interest.
Section 9. Non-Exclusivity of Franchise.
No rights herein granted to the
Grantee
to
construct,
maintain,
install or operate the Steam System
shall be construed as exclusive or
as preventing the City from granting a franchise or privilege to any
other person, firm or corporation.
Section 10. Acceptance of Franchise.
After the effective date of this
ordinance and within seventy-five
(75) after such date, this ordinance
shall be accepted by the Grantee by,
(a) both its filing with the Clerk of
Council an unconditional written
acceptance hereof, and (b) an affidavit of an officer of Grantee with
supporting documentation evidencing that Dominion Cleveland Thermal, Inc. has transferred to CT
Acquisitions I Inc. the franchise and
the Steam System and all material
rights, title, and interests necessary
for the operation of the system to
CT Acquisitions I Inc. and that
Grantee has obtained PUCO approval for the transfer, which shall
be included in File No. 1519-04-A.
The franchise granted to Dominion
Cleveland Thermal, Inc. shall terminate upon such acceptance by the
Grantee. A failure of the Grantee to
accept this ordinance in the manner
described above within such period
of time shall be deemed a rejection
of the franchise by the Grantee, and
the rights and privileges granted
shall, after the expiration of the
period of seventy-five (75), if not so
accepted, absolutely cease and terminate, unless the period of time is
extended by Council by ordinance
passed for that purpose and before
the expiration of the period of seventy-five (75).
Section 11. Permits.
The Director of Public Service and
other appropriate City officials are
hereby authorized to issue such permits to the Grantee and any of its
construction contractors or subcontractors for construction, installation and operation of the Steam System as may be required by law without further action of the Council.
Permits
shall
be
issued
upon
Grantee’s
compliance
with
the
applicable procedures for obtaining
permits and in accordance with the

2023

15
requirements of law. Grantee shall
comply with all existing City and
State air pollution permits to operate which are applicable to the
Steam System.
Section 12. PUCO.
Grantee shall provide to the City’s
Director of Law timely copies of all
notices, filings, applications and all
other documents submitted to the
PUCO concerning or affecting the
Steam
System,
including
copies
received by Grantee of any complaints or correspondence submitted
to the PUCO concerning the Grantee
or Steam System, but not including
such documents which solely relate
to any other Steam System. Grantee
shall not object to or contest the
right of the City to intervene in any
proceeding initiated by Grantee, the
PUCO or a third party concerning
Grantee or the Steam System.
Section 13. Notices and Reports.
Grantee shall provide notice to a
designated representative of each
customer of any work by Grantee on
the Steam System, or of any change
in its operation, which could materially and adversely affect service to
such Customer. Grantee shall also
respond to any reasonable requests
of
a
Customer
for
information,
