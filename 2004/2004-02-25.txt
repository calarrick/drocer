development activities that expand
job and business opportunities for
lower income persons and neighborhoods”; and

moderate income persons and communities; and

An emergency resolution opposing
House Bill 386, which creates a
statewide uniform building code as
adopted by the State Board of Building Standards, and House Bill 175,
which would establish a statewide
uniform building code for all residential buildings.
Whereas,
state
representatives
recently introduced House Bill 386,
which specifies that the building
code adopted by the state Board of
Building Standards is a statewide
uniform building code; and
Whereas, the House is also considering a previously introduced
bill, H.B. 175, which would establish
a uniform building code for all residential buildings; and
Whereas, both bills prohibit local
governments from adopting rules or
regulations in conflict with the
statewide code; and
Whereas, additionally, local governments may not set standards
higher than those established in the
proposed statewide standards; and
Whereas, Ohio is an extremely
diverse state and neither bill reflects
the differences that exist among
Ohio communities in everything from
snowfall to topography, to community preference to history; and
Whereas, while it may be beneficial to have statewide building code
standards to set minimum regulations, these bills establish the only
standards a community may have,
which will be difficult, if not impos-

sible to enforce in all Ohio communities; and
Whereas, H.B. 175 removes local
government’s authority to require
licensing of residential contractors
which diminishes the ability of local
governments to set minimum contractor standards; and
Whereas, H.B. 386 and H.B. 175
may violate the Home Rule provisions

Management, in the Department of
Natural Resources, has exclusive
authority to regulate the permitting,
location, and spacing of oil and gas
wells in the State of Ohio; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the

§116 Police Force; Control by
Chief
The Police Force shall consist of
a Chief, three Deputy Chiefs of
Police,
eleven
Commanders
of
Police, and such other officers,
patrolmen and employees as may be

The Chief of Police, the Deputy
Chiefs of Police, and the Commanders of Police shall be appointed by
the Mayor from the division of
police or they may be persons
appointed from outside the division
who shall have had training and
experience in law enforcement and
they shall serve at the pleasure of

the Mayor shall appoint to the positions of Deputy Chief of Police and

constituting the Police Force, under
such rules and regulations as may
be established by the Mayor or by
the director of the department to

(c) The Clerk of Council.
(d) The Chief of Police, four
Deputy Chiefs of Police, and twelve

commissions appointed by the Mayor
and of advisory boards appointed by
the director of a department.
(f) The secretary to the mayor

it is impractical to give competitive
tests. Such positions shall be filled
from unskilled labor eligible lists
established and maintained by the

register applicants for positions in
the labor class either continuously
or at such times as there are vacancies to be filled, provided, however,
that no registration may be accepted until public notice of the intention to so accept registrations shall
be made by the Commission. Priority of such registration shall determine an applicant’s place on the eligible list, provided the applicant
meets required standards as to age,
citizenship, physical fitness and residence as established by the Commission. Eligibility to be called for

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 210-04.
By Council Member Britt.
An emergency resolution objecting to a New C1 Liquor Permit at
2603 Woodhill Road.
Whereas, Council has been notified
by the Department of Liquor Control
of an application for a New C1 Liquor
Permit at Ibald, Inc., 2603 Woodhill
Road, Cleveland, Ohio 44104, Permanent Number 4118409; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based on
other legal grounds as set forth in
Revised Code Section 4303.292; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to
Section 4303.26 of the Ohio Revised
Code. Council’s objection to said
permit must be received by the
Director of Liquor Control within
30 days of notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
