is currently in negotiations with the
library employee union, Service Employees International Union District
1199; and
Whereas, the Cleveland Public
Library is wasting thousands of tax
dollars in such contract negotiations
attempting to take away longstanding benefits and rights from the
library employees; and
Whereas, the Cleveland Public
Library
proposes
to
subcontract
book preparation and cataloging
work to southern states without providing
any
documentation
that
shows savings to the library; and
Whereas, such proposal would
send tax dollars out of the City and
further reduce the City’s shrinking
tax base; and
Whereas, the Cleveland Public
Library is increasing the number of
part-time jobs over additional good,
full-time jobs that could support
Clevelanders and their families; and
Whereas, the Cleveland Public
Library refuses to provide health
care coverage for part-time employees; and
Whereas, Service Employees International Union District 1199 has set
a strike date for April 20, 2004; and
Whereas, such a strike will hurt
the Cleveland Public Library, the
City of Cleveland and the entire
community; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports the employees of the
