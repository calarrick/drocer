Res. No. 796-04.
By Council Members Zone, Jackson,
Westbrook,
Gordon,
Lewis,
Jones, Coats, Brady, Pierce Scott,
Britt, Conwell, and Cintron.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Delegation to the U.S. Congress to vote to repeal the 2003 tax
breaks which cause disastrous fiscal
problems in this country’s urban
centers and to redirect a portion of
the restored funds to the states so
that painful budget cuts may be
stopped; and further urging said
Ohio Delegation to vote against any
future tax breaks, which erode the
funding available for critical domestic priorities.
Whereas, this Council believes
that the City of Cleveland must provide quality services to its residents;
and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has experienced cuts to its budget
because of Ohio’s budget deficits
over the last few years; and
Whereas, Ohio needs new revenue
to prevent these and other deep budget cuts as well as to pay for education, affordable housing, child
care, health care, prescription drugs,
public safety, environmental programs, local aid, human services,
and other badly needed state and
local programs; and
Whereas, if significant revenue is
not forthcoming, the City of Cleveland will face increased pressure to
raise property taxes, raise fees,
and/or cut vital services; and
Whereas, Ohio is in this fiscal crisis because the sluggish national
economy has resulted in substantial
loss of revenues; and
Whereas, President Bush and the
U.S. Congress could have provided
$85 billion in aid to the states during this nationwide fiscal crisis,
which would have eliminated every
state’s deficit; and
Whereas, instead, the President
and Congress chose to pass a tax
bill that provides only $20 billion in
aid to states and gives away $330
billion in tax breaks; and
Whereas, the 2003 federal tax law
will cost Ohio millions of dollars
over the next decade; and
Whereas, Ohio has lost 213,100
jobs since the start of the recession;
and
Whereas, the 2003 federal tax law
will yield an average tax cut totaling only $380 over 4 years to most
of Ohio’s taxpayers; and
Whereas, by 2006, 89% of Ohio residents will receive less than $100 in
tax cuts; and
Whereas, there is little evidence
that
these
aforementioned
tax
breaks have the “trickle down”
effect promoted by the U.S. government; and
Whereas, history has shown that
large tax giveaways and inequality
of wealth are often followed by
weak economic growth and job loss;
and
Whereas, Ohio relies on federal
aid in the form of Medicaid reimbursements, general economic assistance, increased spending on transportation and housing development,
direct homeland security funding
and a strong Social Security system;
and
Whereas, the federal government
has required that states do more,
but has not provided adequate funding to do so; and

The City Record
Whereas, the 2003 federal tax law
undermines our state and local
efforts in areas such as homeland
security, election reform, and the No
Child Left Behind Act; and
Whereas, the 2003 federal tax law
provides little tax relief to the vast
majority of the citizens of Ohio; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the Ohio Delegation to the
U.S. Congress to vote to repeal the
2003 tax breaks which cause disastrous fiscal problems in this country’s urban centers and to redirect a
portion of the restored funds to the
states so that painful budget cuts
may be stopped.
Section 2. That this Council further urges said Ohio Delegation to
vote against any future tax breaks,
which erode the funding available
for critical domestic priorities.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to the President George W. Bush, the Ohio Delegation to the U.S. Congress and
Governor Bob Taft.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period

An emergency resolution urging
the
Greater
Cleveland
Regional
Transit Authority and Geauga Lake
Park officials to reinstate the bus
route, or otherwise provide transportation, to Geauga Lake Park, formerly known as Six Flags Amusement Park, so that our youth may
maintain summer employment at the
park.
Whereas, it has come to this Council’s
attention
that
the
Greater
Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (RTA) along with officials at
Geauga Lake Park, have discontinued service from Cuyahoga County
to the amusement park located in
Geauga County, Geauga Lake Park,
formerly
known
as
Six
Flags
Amusement Park; and
Whereas, many Cuyahoga County
and city of Cleveland residents,
mostly youth, have held jobs at this
amusement park during the summer
months; and
Whereas, often, these youth working at the park have no other
recourse but to take public transportation to get to work; and
Whereas, it is incumbent upon
RTA to provide service from Cuyahoga County to Geauga Lake Park
so that these youth and all others

795

21
relying
on
public
transportation
may keep their summer employment
at the park; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the Greater Cleveland

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 720-04.
By Council Member Rybka.
An emergency resolution objecting to the transfer of ownership of
a D5 Liquor Permit at 3277 East
65th Street.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Department of Liquor
Control of an application for the
transfer of ownership of a D5 Liquor
Permit from Regwill, Inc., DBA
Triple T, 3277 East 65th Street,
Cleveland, Ohio 44127, Permanent
Number 7274036 to Tesharra Taylor,
Inc., DBA Triple T, 3277 East 65th
Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44127, Permanent Number 8853630; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of
notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby record its objection to the transfer of ownership of a D5 Liquor Permit from Regwill, Inc., DBA Triple
T, 3277 East 65th Street, Cleveland,
Ohio
44127,
Permanent
Number
7274036 to Tesharra Taylor, Inc.,
DBA Triple T, 3277 East 65th Street,
Cleveland, Ohio 44127, Permanent
Number 8853630; and requests the
Director of Liquor Control to set a
hearing for said application in
accordance with provisions of Section 4303.26 of the Revised Code of
Ohio.

transmit two certified copies of this
resolution, together with two copies
of a letter of objection and two
copies of a letter requesting that the
hearing be held in Cleveland, Cuyahoga County.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted April 26, 2004.
Effective April 30, 2004.

Res. No. 721-04.
By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency resolution supporting initiatives to make Cleveland a
truly bicycle-friendly city by 2010;
supporting the City Planning Commission in the adoption of the Bike
Lane Design Guide of the Pedestrian and Bicycle Information Center;
and urging the Ohio Department of
Transportation to reinstate the bike
lanes
into
the
Euclid
Corridor
Transportation
Project
between
Cleveland State University and Case
Western Reserve University
Whereas, in September, 2002, the
City of Cleveland announced its
intention to make Cleveland a bicycle-friendly city by 2010; and
Whereas,
bike
lanes,
signed,
shared roadways and multi-purpose
trails will make up the transportation network that bicyclists will use
in Cleveland; and
Whereas, bicycles are a legal
mode of transportation in the state
of Ohio and bicyclists enjoy the
same rights and have the same
responsibilities as motorists; and
Whereas, bicycling is a means of
affordable transportation; and
Whereas, studies performed by the
Federal Highway Administration on
bike lanes have shown them to be
a highly effective way of increasing
safety for both the bicycle rider and
motorist; and
Whereas, these same studies have
proven that streets with bike lanes
have increased bicycle ridership;
and
Whereas, bicycling is an excellent
form of recreation that can lead to
improved health and physical fitness; and
Whereas, bicycling is environmentally sound and helps ease traffic
congestion; and
Whereas, with the exception of
lane width, the Bike Lane Design
Guide specifications are consistent
with the manual on Uniform Traffic
Control and the AASHTO Guide for
the Development of Bicycle Facilities; and
Whereas, the City of Chicago has
used these guidelines since 1999 and
is considered the most bicycle-friendly large city in the United States; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland’s
Divisions of Engineering and Construction and Traffic Engineering
have reviewed and approved the
Bike Lane Design Guide; and

803

29
Whereas, if the City of Cleveland
does not adopt a set of local design
guidelines, all questions about the
design of bicycle lanes and other onstreet bicycle facilities will be decided by the Ohio Department of Transportation; and
Whereas, if bike lane design decisions are left to the Ohio Department of Transportation, the Euclid
Corridor Transportation Project may
not include the bike lanes between
Cleveland State University and Case
Western Reserve University specifically requested by the City; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland supports initiatives to make Cleveland a truly
bicycle-friendly city by 2010; supports the City Planning Commission
in the adoption of the Bike Lane
Design Guide of the Pedestrian and
Bicycle
Information
Center;
and
urges the Ohio Department of Transportation to reinstate the bike lanes
into the Euclid Corridor Transportation Project between Cleveland
State University and Case Western
Reserve University.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted April 26, 2004.
Effective April 30, 2004.

Res. No. 722-04.
By Council Members Cimperman,
Westbrook and Brady.
An emergency resolution supporting the elimination of the so-called
“two-thirds” rule and overhaul of
the Ohio Schools Facilities Commission’s reimbursement policies for
rehabilitation which will allow the
Cleveland Municipal School District
maximum flexibility in its decisions
regarding whether an older neighborhood school can be rehabilitated
for continued use in our City and in
communities throughout the State of
Ohio.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has architecturally and historically
significant school buildings listed or
eligible for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places; and
Whereas, the exteriors of these
historic neighborhood schools are
constructed of the finest building
materials available; and
Whereas, many of these fine older
buildings can and should be rehabilitated to meet the 21st century
educational needs of Cleveland’s
school children; and
Whereas, the historic rehabilitation of neighborhood schools will
beautify Cleveland neighborhoods
and likely result in increased property values: and

30
Whereas, the Ohio Schools Facilities Commission’s Design Manual
and reimbursement rules are biased
against rehabilitation in favor of
new construction, significantly limiting the options of local school districts; and
Whereas, the Columbus Landmark
Foundation in its 2002 Historic
Schools Technical Assistance Consortium Final Report, demonstrated
that there are cost savings in building renovation verses new construction with the renovated building
providing 21st Century “suitability”:
and
Whereas, cost savings can be
gained
to
provide
21st
century
school building facilities by revising
the methodology to further evaluate
adequacy of historic buildings and
their renovation: and
Whereas, the Ohio Schools Facilities
Commission
should
develop
reimbursement
guidelines
which
give greater consideration to the
issues concerning older urban school
building and sites and their respective importance effecting the fabric
of urban neighborhoods: and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland hereby supports
the elimination of the so-called “twothirds” rule and overhaul of the Ohio
Schools
Facilities
Commission’s
reimbursement policies for rehabilitation which will allow the Cleveland Municipal School District maximum flexibility in its decisions
regarding whether an older neighborhood school can be rehabilitated
for continued use in our City and in
communities throughout the State of
Ohio
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to the members of the Ohio School Facilities
Commission, the Cleveland Municipal School Board, and the Ohio
House and Senate Committees on
Education.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted April 26, 2004.
Effective April 29, 2004.

shall be substantially in accordance
with the form attached as Exhibit
“A”. Each bond, whether to secure
the execution of a contract, its performance, or both, shall be in an
amount determined by the Director
of Public Service.
Each bond submitted to secure the contract or contracts authorized by this ordinance
shall be executed by a surety authorized to do business in the State of

shall be made on order of the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies
under a requisition against the contract or contacts certified by the
Director of Finance. (RL 130444)
Section 4. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
