Whereas, legionellosis is an infection
caused
by
the
bacterium
Legionella pneumophila; and
Whereas, Legionnaires’ disease is
the most distinct form of infection
caused by such bacterium; and
Whereas,
Legionnaires’
disease

outbreak of pneumonia occurred
among persons attending a convention of the American Legion in
Philadelphia; and
Legionella
organisms
Whereas,
can be found in many types of water
systems; and
Whereas, outbreaks of legionellosis have occurred after persons
have breathed mists that come from
a water source contaminated with
Legionella bacteria; and
Whereas, persons may be exposed
to these mists in hospitals; and
Whereas, individuals at increased
risk for Legionnaires’ disease are
those with weakened immune systems; and
Whereas, such individuals comprise a significant percentage of
patients receiving care in a hospital
setting; and
Whereas, water sampling is critical to determining whether Legionnaires’ disease bacteria are present
in a water system and at what levels; and
Whereas, hospitals are currently
not required to perform water sampling to determine whether Legionnaires’ disease bacteria are present

Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health,

to perform water sampling to determine the presence of Legionnaires’
bacteria
will
limit
unnecessary
patient exposure to Legionnaires’

of the proposal of the Phyllis
Wheatley Association to the Ohio
Housing Finance Agency for the use
of Housing Development Assistance

Whereas, the Council of the city
of Cleveland has recognized the
need to maintain affordable housing
in Cleveland’s neighborhoods; and
Whereas, the Phyllis Wheatley

The City Record
Res. No. 356-04.
By Council Member Jones.
An emergency resolution encouraging the Administration to establish a cost recovery system that
enables the City of Cleveland to bill
motor vehicle insurance companies
for costs associated with the Division of Fire responding to motor
vehicle collisions and incidents.
Whereas, national statistics show
that forty percent (40%) of motor
vehicle accidents are caused by nonresident drivers; and
Whereas,
the
costs
associated
with responding to these motor vehicle accidents are placed upon the
taxpayers of the City of Cleveland;
and
Whereas, with increased response
to motor vehicle accidents comes
increased demands on all operational areas of the Division of Fire;
and
Whereas, municipalities in Ohio
are able to acquire costs associated
with emergency runs by the Division of Fire; and
Whereas, the establishment of a
program enabling the City of Cleveland to bill motor vehicle insurance
companies for costs associated with
the Division of Fire’s response to
motor vehicle collision and incidents
will reduce the burden placed upon
the City’s taxpayers; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.

An emergency resolution requesting that the Ohio Civil Rights Commission allocate time during Housing Advocates reconsideration hearing in a fair and equitable manner;
requesting
that
the
Ohio
Civil
Rights Commission grant the Housing Advocates request for reconsideration; requesting that the Ohio
Civil Rights Commission, upon a

383

31
probable cause determination, immediately refer the seven charges of
discrimination for conciliation as
required by state law; and reconvening Council’s special committee
on Insurance Discrimination.
Whereas, Federal and Ohio law
prohibits discrimination in the sale
of fire, extended coverage or homeowners insurance because of race,
color, religion, sex, familial status,
ancestry, handicap, or national origin or because of the racial composition of the neighborhood in which
housing accommodations are located; and
Whereas, Section 665.03(e) of the
Codified Ordinances of the City of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, prohibits discrimination against any person in
the provision of property and casualty insurance; and
Whereas, it has been brought to
the attention of members of Cleveland City Council that insurance
companies require residents of the
City of Cleveland to pay higher premiums for property and casualty
insurance than residents of surrounding communities are required
to pay; and
Whereas, such premiums are, in
many instances, significantly higher; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland is
a diverse City with a greater number of persons of color compared to
the remainder of Cuyahoga County;
and
Whereas, the practice of requiring
higher insurance premiums for City
of Cleveland residents has a discriminatory impact on City of Cleveland residents; and
Whereas, The Housing Advocates,
Inc.
(“Housing
Advocates”),
has
undertaken an investigation and did
several studies to review base rate
premiums and geographical territorial rating zones for the City of
Cleveland and the remainder of
Cuyahoga County; and
Whereas, this investigation has
shown that City of Cleveland residents pay more for homeowners
insurance than residents living in
surrounding cities and this has a
racial and ethnic disparate impact
on City of Cleveland residents; and
Whereas, Housing Advocates has
filed a total of twenty-eight charges
of housing discrimination against
twenty-eight insurance companies
based on its investigation with the
Ohio Civil Rights Commission; and
Whereas, the Ohio Civil Rights
Commission completed its investigation of the first seven (7) charges
and found that there is no probable
cause to believe that discrimination
occurred; and
Whereas, it appears the investigation failed to request certain documents from the respondents which
may have an impact on the outcome
of the investigation; and
Whereas, it appears that the
Commission’s investigation failed to
address Housing Advocates suggestion for a less restrictive alternative
methods to avoid or at least reduce
the imposition of much higher premiums on our residents; and
Whereas, it appears that Housing
Advocates have made a case for disparate impact by the insurance companies in the pricing of insurance
products in the City of Cleveland

32
versus the remainder of Cuyahoga
County; and
Whereas, in a written request to
the Ohio Civil Rights Commission
for an oral hearing to reconsider the
no probable cause determination,
Housing Advocates requested a total
of thirty-five minutes or five minutes per charge to outline the
unique
factual
circumstances
of
each charge; and
Whereas, the Ohio Civil Rights
Commission notified Housing Advocates that they will be provided
with a total of fifteen minutes to
present their request for reconsideration on all seven (7) charges; and
Whereas, the Ohio Civil Rights
Commission is providing the insurance industry with ten minutes of
time to respond to each of the seven
(7) charges; and
Whereas, the Ohio Civil Rights
Commission’s allocation of time at
the
oral
hearing
scheduled
for
March 11, 2004 is unbalanced and
appears to be biased in favor of the
insurance companies as Housing
Advocates is provided with approximately two minutes per charge to
outline the reasons probable cause
of discrimination exists and the
insurance industry is provided with
ten minutes per charge to rebut any
claim of Housing Advocates; and
Whereas, this Council is concerned about equity and fairness in
appeals before the Ohio Civil Rights
Commission; and
Whereas, the Ohio Civil Rights
Commission is mandated by State
law to carry out and enforce the fair
housing laws of the State of Ohio;
and
Whereas, members of Cleveland
City Council, after being provided
information about the scope and
findings of the Commission investigation, urge the Ohio Civil Rights
Commission members to overturn
the initial determination and find
that there is probable cause to
believe that discrimination occurred
regarding these first seven charges
filed by Housing Advocates.; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes and emergency measure for
the immediate preservation of public peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby requests that the Ohio Civil
Rights Commission allocate time
during Housing Advocates reconsideration hearing in a fair and equitable manner.
Section 2. That this Council hereby requests that the Ohio Civil
Rights Commission carefully review
the brief and exhibits submitted by
the Housing Advocates and grant
the Housing Advocates’ request for
reconsideration.
Section 3. That, if this request for
reconsideration
is
granted,
this
Council requests that the Ohio Civil
Rights
Commission
immediately
refer the seven charges of discrimination for conciliation in an attempt
to resolve the charges, as mandated
by State law.
Section 4. That this Council hereby reconvenes its special committee on Insurance Discrimination,
chaired by Councilman O’Malley, to
closely
monitor
the
conciliation

The City Record
process and the investigation of the
remaining twenty-one charges of
discrimination filed by the Housing
Advocates
with

By Council Members Zone, Westbrook and Jones.
An emergency resolution opposing
House Bill 218, which revises the
declaration of the boundaries of the
land and waters of Lake Erie that
are within the Public Trust and
specifies by definition that littoral
owners have increased rights of submerged lands and waters fronting
their land.
Whereas,
state
representatives
recently introduced House Bill 218,
which would weaken the authority
of the State and local government to
manage the Lake Erie shoreline in
the public interest by removing the
authority of both the State and local
government
to
authorize
and
approve projects; and
Whereas, the bill would limit the
State’s ability to adequately protect
vulnerable coastal areas by removing the states authority to manage
and protect coastal erosion; and
Whereas, the bill would redefine
the littoral rights to allow construction of private structures below
the “natural low watermark”; and
Whereas, the bill would cede title
to hundreds of acres of land that it
holds in trust for the people of Ohio,
placing
the
individual
property
rights of 15,000 private property
owners above the common interests
of the 11 million citizens of Ohio;
and
Whereas, the State of Ohio would
be the only Great Lake State to not
recognize the average high water
mark as the boundary separating
public property and private property; and
Whereas, the bill would severely
limit the State’s stewardship of the

384

March 10, 2004
Lake Erie shore on behalf of the
public trust; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby opposes House Bill 218 which
revises the declaration of the boundaries of the land and waters of Lake
Erie that are within the Public
Trust and specifies by definition
that littoral owners have increased
rights of submerged lands and
waters fronting their land.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to the
appropriate members of the Ohio
Senate Energy, Natural Resources
and Environmental Committees and
those members of the Ohio General
Assembly representing residents of
Cuyahoga County.

An emergency resolution opposing
the plan of President George W.
Bush to eliminate Community Development Block Grant funding in
year 2005.
Whereas,
Community
Development Block Grant (“CDBG”) funding
provides the City of Cleveland and
other eligible metropolitan cities
and urban counties with annual
direct grants that they can use to
revitalize
neighborhoods,
expand
affordable housing and economic
opportunities, and improve community facilities and services, principally to benefit low and moderate
income persons; and
Whereas, the White House released a list of programs that it
wants to eliminate in 2005 and programs that it hopes to cut back significantly; and
Whereas, one of the programs listed was the elimination of the Community Development Block grant
program as the White House proposes a reduction in funding from
$334 million in 2004 to $0 in 2005; and
Whereas, elimination of the Community Development Block Grant
program will have a devastating
effect on the City of Cleveland and
other cities; and
Whereas, the United States Housing and Urban Development’s website indicates that “the impact of
CDBG-funded projects can be seen
in the housing stock, the business
environment, the streets and the
public facilities of entitlement communities” and indicates that “the
program is also an increasingly
important
catalyst
for
economic
development activities that expand
job and business opportunities for
lower income persons and neighborhoods”; and
Whereas, in these challenging economic times, it is important to continue programs that benefit low and
moderate income persons and communities; and
Whereas, in these challenging
economic times, it is also important
to provide adequate funding of pro-

By Council Member Zone.
An emergency resolution opposing
House Bill 386, which creates a
statewide uniform building code as
adopted by the State Board of Building Standards, and House Bill 175,
which would establish a statewide
uniform building code for all residential buildings.
Whereas,
state
representatives
recently introduced House Bill 386,
which specifies that the building
code adopted by the state Board of
Building Standards is a statewide
uniform building code; and
Whereas, the House is also considering a previously introduced
bill, H.B. 175, which would establish
a uniform building code for all residential buildings; and
Whereas, both bills prohibit local
governments from adopting rules or
regulations in conflict with the
statewide code; and
Whereas, additionally, local governments may not set standards
higher than those established in the
proposed statewide standards; and
Whereas, Ohio is an extremely
diverse state and neither bill reflects
the differences that exist among Ohio
communities
in
everything
from
snowfall to topography, to community preference to history; and
Whereas, while it may be beneficial to have statewide building code
standards to set minimum regulations, these bills establish the only
standards a community may have,
which will be difficult, if not impossible to enforce in all Ohio communities; and
Whereas, H.B. 175 removes local
government’s authority to require
licensing of residential contractors
which diminishes the ability of local
governments to set minimum contractor standards; and
Whereas, H.B. 386 and H.B. 175
may violate the Home Rule provisions
of
the
Ohio
Constitution,
which give communities the right to
govern themselves; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby opposes House Bill 386, which
creates a statewide uniform building code as adopted by the State
Board of Building Standards, and
House Bill 175, which would establish a statewide uniform building
code for all residential buildings.

Resources, as House Bill 278 violates the home rule powers granted

Whereas, House Bill 278 gives all
power to regulate the placement and
operation of oil and gas wells to the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources; and
Whereas, municipalities in Ohio,
such as the City of Cleveland, exercising their constitutional home rule
powers may regulate oil and gas
wells; and
Whereas, House Bill 278 is contrary to the Ohio Constitution in
that it violates the right of municipalities to exercise home rule powers as House Bill 278 declares that
the Division of Mineral Resources
Management, in the Department of
Natural Resources, has exclusive
authority to regulate the permitting,
location, and spacing of oil and gas
wells in the State of Ohio; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
