Ord. No. 1119-04.
By Council Members Cimperman,
Sweeney, Zone, Reed, White, Jackson, Polensek, Britt, Pierce Scott,
Coats, Brady, Dolan, O’Malley, Johnson and Rybka.
An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting
new Sections 432.01 through 432.06
and 432.99 thereof, relating to cruising.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has experienced traffic congestion
generated by repetitive, unnecessary
driving of motor vehicles within the
City in certain specific areas; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has also experienced repetitive, unnecessary
driving
around
area
schools both before and after school
when children are either going to or
leaving from school; and
Whereas, such repetitive, unnecessary driving of motor vehicles is
often referred to as “cruising”; and
Whereas, the traffic congestion
resulting from such cruising creates
bumper-to-bumper traffic conditions,
slow-speed
traffic
and
vehicles
stopped in traffic upon roadways
otherwise existing for travel; and
Whereas, such repetitive, unnecessary driving around schools is often
done by those seeking to intimidate,
harass, kidnap or otherwise victimize a child or children; and
Whereas, such cruising in these
certain areas of the City, and
around schools in the City restricts
residential and commercial residents
in these areas and restricts those
legitimately driving motor vehicles
in school areas from entering and
traveling in a normal traffic flow;
and
Whereas, such cruising further
prevents emergency vehicles from
properly and expeditiously responding to emergencies; and
Whereas, cruising also creates
excessive noise from traffic congestion and increases motor vehicle
accidents, traffic and other offenses;
and
Whereas, prohibition of cruising
around schools will help prevent the
targeting of school children for illegal purposes, and help keep our children safe while walking to and from
school; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
hereby supplemented by enacting
new Sections 432.01 through 432.06
and 432.99 thereof, to read as follows:
Chapter 432
Cruising Prohibited
Section 432.01 Findings and Purpose

the public health, safety and welfare arises from the congestion created by the repetitive, unnecessary
driving
of
motor
vehicles,
also
known as “cruising”, at certain
times on certain highways in the
City and around schools located in
the City. The purpose of this ordinance is to reduce the dangerous
traffic congestion, as well as the

June 9, 2004

noise, air pollution, obstruction of
streets, sidewalks and parking lots,
impediment of access to businesses
and other buildings open to the public, interference with use of property or conduct of business resulting
from cruising, to insure access for
emergency vehicles to and through
said highways, and to increase the
safety of school children when walking to and from school. The regulations in this chapter are narrowly
tailored to curb a problem unique to
certain streets in the City and do
not unreasonably interfere with constitutionally protected rights.

hours of 7:00 am and 9:00 am and
2:00 pm and 4:00 pm on school days.
Passing a traffic control point in a
school zone a third time under the

An emergency resolution supporting the Northeast Ohio Campaign
for American Manufacturing and its
mission to inform the public and
elected officials of the importance
and economic impact of manufacturing to our communities and to
implement policies that enhance the
competitiveness of American-based
manufacturing and requesting President Bush and the United States
Congress to do its part to help
achieve greater equity in competitive conditions and international
trade practices.
Whereas, this Council is concerned about the decline of manufacturing jobs in northeast Ohio due
to the U.S. trade deficit and manipulation by foreign governments of
their currencies; and
Whereas, manufacturing is critical to the health of northeast Ohio’s
economy, generating high quality
products,
personal
opportunity,
careers, wealth, high standards of
living and economic growth that
together make up the American
Dream; and
Whereas, the manufacturing sector faces intense global competition
and, in many cases, unfair trade
practices, making it difficult for
many companies
to operate profitably and earn a fair return on capital invested; and
Whereas,
44,000
manufacturing
jobs have been lost in greater Cleveland between November 1999 and
November 2003, of which 13,000 were
lost directly due to the US trade
deficit; and
Whereas, lost manufacturing jobs
translate into the loss of family supporting wages, which further translates into less money spent in retail
stores, for arts and entertainment,
for transportation, and for legal and
accounting services; and
Whereas, a dollar of lost manufacturing production leads to another $1.50 in losses to the service-sector; and
Whereas, the loss of manufacturing companies, equipment, design
and production capacity undermines
our national defense and our capacity to innovate the next generation
of products; and
Whereas, the U.S. trade deficit
from 1994 to 2000 took more than

June 9, 2004
135,000 jobs and job opportunities
from Ohio’s economy; 100,000 of
these jobs were from the high-paying manufacturing sector; and
Whereas, United States’ exports of
manufactured goods have fallen by
$100 billion from their peak in 2000,
which accounts for up to 40% of the
total decline in production and jobs;
and
Whereas, U.S. manufacturers that
attempt to do business in China and
other nations face market barriers
and unfair trade practices, raw
material and other subsidies, technical trade restriction, violations of
intellectual property rights and nonmarket-based industrial policies that
limit U.S. exports and increase
import penetration of our markets;
and
Whereas, China, Taiwan, Korea
and Japan are engaged in government currency intervention, through
purchases of U.S dollars to keep
their currencies from appreciating,
despite large trade surpluses and
investment inflows; and
Whereas, intervention by the Chinese government has maintained
the Chinese yuan at its artificially
low 1994 value, which by some estimates is 40% below its market
value; and
Whereas, unless addressed immediately, foreign currency manipulation and unfair trading practices
will further weaken the manufacturing sector in northeast Ohio and
the United States and encourage
even larger U.S. trade deficits; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports the Northeast Ohio Campaign for American Manufacturing
and its mission to inform the public
and elected officials of the importance and economic impact of manufacturing to our communities and
to implement policies that enhance
the competitiveness of Americanbased manufacturing.
Section 2. That this Council hereby requests President Bush and the
United States Congress to do its part
to help achieve greater equity in
competitive conditions and international trade practices.
Section 3. That the Clerk is hereby directed to send copies of this
resolution to President George Bush,
Senators Voinovich and DeWine and
to the U.S. Representatives from
Northeast Ohio.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
