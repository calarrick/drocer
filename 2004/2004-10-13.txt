cease and terminate, unless such
period is extended by Council by
ordinance passed for that purpose
and before the expiration of the
period of seventy-five (75) days.

cost restore the same to their original condition. Grantee shall clear all
streets
and
public
grounds
of
obstructions or anything that might

1969

17
constitute a nuisance or prevent
such streets and public grounds
from being open and in repair, if
such obstruction or nuisance was
caused by the Grantee or related to
the operation of the Steam System.
If the Grantee fails to complete such
work within a reasonable period of
time, the appropriate officer of the
City may, in writing, notify the
Grantee that the City will complete
such work if not completed by the

determined by the City after receipt
of notice by Grantee. Any work not

charged to the Grantee. Upon the
doing of such work, the City shall
furnish the Grantee with itemized
bills of the actual out-of-pocket cost
of the work, and Grantee shall pay

right of the Council to require such
reconstruction,
relocation,
repair,
change or discontinuance of the
appliances used by the Steam System
in
the
streets
and
public
grounds of the Service Area, all at
the cost of the Grantee, as shall, in
the opinion of the Council, be necessary in the public interest. The
Council shall at all times control the
distribution of space in, under, over,
along, across or upon all streets and
public grounds occupied by fixtures
of the Steam System. In the construction, installation, maintenance
or repair of its properties, the
Grantee shall comply with all laws
and regulations existing at the
effective date of this franchise or
that may thereafter be made by the
City applicable to the Grantee and
the Grantee shall be liable for damages caused by its failure or neglect
to comply with such laws and regulations and shall save the City
harmless from any and all claims
for damages by reason of such failure or neglect.
Section 4. Indemnification and
Insurance.
The Grantee shall fully indemnify
and save harmless the City and its
respective
officers,

for losses and physical damages to
property of the City or other persons, and for debts incurred or taxes
owed by Grantee or its agents,
employees or contractors, caused by
or as a result of the construction,
installation, maintenance and operation of, or the failure to properly
construct, install, maintain and operate,
the
Steam
System
by
the
Grantee. The Grantee shall carry
insurance to cover and protect itself
and the City as an additional
insured from and against all claims,
demands, actions, judgments, costs,

18
expenses, and liabilities which may
arise or result, directly or indirectly, from or by reason of loss, injury
or damage to the City, its property
or employees, or to other persons or
their property, which may arise
from the operations of Grantee or its
Steam System. Grantee’s insurance
company shall, at its own expense,
defend the City, if requested by the
City, in all litigation or claims
alleged to result from or arise out
of such activities or failure to act
of Grantee. The City shall duly notify the insurance company of any
claims and shall deal directly with
such
insurance
carrier
to
seek
defense by such insurance company;
provided, however, the City shall not
be required to institute legal proceedings against such insurance
company if the insurance company
fails
to
defend.
In
the
event
Grantee’s insurance company fails
to defend the City, then Grantee, at
its own expense, shall defend the
City, if requested by the City, in all
litigation or claims alleged to result
from or arise out of such activities
or failure to act of Grantee. Copies
of the Grantee’s currently effective
insurance policy and its currently
effective certificate of insurance
showing the City as an additional
insured shall be maintained on file
with the Clerk of Council of the City
in the above mentioned file, with a
copy provided to the Director of
Law of the City, beginning with the
effective date of the franchise transfer. The amounts of such insurance
against liability due to physical
damages to property shall not be
less than Twenty Million Dollars
($20,000,000)
per
occurrence
and
aggregate; and against liability due
to bodily injury or to death of persons not less than Twenty Million
Dollars ($20,000,000) per occurrence
and aggregate. Grantee shall not
reduce, cancel, or fail to promptly
replace
the
insurance
described
herein, and should the insurer cancel such insurance the Grantee shall
immediately notify the City. The
City shall notify the Grantee and its
insurance carrier in writing, within
fifteen (15) business days after the
presentation
of
any
claim
or
demand, either by suit or otherwise,
made against the City, or not less
than five (5) business days prior to
the date upon which an answer to
such legal action is due, when the
City determined that the suit, claim
or demand may involve the Grantee
or the operation of the Steam System.
Section 5. Operation, Service and
Rates of the Steam System.
A. Service Connections and Delivery of Steam Service. Grantee shall,
so far as the capacity of its plant
will allow, deliver steam or water to
any person or entity requesting
Steam Service who complies with its
reasonable regulations and whose
property abuts upon its service lines
(“Customer”). At the point of delivery, the steam will be dry and saturated in accordance with the steam
table established by American Society
of
Mechanical
Engineers
(“ASME”). The Grantee shall be
responsible
to
maintain,
at
its
expense, all mains and lines up to
the property line of the Customer’s
facility, except where otherwise set

The City Record
forth in an agreement between
Grantee and a particular Customer,
and shall keep such lines in sound
operating condition and free of
undue leakage.
B. Abandonment of Services. In
the event Grantee makes an application to the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (“PUCO”), to abandon service to any part or all of its
Service Area, Grantee shall send a
copy of any such application to each
of its then existing customers.
C. Existing Rates. All valid contracts or agreements establishing
rates, charges or billing arrangements
between
Customers
and
Grantee (including but not limited
to agreements combining billings
for one or more premises owned or
operated by a Customer) in effect as
of the effective date of this ordinance, shall remain in effect until
the expiration of the contract or
agreement as set forth in such contract or agreement (or as may have
been extended by PUCO order),
except
as
may
be
allowed
or
required by any Court or arbitration
panel, or as agreed by Customer and
Grantee. All tariff and contract
rates for Steam Service in effect as
of the effective date of this ordinance, shall, except for fuel adjustment clause increases and authorized by the PUCO or in accordance
with Ohio law, remain in effect
through the term of the franchise.
D. Rates and Charges. If the
Grantee and any Customer cannot
agree on a contract which sets rates
for Steam Service to that Customer,
the rates and charges for Steam Service rendered by Grantee for such
Customer or Customers shall be set
by the PUCO, by Council, or as otherwise may be provided by law. During the term of this franchise,
Grantee shall, upon the request of
the City or Council, provide such
data and information as the City
reasonably requires to review the
rates, charges, terms and conditions
of
Steam
Service
provided
by
Grantee. Nothing contained in the
subparagraph shall be deemed a
waiver of the Grantee to appeal to
or seek review of PUCO in connection with any rates.
E. Contract Rates. Grantee may
enter into contracts for the provision
of Steam Service to one or more of
its Customers provided that the contracts are entered into under the
requirements of the Revised Code or
filed with the PUCO under the terms
of Section 4905.31 of the Revised
Code and provided that copies of all
contracts for Steam Service are provided to the Clerk of Council of the
City to be maintained in the Council file mentioned above, with copies
provided to the Director of Law of
the City.
F. Quality of Service. The Grantee
shall at all times provide safe, adequate and reliable service to its Customers and shall, except as may otherwise be permitted by law, provide
same without discrimination. In so
doing, Grantee shall maintain the
Steam System in a manner to ensure
such service and to ensure the efficient and safe operation of the
Steam System. Grantee shall maintain the Steam System so as to avoid
substantial
leakage,
and
shall
promptly repair material leaks in

1970

October 13, 2004
the Steam System. Grantee shall
also promptly repair any pavement,
tree lawn, curb or other portion of
the street or public ground which is
damaged by Grantee or due to
defects in or leaks in or emanating
from the Steam System. If there is
any dispute between Grantee and a
Customer as to whether the Grantee
or Customer is responsible to repair
damage in the streets or public
grounds caused by Grantee or due
to defects or leaks in the Steam System, Grantee shall promptly make
any necessary repairs pending resolution of such dispute. The cost of
such repairs may be part of any
such resolution, and may be charged
to the Customer if it is determined
that the repairs were the responsibility of the Customer. The Grantee
acknowledges
its
obligation
to
operate and maintain the Steam System so that it is not in such condition as to be a hazard to the health,
safety or welfare of the public, and
acknowledges the right of the City
to reasonably require the Grantee to
make necessary repairs or improvements
to
abate
said
condition.
Grantee shall promptly comply with
an order of the Director of the
appropriate department of the City
having custody and control of the
particular property or the responsibility to ensure the health, safety or
welfare of the public in the particular situation to make any such
repairs or improvements.
G. Minority Business Enterprise
and Female Business Enterprise
Participation
and
Affirmative
Action. Grantee shall use its best
efforts to meet the goals of the City
in effect on the effective date of this
ordinance with respect to minority

business
enterprise
participation,
i.e., thirty percent (30%) and ten
percent
(10%),
respectively,
in
Grantee’s proposed construction for
the improvement and expansion of
the Steam System; provided, that in
evaluating Grantee’s efforts to meet
such goals, the City shall give consideration to the availability of certain specialty items of equipment
for the Steam System that are not
readily available from minority and
female vendors.
Grantee shall adhere to the standards set forth in division (a) of
Section 187.04 of the Codified Ordinances of the City, as presently in
effect with respect to nondiscrimination in employment, and shall use
its best efforts to improve the percentage of minority and female
employment in the various occupations involved in the performance of
the Grantee’s business.
Section 6. Transfers and Assignments.
The franchise granted to the
Grantee herein shall not be transferable either directly or indirectly
except with the consent of Council.
Additionally,
grantee
shall
not,
without consent of Council, either
directly or indirectly consolidate,
merge or in any other way give or
permit control of the management of
its business to or by any other heating, cooling or power company now
operating or that may in the future
operate in the City, including any
company which would by such
action by Grantee first enter into
the business of providing heating,

October 13, 2004
cooling or power, nor shall Grantee
assign or transfer so much of the
assets of the Steam System so as to
render Grantee unable to continue
providing
adequate
service
as
required
herein.
Notwithstanding
the provisions of this Sections 6, the
capital stock or all or substantially
all of the assets and business of
Grantee may, without the prior
approval of Council, be (i) transferred to any corporation or other
entity
which
is
affiliated
with
Grantee or Ancora Management LLC

or the control of Grantee’s management may be transferred to, any corporation or other entity which is
affiliated with Grantee or Ancora
Management LLC. For purposes of
this section the term “affiliate” shall
mean any person or entity directly
or indirectly controlling, controlled
by or under common control with
another person or entity.
Section 7. Right of Purchase by
the City.
Under Section 183 of the Charter
of the City of Cleveland, there is
reserved to the City the right to terminate this franchise and to purchase all of the property of the
Grantee in the streets and highways
in the City and elsewhere used in or
useful for the operation of the utility at a price to be fixed in the manner provided in the following sentence. If the City and Grantee cannot agree on the price to be paid by
the City for such property, the value
shall
be
determined
by
three
appraisers, one each selected by the
City and Grantee, and the other
selected
by
the
two
appraisers
appointed. If the three appraisers
cannot agree upon a value for such
property, the average of the three
separate appraisals of the appraisers shall be the value of such property. The standard to be used by the
appraisers shall be the fair market
value of such property as a going
concern. Further, to the extent provided in Section 184 of the Charter
of the City, the price to be paid by
the City for the property that may
be acquired by the City from the
Grantee, by purchase, condemnation,
or otherwise, shall exclude all additional value of the grant or renewal of this franchise.
Section 8. Renewal of Franchise.
Council may, by ordinance, renew
the franchise at the expiration of
this franchise upon terms conducive
to the public interest.
Section 9. Non-Exclusivity of Franchise.
No rights herein granted to the
Grantee
to
construct,
maintain,
install or operate the Steam System
shall be construed as exclusive or
as preventing the City from granting a franchise or privilege to any
other person, firm or corporation.
Section 10. Acceptance of Franchise.
After the effective date of this
ordinance and within seventy-five
(75) after such date, this ordinance
shall be accepted by the Grantee by,
(a) both its filing with the Clerk of
Council an unconditional written
acceptance hereof, and (b) an affidavit of an officer of Grantee with
supporting documentation evidencing that Dominion Cleveland Thermal, Inc. has transferred to CT
Acquisitions I Inc. the franchise and

The City Record
rights, title, and interests necessary
for the operation of the system to

Grantee has obtained PUCO approval for the transfer, which shall
be included in File No. 1519-04-A.
The franchise granted to Dominion
Cleveland Thermal, Inc. shall terminate upon such acceptance by the
Grantee. A failure of the Grantee to
accept this ordinance in the manner
described above within such period
of time shall be deemed a rejection
of the franchise by the Grantee, and
the rights and privileges granted
shall, after the expiration of the
period of seventy-five (75), if not so
accepted, absolutely cease and terminate, unless the period of time is
extended by Council by ordinance
passed for that purpose and before
the expiration of the period of seventy-five (75).

shall not object to or contest the
right of the City to intervene in any
proceeding initiated by Grantee, the
PUCO or a third party concerning
Grantee or the Steam System.
Section 13. Notices and Reports.
Grantee shall provide notice to a
designated representative of each
customer of any work by Grantee on
the Steam System, or of any change
in its operation, which could materially and adversely affect service
to such Customer. Grantee shall also
respond to any reasonable requests
of
a
Customer
for
information,

an entity approved by the City and
Council. These rights and remedies
are in addition to any other rights
and remedies permitted to the City
by the terms of this franchise or by

PUBLIC NOTICE
Consistent with the Charter of the
City of Cleveland, the following public notice appeared in The Plain
Dealer on September 20, 2004 and

Post on September 23, 2004 and September 30, 2004.
Ordinance No. 846-04, passed by
the Council of the City of Cleveland
on August 11, 2004, authorizes the
submission to the electors of the
City

on
Tuesday,
November 2, 2004, of a proposal to
amend Sections 116 and 126 of the
Charter of the City of Cleveland to
read as follows:
§116 Police Force; Control by
Chief
The Police Force shall consist of
a Chief, three Deputy Chiefs of
Police,
eleven
Commanders
of
Police, and such other officers,
patrolmen and employees as may be
provided by ordinance or resolution
of the Council. The Mayor may
appoint a fourth Deputy Chief of
Police to protect the people from
homeland security threats and a
twelfth Commander of Police for
community policing. In case of riot
or like emergency the Mayor may
appoint additional patrolmen and
officers for temporary service who
need not be in the classified service.
The Chief of Police, the Deputy
Chiefs of Police, and the Commanders of Police shall be appointed by
the Mayor from the division of
police or they may be persons
appointed from outside the division
who shall have had training and
experience in law enforcement and
they shall serve at the pleasure of
the Mayor; provided, however, that
the Mayor shall appoint to the positions of Deputy Chief of Police and
Commander of Police from among
persons recommended by the Chief
of Police with the concurrence of
the executive head of the police
force if such executive head be
other than the Mayor. The Council
may, by ordinance, direct the Mayor
to make appointments of minorities
to the positions of Deputy Chief of
Police and Commander of Police.
Upon the termination of their service as Chief of Police, Deputy
Chief of Police, or Commander of
Police they shall, if appointed from
the division of police, revert to the

1976

October 13, 2004
civil service status held by them at
the time of their appointment, in so
far as it is competent for this charter so to provide. The Chief of
Police shall have exclusive control
of the stationing and transfer of
patrolmen and other officers and
employees constituting the Police
Force, under such rules and regulations as may be established by the
Mayor or by the director of the department to whom the Chief of
Police may be immediately responsible.
§126 Division into Classified and

(b) All directors of departments.
(c) The Clerk of Council.
(d) The Chief of Police, four
Deputy Chiefs of Police, and twelve
Commanders of Police.
(e) The members of all boards or
commissions appointed by the Mayor
and of advisory boards appointed by
the director of a department.
(f) The secretary to the mayor
and one secretary for each director
of a department.
(g) Eight (8) executive assistants
to the Mayor, provided, however,
that there shall be no restrictions as

determine the merit and fitness of
applicants by competitive tests.

peculiar and exceptional qualifications of a scientific, managerial, professional or educational character,
as may be determined by the Commission, the fitness of applicants for
which may be determined by noncompetitive tests.
(c) The ordinary unskilled labor
class shall include all ordinary
unskilled labor positions for which
it is impractical to give competitive
tests. Such positions shall be filled
from unskilled labor eligible lists
established and maintained by the
Commission. The Commission shall

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 1773-04.
By Council Member Jackson (by
departmental request.
An emergency resolution requesting the County Auditor to make
advances during the year 2005 under
Section 321.34 of the Revised Code.
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That under Section
321.34 of the Revised Code, the County Auditor is requested to draw, and
the County Treasurer is requested to
pay, on draft or drafts made payable
to the Treasury of the City of Cleveland, any money that may be in the
County Treasury from time to time
during the year 2005 and credited to
the account of the City of Cleveland
and lawfully applicable to the purpose of the 2005 fiscal year, during
which year this continuing request
is applicable. The payments are to
be made from time to time under the
schedule set by Cuyahoga County.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit a certified
copy of this resolution to the Auditor of Cuyahoga County.
Section 3. That this resolution is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted October 4, 2004.
Effective October 5, 2004.

Res. No. 1863-04.
By Council Member Coats.
An emergency resolution joining
the National League of Cities in
calling for a national commitment to
ensure
access
to
the
American
dream and joining the National
League of Cities in urging state and
federal leaders to work with the
City of Cleveland to develop programs and policies that will maximize access to affordable housing,

strengthen public education, create
opportunities to develop marketable
job skills, and build inclusive communities.
Whereas, the American Dream is
rooted in principles of fairness,
opportunity, and a chance to succeed; and
Whereas, the leaders of America’s
cities and towns are on the front of
service delivery and are the level of
government that citizens look to
first to ensure a good quality of life
and a bright future; and
Whereas, the National League of
Cities believes that government at
all levels has a responsibility to
work together to develop policies
and programs that will give every
American an opportunity to achieve
the American dream; and
Whereas, a new National League
of Cities public opinion survey
shows that two-thirds of Americans
believe the dream is becoming harder to achieve especially for young
families and nearly three quarters
believe government should actively
work to help people achieve the
American dream; and
Whereas, this Council is committed to working with other governmental leaders to maximize access
to affordable housing, strengthen
public education, create opportunities
to
develop
marketable
job
skills, and build an inclusive community; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council joins
the National League of Cities in
calling for a national commitment to
ensure
access
to
the
American
dream.
Section 2. That this Council joins
the National League of Cities in
urging state and federal leaders to
work with the City of Cleveland to
develop programs and policies that
will maximize access to affordable
housing, strengthen public education, create opportunities to develop
marketable job skills, and build
inclusive communities.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
certified copy of this resolution to
Ohio Governor Bob Taft, those members of the State of Ohio Legislature
representing residents of the City of
Cleveland, U.S. Senator Michael DeWine, U.S. Senator George Voinovich,
Congresswoman
Stephanie
Tubbs Jones, Congressman Dennis
Kucinich,
Congressman
Sherrod
Brown,
Congressman
Steven
LaTourette, and the National League
of Cities.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted October 4, 2004.
Effective October 5, 2004.

October 13, 2004
Res. No. 1864-04.
By Council Member Jackson.
An emergency resolution objecting to the transfer of Liquor License
of a C2 and C12X Liquor Permit at
3609 Community College Avenue.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Department of Liquor
Control of an application for a
transfer of Liquor License of a C2
and C2X Liquor Permit from Curtis
Hunt, DBA Right on Time Food &
Beverage, 6002 Woodland Avenue,
1st floor, Cleveland, Ohio 44104,
Permanent Number 4073963 to Curtis Hunt, DBA Right on Time Food
& Beverage, 3609 Community College Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44115,
Permanent
Number
40739630001;
and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of
notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby record its objection to a transfer

An emergency resolution encouraging the Board of Trustees of the
Cleveland Public Library and the
Director of the Cleveland Public
Library to conduct or participate in
an analysis to determine the advantages and disadvantages of merging
with the Cuyahoga County Public

Whereas, Cleveland has the highest poverty rate in the nation and
its homeowners can least afford
additional tax burdens; and

increased the property taxes on a
$100,000 home by an additional

$100,000 pay $170.00 a year in property taxes to fund the Cleveland
Public Library; and
Whereas, homeowners in Cuyahoga County, without an independent library system, owning homes
valued at $100,000 pay $36.00 a year
in property taxes to fund the Cuyahoga County Public Library; and
Whereas, the Main Library of the
Cleveland Public Library is located
in downtown Cleveland and is utilized by both City of Cleveland
homeowners and suburban homeowners; and
Whereas, during these challenging economic times, it is imperative
that public entities use tax payer
dollars in the most effective and
efficient manner; and
Whereas, it is appropriate for the
Cleveland Public Library to conduct
or participate in analysis to deter-

1979

mine the advantages and disadvantages of merging with the Cuyahoga

School District is seeking a significant property tax increase to fund
school operations; and
Whereas, a merger of the Cleveland Public Library with the Cuyahoga County Public Library may
result in a property tax savings for
Cleveland
homeowners
and
any
potential savings could be used to
offset the property tax increases
sought by the Cleveland Municipal
School District; and

immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
