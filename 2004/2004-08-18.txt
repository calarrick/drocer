of the City identified in the map
contained in File No. 2909-87-A and
incorporated by reference and as
expanded or extended within the
boundaries of the City (the “Service

the existing and future transmission
and distribution system extending
to the property line of each customer,
except
where
otherwise

Grantee and a particular customer.
The grant of this franchise does not
establish priority or lack of priority
for use of the streets and public
grounds to Grantee over other present or future permit holders or
franchises, or over the City’s own
use. Any extension or expansion of
the Steam System shall be subject
to
all
of
the
obligations

reserved rights in favor of the City
set forth in this franchise, and shall
be subject to all of the conditions of
this franchise.

by the date specified shall cause
Grantee to be deemed to have rejected this franchise, and the rights and
privileges granted shall cease and

The City Record
terminate, unless such period is
extended by Council by ordinance
passed for that purpose and before
the expiration of the period of thirty (30) days. This amount, together

with any work, shall obtain any permits and approvals required by the
regulations and ordinances of the
City. Prior to performing any work
which would affect or alter the
City’s
water
mains,
sewage
or
drainage system or any other property of the City, Grantee shall provide written notice to the appropriate affected City agency or office.
When
any
streets
and
public
grounds are entered upon by the
Grantee, or facilities removed by the
Grantee, the Grantee shall at its
cost restore the same to their original condition. Grantee shall clear all
streets
and

time, the appropriate officer of the
City may, in writing, notify the
Grantee that the City will complete
such work if not completed by the
Grantee as soon as practicable as
determined by the City after receipt
of notice by Grantee. Any work not
completed as determined by the
City’s officer may be completed by
the City and the actual out-of-pocket cost of such work shall be
charged to the Grantee. Upon the
doing of such work, the City shall
furnish the Grantee with itemized

relocation,
repair,
change or discontinuance of the
appliances used by the Steam System
in
the
streets
and
public
grounds of the Service Area, all at
the cost of the Grantee, as shall, in
the opinion of the Council, be necessary in the public interest. The
Council shall at all times control the
distribution of space in, under, over,
along, across or upon all streets and
public grounds occupied by fixtures
of the Steam System. In the construction, installation, maintenance
or repair of its properties, the
Grantee shall comply with all laws
and regulations existing at the
effective date of this franchise or
that may thereafter be made by the
City applicable to the Grantee and
the Grantee shall be liable for damages caused by its failure or neglect
to comply with such laws and regulations and shall save the City
harmless from any and all claims
for damages by reason of such failure or neglect.
Section 4. Indemnification and
Insurance.
The Grantee shall fully indemnify
and save harmless the City and its

and
employees from and against all
damages, judgments, decrees, costs,
and expenses for bodily injury or

for losses and physical damages to
property of the City or other persons, and for debts incurred or taxes
owed by Grantee or its agents,
employees or contractors, caused by
or as a result of the construction,
installation, maintenance and operation of, or the failure to properly
construct, install, maintain and operate,
the
Steam
System
by
the
Grantee. The Grantee shall carry
insurance to cover and protect itself
and the City as an additional
insured from and against all claims,
demands, actions, judgments, costs,
expenses, and liabilities which may
arise or result, directly or indirectly, from or by reason of loss, injury
or damage to the City, its property
or employees, or to other persons or
their property, which may arise

company shall, at its own expense,
defend the City, if requested by the

August 18, 2004
of such activities or failure to act
of Grantee. The City shall duly notify the insurance company of any
claims and shall deal directly with
such
insurance
carrier
to
seek
defense by such insurance company;
provided, however, the City shall not
be required to institute legal proceedings against such insurance
company if the insurance company
fails
to
defend.
In
the
event
Grantee’s insurance company fails
to defend the City, then Grantee, at
its own expense, shall defend the
City, if requested by the City, in all
litigation or claims alleged to result
from or arise out of such activities
or failure to act of Grantee. Copies
of the Grantee’s currently effective

showing the City as an additional
insured shall be maintained on file
with the Clerk of Council of the City
in the above mentioned file, with a
copy provided to the Director of
Law of the City, beginning with the
effective date of this ordinance. The

person in any one occurrence and
not less than Twenty Million Dollars
($20,000,000) for damage to the property of two or more persons in any

prior to the date upon which an
answer to such legal action is due,
when the City determined that the
suit, claim or demand may involve
the Grantee or the operation of the
Steam System.
Section 5. Operation, Service and
Rates of the Steam System.
A. Service Connections and Delivery of Steam Service. Grantee shall,
so far as the capacity of its plant
will allow, deliver steam or water to

of
Mechanical
Engineers
(“ASME”). The Grantee shall be
responsible
to
maintain,
at
its
expense, all mains and lines up to
the property line of the Customer’s
facility, except where otherwise set
forth in an agreement between
Grantee and a particular Customer,
and shall keep such lines in sound
operating condition and free of
undue leakage.
B. Abandonment of Services. In
the event Grantee makes an application to the PUCO to abandon service to any part or all of its Service
Area, Grantee shall send a copy of

The City Record
any such application to each of its
then existing customers.
C. Existing Rates. All valid contracts or agreements establishing
rates, charges or billing arrangements
between
Customers
and
Grantee (including but not limited
to agreements combining billings
for one or more premises owned or
operated by a Customer) in effect as
of the effective date of this ordinance, shall remain in effect until
the expiration of the contract or
agreement as set forth in such contract or agreement (or as may have
been extended by PUCO order),
except
as
may
be
allowed
or
required by any Court or arbitration
panel, or as agreed by Customer and
Grantee. All tariff and contract
rates for Steam Service in effect as
of the effective date of this ordinance, shall, except for fuel adjustment clause increases and authorized by the PUCO or in accordance
with Ohio law, remain in effect
through December 31, 2020.
D. Rates and Charges. If the
Grantee and any Customer cannot
agree on a contract which sets rates
for Steam Service to that Customer,
the rates and charges for Steam Service rendered by Grantee for such
Customer or Customers shall be set
by the Public Utilities Commission
of Ohio, by Council, or as otherwise
may be provided by law. During the
term of this franchise, Grantee
shall, upon the request of the City
or Council, provide such data and
information as the City reasonably
requires
to
review
the
rates,
charges, terms and conditions of
Steam Service provided by Grantee.
Nothing contained in the subparagraph shall be deemed a waiver of
the Grantee to appeal to or seek
review of PUCO in connection with
any rates.
E. Contract Rates. Grantee may
enter into contracts for the provision
of Steam Service to one or more of
its Customers provided that the contracts are entered into under the
requirements of the Revised Code or
filed with the PUCO under the terms
of Section 4905.31 of the Revised
Code and provided that copies of all
contracts for Steam Service are provided to the Clerk of Council of the
City to be maintained in the Council file mentioned above, with copies
provided to the Director of Law of
the City.
F. Quality of Service. The Grantee
shall at all times provide safe, adequate and reliable service to its Customers and shall, except as may otherwise be permitted by law, provide
same without discrimination. In so
doing, Grantee shall maintain the
Steam System in a manner to ensure
such service and to ensure the efficient and safe operation of the
Steam System. Grantee shall maintain the Steam System so as to avoid
substantial
leakage,
and
shall
promptly repair material leaks in
the Steam System. Grantee shall
also promptly repair any pavement,
tree lawn, curb or other portion of
the street or public ground which is
damaged by Grantee or due to
defects in or leaks in or emanating
from the Steam System. If there is
any dispute between Grantee and a
Customer as to whether the Grantee
or Customer is responsible to repair
damage in the streets or public
grounds caused by Grantee or due
to defects or leaks in the Steam System, Grantee shall promptly make
any necessary repairs pending resolution of such dispute. The cost of

1601

27
such repairs may be part of any
such resolution, and may be charged
to the Customer if it is determined
that the repairs were the responsibility of the Customer. The Grantee
acknowledges its obligation to operate and maintain the Steam System
so that it is not in such condition as
to be a hazard to the health, safety
or
welfare
of
the
public,
and
acknowledges the right of the City
to reasonably require the Grantee to
make necessary repairs or improvements
to
abate
said
condition.
Grantee shall promptly comply with
an order of the Director of the
appropriate department of the City
having custody and control of the
particular property or the responsibility to ensure the health, safety or
welfare of the public in the particular situation to make any such
repairs or improvements.

enterprise participation and female
business
enterprise
participation,
i.e., thirty percent (30%) and ten
percent
(10%),
respectively,
in
Grantee’s proposed construction for
the improvement and expansion of
the Steam System; provided, that in
evaluating Grantee’s efforts to meet
such goals, the City shall give consideration to the availability of certain specialty items of equipment
for the Steam System that are not
readily available from minority and
female vendors.
Grantee shall adhere to the standards set forth in division (a) of
Section 187.04 of the Codified Ordinances of the City, as presently in
effect with respect to nondiscrimination in employment, and shall use
its best efforts to improve the percentage of minority and female
employment in the various occupations involved in the performance of
the Grantee’s business.
Section 6. Transfers and Assignments.
The franchise granted to the
Grantee herein shall not be transferable either directly or indirectly
except with the consent of Council.
Grantee shall not, without consent
of Council, either directly or indirectly consolidate, merge or in any
other way give or permit control of
the management of its business to
or by any other heating, cooling or
power company now operating or
that may in the future operate in
the City, including any company
which would by such action by
Grantee first enter into the business
of providing heating, cooling or
power, nor shall Grantee assign or
transfer so much of the assets of the
Steam System so as to render
Grantee unable to continue providing adequate service as required
herein. The provisions of this section do not apply in the event of a
direct or indirect sale or transfer of
control of any of Grantee’s subsidiaries
which
together
with
Grantee own assets of the Steam
System as currently existing or in
the future constituted or all or substantially all of the assets and business of any of the foregoing to any
of the affiliates of Grantee or any
affiliates of Ancora Management
LLC now or in the future existing
or created to invest in, own or operate the Steam System, except that

28
there shall not be any direct or indirect sale or transfer of control of
any of Grantee’s subsidiaries which
together with Grantee own assets of
the Steam System or all or substantially all of the assets and business
of any of the foregoing in any manner which would be prohibited if
done by Grantee itself as set forth
above without prior approval of
Council, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld. The capital
stock or all or substantially all of
the assets and business of Grantee
may, without the prior approval of
Council, be (i) transferred to any
corporation or other entity which is
affiliated with Grantee or Ancora
Management LLC or (ii) consolidated or merged with, or the control of
Grantee’s
management
may
be
transferred to, any corporation or
other entity which is affiliated with
Grantee
or
Ancora
Management
LLC. For purposes of this section
the term “affiliate” shall mean any
person or entity directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or
under common control with another
person or entity.
Section 7. Right of Purchase by
the City.
Under Section 183 of the Charter
of the City of Cleveland, there is
reserved to the City the right to terminate this franchise and to purchase all of the property of the
Grantee in the streets and highways
in the City and elsewhere used in or
useful for the operation of the utility at a price to be fixed in the manner provided in the following sentence. If the City and Grantee cannot agree on the price to be paid by
the City for such property, the value
shall
be
determined
by
three
appraisers, one each selected by the
City and Grantee, and the other
selected
by
the
two
appraisers
appointed. If the three appraisers
cannot agree upon a value for such
property, the average of the three
separate appraisals of the appraisers shall be the value of such property. The standard to be used by the
appraisers shall be the fair market
value of such property as a going
concern. Further, to the extent provided in Section 184 of the Charter
of the City, the price to be paid by
the City for the property that may
be acquired by the City from the
Grantee, by purchase, condemnation,
or otherwise, shall exclude all value
of the grant or renewal of this franchise.
Section 8. Renewal of Franchise.
Council may, by ordinance, renew
the franchise at the expiration of
this franchise upon terms conducive
to the public interest.
Section 9. Non-Exclusivity of Franchise.
No rights herein granted to the
Grantee
to
construct,
maintain,
install or operate the Steam System
shall be construed as exclusive or
as preventing the City from granting a franchise or privilege to any
other person, firm or corporation.
Section 10. Acceptance of Franchise.
After the effective date of this
ordinance and within thirty days
after such date, this ordinance shall
be accepted by the Grantee by, (a)
both its filing with the Clerk of
Council an unconditional written
acceptance hereof, and (b) an affidavit of an officer of Grantee with
supporting documentation evidencing that Dominion Cleveland Ther-

The City Record
mal, Inc. has transferred to CT
Acquisitions I Inc. the franchise and

rights, title, and interests necessary
for the operation of the system to

Grantee has obtained PUCO approval for the transfer, which shall
be included in File No. 1519-04-A.
The franchise granted to Dominion
Cleveland Thermal, Inc. shall terminate upon such acceptance by the
Grantee. A failure of the Grantee to
accept this ordinance in the manner
described above within such period
of time shall be deemed a rejection
of the franchise by the Grantee, and
the rights and privileges granted
shall, after the expiration of the
period of thirty days, if not so
accepted, absolutely cease and terminate, unless the period of time is
extended by Council by ordinance
passed for that purpose and before
the expiration of the period of thirty days.
Section 11. Permits.
The Director of Public Service and
other appropriate City officials are
hereby authorized to issue such permits to the Grantee and any of its
construction contractors or subcontractors for construction, installation and operation of the Steam System as may be required by law without further action of the Council.
Permits
shall
be
issued
upon
Grantee’s

permits and in accordance with the
requirements of law. Grantee shall
comply with all existing City and
State air pollution permits to operate which are applicable to the
Steam System.

Director of Law timely copies of all
notices, filings, applications and all
other documents submitted to the
PUCO concerning or affecting the
Steam
System,
including

right of the City to intervene in any
proceeding initiated by Grantee, the
PUCO or a third party concerning
Grantee or the Steam System.
Section 13. Notices and Reports.
Grantee shall provide notice to a
designated representative of each

respond to any reasonable requests
of a Customer for information, including available Steam System efficiency measurements and studies. In
addition, Grantee shall provide a
copy of each of its annual reports
to the Clerk of Council, for filing in

Res. No. 1540-04.
By Council Members Polensek,
Zone and Westbrook.
An emergency resolution objecting to the unsightly conditions at
the Cleveland lakefront parks and
calling on the Campbell administration to convene a discussion with
the State of Ohio and the Cleveland
Metroparks about the ownership and
management of the parks for purposes of properly maintaining such
parks for maximum utilization by
the citizens of Greater Cleveland.
Whereas, five lakefront parks
located in the Cleveland area have
been under control of the State of
Ohio since the 1970’s; and
Whereas, these lakefront parks
are Edgewater Park, East 55th
Street Marina, Gordon Park, Euclid
Beach, and Villa Angela/Wildwood,
all located in the city of Cleveland;
and
Whereas, the State of Ohio, troubled by a budget deficit, has been
unable to properly maintain these
lakefront parks, which have become
overgrown and filled with litter; and
Whereas, this Council is convinced that these conditions indicate
an inability of the State to adequately
maintain
the
lakefront
parks; and
Whereas, although the State did
initiate a major clean-up based upon
complaints from City Council and
media coverage, the unkempt and
unsightly conditions have not been
completely remediated and these
conditions continue to deter the full
utilization of the lakefront parks by
the public; and
Whereas, this Council believes it
is necessary to explore and identify
an appropriate management authority to bring these parks back into
stable, beautiful condition; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
objects to the unsightly conditions
at the Cleveland lakefront parks

The City Record
Res. No. 1579-04.
By Council Members Cimperman,
Conwell, Pierce Scott, Zone, Jones,
White, Reed, Jackson, Britt, Lewis,
Coats,
Rybka,
Gordon,
O’Malley,
Westbrook, Brady, Sweeney and
Polensek.
An emergency resolution urging
the YMCA to keep the West Side
Family YMCA, the Miles Avenue
Family YMCA, and the Glenville
Family YMCA open until at least
December 31, 2004; to extend the
partnership negotiations to at least
December 31, 2004; and to allow community and local nonprofit organizations to create a plan and to identify opportunities to continue services that will be lost.
Whereas, the YMCA’s relationship
with Cleveland dates back to 1854
when it began its charity and missionary work with the City’s adults
and children; and
Whereas, throughout its history,
the YMCA also worked with the
City’s social settlement and welfare
agencies to serve the City’s poor and
disadvantaged; and
Whereas, throughout its history,
the YMCA has been a strong community presence in many Cleveland
neighborhoods; and
Whereas, the West Side Family
Branch opened in 1901 and is a
neighborhood institution and gathering place for neighbors in the
Ohio City/Near West Side community; and
Whereas, the Miles Avenue Family Branch serves the City’s UnionMiles and southeast community; and
Whereas, the Glenville Family
Branch is important to the City’s
Glenville community; and
Whereas,
in
June
the
YMCA
administration announced changes
for these three City branches that
will result in reduced programs for
adults and children in the City’s
neighborhoods; and
Whereas, the YMCA announced
that it will close the West Side Family Branch on August 31, 2004 and
has offered the building for sale; and
Whereas, the closing of the West
Side Family Branch is a devastating
loss for the City’s residents who participated in the valuable programs
offered at the facility, including
childcare, swimming, exercise, and
wellness programs, and who used
the facility as a community-gathering place; and
Whereas, the YMCA has said that
it is willing to continue programs in
the Ohio City/Near West neighborhood in collaboration with a community partner yet there have been
no meaningful discussions with any
potential community partners; and
Whereas, the YMCA has proposed
a partnership with the Union Miles
Development Corp. to continue to
offer programs in the Union Miles
and southeast Cleveland neighborhood, but has stated that if the
partnership negotiations are not successfully concluded by August 31,
2004 it will reduce services and
potentially close the Miles Avenue
Family Branch; and
Whereas, this timeline is not practical or reasonable in that it does
not give Union Miles Development
Corp. enough time to assess the
partnership and move forward with
a meaningful plan; and

55
Whereas, the YMCA has proposed
a partnership with the Glenville
Development
Corp.
whereby
the
Glenville Family Branch will be
sold to the Glenville Development
Corp. and the YMCA would lease
space for reduced programming; and
Whereas, the YMCA has stated
that if this partnership negotiation
is not successfully concluded by
August 31, 2004 it will reduce services
and
potentially
close
the
Glenville Family Branch; and
Whereas, this timeline is not practical or reasonable in that it does
not
give
Glenville
Development
Corp. enough time to assess the
partnership and move forward with
a meaningful plan; and
Whereas, Mayor Jane L. Campbell
and members of Cleveland City
Council have asked the YMCA to
extend the closing date for the
branches and the date for conclusion
of
partnership
negotiations
to
December 31, 2004 to allow the community and local nonprofit organizations to create a plan and to identify opportunities to continue services that will be lost; and
Whereas, the YMCA Board of
Trustees has not responded to this
request; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the YMCA to keep the West Side
Family YMCA, the Miles Avenue
Family YMCA, and the Glenville
Family YMCA open until at least
December 31, 2004 and to extend the
deadline for conclusion of partnership negotiations to at least December 31, 2004 to allow the community
and local nonprofit organizations to
create a plan and to identify opportunities to continue services that
will be lost.
Section 2. That this Council urges
the YMCA to disclose branch-bybranch financial summaries to the
community and City officials so that
the community that supports this
nonprofit corporation may evaluate
the reason given by the YMCA for
closing and restructuring the City
branches and may more competently consider alternative plans and
identify opportunities to continue
services that will be lost.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is authorized and directed to
transmit a copy of this resolution to
the
Executive
Director
of
the
Greater Cleveland YMCA and to the
members of its Board of Trustees.
Section 4. That this resolution is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

the foundation below the surface
upon which the lead-based paint
removal is being performed and on
sides adjacent to said surface. The

AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 1457-04.
By Council Members Britt and

An
emergency
resolution
to
acknowledge the creation of a Cleveland Women’s Health Care Commission.
Whereas, Charter Section 81 allows
a director, with the approval of the
Mayor, to appoint an advisory board;
and
Whereas, the Mayor has approved
the
creation
of
the
Cleveland
Women’s Health Care Commission;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. This Council acknowledges that the Director of Public
Health has established a Cleveland
Women’s Health Care Commission
(the “Commission”) consisting of not
less than ten (10) and not more than
thirty (30) members, appointed by
the Director of Public Health. There
shall be at least four (4) members
of the Commission who are recommended by the African American
Women’s Agenda Education Foundation.
The
Commission
shall
appoint a Secretary, who may or
may not be a member of the Commission, and who shall serve at the
pleasure of the Commission. The
Commission shall adopt its own
rules and order of business and
keep a journal of its proceedings.
The Commission shall meet at least
every 3 months, and on the call of
the Chairperson, who shall be the
Commissioner of Health.
Section 2. Duties of the Commission. The Commission shall do the
following:

The City Record
Res. No. 1540-04.
By Council Members Polensek,
Zone and Westbrook.
An emergency resolution objecting to the unsightly conditions at
the Cleveland lakefront parks and
calling on the Campbell administration to convene a discussion
with the State of Ohio and the
Cleveland Metroparks about the
ownership and management of the
parks for purposes of properly
maintaining such parks for maximum utilization by the citizens of
Greater Cleveland.
Whereas, five lakefront parks
located in the Cleveland area have
been under control of the State of
Ohio since the 1970’s; and
Whereas, these lakefront parks
are Edgewater Park, East 55th
Street Marina, Gordon Park, Euclid
Beach, and Villa Angela/Wildwood,
all located in the city of Cleveland;
and
Whereas, the State of Ohio, troubled by a budget deficit, has been
unable to properly maintain these
lakefront parks, which have become
overgrown and filled with litter; and
Whereas, this Council is convinced that these conditions indicate
an inability of the State to adequately
maintain
the
lakefront
parks; and
Whereas, although the State did
initiate a major clean-up based upon
complaints from City Council and
media coverage, the unkempt and
unsightly conditions have not been
completely remediated and these
conditions continue to deter the full
utilization of the lakefront parks by
the public; and
Whereas, this Council believes it
is necessary to explore and identify
an appropriate management authority to bring these parks back into
stable, beautiful condition; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
objects to the unsightly conditions
at the Cleveland lakefront parks
and calls on the Campbell administration to convene a discussion
with the State of Ohio and the
Cleveland Metroparks about the
ownership and management of the
parks for purposes of properly
maintaining such parks for maximum utilization by the citizens of
Greater Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to Governor
Bob Taft and Executive Director
and members of the Board of the
Cleveland Metroparks.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

An emergency resolution urging
the YMCA to keep the West Side
Family YMCA, the Miles Avenue
Family YMCA, and the Glenville
Family YMCA open until at least
December 31, 2004; to extend the
partnership negotiations to at least
December 31, 2004; and to allow community and local nonprofit organizations to create a plan and to identify opportunities to continue services that will be lost.
Whereas, the YMCA’s relationship
with Cleveland dates back to 1854
when it began its charity and missionary work with the City’s adults
and children; and
Whereas, throughout its history,
the YMCA also worked with the
City’s social settlement and welfare
agencies to serve the City’s poor and
disadvantaged; and
Whereas, throughout its history,
the YMCA has been a strong community presence in many Cleveland
neighborhoods; and
Whereas, the West Side Family
Branch opened in 1901 and is a
neighborhood institution and gathering place for neighbors in the
Ohio City/Near West Side community; and
Whereas, the Miles Avenue Family Branch serves the City’s UnionMiles and southeast community; and
Whereas, the Glenville Family
Branch is important to the City’s
Glenville community; and
Whereas,
in
June
the
YMCA
administration announced changes
for these three City branches that
will result in reduced programs for
adults and children in the City’s
neighborhoods; and
Whereas, the YMCA announced
that it will close the West Side Family Branch on August 31, 2004 and
has offered the building for sale; and
Whereas, the closing of the West
Side Family Branch is a devastating
loss for the City’s residents who participated in the valuable programs
offered at the facility, including
childcare, swimming, exercise, and
wellness programs, and who used
the facility as a community-gathering place; and
Whereas, the YMCA has said that
it is willing to continue programs
in the Ohio City/Near West neighborhood in collaboration with a
community partner yet there have
been no meaningful discussions
with any potential community partners; and
Whereas, the YMCA has proposed
a partnership with the Union Miles
Development Corp. to continue to
offer programs in the Union Miles
and southeast Cleveland neighborhood, but has stated that if the partnership negotiations are not successfully concluded by August 31,
2004 it will reduce services and
potentially close the Miles Avenue
Family Branch; and
Whereas, this timeline is not practical or reasonable in that it does
not give Union Miles Development

1656

August 18, 2004
Corp. enough time to assess the
partnership and move forward with
a meaningful plan; and
Whereas, the YMCA has proposed
a partnership with the Glenville
Development
Corp.
whereby
the
Glenville Family Branch will be
sold to the Glenville Development
Corp. and the YMCA would lease
space for reduced programming; and
Whereas, the YMCA has stated
that if this partnership negotiation
is not successfully concluded by
August 31, 2004 it will reduce services
and
potentially
close
the
Glenville Family Branch; and
Whereas, this timeline is not practical or reasonable in that it does
not
give
Glenville
Development
Corp. enough time to assess the
partnership and move forward with
a meaningful plan; and
Whereas, Mayor Jane L. Campbell
and members of Cleveland City
Council have asked the YMCA to
extend the closing date for the
branches and the date for conclusion
of
partnership
negotiations
to
December 31, 2004 to allow the community and local nonprofit organizations to create a plan and to identify opportunities to continue services that will be lost; and
Whereas, the YMCA Board of
Trustees has not responded to this
request; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the YMCA to keep the West Side
Family YMCA, the Miles Avenue
Family YMCA, and the Glenville
Family YMCA open until at least
December 31, 2004 and to extend the
deadline for conclusion of partnership negotiations to at least December 31, 2004 to allow the community
and local nonprofit organizations to
create a plan and to identify opportunities to continue services that
will be lost.
Section 2. That this Council urges
the YMCA to disclose branch-bybranch financial summaries to the
community and City officials so that
the community that supports this
nonprofit corporation may evaluate
the reason given by the YMCA for
closing and restructuring the City
branches and may more competently consider alternative plans and
identify opportunities to continue
services that will be lost.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is authorized and directed to
transmit a copy of this resolution to
the
Executive
Director
of
the
Greater Cleveland YMCA and to the
members of its Board of Trustees.
Section 4. That this resolution is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

By Council Members Britt, Gordon,
White and Jackson (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance to repeal
Section 203.10 and Sections 240.01
through 240.07, and 240.99 of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, as amended or enacted
by various ordinances; to amend Sections 365.01, 365.02, 365.05, 365.06,
365.07, 371.01, 375.02, 375.03, and
375.08 of the codified ordinances, as
amended or enacted by various ordinances; to enact new Sections 240.01
to 240.09 and 240.99 all relating to
lead and lead hazards.
Whereas, according to Ohio Department of Health data for 2002,
there are an estimated 5,100 children
in the City of Cleveland with blood
levels greater than 10 micrograms
of lead per deciliter of blood, the
threshold established by the Centers
for Disease Control (CDC); and
Whereas, Cleveland and Cuyahoga
County have high rates of elevated
blood levels in children relative to
other cities and counties in the U.S.;
and
Whereas, according to the CDC,
lead affects virtually every system in
the body and, even at low levels, is
harmful
and
associated
with
decreased intelligence, impaired neurobehavioral development, decreased
stature and growth, and impaired
hearing acuity in children; and
Whereas, the major source of lead
exposure among children is leadbased paint and lead-contaminated
dust found in deteriorating buildings. Lead-based paints were banned
for use in housing in 1978, but thousands of housing units in the City
of Cleveland that are homes to one
or more young children have deteriorated leaded paint and lead-contaminated house dust; and
Whereas, lead poisoning is entirely preventable through proper methods of control of lead hazards; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
desires to prevent lead poisoning
and protect the public health and
safety by prohibiting improper control of lead hazards and the inadvertent creation of lead hazards during
repainting,
remodeling,
and
repair in housing units; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
desires to prevent lead poisoning
and protect the public health and
safety through education by ensuring the application of the federal
disclosure rule to residential property constructed before 1978 in the
City limits; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
desires to prevent lead poisoning
and protect the public health and
safety by providing an incentive to
residential property owners to make
their property lead free and lead
safe through the issuance of leadfree and lead-safe maintenance certificates; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
Department of Public Health has
been delegated by the Ohio Department of Health with the duty to
investigate residential units, daycare facilities, and schools, when it
is notified that a child has become
lead poisoned, and order the owners
and managers of residential units,
day-care facilities, and schools that
are contributing to the child’s lead
poisoning to control associated lead
hazards; and

The City Record
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the following Sections of the Codified Ordinances of

122
Ord. No. 1305-04.
By Council Member Jackson.
An emergency ordinance providing for the issuance and sale of
bonds in the maximum principal
amount of $14,140,000 to improve the
municipal street system and related
facilities; and the issuance of notes
in anticipation of those bonds.
Whereas, this Council desires to
issue bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed Fourteen
Million One Hundred Forty Thousand
Dollars
($14,140,000)
(the
“Bonds”) to finance the costs of certain
permanent
improvements
described in Section 1; and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of the City, has certified to this Council that the estimated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be financed with
the proceeds of the Bonds is at least
five (5) years and the maximum
maturity of the Bonds is twenty (20)
years; and
Whereas, this Council passed Ordinance No. 1749-80 on October 8, 1980,
and thereafter amended that ordinance by Ordinance No. 1112-83,
passed on May 6, 1983, and Ordinance No. 944-96, passed on June 10,
1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so
amended and as the same may further be amended from time to time
in accordance with its provisions, is
referred to as the “General Bond
Ordinance”), providing the general
terms
and
provisions
for
the
issuance of unvoted general obligations of the City, with the specific
terms of each series of bonds to be
contained in ordinances authorizing
their issuance (the “Series Bond
Ordinances”); and
Whereas, the issuance of the
Bonds is necessary to provide funds
to pay the costs of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1 that are urgently needed for
the benefit of the City, and as a
result, this Ordinance constitutes an
emergency measure providing for
the immediate preservation of the
public peace, property, health and
safety, and for the usual daily operation of a municipal department;
now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary to issue the Bonds in an
aggregate principal amount not to
exceed Fourteen Million One Hundred
Forty

roadways, driveways, underground
vaults, sidewalks and pedestrian
walkways, by acquiring, constructing, reconstructing, opening, extending, widening, grading, draining,

The City Record
necessary and incidental thereto,
and to pay any capitalized interest
and all expenses incurred in connection with the issuance of the
securities, including any financing
costs within the meaning of Revised
Code Section 133.01(K), and such
other costs of those permanent
improvements as may be financed
with the proceeds of securities as
permitted by Revised Code Section
133.15(B) and as otherwise permitted by law; and to authorize the
issuance of notes in anticipation of
the Bonds.
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Sections
133.01 to 133.70, inclusive, and other
applicable provisions of the Revised
Code, the Charter of the City, the
General Bond Ordinance and this
Ordinance in the principal amount
and for the purpose stated in Section 1. The Bonds shall be designated
“Bridges
and
Roadways
Improvement Bonds, Series 2004”.
The Bonds shall be issued in one lot
as fully registered Bonds in denominations of $5,000 or any integral
multiple thereof. The Bonds shall be
numbered as determined by the
Director of Finance.
The Bonds shall be dated as of
October 1, 2004, or such other date,
but in no event later than October
1, 2005, specified in the certificate
of award providing for the final
terms of the Bonds and the sale of
the Bonds signed by the Director of
Finance in accordance with this
Ordinance
(the
“Certificate
of
Award”). The Bonds shall bear
interest at the rate or rates per
year specified in the Certificate of
Award; provided that if all the
Bonds bear interest at the same
rate per year, then such rate shall
not exceed six percent (6%) per
year, and if the Bonds bear interest at more than one rate per year,
then the weighted average of such
rates (taking into account the principal amount and maturity of each
Bond to which a rate applies) shall
not exceed six percent (6%) per
year. Interest on the Bonds shall be
payable, until the principal amount
is paid, semi-annually on June 1
and December 1 of each year or on
the days specified in the Certificate
of Award as the dates on which
interest on the Bonds shall be
payable
(the
“Interest
Payment
Dates”),
beginning
December
1,
2004 or on such other Interest Payment Date specified in the Certificate of Award as the first Interest
Payment Date.
The Bonds shall mature on December 1 in twenty (20) substantially
equal annual installments, beginning December 1, 2005, or according
to the schedule set forth in the Certificate of Award, provided that (i)
each principal payment shall occur
on an Interest Payment Date, (ii)
the first principal payment on the
Bonds shall be no earlier than
December 1, 2004 and no later than
August 1, 2007, (iii) the final maturity date of the Bonds shall be no
later than twenty (20) years from
that date which is twelve months
prior to the first date on which provision for payment of principal is
made, and (iv) the principal amount
thereof shall be payable in annual
installments such that the total principal and interest payments on the
Bonds in any fiscal year in which
principal is payable is not more

1696

August 18, 2004
than three times the amount of
those payments in any other fiscal
year.
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the
“Mandatory
Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption prior to stated maturity
as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent,
currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of
and interest on any Term Bonds
shall include amounts sufficient to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City
for any Term Bonds. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds which
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and canceled
by the Registrar, to the extent not
applied
theretofore
as
a
credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by

August 18, 2004
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of
the principal amount thereof against
the then current Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement (and
corresponding mandatory redemption obligation). Any excess of that
amount
over
the
then
current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement shall be credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligations) in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(b)
Optional
Redemption.
The
Bonds may be subject to redemption
prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole or in
part on any date, in integral multiples
of
$5,000,
at
the
optional
redemption dates and at the redemption prices (expressed as a percentage
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed) specified in the Certificate of Award, plus, in each case,
accrued interest to the redemption
date, provided the first optional
redemption date shall not be later
than December 1, 2014 and the highest redemption price shall not be
greater than 102%. The Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that it is in the
best interests of the City for the
Bonds not to be callable prior to
their stated maturity.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar, given upon the direction
of the Council of the City by passage of an ordinance. That notice
shall specify the redemption date
and the principal amount of each
maturity of Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar.
There shall be deposited with the
Registrar on or prior to the redemption date funds sufficient to redeem
at the redemption price all of the
redeemable Bonds for which notice
of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Bonds by lot when Bonds of
denominations greater than $5,000
are then outstanding, each $5,000
unit of principal thereof shall be
treated as though it were a separate
Bond of the denomination of $5,000.
If it is determined that one or more,
but not all of the $5,000 units of
principal amount represented by a
Bond are to be called for redemption, then upon notice of redemption
of a $5,000 unit or units, the registered owner of that Bond shall sur-

The City Record
render the Bond to the Registrar (i)
for payment of the redemption price
of the $5,000 unit or units called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption and any
premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing and to any
municipal bond insurance company
that has issued a policy insuring
some or all of the Bonds. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity
of
the
proceedings
for
the
redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph, the Bonds and portions
thereof called for redemption shall
become due and payable on the
redemption date, and, upon presentation and surrender at the place or
places specified in that notice, shall
be paid. If money for the redemption of all of the Bonds and portions
thereof to be redeemed, including
interest accrued to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, and, if notice of
redemption has been deposited in
the mail, then from and after the
redemption date those Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall cease to bear interest and
no longer shall be considered to be
outstanding. If that money shall not
be so available on the redemption
date, or that notice shall not have
been deposited in the mail, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held
by
the
Registrar
for
the
redemption of particular Bonds shall
be held in trust for the account of
the registered owners and shall be
paid to them, respectively, upon presentation and surrender of those
Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of

1697

123
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section
3) at the close of business on the
date provided in the Agreement
authorized in Section 3 (the “Record
Date”). Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond
Ordinance, so long as the Bonds are
held by a Depository in a book entry
system (as described in Section 3),
debt charges on the Bonds will be
payable in lawful money of the United States by wire transfer to the
Depository made by the Escrow
Agent on each Interest Payment
Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance, except for the third paragraph of Section 13(a) (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 (pertaining generally to the periods during which the City is not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under the
General Bond Ordinance), will not
apply to the Bonds. Except for those
provisions, the General Bond Ordinance is included as a part of this
Ordinance as fully as if restated in
this Ordinance. Words and terms not
otherwise defined in this Ordinance
shall have the same meaning as set
forth in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their faces
the purpose for which they are
issued and that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to
Section 4 of the General Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be authenticated by the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee (as
defined therein). The Bonds shall be
signed by the City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor and by the City’s Director of Finance or Acting Director of
Finance; provided, however, that in
accordance with Section 9.96 of the
Code and the foregoing requirement
that each Bond bear the manual signature of an authorized officer of
the Trustee, either or both of the
signatures of the City’s Mayor or
Acting Mayor or of its Director of
Finance
or
Acting
Director
of
Finance may be a facsimile. The
Bonds shall bear the seal of the
City, which seal may be a facsimile
seal. Pursuant to Section 83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
or Acting Director of Law shall prepare the Bonds and shall endorse
thereon his or her approval of the
form and correctness thereof by his
or her manual or facsimile signature.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating agent, bond registrar, transfer
agent and paying agent for the
Bonds (the “Registrar”); provided
that the Escrow Agent shall also act
as paying agent for the Bonds so
long as the Bonds are held in a book
entry
system.
The
Director
of
Finance shall sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
the Registrar Agreement among the
City, the Registrar and the Escrow
Agent (the “Agreement”) in substantially the form as is now on file

124
with the Clerk of Council in File No.
1305-04-A. The Agreement is approved, together with any changes
or amendments that are not inconsistent with this ordinance and not
substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Agreement or amendments to the
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Agreement from the
proceeds of the Bonds to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided
in this Section (the “Bond Register”). Subject to the provisions of
Section 5, the person in whose name
a Bond is registered on the Bond
Register shall be regarded as the
absolute owner of that Bond for all
purposes of this ordinance. Payment
of or on account of the debt charges
on any Bond shall be made only to
or upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Bond at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner
or
by
a
person
legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of
this ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City

The City Record
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Bonds
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Bonds surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and the
principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized: (i) the
Bonds may be issued in the form of
a single, fully registered Bond representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the beneficial
owners in book entry form shall
have no right to receive Bonds in
the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for
transfer to another Depository or to
another nominee of a Depository,
without further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the benefi-

1698

August 18, 2004
cial owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Bonds from the Depository,
and the Trustee and Registrar shall
authenticate and deliver bond certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking
Fund and, if not purchased by them,
shall be offered to the Treasury
Investment Account for purchase
and, if not purchased for that
Account, shall be sold to A.G.
Edwards & Sons, Inc. and SBKBrooks Investment Corp. (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”).
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance, the written advice
of either Government Capital Management, LLC or Columbia Equity
Financial Corporation or both (the
“Financial Advisor”), and the Original Purchaser’s offer to purchase
the Bonds, including: the principal
amount of the Bonds, final purchase
price (which shall be not less than
97% of the principal amount plus
accrued interest to their date of
delivery), interest rate or rates, the
amounts and years in which principal installments are payable (at
stated
maturity
or
pursuant
to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements), the Interest
Payment Dates and the date of the
Bonds (if different from those set
forth in Section 2) and any other
matters required in this Ordinance
to be set forth in that Certificate.
The Mayor, Director of Finance,
Director of Law and other appropriate officers of the City are, and each
of them is, authorized and directed
to take such actions as are necessary, appropriate and in the best
interest of the City to establish the
terms and requirements for delivery
of the Bonds and to make such
arrangements as are necessary with
the Original Purchaser in order to
establish the date, location, and procedure, and conditions for the delivery of the Bonds to the Original Purchaser,
to
give
all
appropriate
notices and certificates, to cause a
true transcript of proceedings with
reference to the issuance of the
Bonds to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Mayor and the Director
of Finance are, and each of them is

August 18, 2004
further authorized and directed to
sign and deliver on behalf of the
City a bond purchase agreement
(the “Bond Purchase Agreement”),
approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, between the
City and the Original Purchaser setting forth the terms and conditions
on which the City agrees to sell the
Bonds and the Original Purchaser
agrees to buy the Bonds on terms
consistent with this Ordinance. The
Bond
Purchase
Agreement
is
approved substantially in the form
now on the file with the Clerk of
Council in the File referenced in
Section 3, together with any changes
or amendments that are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and not
substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Bond
Purchase
Agreement
or
amendments to the Bond Purchase
Agreement. It is determined that the
terms of the Bonds, as provided in
this Ordinance and as may be provided in or pursuant to the Certificate of Award, are in the best interest of the City and in compliance
with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an
Official Statement is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
original issuance of the Bonds, those
officers in their official capacities
are authorized to prepare or cause
to be prepared on behalf of the City
an Official Statement and any necessary supplements and to authorize
the use and distribution of that Official Statement and any supplements.
Each of those officers is authorized
to sign on behalf of the City and in
his or her official capacity, that
Official Statement and any supplements approved by such officer.
Those officers are and each of them
is authorized to sign and deliver, on
behalf of the City and in their official capacities, such certificates in
connection with the accuracy of the
Official Statement and any supplements as may, in their judgment, be
necessary or appropriate. Those officers are also authorized to determine and certify on behalf of the
City that such disclosure document
is “deemed final” by the City within the meaning of Securities and
Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12
(the “SEC Rule”). The Director of
Finance is authorized to contract for
services for the production and distribution of preliminary and final
official statements, including by
printed and electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under, the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
and directed to prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall con-

The City Record
stitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Bonds in accordance
with the SEC Rule. The performance
of that Agreement shall be subject
to the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of the
occurrence of any other events, the
Director of Finance shall consult
with, as appropriate, the Financial
Advisor and legal counsel.
Pursuant
to
Section
133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds
with other bonds into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of their sale as a single issue to
be designated “Various Purpose General Obligation Bonds, Series 2004”
or such other designation as may be
set forth in the Certificate of Award.
Such bonds shall contain a summary statement of purposes encompassing the purpose for which the
Bonds are issued and shall state
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds
promptly when and as the same
falls due, and also to provide for the
discharge of the Bonds at maturity,
there shall be and is levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes, a direct
tax annually during the period the
Bonds
are
outstanding,
in
an
amount sufficient to provide for the
payment of that interest, when and
as the same shall fall due, and also
to discharge the principal of the
Bonds at maturity, which tax shall
not be less than the interest and
sinking fund tax required by Section
11 of Article XII of the Constitution
of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is ordered
computed,
certified,
levied
and
extended upon the tax duplicate and
collected by the same officers, in the
same manner and at the same time
that taxes for general purposes for
each of those years are certified,
extended and collected. The tax
shall be placed before and in preference to all other items and for the
full amount thereof. The funds
derived from those tax levies shall
be placed in the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund as required by the
General Bond Ordinance, and those
funds, together with the interest collected on them shall be irrevocably
pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds
when and as the same fall due; provided, however, that, subject to the
provisions of Section 8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in each year to
the extent that revenues are available from other sources for the payment of the Bonds and are appropriated for such purpose, the amount
of such tax shall be reduced by the
amount of such revenues so available and appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under

1699

125
Sections 133.25(B)(1) and 5705.51 of
the Revised Code, and in accordance
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the
General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt
charges for the Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended and applied for the objects
and purposes for which the Bonds
are issued. Accrued interest and any
premium received from the sale of
the Bonds shall be deposited in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund to be
applied to the payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds.
Section 7. General Obligation. The
Bonds are secured by a pledge and
lien on a parity with the pledges
and liens authorized by the General
Bond Ordinance and, in addition to
the taxes and revenues specifically
pledged pursuant to this Ordinance
and the General Bond Ordinance and
the other covenants, terms and
agreements provided hereunder and
in the General Bond Ordinance to
secure payment of the principal of
and interest on the Bonds, the City
hereby determines, declares, warrants and covenants that the Bonds
are general obligations of the City
and that the full faith and credit of
the City are hereby pledged for the
payment of the principal of and
interest on the Bonds in accordance
with the laws and Constitution of
the State of Ohio, this Ordinance and
the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid
and discharged all the outstanding
Bonds, or there shall otherwise be
paid to the holders of the outstanding Bonds all debt charges due or
to become due thereon, and provision shall also be made for paying
all other sums payable hereunder,
then and in that event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of further
effect, and the covenants, agreements and other obligations of the
City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the
request of the City execute and
deliver to the City such instruments
in writing as shall discharge the
lien hereof and enter on the record
such discharge of the lien and such
other instruments as may be reasonably required by the City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if:
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or sub-accounts, in trust for and
irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold
in special accounts or sub-accounts,
in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations
of the United States certified by an
independent public accounting firm
of national reputation to be of such
maturities and interest payment
dates and to bear such interest,
without further investment or reinvestment of either the principal
amount thereof or the interest earn-

126
ings therefrom (likewise to be held
in trust and committed, except as
hereinafter provided), as will be sufficient,
together
with
moneys
referred to in (i) above, for the payment, at their maturities or redemption dates, of all debt charges on the
Bonds to their date of maturity or
redemption, as the case may be, or
if default in such payment shall
have occurred on such date then to
the date of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds
are to be redeemed prior to the
maturity thereof, notice of such
redemption shall have been duly
given or irrevocable provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall have
been duly made for the giving of
such notice. Any moneys held by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with
the provisions of this Section shall
be invested by the Escrow Agent in
direct obligations of the United
States of America maturing, or
redeemable at the option of the holder, at times and in amounts sufficient to meet payment of debt
charges on the Bonds, as directed by
the Director of Finance. Any income
or interest earned by, or increment
to, the investments held under this
Section shall, to the extent determined from time to time by the
Escrow Agent to be in excess of the
amount required to be held by it for
the purposes of this Section, be
transferred at the time of such
determination as provided in Section
17(a) of the General Bond Ordinance
for unclaimed funds held by a Paying Agent. In the event of nonpresentment of any Bond as described
in Section 17(a) of the General Bond
Ordinance, the moneys held pursuant to this Section shall be held
and paid as provided in said Section
17(a) for unclaimed funds held by a
Paying Agent.
Section 9. Bond Anticipation Notes.
For the purpose of raising money in
anticipation of the issuance of the
Bonds for the purposes set forth in
Section 1 hereof, notes of the City
may be issued in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed Fourteen
Million One Hundred Forty Thousand
Dollars
($14,140,000)
(the
“Notes”) upon the direction of the
Director of Finance to be set forth
in a certificate providing for the
final terms of the Notes and the sale
of the Notes and signed by the
Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate of Award”).
Section 10. Term of the Notes. The
Notes: shall bear interest at such
rate, not exceeding five percent
(5%) per year, as may be fixed by
the Director of Finance of the City
in the Note Certificate of Award;
shall
be
dated
their
date
of
issuance; shall mature on the date
set forth in the Note Certificate of
Award, which shall be no later than
five (5) years from such date of
issuance; shall be subject to redemption by the City at any time prior
to maturity without penalty, provided that, if the Director of Finance,
based on the advice of the financial
advisor of the City, determines that
it is in the best interest of the City
in order to enhance the marketability of the Notes, the Director of
Finance may cause the Notes to not
be redeemable for a period which
ends no later than the date which is
two (2) years following the date of
issuance of the Notes; shall be designated
“Bridges
and
Roadways
Improvement
Bond
Anticipation
Notes, Series 2004”; shall be issued
in such numbers and denominations

The City Record
as may be requested by the Note
Purchaser
(hereinafter
defined);
and shall be issued in fully registered form (which may be in a book
entry only system) in denominations
of $5,000 or integral multiples thereof. Interest shall be payable semiannually on the dates set forth in
the Note Certificate of Award; provided that if the Notes mature on or
before the end of the twelfth (12th)
month
following
their
date
of
issuance, interest on the Notes shall
be payable at maturity.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating agent, registrar, transfer agent
and paying agent for the Notes (the
“Note Registrar”); provided that the
Escrow Agent also shall act as paying agent for the Notes so long as
the Notes are held in a book entry
system. The Director of Finance
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, an agreement among the City, the Note Registrar and the Escrow Agent (the
“Note Registrar Agreement”) providing for services relating to the registration, transfer, exchange and
payment of Notes. The Director of
Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and
for
reimbursement
of
expenses
incurred pursuant to the Note Registrar Agreement from the proceeds
of the Notes to the extent available
and then from other money lawfully available and appropriated or to
be appropriated for that purpose.
So long as any of the Notes
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Note Registrar to maintain and keep at its principal corporate trust office all books and
records necessary for the registration, exchange and transfer of Notes
as provided in this Section (the
“Note Register”). Subject to the provisions of Section 5, the person in
whose name a Note is registered on
the Note Register shall be regarded
as the absolute owner of that Note
for all purposes of this ordinance.
Payment of or on account of the
debt charges on any Note shall be
made only to or upon the order of
that person; neither the City nor the
Note Registrar shall be affected by
any notice to the contrary, but the
registration may be changed as provided in this Section. All such payments shall be valid and effectual
to satisfy and discharge the City’s
liability upon the Note, including
interest, to the extent of the amount
or amounts so paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for
Notes of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Note Registrar, together with a request for exchange
signed by the registered owner or
by a person legally empowered to do
so in a form satisfactory to the Note
Registrar. A Note may be transferred only on the Note Register
upon presentation and surrender of
the Note at the principal corporate
trust office of the Note Registrar
together with an assignment signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Note Registrar. Upon exchange or transfer
the Note Registrar shall complete,
authenticate and deliver a new Note
or Notes of any authorized denomination or denominations requested
by the owner equal in the aggregate
to the unmatured principal amount

1700

August 18, 2004
of the Note surrendered and bearing
interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Note Registrar shall undertake the exchange
or transfer of Notes only after the
new Notes are signed by the authorized officers of the City. In all
cases of Notes exchanged or transferred, the City shall sign and the
Note Registrar shall authenticate
and deliver Notes in accordance
with the provisions of this Ordinance. The exchange or transfer
shall be without charge to the
owner, except that the City and Note
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Note Registrar may require
that those charges, if any, be paid
before the procedure is begun for
the exchange or transfer. All Notes
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Notes surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Pursuant
to
Section
133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Notes
with other bond anticipation notes
of the City into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of
their sale as a single issue to be
designated “Various Purpose General
Obligation
Bond
Anticipation
Notes, Series 2004”. The Notes shall
contain a summary statement of
purposes encompassing the purpose
for which the Notes are issued and
shall state that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 11. Execution and Payment of the Notes. The Notes shall
be executed by the Director of
Finance and the Mayor, provided
that one of such signatures may be
a facsimile. Such Notes shall express
upon their face the purpose for
which they are issued and that they
are issued pursuant to this ordinance, and may be payable in Federal Reserve funds of the United
States of America if requested by
the Note Purchaser.
Section 12. Sale of the Notes. The
Notes shall be sold at private sale
to the Note Purchaser by the Director of Finance in the principal
amount set forth in a certificate of
award to be executed by the Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate
of Award”) at not less than par and
accrued interest and at a rate not
exceeding that set forth in Section
10 hereof. The Notes shall be sold to
A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc. and SBKBrooks Investment Corp. (collectively, the “Note Purchaser”). The proceeds of such sale shall be paid into
the proper fund and used for the
purpose for which the Notes are
being issued under the provisions of
this Ordinance.
Section 13. Security for the Notes.
The Notes shall be the full general
obligations of the City, and the full
faith, credit and revenue of the City
are hereby pledged for the prompt
payment of the same. The par value
to be received from the sale of the
Bonds and any excess funds resulting from the issuance of the Notes
shall, to the extent necessary, be
used for the retirement of the Notes
at maturity, together with the interest thereon, and are hereby pledged
for such purpose.

Section 14. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. During the year
or years while the Notes are outstanding there shall be levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes but within tax limitations, a direct tax annually not less than that which would
have been levied if bonds had been
issued therefor without the prior
issue of the Notes. That tax shall be
and is ordered computed, certified,
levied and extended upon the tax
duplicate and collected by the same
officers, in the same manner and at
the same time that taxes for general purposes for each year are certified, extended and collected. That
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from the tax levies required
by this Ordinance shall be placed in
the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account, and those funds,
together with the interest collected
on
them,
shall
be
irrevocably
pledged for the payment of the principal and interest of the Notes or the
Bonds in anticipation of which they
are issued, when and as the same
falls due; provided, however, that in
each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the Notes
and Bonds and are appropriated for
such purpose, the amount of such
direct tax upon all of the taxable
property in the City may be reduced
by the amount of such revenues so
available and appropriated.
Section 15. Preparation of Disclosure Document for the Notes. The
Director of Finance is hereby authorized to prepare, execute and deliver to the Note Purchaser, to the
extent required by law, a preliminary and final Official Statement or
any other appropriate disclosure
document of the City in accordance
with the sale and delivery of the

document “final” for purposes of
SEC Rule 15c2-12.

herein of the provisions of the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) and the
third paragraph of Section 4 of the

private activity bonds, arbitrage
bonds or hedge bonds under Sections
141, 148 or 149 of the Internal Rev-

enue Code of 1986, as amended (the

item of tax preference under Section
57 of the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the Notes
and the Bonds to be and to remain
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will
not take or authorize to be taken
any actions that would adversely
affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or
persons acting for it, will, among
other acts of compliance, (i) apply
the proceeds of the Notes and the
Bonds to the governmental purpose
of the borrowing, (ii) restrict the
yield
on
investment
property
acquired with those proceeds, (iii)
make timely and adequate payments
to the federal government, (iv)

Each covenant made in this section with respect to the Notes and
the Bonds is also made with respect
to all issues any portion of the debt
service on which is paid from proceeds of the Notes or the Bonds

assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose, reducing the
burden or expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or
payments or penalties, or making
payments of special amounts in lieu
of making computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as
rebate, or obviating those amounts
or payments, as determined by that
officer, which action shall be in
writing and signed by the officer,
(b) to take any and all other
actions, make or obtain calculations,
make payments, and make or give
reports, covenants and certifications

relevant to the tax treatment of the
interest on and the tax status of the
Notes and the Bonds.

in the best interest of the City to,
and the City shall, issue the Series
2004 Bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $20,000,000
for the purpose of providing the
funds necessary for the Project. The
final aggregate principal amount of
the Series 2004 Bonds will be determined in the Certificate of Award as
provided in Section 6.
Section 3. Terms of Series 2004
Bonds. The Series 2004 Bonds shall
be dated the date of issuance or
such other date as is designated in
the Certificate of Award. The Series
2004 Bonds shall mature on the
dates and in the respective principal
amounts to be determined by the
Director of Finance in the Certificate of Award in accordance with
his determination of the best interest of, and financial advantages to,
the City; provided that the final
maturity date shall be not later than
30 years from the date of issuance
of the Series 2004 Bonds. The Series
2004 Bonds shall bear interest from
their date at the rate or rates per
year set forth in the Certificate of
Award, or if any Series 2004 Bonds
bear interest at a variable rate, at
the rate determined pursuant to the
Trust Indenture and the Certificate
of Award. Interest on the Series 2004
Bonds shall be payable on the dates
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance in the Certificate of Award,
and the Series 2004 Bonds shall bear
interest at those rates until the principal amount of the Series 2004
Bonds is paid or payment is provided for. If any Series 2004 Bonds bear
interest at a fixed rate, that rate
shall not exceed eight percent (8%)

a 360-day year consisting of twelve
30-day months) and interest shall be
payable not more often than every
six months and at maturity or at
any earlier redemption date. If any

date.
The Series 2004 Bonds may be

may be issued at the same or different times. The Series 2004 Bonds
of each series shall be designated as
provided in the applicable Certificate of Award. A separate Certificate of Award may be delivered for
each Series.
In the event that the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, determines that the City’s best interests will be served by causing all
or a portion of the Series 2004
Bonds to be obligations bearing
interest
at
variable
rates,
redeemable
by
the
City
without
penalty or premium on interest
adjustment dates, then the Director
of Finance is authorized to so specify in the Certificate of Award. If
the Director of Finance so determines, then the Director of Finance
shall specify in the Certificate of
Award the method and procedure
by which the variable rate of inter-

1703

129
est to be borne by the variable rate
Series 2004 Bonds shall be determined, whether by reference to a
market index, by a remarketing
agent or otherwise; provided that
the variable rate Series 2004 Bonds
shall not bear interest at a rate in
excess of sixteen percent (16%) per
year. Notwithstanding that limitation, Series 2004 Bonds held by a
provider of a Credit Support Instrument may bear interest at a rate
not in excess of twenty-five percent
(25%) per year as provided in the
agreement with the provider of the
Credit Support Instrument. Holders
of variable rate Series 2004 Bonds
may be given the right to tender
their
variable
rate
Series
2004
Bonds for purchase by the City at
the times, on the terms, and subject
to the conditions set forth in the
Certificate of Award and any tender agreement; provided that tender
rights shall be exercisable only at
such times as a Credit Support
Instrument is in place that provides
for the payment of the purchase
price payable to the tendering holder of a variable rate Bond. If the
Director of Finance designates any
Series 2004 Bonds as variable rate
Series 2004 Bonds, and if the holders of the variable rate Series 2004
Bonds are to be entitled to tender
the variable rate Series 2004 Bonds
for purchase, then the Director of
Finance shall also designate in the
Certificate of Award for those variable rate Series 2004 Bonds the
provider or providers for any Credit Support Instrument, the tender
agent or agents and the remarketing agent or agents, which designations shall be based on the determination of the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the parties
so designated possess the requisite
resources and experience to provide
the services required of them and
that the terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide such services are fair and commercially reasonable. The Director
of Finance is authorized to enter
into agreements in connection with
the delivery of the variable rate
Series 2004 Bonds, and from time to
time thereafter so long as the variable rate Series 2004 Bonds are outstanding, with providers of Credit
Support Instruments, tender agents
(which may be the Trustee), remarketing agents, and others as may
be determined by the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
necessary or appropriate to provide
for the method of determining the
variable interest rates, permitting
holders the right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support
for the payment of the variable rate
Series 2004 Bonds upon tender for
purchase or redemption, and providing for the repayment by the
City of any amounts drawn under
the Credit Support Instrument.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of
the Series 2004 Bonds, and regardless of the Series 2004 Bonds bearing interest at variable or fixed
rates, is authorized to contract for
one or more Credit Support Instruments, and to pay their costs from
proceeds of the Series 2004 Bonds, if
he determines that the Credit Support Instrument or Instruments will
result in a savings in the cost of
this financing to the City, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor.

130
The Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, shall further determine and
specify in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Series 2004
Bonds
are
subject
to
optional
redemption prior to maturity, the
earliest date on which redeemable
Series 2004 Bonds shall be subject to
prior redemption, which shall not be
later than ten years from the first
interest payment date, and the
applicable redemption premium for
the redeemable Series 2004 Bonds,
which shall be not greater than
103%
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed.
Section 4. Registration, Transfer
and Exchange. The Series 2004
Bonds shall be issued only as fully
registered Series 2004 Bonds. The
Trustee shall act as the authenticating
agent,
registrar,
transfer
agent, and paying agent for the
Series 2004 Bonds, except as otherwise provided in the Trust Indenture.
Principal of the Series 2004 Bonds
shall be payable when due upon presentation
and
surrender
of
the
Series 2004 Bonds at the office of
the Trustee designated in the Trust
Indenture. Interest on each Bond
shall be paid on each interest payment date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing on the
Register (defined below in this Section) at the close of business on the
record date provided in the Trust
Indenture. The Trustee shall maintain and keep all books and records
necessary
for
the
registration,
exchange, and transfer of Series
2004 Bonds as provided in the Trust
Indenture (the “Register”) so long
as any of the Series 2004 Bonds
remain outstanding. Subject to the
provisions in the Trust Indenture,
the person in whose name a Bond is
registered on the Register shall be
regarded as the absolute owner of
that Bond for all purposes of the
Proceedings. Payment of or on
account of the debt charges on any
Bond shall be made only to or upon
the order of that person; neither the
City nor the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary, but
the registration may be changed as
provided in the Trust Indenture. All
such payments shall be valid and
effectual to satisfy and discharge
the City’s liability upon the Bond,
including interest, to the extent of
the amount or amounts so paid.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
and so long as the Series 2004 Bonds
are issued in a book entry system,
principal of and interest on the
Series 2004 Bonds shall be payable
in the manner provided in any
agreement entered into by the Director of Finance, in the name and on
behalf of the City, in connection
with the book entry system.
Series
2004
Bonds
may
be
exchanged for Series 2004 Bonds of
any authorized denomination upon
presentation and surrender at the
office designated by the Trustee,
together
with
a
request
for
exchange signed by the registered
owner
or
by
a
person
legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Trustee.
The Series 2004 Bonds may be
issued to a Depository for use in a
book entry system and, if and as
long as a book entry system is utilized, (i) the Series 2004 Bonds may
be issued in the form of a single,
fully registered Bond representing

The City Record
each maturity and registered in the
name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository; (ii) the book entry interest
owners of Series 2004 Bonds in book
entry form shall have no right to
receive Series 2004 Bonds in the
form of physical securities or certificates; (iii) ownership of book
entry interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
book entry interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Series 2004 Bonds as such shall
not be transferable or exchangeable,
except
for
transfer
to
another
Depository or to another nominee of
a Depository, without further action
by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Series 2004 Bonds for use in
a book entry system, the Director of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Director of Finance, after
making provision for notification of
the book entry interest owners by
the then Depository and any other
arrangements
deemed
necessary,
shall permit withdrawal of the
Series 2004 Bonds from the Depository, and authenticate and deliver
certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance also is
authorized
and
directed
to
the
extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the Series
2004 Bonds, after determining that
the signing thereof will not endanger the funds or securities of the
City and after the approval of the
form of any such agreement by the
Director of Law.
Section 5. Execution of Series 2004
Bonds. Series 2004 Bonds shall be
signed by the Mayor and the Director of Finance, in the name of the
City and in their official capacities,
provided that either or both of those
signatures may be a facsimile, and
shall bear the seal of the City or a
facsimile thereof; provided that no
Bond shall be valid or obligatory for
any purpose or shall be entitled to
any security or benefit under the
Proceedings unless and until the
certificate of authentication printed
on the Bond is signed by the
Trustee as authenticating agent,
and authentication by the Trustee
shall be conclusive evidence that the
Bond so authenticated has been duly
issued, signed and delivered under,
and is entitled to the security and
benefit of, the Proceedings. The certificate of authentication may be
signed by any authorized officer or
employee of the Trustee or by any
other person acting as an agent of
the Trustee and approved by the
Director of Finance on behalf of the
City. The same person need not sign
the certificate of authentication on
all of the Series 2004 Bonds.
Pursuant to Section 83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
shall prepare the Series 2004 Bonds

1704

approval of the form and correctness
thereof by his manual or facsimile
signature. The Series 2004 Bonds
shall be issued in the denominations
as requested by the Original Purchaser and approved by the Director
of Finance, in conformity with this
Ordinance.
The
entire
principal
amount may be represented by a single bond certificate and may be
issued as fully registered securities
and in book entry or other uncertificated form if it is determined by
the
Director
of
Finance
that
issuance of fully registered securities in that form will facilitate the
sale and delivery of the Series 2004
Bonds. The Series 2004 Bonds may
be issued in the authorized denominations of either (a) $100,000 each
or in any denomination that is the
sum of (i) $100,000 and (ii) $5,000 or
any integral multiple thereof, and
not exchangeable for other Series
2004 Bonds in denominations less
than $100,000, or (b) $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, as determined by the Director of Finance in
the Certificate of Award to be in the
best interests of the City. The Series
2004 Bonds shall not have coupons
attached, shall be numbered as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance and shall express upon
their faces the purpose, in summary
terms, for which they are issued and
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 6. Sale of Series 2004
Bonds. The Series 2004 Bonds shall
be sold at not less than 97% of par
plus accrued interest at private sale
by the Director of Finance to the
Original Purchaser in accordance
with law and the provisions of this
Ordinance.
If
the
Director
of
Finance determines, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, that an underwriter is incapable
of fully performing its duties or
meeting its obligations in its capacity as Original Purchaser with
respect to the Series 2004 Bonds, the
Director of Finance is hereby authorized and directed, in the name of
and on behalf of the City, to take
whatever action may be necessary
to
terminate
that
underwriter’s
standing as Original Purchaser. The
Director of Finance shall sign the
Certificate of Award referred to in
this Ordinance, evidencing that sale
to the Original Purchaser, cause the
Series 2004 Bonds to be prepared,
and have the Series 2004 Bonds
signed and delivered, together with
a true transcript of proceedings
with reference to the issuance of the
Series 2004 Bonds if requested by
the Original Purchaser, to the Original Purchaser upon payment of the
purchase price. The Director of
Finance is authorized to sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, a bond purchase agreement between the City and the Original Purchaser, or representative
thereof (the “Purchase Agreement”),
in a form contained in File No. 130604-A and as approved by the Director of Law. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Purchase Agreement
from the proceeds of the Series 2004
Bonds to the extent available and
then from other money lawfully
available and appropriated or to be
appropriated for that purpose. The
Mayor, the Director of Finance, the
Clerk, the Director of Law, and
other City officials, as appropriate,

August 18, 2004
are each authorized and directed to
sign
any
transcript
certificates,
financial statements and other documents and instruments and to take
such actions as are necessary or
appropriate
to
consummate
the
transactions contemplated by this
Ordinance.
Section 7. Security for the Bonds.
The Series 2004 Bonds shall be special obligations of the City, and the
debt charges on the Series 2004
Bonds, as well as the Series 2003
Bonds and any Additional Bonds,
shall be payable solely from the Net
Project Revenues and the Nontax
Revenues. The payment of debt
charges on the Bonds is secured by
the Trust Indenture and by a pledge
of and lien on the Bond Fund held
by the Trustee under the Trust
Indenture. The Bonds are not and
shall not be secured by an obligation or pledge of any money raised
by taxation. The Bonds do not and
shall not represent or constitute a
debt or pledge of the faith and credit or taxing power of the City, and
the owners thereof have and shall
have no right to have taxes levied
by the City for the payment of debt
charges thereon. The Series 2004
Bonds shall contain a statement to
that effect and to the effect that the
Bonds are payable solely from the
Net Project Revenues and the Nontax Revenues and are not secured
by an obligation or pledge of any
money raised by taxation.
The City covenants and agrees
that while the Bonds are outstanding, it will appropriate and maintain
Nontax Revenues at such times and
in such amounts as will be sufficient, together with the Net Project
Revenues and any other funds available for the purpose, to pay the debt
charges on the Bonds and will so
restrict other obligations payable
from Nontax Revenues prior to or on
a parity with the Bonds as will
ensure the continuing availability
for appropriation of sufficient Nontax Revenues to pay debt charges
when due.
In accordance with the Trust
Indenture, there shall be deposited
in the Bond Fund (i) any Net Project Revenues, and (ii) other Nontax
Revenues on or prior to the date
debt charges on the Bonds are due,
in an amount sufficient to pay those
debt charges. There shall be deposited in the Bond Reserve Fund from
the proceeds of the Series 2004
Bonds or a Credit Support Instrument, the amount, if any, determined by the Director of Finance
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, to enhance the
marketability of the Series 2004
Bonds and to enable the City to stabilize its budget against fluctuations in the receipt of Nontax Revenues. Money in the Bond Fund and
Bond Reserve Fund shall be applied
and invested as provided in the
Trust Indenture. Amounts drawn on
the Bond Reserve Fund shall be
restored to the extent, and over the
period of time, provided in the Trust
Indenture.
Section
8.
Payment
of
Debt
Charges on the Series 2004 Bonds.
Nothing herein shall be construed as
requiring the City to use or apply to
the payment of debt charges on the
Series 2004 Bonds any funds or revenues from any source other than
Net Project Revenues and the Nontax
Revenues.
Subject
to
the
requirements of Revised Code Section 176.04, nothing herein, however,
shall be deemed to prohibit the City,

The City Record
of its own volition, from using, to
the extent that it is authorized by
law to do so, any other resources for
the fulfillment of any of the terms,
conditions or obligations of this
Ordinance or of the Series 2004
Bonds.
The City will, solely from the proceeds of the Series 2004 Bonds or
from the Net Project Revenues or
the Nontax Revenues, pay or cause
to be paid the debt charges on the
Series 2004 Bonds on the dates, at
the places and in the manner provided herein and in the Series 2004
Bonds. For that purpose, in each
year while the Bonds are outstanding, this Council, after providing for
the
payment
of
debt
charges
payable on the City’s general obligation securities in that year from
sources available for that purpose,
will appropriate Nontax Revenues
required to pay, and for the purpose
of paying, the debt charges due in
that year on the Bonds (less other
money available for the purpose)
and any outstanding parity obligations payable from Nontax Revenues. Further, this Council will
give effect to such appropriations in
all ordinances it passes thereafter in
that year appropriating money for
expenditure and encumbrance and
limit the other appropriations of
Nontax Revenues in that year to the
amount available after deducting
the amount required for the payment of debt charges payable on the
City’s general obligation securities
and to pay those debt charges. The
City covenants that, so long as any
of the Bonds are outstanding, it
shall not issue any additional obligations payable from the Nontax Revenues on a parity with the Bonds
and any outstanding parity obligations payable from Nontax Revenues, unless, prior to passage of
the ordinance authorizing such parity
obligations,
the
Director
of
Finance shall have certified to this
Council that the Nontax Revenues
during the preceding calendar year,
adjusted to reflect, if necessary,
changes in the rates or charges
resulting in the Nontax Revenues,
aggregate in amount not less than
100% of the highest amount of (a)
debt charges on the Bonds and (b)
required payments on such proposed
parity obligations and any outstanding parity obligations due in
any succeeding calendar year.
Each
obligation
of
the
City
required to be undertaken pursuant
to this Ordinance and the Series 2004
Bonds is binding upon the City, and
upon each officer or employee of the
City as may from time to time have
the authority under law to take any
action on behalf of the City as may
be necessary to perform all or any
part of such obligation, as a duty of
the City and of each of those officers and employees resulting from
an office, trust or station within the
meaning of Section 2731.01 of the
Revised Code, providing for enforcement by writ of mandamus.
Section
9.
Supplemental
Trust
Indenture. The City shall enter into
the First Supplement, supplementing
the original Trust Indenture, to further provide for the terms of the
Series 2004 Bonds. The Mayor and
the Director of Finance shall sign
and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of the City, the First Supplement in a form consistent with this
Ordinance and approved by the
Director of Law. The Mayor and the
Director of Finance and other City
officials, as appropriate, are autho-

1705

131
rized to take such actions and sign
and deliver such related instruments
as are necessary or appropriate to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance.
Section 10. Project Fund; Deposit
of Proceeds. The proceeds from the
sale of the Series 2004 Bonds are
appropriated and shall be used for
the purpose for which the Series 2004
Bonds are being issued. There is created by the City, as a separate fund
or account, in the custody and control of the Trustee, a fund designated the “Core City Program Series
2004 Project Fund” (the “Project
Fund”). That Project Fund shall be
maintained separate and apart from
the fund established as the project
fund for the Series 2003 Bonds, and
shall not be subject to any of the
restrictions on the use of the Series
2003 project fund contained in Section 16 of Ordinance No. 1982-02.
Within the Project Fund the City
shall establish as accounts or subaccounts: the Economic Development
Account, the Housing Account and
the Undesignated Account. The proceeds from the sale of the Series 2004
Bonds shall be deposited initially in
the Undesignated Account of the Project Fund. Additional funds, from
whatever source, may be voluntarily
deposited in any account of the Project Fund by the City. Funds in the
Undesignated Account of the Project
Fund may be transferred to the Economic Development Account to pay
costs of a Project, or to make loans
to others to pay costs of that Project,
consistent with Revised Code Chapter 165, following certification of the
Project by the Corporation as being
in accordance with the Economic
Development Plan. Funds in the
Undesignated Account of the Project
Fund may be transferred to the
Housing Account of the Project Fund
to pay costs of a Project for residential housing, or to make grants
or loans to others or subsidies to
loans or otherwise to pay costs of
that Project, upon certification to the
Trustee by the Director of Community Development or the Director of
Finance of the City that the Project
is consistent with the Housing Plan
and was submitted for review to the
Housing Advisory Board, all pursuant to Revised Code 176.04. Money
in the respective accounts of the Project Fund are appropriated for, and
shall be used to pay, costs of Projects consistent with the requirements of this Ordinance. The City
may establish additional accounts or
subaccounts within the Project Fund
as necessary or convenient to ascertain the dates, amounts and sources
of deposits. At such time as disbursements are to be made from the
Project Fund to pay costs of a Project, the City shall direct the Trustee
to transfer amounts in the applicable
account of the Project Fund to the
City for subsequent disbursement by,
or reimbursement to, the City for
Project purposes. Any portion of the
proceeds of the Series 2004 Bonds to
be used to pay interest on the Series
2004 Bonds shall be deposited in a
capitalized interest subaccount of the
Project Fund. Any accrued interest
received from the sale of the Bonds
shall be deposited in the Bond Fund.
Section 11. Disclosure. If, in the
judgment of the Director of Finance,
after consultation with a Financial
Advisor and the Original Purchaser,
an official statement or other disclosure
document
is
appropriate
relating to the initial offering of the
Series 2004 Bonds, the Director of

132
Finance, on behalf of the City and
in that officer’s official capacity, is
authorized to (i) cooperate with the
Original Purchaser in the preparation of, and the making of modifications, completions or changes of
or supplements to, such a disclosure
document, (ii) determine, and to certify or otherwise represent, when
the disclosure document is to be
deemed final or is final, (iii) authorize the use and distribution of that
disclosure document and any supplements thereto in connection with
the initial offering of the Series 2004
Bonds, and (iv) sign certificates,
statements or other documents in
connection with the finality, accuracy, and completeness of that disclosure document. The Director of
Finance is authorized to contract for
services for the production and distribution of preliminary and final
official statements, including by
printed and electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Series 2004 Bonds, the City
agrees, as the only obligated person
with respect to the Series 2004
Bonds under the Rule, to provide or
cause to be provided such financial
information
and
operating
data,
audited financial statements and
notices, in such manner, as may be
required for purposes of paragraph
(b)(5)(i) of the Rule. In order to
describe and specify certain terms
of the City’s continuing disclosure
agreement for that purpose, and
thereby to implement that agreement,
including
provisions
for
enforcement, amendment, and termination, the Director of Finance is
authorized and directed to sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, and if required under
the Rule, a Continuing Disclosure
Certificate or Certificates in conformance with the reporting requirements of the Rule. The agreement
formed, collectively, by this paragraph and that Certificate, shall be
the
City’s
continuing
disclosure
agreement for purposes of the Rule,
and its performance shall be subject
to the annual appropriation of any
funds that may be necessary to perform it. The Director of Finance is
further authorized and directed to
establish procedures in order to
ensure compliance by the City with
its continuing disclosure agreement,
including the timely provision of
information and notices.
Section 12. Ratings, Insurance,
and Other Credit Enhancement. If,
in the judgment of the Director of
Finance, based on written advice of
a Financial Advisor, the filing of an
application for a rating on the
Series 2004 Bonds by one or more
nationally recognized rating agencies or one or more Credit Support
Instruments is in the best interest
of, and financially advantageous to,
the City, the Director of Finance is
authorized to prepare and submit
those applications, to provide to
each such agency, company or credit provider such information as may
be required for the purpose. The
cost of obtaining each rating and
each
Credit
Support
Instrument,
except to the extent paid by the
Original Purchaser in accordance
with the Purchase Agreement, shall
be paid from the proceeds of the
Series 2004 Bonds.
Section 13. Interest Rate Hedges
and Other Arrangements. For the
purpose of achieving the optimal
available debt structure for the
Series 2004 Bonds, the Director of

The City Record
Finance may, based on the written
advice of a Financial Advisor, enter
into one or more agreements in
anticipation of, in connection with
or subsequent to the issuance of the
Series 2004 Bonds for an interest
rate swap, an interest rate cap or
other arrangements to lower the
effective interest rate on the obligations of the City or to hedge the
exposure of the City against fluctuations in prevailing interest rates or
to optimize the City’s cash flow, provided, however, that: (i) the counterparty to any such agreement or
arrangement shall have a rating of
at least “A” by either Moody’s
Investors Service, Inc., or Standard
& Poor’s Corporation; (ii) no such
agreement or arrangement shall
purport to entitle the counterparty
or provider to payment by the City
from any source other than the
sources of payment for the Series
2004 Bonds as described in this Ordinance; (iii) the terms of the agreements or arrangements shall have
been determined by the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, to be
justified by the corresponding benefit to the City and to be commercially reasonable based on then current market conditions.
Section 14. Prevailing Rates of
Wages. As provided in Revised Code
Section 165.031, all wages paid to
laborers and mechanics employed on
a Project funded from the Economic Development Account of the Project Fund shall be paid at not less
than the prevailing rates of wages
for laborers and mechanics for each
class of work called for by the Project, which wages shall be determined
in
accordance
with
the
requirements of Chapter 4115 of the
Ohio Revised Code, for determination of prevailing wage rates; provided that the requirements of this
Section shall not apply where the
federal government or any of its
agencies furnished or furnishes by
loan or grant all or any part of the
funds used or to be used in connection with the Project and prescribed
or prescribes predetermined minimum wages to be paid to such laborers and mechanics; and provided further that, if a nonpublic user beneficiary undertakes, as a part of the
Project, construction to be performed by its regular bargaining
unit employees who are covered by
a collective bargaining agreement
that was in existence prior to the
date of adoption of this Ordinance,
the rate of pay provided under the
applicable
collective
bargaining
agreement may be paid to such
employees. If and to the extent
required by Revised Code Section
176.05, all wages paid to laborers
and mechanics employed on a Project
funded
from
the
Housing
Account of the Project Fund shall
be paid at not less than the residential prevailing rate of wages for
laborers and mechanics for each
class of work called for by the Project, which wages shall be determined as provided in Section 176.05.

Passed August 11, 2004.
Effective August 17, 2004.

Ord. No. 1307-04.
By Council Member Jackson (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance providing for the issuance and sale of
bonds in the maximum principal
amount of $3,110,000 for the purpose
of
providing
funds
to
improve
municipal
parks
and
recreation
facilities; and the issuance of notes
in anticipation of those bonds.
Whereas, this Council desires to
issue bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed Three Million One Hundred Forty Thousand
Dollars ($3,110,000) (the “Bonds”) to
finance the costs of certain perma-

August 18, 2004
nent improvements described in Section 1; and
Whereas, the Director of Finance,
as fiscal officer of the City, has certified to this Council that the estimated life or usefulness of the
improvements to be financed with
the proceeds of the Bonds is at least
five (5) years and the maximum
maturity of the Bonds is twenty (20)
years; and
Whereas, this Council passed Ordinance No. 1749-80 on October 8, 1980,
and thereafter amended that ordinance by Ordinance No. 1112-83,
passed on May 6, 1983, and Ordinance No. 944-96, passed on June 10,
1996 (Ordinance No. 1749-80, as so
amended and as the same may further be amended from time to time
in accordance with its provisions, is
referred to as the “General Bond
Ordinance”), providing the general
terms
and
provisions
for
the
issuance of unvoted general obligations of the City, with the specific
terms of each series of bonds to be
contained in ordinances authorizing
their issuance (the “Series Bond
Ordinances”); and
Whereas, the issuance of the
Bonds is necessary to provide funds
to pay the costs of certain permanent improvements described in Section 1 that are urgently needed for
the benefit of the City, and as a
result, this Ordinance constitutes an
emergency measure providing for
the immediate preservation of the
public peace, property, health and
safety, and for the usual daily operation of a municipal department;
now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Purpose. It is deemed
necessary to issue the Bonds in an
aggregate principal amount not to
exceed Three Million One Hundred
Ten Thousand Dollars ($3,110,000)
for the purpose of providing funds
to improve municipal parks and
recreation facilities by constructing,
reconstructing, rehabilitating, installing, renovating, enlarging and otherwise improving parks and recreation
centers and areas, pools, skating
rinks, greenhouses, bicycle paths,
playgrounds,
playfields,
tracks,
fields and related buildings, structures,
walkways,
pavement
and
facilities, and providing necessary
water systems, drainage, lighting,
signage, fixtures, furnishings, equipment, safety modifications and site
improvements, together with all preliminary associated research, planning and development and all necessary and incidental appurtenances
in all cases, including the acquisition of any required real estate and
interests in real estate and the
demolition of any existing buildings,
structures,
walkways
and
facilities, and to pay any capitalized
interest and all expenses incurred in
connection with the issuance of the
securities, including all financing
costs within the meaning of Section
133.01(K) of the Revised Code and
such other costs of the foregoing
permanent improvements that may
be financed with the proceeds of
securities as permitted by Section
133.15(B) of the Ohio Revised Code
and as otherwise permitted by law;
and to authorize the issuance of
notes in anticipation of the Bonds.
Section 2. Authority and Terms.
The Bonds shall be issued pursuant
to the provisions of Article XVIII of
the Constitution of Ohio, Sections
133.01 to 133.70, inclusive, and other
applicable provisions of the Revised

The City Record
Code, the Charter of the City, the
General Bond Ordinance and this
Ordinance in the principal amount
and for the purpose stated in Section 1. The Bonds shall be designated “Parks and Recreation Facilities
Improvement
Bonds,
Series
2004”. The Bonds shall be issued in
one lot as fully registered Bonds in
denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. The Bonds
shall be numbered as determined by
the Director of Finance.
The Bonds shall be dated as of
October 1, 2004, or such other date,
but in no event later than October
1, 2005, specified in the certificate of
award providing for the final terms
of the Bonds and the sale of the
Bonds signed by the Director of
Finance in accordance with this
Ordinance
(the
“Certificate
of
Award”). The Bonds shall bear
interest at the rate or rates per year
specified
in
the
Certificate
of
Award; provided that if all the
Bonds bear interest at the same rate
per year, then such rate shall not
exceed six percent (6%) per year,
and if the Bonds bear interest at
more than one rate per year, then
the weighted average of such rates
(taking into account the principal
amount and maturity of each Bond
to which a rate applies) shall not
exceed six percent (6%) per year.
Interest on the Bonds shall be
payable, until the principal amount
is paid, semi-annually on June 1 and
December 1 of each year or on the
days specified in the Certificate of
Award as the dates on which interest on the Bonds shall be payable
(the
“Interest
Payment
Dates”),
beginning December 1, 2004 or on
such other Interest Payment Date
specified in the Certificate of Award
as the first Interest Payment Date.
The Bonds shall mature on December 1 in twenty (20) substantially
equal annual installments, beginning December 1, 2005, or according
to the schedule set forth in the Certificate of Award, provided that (i)
each principal payment shall occur
on an Interest Payment Date, (ii)
the first principal payment on the
Bonds shall be no earlier than
December 1, 2004 and no later than
August 1, 2007, (iii) the final maturity date of the Bonds shall be no
later than twenty (20) years from
that date which is twelve months
prior to the first date on which provision for payment of principal is
made, and (iv) the principal amount
thereof shall be payable in annual
installments such that the total principal and interest payments on the
Bonds in any fiscal year in which
principal is payable is not more
than three times the amount of
those payments in any other fiscal
year.
The Bonds stated to mature in
any year may be issued as term
bonds (the “Term Bonds”), payable
pursuant
to
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirements as
defined and further described below.
The Director of Finance shall determine in the Certificate of Award
whether any of the Bonds shall be
issued as Term Bonds, any dates
(the
“Mandatory
Redemption
Dates”) on which the principal
amount of the Term Bonds shall be
payable
pursuant
to
mandatory
sinking fund installments rather
than at stated maturity and the
amount of principal to be paid on
each Mandatory Redemption Date
(the
“Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements”).

1707

133
The Bonds shall be subject to
redemption prior to stated maturity
as follows:
(a)
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption. If any of the Bonds are
issued as Term Bonds, the Term
Bonds shall be subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption and be
redeemed pursuant to Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements, at a redemption price of 100
percent of the principal amount
redeemed, plus interest accrued to
the redemption date, on the Mandatory Redemption Dates.
The aggregate of the moneys to
be deposited with the Escrow Agent,
currently The Huntington National
Bank, for payment of principal of
and interest on any Term Bonds
shall include amounts sufficient to
redeem on the Mandatory Redemption Dates the principal amount of
Term Bonds payable on those dates
pursuant to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Redemption
Requirements
(less the amount of any credit as
provided below).
The City shall have the option to
deliver to the Registrar (as defined
in Section 3) for cancellation Term
Bonds in any aggregate principal
amount and to receive a credit
against the then current Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory
redemption obligation) of the City
for any Term Bonds. That option
shall be exercised by the City on or
before the forty-fifth (45th) day preceding the applicable Mandatory
Redemption Date, by furnishing the
Escrow Agent a certificate, signed
by the Registrar, setting forth the
extent of the credit to be applied
with respect to the then current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement. If the certificate
is not timely furnished to the
Escrow Agent, the Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligation) shall not be
reduced. A credit against the then
current Mandatory Sinking Fund
Redemption Requirement (and corresponding mandatory redemption
obligation) also shall be received by
the City for any Term Bonds which
prior thereto have been redeemed
(other than through the operation of
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund
Redemption Requirements) or purchased for cancellation and canceled
by the Registrar, to the extent not
applied
theretofore
as
a
credit
against any mandatory redemption
obligation.
Each Term Bond so delivered, or
previously redeemed, or purchased
and canceled, shall be credited by
the Escrow Agent at 100 percent of
the principal amount thereof against
the then current Mandatory Sinking
Fund Redemption Requirement (and
corresponding mandatory redemption obligation). Any excess of that
amount
over
the
then
current
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirement shall be credited
against subsequent Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements
(and
corresponding
mandatory
redemption obligations) in the order
directed by the Director of Finance.
(b)
Optional
Redemption.
The
Bonds may be subject to redemption
prior to maturity by and at the
option of the City, in whole or in
part on any date, in integral multiples
of
$5,000,
at
the
optional
redemption dates and at the redemption prices (expressed as a percentage
of
the
principal
amount

134
redeemed) specified in the Certificate of Award, plus, in each case,
accrued interest to the redemption
date, provided the first optional
redemption date shall not be later
than December 1, 2014 and the highest redemption price shall not be
greater than 102%. The Director of
Finance may determine in the Certificate of Award that it is in the
best interests of the City for the
Bonds not to be callable prior to
their stated maturity.
If optional redemption at a price
exceeding 100% of the principal
amount to be redeemed is to take
place as of any applicable Mandatory Redemption Date, the Bonds, or
portions thereof, to be redeemed
optionally shall be selected by lot
prior to the selection by lot of the
Bonds to be redeemed on the same
date by operation of the Mandatory
Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements of paragraph (a). The Bonds
shall be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph only upon written notice
from the Director of Finance to the
Registrar, given upon the direction
of the Council of the City by passage of an ordinance. That notice
shall specify the redemption date
and the principal amount of each
maturity of Bonds to be redeemed,
and shall be given at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the redemption
date or such shorter period as shall
be acceptable to the Registrar.
There shall be deposited with the
Registrar on or prior to the redemption date funds sufficient to redeem
at the redemption price all of the
redeemable Bonds for which notice
of redemption has been given.
(c) Partial Redemption. If fewer
than all of the outstanding Bonds
are called for redemption at one
time, they shall be called in the
order of maturities directed by the
Director of Finance. If fewer than
all Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Bonds to be redeemed, or portions
thereof in amounts of $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, shall be
made by the Registrar by lot in a
manner determined by the Registrar. In the case of a partial redemption of Bonds by lot when Bonds of
denominations greater than $5,000
are then outstanding, each $5,000
unit of principal thereof shall be
treated as though it were a separate
Bond of the denomination of $5,000.
If it is determined that one or more,
but not all of the $5,000 units of
principal amount represented by a
Bond are to be called for redemption, then upon notice of redemption
of a $5,000 unit or units, the registered owner of that Bond shall surrender the Bond to the Registrar (i)
for payment of the redemption price
of the $5,000 unit or units called for
redemption (including, without limitation, the interest accrued to the
date fixed for redemption and any
premium), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner thereof, of a new Bond or
Bonds of any authorized denomination or denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unmatured and unredeemed portion
of, and bearing interest at the same
rate and maturing on the same date
as, the Bond surrendered.
(d) Notice of Redemption. The
notice of the call for redemption of
Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers or other distinguishing marks, the Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, (ii)
the redemption price to be paid, (iii)

The City Record
the date fixed for redemption, and
(iv) the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed
for redemption, to the registered
owner of each Bond subject to
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Bond Register maintained by the Registrar at the close
of business on the fifteenth day preceding that mailing and to any
municipal bond insurance company
that has issued a policy insuring
some or all of the Bonds. Failure to
receive notice by mail or any defect
in that notice regarding any Bond,
however, shall not affect the validity
of
the
proceedings
for
the
redemption of any Bond.
(e) Payment of Redeemed Bonds.
Notice having been mailed in the
manner provided in the preceding
paragraph, the Bonds and portions
thereof called for redemption shall
become due and payable on the
redemption date, and, upon presentation and surrender at the place or
places specified in that notice, shall
be paid. If money for the redemption of all of the Bonds and portions
thereof to be redeemed, including
interest accrued to the redemption
date, is held by the Registrar on the
redemption date, and, if notice of
redemption has been deposited in
the mail, then from and after the
redemption date those Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall cease to bear interest and
no longer shall be considered to be
outstanding. If that money shall not
be so available on the redemption
date, or that notice shall not have
been deposited in the mail, those
Bonds and portions thereof shall
continue to bear interest, until they
are paid, at the same rate as they
would have borne had they not been
called for redemption. All money
held
by
the
Registrar
for
the
redemption of particular Bonds shall
be held in trust for the account of
the registered owners and shall be
paid to them, respectively, upon presentation and surrender of those
Bonds.
The debt charges on the Bonds
shall be payable in lawful money of
the United States of America without deduction for the services of the
Registrar or Escrow Agent as paying
agent.
Principal
shall
be
payable when due upon presentation
and surrender of the Bonds at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar. Interest on a Bond
shall be paid on each Interest Payment Date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Bond was registered, and to that
person’s address appearing, on the
Bond Register (as defined in Section
3) at the close of business on the
date provided in the Agreement
authorized in Section 3 (the “Record
Date”). Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the General Bond
Ordinance, so long as the Bonds are
held by a Depository in a book entry
system (as described in Section 3),
debt charges on the Bonds will be
payable in lawful money of the United States by wire transfer to the
Depository made by the Escrow
Agent on each Interest Payment
Date.
This Series Bond Ordinance is
enacted pursuant to the General

1708

August 18, 2004
Bond Ordinance. The General Bond
Ordinance, except for the third paragraph of Section 13(a) (pertaining
generally to an adjustment of the
interest rate in an event of default)
and the third paragraph of Section
4 (pertaining generally to the periods during which the City is not
required to make any transfers or
exchanges of bonds issued under the
General Bond Ordinance), will not
apply to the Bonds. Except for those
provisions, the General Bond Ordinance is included as a part of this
Ordinance as fully as if restated in
this Ordinance. Words and terms not
otherwise defined in this Ordinance
shall have the same meaning as set
forth in the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 3. Execution, Authentication, Approval and Recording of the
Bonds; Exchange and Transfer of
the Bonds; Paying Agents. The
Bonds shall express upon their faces
the purpose for which they are
issued and that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance. Pursuant to
Section 4 of the General Bond Ordinance, each Bond shall be authenticated by the manual signature of an
authorized officer of the Trustee (as
defined therein). The Bonds shall be
signed by the City’s Mayor or Acting Mayor and by the City’s Director of Finance or Acting Director of
Finance; provided, however, that in
accordance with Section 9.96 of the
Code and the foregoing requirement
that each Bond bear the manual signature of an authorized officer of
the Trustee, either or both of the
signatures of the City’s Mayor or
Acting Mayor or of its Director of
Finance
or
Acting
Director
of
Finance may be a facsimile. The
Bonds shall bear the seal of the
City, which seal may be a facsimile
seal. Pursuant to Section 83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
or Acting Director of Law shall prepare the Bonds and shall endorse
thereon his or her approval of the
form and correctness thereof by his
or her manual or facsimile signature.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating agent, bond registrar, transfer
agent and paying agent for the
Bonds (the “Registrar”); provided
that the Escrow Agent shall also act
as paying agent for the Bonds so
long as the Bonds are held in a book
entry
system.
The
Director
of
Finance shall sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
the Registrar Agreement among the
City, the Registrar and the Escrow
Agent (the “Agreement”) in substantially the form as is now on file
with the Clerk of Council in File No.
1307-04-A.
The
Agreement
is
approved,
together
with
any
changes or amendments that are not
inconsistent with this ordinance and
not substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing of the
Agreement or amendments to the
Agreement. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the
services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Agreement from the
proceeds of the Bonds to the extent
available
and
then
from
other
money lawfully available and appropriated or to be appropriated for
that purpose.
So long as any of the Bonds
remain outstanding, the City will

August 18, 2004
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep at its principal corporate trust
office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange
and transfer of Bonds as provided
in this Section (the “Bond Register”). Subject to the provisions of
Section 5, the person in whose name
a Bond is registered on the Bond
Register shall be regarded as the
absolute owner of that Bond for all
purposes of this ordinance. Payment
of or on account of the debt charges
on any Bond shall be made only to
or upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Bond, including interest, to the
extent of the amount or amounts so
paid.
Any Bond may be exchanged for
Bonds of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Registrar, together
with a request for exchange signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Registrar.
A Bond may be transferred only on
the Bond Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Bond at the
principal corporate trust office of
the Registrar together with an
assignment signed by the registered
owner
or
by
a
person
legally
empowered to do so in a form satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
exchange or transfer the Registrar
shall complete, authenticate and
deliver a new Bond or Bonds of any
authorized denomination or denominations requested by the owner
equal in the aggregate to the unmatured principal amount of the Bond
surrendered and bearing interest at
the same rate and maturing on the
same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Bonds only after the new
Bonds are signed by the authorized
officers of the City. In all cases of
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds
in accordance with the provisions of
this ordinance. The exchange or
transfer shall be without charge to
the owner, except that the City and
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Registrar may require that
those charges, if any, be paid before
the procedure is begun for the
exchange or transfer. All Bonds
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Bonds surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Ordinance, if it is determined by the Director of Finance to
be advantageous to the City, the
Bonds may be issued in book entry
form in accordance with the provisions of this Section. As used in this
Section and this Ordinance:
“Book entry form” or “book entry
system” means a form or system
under which (i) the ownership of
beneficial interests in Bonds and the

The City Record
principal of and interest on the
Bonds may be transferred only
through a book entry, and (ii) physical Bond certificates in fully registered form are issued by the City
only to a Depository or its nominee
as registered owner, with the Bonds
“immobilized” in the custody of the
Depository. The book entry maintained by others than the City is the
record that identifies the owners of
beneficial interests in those Bonds
and that principal and interest.
“Depository” means any securities
depository that is a clearing agency
under federal law operating and
maintaining, with its Participants or
otherwise, a book entry system to
record ownership of beneficial interests in Bonds or the principal and
interest, and to effect transfers of
Bonds, in book entry form, and
includes and means initially The
Depository Trust Company (a limited purpose trust company), New
York, New York.
“Participant” means any participant contracting with a Depository
under a book entry system and
includes security brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, and
clearing corporations.
The Bonds may be issued to a
Depository for use in a book entry
system and, if and as long as a book
entry system is utilized: (i) the
Bonds may be issued in the form of
a single, fully registered Bond representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee, as registered owner,
and immobilized in the custody of
the Depository; (ii) the beneficial
owners in book entry form shall
have no right to receive Bonds in
the form of physical securities or
certificates; (iii) ownership of beneficial interests in book entry form
shall be shown by book entry on the
system maintained and operated by
the Depository and its Participants,
and transfers of the ownership of
beneficial interests shall be made
only by book entry by the Depository and its Participants; and (iv)
the Bonds as such shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for
transfer to another Depository or to
another nominee of a Depository,
without further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Bonds for use in a book
entry
system,
the
Director
of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do
so, the Registrar, after making provision for notification of the beneficial owners by the then Depository
and any other arrangements deemed
necessary, shall permit withdrawal
of the Bonds from the Depository,
and the Trustee and Registrar shall
authenticate and deliver bond certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance is also
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the
Bonds, after determining that the
signing thereof will not endanger
the funds or securities of the City
and after the approval of the form

1709

135
of any such agreement by the Director of Law.
Section 4. Sale of Bonds. The
Bonds shall first be offered for purchase to the Trustees of the Sinking
Fund and, if not purchased by them,
shall be offered to the Treasury
Investment Account for purchase
and, if not purchased for that
Account, shall be sold to A.G.
Edwards & Sons, Inc. and SBKBrooks Investment Corp. (collectively, the “Original Purchaser”).
The Bonds shall be awarded to
the Original Purchaser in the Certificate of Award which shall specify the final terms of the Bonds in
accordance with law, the provisions
of this Ordinance, the written advice
of either Government Capital Management, LLC or Columbia Equity
Financial Corporation or both (the
“Financial Advisor”), and the Original Purchaser’s offer to purchase
the Bonds, including: the principal
amount of the Bonds, final purchase
price (which shall be not less than
97% of the principal amount plus
accrued interest to their date of
delivery), interest rate or rates, the
amounts and years in which principal installments are payable (at
stated
maturity
or
pursuant
to
Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption Requirements), the Interest
Payment Dates and the date of the
Bonds (if different from those set
forth in Section 2) and any other
matters required in this Ordinance
to be set forth in that Certificate.
The Mayor, Director of Finance,
Director of Law and other appropriate officers of the City are, and each
of them is, authorized and directed
to take such actions as are necessary, appropriate and in the best
interest of the City to establish the
terms and requirements for delivery
of the Bonds and to make such
arrangements as are necessary with
the Original Purchaser in order to
establish the date, location, and procedure, and conditions for the delivery of the Bonds to the Original Purchaser,
to
give
all
appropriate
notices and certificates, to cause a
true transcript of proceedings with
reference to the issuance of the
Bonds to be delivered to the Original Purchaser, to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance and to take all steps necessary to effect the due execution,
authentication and delivery of the
Bonds. The Mayor and the Director
of Finance are, and each of them is
further authorized and directed to
sign and deliver on behalf of the
City a bond purchase agreement
(the “Bond Purchase Agreement”),
approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, between the
City and the Original Purchaser setting forth the terms and conditions
on which the City agrees to sell the
Bonds and the Original Purchaser
agrees to buy the Bonds on terms
consistent with this Ordinance. The
Bond
Purchase
Agreement
is
approved substantially in the form
now on the file with the Clerk of
Council in the File referenced in
Section 3, together with any changes
or amendments that are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and not
substantially adverse to the City
and that are approved by the Director of Finance on behalf of the City,
all of which shall be conclusively

136
evidenced by the signing of the
Bond
Purchase
Agreement
or
amendments to the Bond Purchase
Agreement. It is determined that the
terms of the Bonds, as provided in
this Ordinance and as may be provided in or pursuant to the Certificate of Award, are in the best interest of the City and in compliance
with all legal requirements.
If, in the judgment of the Mayor
and the Director of Finance, a disclosure document in the form of an
Official Statement is appropriate or
necessary in connection with the
original issuance of the Bonds, those
officers in their official capacities
are authorized to prepare or cause
to be prepared on behalf of the City
an Official Statement and any necessary supplements and to authorize
the use and distribution of that Official Statement and any supplements.
Each of those officers is authorized
to sign on behalf of the City and in
his or her official capacity, that
Official Statement and any supplements approved by such officer.
Those officers are and each of them
is authorized to sign and deliver, on
behalf of the City and in their official capacities, such certificates in
connection with the accuracy of the
Official Statement and any supplements as may, in their judgment, be
necessary or appropriate. Those officers are also authorized to determine and certify on behalf of the
City that such disclosure document
is “deemed final” by the City within the meaning of Securities and
Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12
(the “SEC Rule”). The Director of
Finance is authorized to contract for
services for the production and distribution of preliminary and final
official statements, including by
printed and electronic means.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Bonds, the City agrees, in
accordance with, and as the only
obligated person with respect to the
Bonds under, the SEC Rule, to provide or cause to be provided such
financial information and operating
data and notices, in such manner, as
may be required for purposes of the
SEC Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment
and termination, the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
and directed to prepare, or cause to
be prepared, and to sign and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the
City, a continuing disclosure agreement or certificate, which shall constitute the continuing disclosure
agreement made by the City for the
benefit of the holders and beneficial
owners of the Bonds in accordance
with the SEC Rule. The performance
of that Agreement shall be subject
to the availability of funds and their
annual appropriation to meet costs
the City would be required to incur
to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of the
occurrence of any other events, the
Director of Finance shall consult
with, as appropriate, the Financial
Advisor and legal counsel.

The City Record
Pursuant
to
Section
133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Bonds
with other bonds into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of their sale as a single issue to
be designated “Various Purpose General Obligation Bonds, Series 2004”
or such other designation as may be
set forth in the Certificate of Award.
Such bonds shall contain a summary statement of purposes encompassing the purpose for which the
Bonds are issued and shall state
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 5. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. For the purpose
of providing the necessary funds to
pay the interest on the Bonds
promptly when and as the same
falls due, and also to provide for the
discharge of the Bonds at maturity,
there shall be and is levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes, a direct
tax annually during the period the
Bonds
are
outstanding,
in
an
amount sufficient to provide for the
payment of that interest, when and
as the same shall fall due, and also
to discharge the principal of the
Bonds at maturity, which tax shall
not be less than the interest and
sinking fund tax required by Section
11 of Article XII of the Constitution
of Ohio.
The tax shall be and is ordered
computed,
certified,
levied
and
extended upon the tax duplicate and
collected by the same officers, in the
same manner and at the same time
that taxes for general purposes for
each of those years are certified,
extended and collected. The tax
shall be placed before and in preference to all other items and for the
full amount thereof. The funds
derived from those tax levies shall
be placed in the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account of the
Sinking Fund as required by the
General Bond Ordinance, and those
funds, together with the interest collected on them shall be irrevocably
pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds
when and as the same fall due; provided, however, that, subject to the
provisions of Section 8 of the General Bond Ordinance, in each year to
the extent that revenues are available from other sources for the payment of the Bonds and are appropriated for such purpose, the amount
of such tax shall be reduced by the
amount of such revenues so available and appropriated.
This Council hereby covenants, on
behalf of the City and its officials,
pursuant to the authorization under
Sections 133.25(B)(1) and 5705.51 of
the Revised Code, and in accordance
with the provisions of and to the
extent required or permitted by the
General Bond Ordinance, that the
City will appropriate annually from
the proceeds of the City’s municipal
income taxes an amount as is necessary to meet the annual debt
charges for the Bonds.
Section 6. Application of Proceeds.
The proceeds from the sale of the
Bonds, except for accrued interest
thereon and any premium, shall be
expended and applied for the objects
and purposes for which the Bonds
are issued. Accrued interest and any
premium received from the sale of
the Bonds shall be deposited in the
Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations
Account of the Sinking Fund to be
applied to the payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds.

Section 7. General Obligation. The
Bonds are secured by a pledge and
lien on a parity with the pledges
and liens authorized by the General
Bond Ordinance and, in addition to
the taxes and revenues specifically
pledged pursuant to this Ordinance
and the General Bond Ordinance and
the other covenants, terms and
agreements provided hereunder and
in the General Bond Ordinance to
secure payment of the principal of
and interest on the Bonds, the City
hereby determines, declares, warrants and covenants that the Bonds
are general obligations of the City
and that the full faith and credit of
the City are hereby pledged for the
payment of the principal of and
interest on the Bonds in accordance
with the laws and Constitution of
the State of Ohio, this Ordinance and
the General Bond Ordinance.
Section 8. Defeasance.
(a) Release of Ordinance. If the
City shall pay or cause to be paid
and discharged all the outstanding
Bonds, or there shall otherwise be
paid to the holders of the outstanding Bonds all debt charges due or
to become due thereon, and provision shall also be made for paying
all other sums payable hereunder,
then and in that event this Ordinance (except for Section 8(b) hereof) shall cease to be of further
effect, and the covenants, agreements and other obligations of the
City under this Ordinance shall be
discharged and satisfied, and thereupon the Trustee shall at the
request of the City execute and
deliver to the City such instruments
in writing as shall discharge the
lien hereof and enter on the record
such discharge of the lien and such
other instruments as may be reasonably required by the City.
(b) Payment and Discharge of
Bonds. Outstanding Bonds shall be
deemed to have been paid and discharged within the meaning of this
Ordinance, including without limitation, Section 8(a) hereof, if:
(i) the Escrow Agent or Paying
Agent shall hold in special accounts
or sub-accounts, in trust for and
irrevocably committed solely thereto, sufficient moneys; or
(ii) the Escrow Agent shall hold
in special accounts or sub-accounts,
in trust for and irrevocably committed solely thereto, direct obligations
of the United States certified by an
independent public accounting firm
of national reputation to be of such
maturities and interest payment
dates and to bear such interest,
without further investment or reinvestment of either the principal
amount thereof or the interest earnings therefrom (likewise to be held
in trust and committed, except as
hereinafter provided), as will be sufficient,
together
with
moneys
referred to in (i) above, for the payment, at their maturities or redemption dates, of all debt charges on the
Bonds to their date of maturity or
redemption, as the case may be, or
if default in such payment shall
have occurred on such date then to
the date of the tender of such payment; provided, that if any Bonds
are to be redeemed prior to the
maturity thereof, notice of such
redemption shall have been duly
given or irrevocable provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall have
been duly made for the giving of
such notice. Any moneys held by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with
the provisions of this Section shall
be invested by the Escrow Agent in

August 18, 2004
direct obligations of the United
States of America maturing, or
redeemable at the option of the holder, at times and in amounts sufficient to meet payment of debt
charges on the Bonds, as directed by
the Director of Finance. Any income
or interest earned by, or increment
to, the investments held under this
Section shall, to the extent determined from time to time by the
Escrow Agent to be in excess of the
amount required to be held by it for
the purposes of this Section, be
transferred at the time of such
determination as provided in Section
17(a) of the General Bond Ordinance
for unclaimed funds held by a Paying Agent. In the event of nonpresentment of any Bond as described
in Section 17(a) of the General Bond
Ordinance, the moneys held pursuant to this Section shall be held
and paid as provided in said Section
17(a) for unclaimed funds held by a
Paying Agent.
Section 9. Bond Anticipation Notes.
For the purpose of raising money in
anticipation of the issuance of the
Bonds for the purposes set forth in
Section 1 hereof, notes of the City
may be issued in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed Three
Million One Hundred Ten Thousand
Dollars ($3,110,000) (the “Notes”)
upon the direction of the Director of
Finance to be set forth in a certificate providing for the final terms of
the Notes and the sale of the Notes
and signed by the Director of
Finance (the “Note Certificate of
Award”).
Section 10. Term of the Notes. The
Notes: shall bear interest at such
rate, not exceeding five percent
(5%) per year, as may be fixed by
the Director of Finance of the City
in the Note Certificate of Award;
shall
be
dated
their
date
of
issuance; shall mature on the date
set forth in the Note Certificate of
Award, which shall be no later than
five (5) years from such date of
issuance; shall be subject to redemption by the City at any time prior
to maturity without penalty, provided that, if the Director of Finance,
based on the advice of the financial
advisor of the City, determines that
it is in the best interest of the City
in order to enhance the marketability of the Notes, the Director of
Finance may cause the Notes to not
be redeemable for a period which
ends no later than the date which is
two (2) years following the date of
issuance of the Notes; shall be designated
“Parks
and
Recreation
Facilities Improvement Bond Anticipation Notes, Series 2004”; shall be
issued in such numbers and denominations as may be requested by the
Note
Purchaser
(hereinafter
defined); and shall be issued in
fully registered form (which may be
in a book entry only system) in
denominations of $5,000 or integral
multiples thereof. Interest shall be
payable semi-annually on the dates
set forth in the Note Certificate of
Award; provided that if the Notes
mature on or before the end of the
twelfth (12th) month following their
date of issuance, interest on the
Notes shall be payable at maturity.
U.S. Bank National Association is
appointed to act as the authenticating agent, registrar, transfer agent
and paying agent for the Notes (the
“Note Registrar”); provided that the
Escrow Agent also shall act as paying agent for the Notes so long as
the Notes are held in a book entry
system. The Director of Finance

The City Record
shall sign and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the City, an agreement among the City, the Note Registrar and the Escrow Agent (the
“Note Registrar Agreement”) providing for services relating to the registration, transfer, exchange and
payment of Notes. The Director of
Finance shall provide for the payment of the services rendered and
for
reimbursement
of
expenses
incurred pursuant to the Note Registrar Agreement from the proceeds
of the Notes to the extent available
and then from other money lawfully available and appropriated or to
be appropriated for that purpose.
So long as any of the Notes
remain outstanding, the City will
cause the Note Registrar to maintain and keep at its principal corporate trust office all books and
records necessary for the registration, exchange and transfer of Notes
as provided in this Section (the
“Note Register”). Subject to the provisions of Section 5, the person in
whose name a Note is registered on
the Note Register shall be regarded
as the absolute owner of that Note
for all purposes of this ordinance.
Payment of or on account of the
debt charges on any Note shall be
made only to or upon the order of
that person; neither the City nor the
Note Registrar shall be affected by
any notice to the contrary, but the
registration may be changed as provided in this Section. All such payments shall be valid and effectual
to satisfy and discharge the City’s
liability upon the Note, including
interest, to the extent of the amount
or amounts so paid.
Any Note may be exchanged for
Notes of any authorized denomination upon presentation and surrender at the principal corporate trust
office of the Note Registrar, together with a request for exchange
signed by the registered owner or
by a person legally empowered to do
so in a form satisfactory to the Note
Registrar. A Note may be transferred only on the Note Register
upon presentation and surrender of
the Note at the principal corporate
trust office of the Note Registrar
together with an assignment signed
by the registered owner or by a person legally empowered to do so in
a form satisfactory to the Note Registrar. Upon exchange or transfer
the Note Registrar shall complete,
authenticate and deliver a new Note
or Notes of any authorized denomination or denominations requested
by the owner equal in the aggregate
to the unmatured principal amount
of the Note surrendered and bearing
interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date.
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Note Registrar shall undertake the exchange
or transfer of Notes only after the
new Notes are signed by the authorized officers of the City. In all
cases of Notes exchanged or transferred, the City shall sign and the
Note Registrar shall authenticate
and deliver Notes in accordance
with the provisions of this Ordinance. The exchange or transfer
shall be without charge to the
owner, except that the City and Note
Registrar may make a charge sufficient to reimburse them for any
tax or other governmental charge
required to be paid with respect to
the exchange or transfer. The City
or the Note Registrar may require
that those charges, if any, be paid
before the procedure is begun for

1711

137
the exchange or transfer. All Notes
issued and authenticated upon any
exchange or transfer shall be valid
obligations of the City, evidencing
the same debt, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under this
ordinance, as the Notes surrendered
upon that exchange or transfer.
Pursuant
to
Section
133.30(B),
Ohio Revised Code, the Director of
Finance may combine the Notes
with other bond anticipation notes
of the City into a single consolidated issue of bonds for purposes of
their sale as a single issue to be
designated “Various Purpose General
Obligation
Bond
Anticipation
Notes, Series 2004”. The Notes shall
contain a summary statement of
purposes encompassing the purpose
for which the Notes are issued and
shall state that they are issued pursuant to this Ordinance.
Section 11. Execution and Payment of the Notes. The Notes shall
be executed by the Director of
Finance and the Mayor, provided
that one of such signatures may be
a facsimile. Such Notes shall express
upon their face the purpose for
which they are issued and that they
are issued pursuant to this ordinance, and may be payable in Federal Reserve funds of the United
States of America if requested by
the Note Purchaser.
Section 12. Sale of the Notes. The
Notes shall be sold at private sale
to the Note Purchaser by the Director of Finance in the principal
amount set forth in a certificate of
award to be executed by the Director of Finance (the “Note Certificate
of Award”) at not less than par and
accrued interest and at a rate not
exceeding that set forth in Section
10 hereof. The Notes shall be sold to
A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc. and SBKBrooks Investment Corp. (collectively, the “Note Purchaser”). The proceeds of such sale shall be paid into
the proper fund and used for the
purpose for which the Notes are
being issued under the provisions of
this Ordinance.
Section 13. Security for the Notes.
The Notes shall be the full general
obligations of the City, and the full
faith, credit and revenue of the City
are hereby pledged for the prompt
payment of the same. The par value
to be received from the sale of the
Bonds and any excess funds resulting from the issuance of the Notes
shall, to the extent necessary, be
used for the retirement of the Notes
at maturity, together with the interest thereon, and are hereby pledged
for such purpose.
Section 14. Provision for Levying
and Collecting Tax. During the year
or years while the Notes are outstanding there shall be levied on all
the taxable property in the City, in
addition to all other taxes but within tax limitations, a direct tax annually not less than that which would
have been levied if bonds had been
issued therefor without the prior
issue of the Notes. That tax shall be
and is ordered computed, certified,
levied and extended upon the tax
duplicate and collected by the same
officers, in the same manner and at
the same time that taxes for general purposes for each year are certified, extended and collected. That
tax shall be placed before and in
preference to all other items and for
the full amount thereof. The funds
derived from the tax levies required
by this Ordinance shall be placed in
the Unvoted Tax Supported Obligations Account, and those funds,

138
together with the interest collected
on
them,
shall
be
irrevocably
pledged for the payment of the principal and interest of the Notes or the
Bonds in anticipation of which they
are issued, when and as the same
falls due; provided, however, that in
each year to the extent that revenues are available from other
sources for the payment of the Notes
and Bonds and are appropriated for
such purpose, the amount of such
direct tax upon all of the taxable
property in the City may be reduced
by the amount of such revenues so
available and appropriated.
Section 15. Preparation of Disclosure Document for the Notes. The
Director of Finance is hereby authorized to prepare, execute and deliver to the Note Purchaser, to the
extent required by law, a preliminary and final Official Statement or
any other appropriate disclosure
document of the City in accordance
with the sale and delivery of the
Notes, and to deem such disclosure
document “final” for purposes of
SEC Rule 15c2-12.
Section 16. Miscellaneous.
(a) Any provisions of the Codified
Ordinances of the City which are
inconsistent with the provisions of
this Ordinance and the General
Bond Ordinance shall not apply to
the Bonds or the Notes authorized
herein.
(b) All covenants, terms and provisions of the General Bond Ordinance are fully applicable to the
Bonds and the Notes authorized
herein, and nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to alter or
restrict such full application of the
General Bond Ordinance, except for
the exclusion from application to
the Bonds and the Notes authorized
herein of the provisions of the third
paragraph of Section 13(a) and the
third paragraph of Section 4 of the
General Bond Ordinance pursuant to
Section 2 of this Ordinance.
Section 17. Captions. The captions
or headings in this Ordinance are
for convenience only and in no way
define, limit or describe the scope or
intent of any provisions or sections
of this Ordinance.
Section
18.
Federal
Tax
Covenants. The City covenants that
it will use, and will restrict the use
and investment of, the proceeds of
the Notes and the Bonds in such
manner and to such extent as may
be necessary so that (a) the Notes
and the Bonds will not (i) constitute
private activity bonds, arbitrage
bonds or hedge bonds under Sections
141, 148 or 149 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
Code) or (ii) be treated other than
as bonds to which Section 103(a) of
the Code applies, and (b) the interest thereon will not be treated as an
item of tax preference under Section
57 of the Code.
The City further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the Notes
and the Bonds to be and to remain
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will
not take or authorize to be taken
any actions that would adversely
affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or
persons acting for it, will, among
other acts of compliance, (i) apply
the proceeds of the Notes and the
Bonds to the governmental purpose
of the borrowing, (ii) restrict the
yield
on
investment
property
acquired with those proceeds, (iii)
make timely and adequate payments

The City Record
to the federal government, (iv)
maintain books and records and
make calculations and reports, and
(v) refrain from certain uses of
those proceeds, and, as applicable,
of property financed with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the
extent necessary to assure such
exclusion of that interest under the
Code.
Each covenant made in this section with respect to the Notes and
the Bonds is also made with respect
to all issues any portion of the debt
service on which is paid from proceeds of the Notes or the Bonds
(and, if different, the original issue
and any refunding issues in a series
of refundings), to the extent such
compliance is necessary to assure
exclusion of interest on the Notes
and the Bonds from gross income
for federal income tax purposes, and
the officers identified above are
authorized to take actions with
respect to those issues as they are
authorized in this section to take
with respect to the Notes and the
Bonds.
The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer of
the City having responsibility for
issuance of the Notes and the Bonds
is hereby authorized (a) to make or
effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or
waiver on behalf of the City with
respect to the Notes and the Bonds
as the City is permitted or required
to make or give under the federal
income tax laws, including, without
limitation thereto, any of the elections
provided
for
in
Section
148(f)(4)(C) of the Code or available under Section 148 of the Code,
for the purpose of assuring, enhancing or protecting favorable tax
treatment or status of the Notes and
the Bonds or interest thereon or
assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose, reducing the
burden or expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or
payments or penalties, or making
payments of special amounts in lieu
of making computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as
rebate, or obviating those amounts
or payments, as determined by that
officer, which action shall be in
writing and signed by the officer,
(b) to take any and all other
actions, make or obtain calculations,
make payments, and make or give
reports, covenants and certifications
of and on behalf of the City, as may
be appropriate to assure the exclusion of interest from gross income
and the intended tax status of the
Notes and the Bonds, and (c) to give
one or more appropriate certificates
