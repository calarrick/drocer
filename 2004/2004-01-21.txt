Res. No. 72-04.
By Council Member Cimperman.
An emergency resolution expressing this Council’s support for the
ongoing cooperative efforts between
Cuyahoga County Metropolitan Housing Authority, the Cleveland Municipal School District, and the residents of the Tremont community in
establishing a plan that will enable

that they currently attend.
Whereas, Cuyahoga County Metropolitan Housing Authority (“CMHA”)
is seeking Federal Hope VI funds

are not awarded, CMHA has committed to using CMHA capital funds
for the reconstruction of Valleyview
Estate; and
Whereas, the first group of families to relocate from Valleyview

concerned about the educational obstacles their children may encounter
during the relocation process; and
Whereas, parents of Tremont School

the Tremont Community, and staff
of CMHA encourage the Cleveland
Municipal School District to develop
a plan that would enable students
to complete the 2003-2004 school year
in the school that they
currently

will prevent students from changing
schools mid-year; and
Whereas, changing schools midyear can be a disruptive and difficult experience for students and
adversely affect the quality of education for these students; and

2003-2004 school year in the school
that they are currently attend; and

the Cleveland Municipal School District’s cooperation on this issue; and

Chief Executive Officer of the Cleveland Municipal School District.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,

the Greater Cleveland Sports Commission; authorizing the purchase or

Whereas, the City is hosting the

Whereas, within the last month, it
was determined that it is necessary
to
establish
a

center
beginning in April to ensure the
smooth operation and security of the

Whereas, to facilitate coordination
with the City’s emergency command
operations, it is beneficial to locate
the headquarters and command center for the 2004 International Children’s Games within portions of the

Whereas, on January 5, 2004, this
Council passed Ordinance No. 214403, which authorized, among other
things, the public improvement of
the entire facility located at 205 St.
Clair Avenue; and
Whereas, because of the urgent
nature of ensuring that the pertinent portions of the 205 St. Clair
Avenue facility are ready for operation for the International Children’s Games, this Council finds
that, based on considerations of its
experience and expertise in construction of complex data centers
with high-technology components,
proposed cost, quality, personnel
availability, safety, security and
project delivery date, Schirmer Construction Company is uniquely situated as the best firm to provide the
labor and materials necessary for
the rehabilitation, renovation, reconstruction, or otherwise improvement
of portions of the facility in order
to house a data center, an emergency operations command center,
and other program spaces in the
short time necessary for the International Children’s Games; and
Whereas, this Council finds that
the Schirmer Construction Company
is specifically capable of performing
this work and is also capable of
starting and completing the im-
