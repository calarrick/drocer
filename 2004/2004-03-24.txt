FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES REFERRED
Ord. No. 466-04.
By Council Member Jackson (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the purchase by one or more
requirement contracts of building
materials, for the various divisions
of City government.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Finance is authorized to make one or
more written requirement contracts
under the Charter and the Codified
Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
for the requirements for the period of
one or two years of the necessary
items of building materials, in the
approximate amount as purchased
during the preceding term, to be purchased by the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies on a unit basis
for the various divisions of City government. Bids shall be taken in a
manner that permits an award to be
made for all items as a single contract, or by separate contract for each
or any combination of the items as
the Board of Control determines.
Alternate bids for a period less than
the specified term may be taken if
desired by the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies until provision is
made for the requirements for the
entire term. The Director of Finance
is authorized to enter into one or
more contracts with a term of two
years instead of one year when there
is a financial advantage to the City.
For purposes of this ordinance, a

financial advantage shall be determined by the Director of Finance by
comparing the bids received for both
terms.
Section 2. That the costs of the
contract
or
contracts
shall
be
charged against the proper appropriation accounts and the Director
of Finance shall certify the amount
of the initial purchase, which purchase, together with all later purchases, shall be made on order of
the Commissioner of Purchases and
Supplies under a requisition against
the contract or contracts certified by
the Director of Finance. (RL 104783)
Section 3. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Referred to Directors of Finance,
Law; Committee on Finance.
Ord. No. 467-04.
By Council Members Reed and
Jackson (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance reaffirming, amending, and restating Ordinance No. 73-84, passed January 23,
1984, in order to continue to pick-up
employee contributions to the Police
and Fire Pension Fund under new
procedures.
Whereas, under Ordinance No. 7384, passed January 23, 1984, this
Council authorized a plan for Cleveland to assume and pay employee
contributions to the Police and Fire
Pension Fund (“OP&F”); and
Whereas, under the plan authorized by this Council, the City
“picks-up” all of the ten percent
(10%) mandatory contributions required under Section 742.31 of the
Ohio Revised Code for participating
employees who are members of the
OP&F; and
Whereas, the OP&F has adopted
new
procedures
for
reporting
picked-up contributions in order to
properly prepare 1099-R forms for its
members; and
Whereas, this Council reaffirms,
amends, and restates Ordinance No.
73-84, passed January 23, 1984, in
order to continue the picked-up contributions under the new procedures;
and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That, effective on the
passage date of this ordinance, the
City of Cleveland shall continue to
pick-up all of the ten percent (10%)
mandatory
contributions
by
the
employees who are members of the
OP&F through a payroll reduction.
The picked-up contributions paid
through a payroll reduction, even
though designated as employee contributions for state law purposes,
are being paid by the City of Cleveland in lieu of the contributions by
the employee. The picked-up contributions will not be included in the
gross income of the employees for
tax reporting purposes, that is, for
federal or state income tax withholding
taxes,
until
distribution
from the OP&F. The employees shall
not be entitled to any option of
choosing to receive the contributed

480

March 24, 2004
amounts directly instead of having
them paid by the City of Cleveland
to the OP&F.
Section 2. That the Director of
Finance and the Commissioner of
Accounts are directed to implement
the provisions of this ordinance.
Section 3. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 1 of Ordinance No. 2380-02, passed December
16, 2002, is amended to read as follows:
Section 1. That the Director of

staff of the several departments of
the City of Cleveland in order to provide professional services necessary
to prepare planning studies, for the
various divisions of the Department
of Port Control.
The selection of the consultants for
the services shall be made by the
Board of Control upon the nomination
of the Director of Port Control from
a list of qualified consultants available for the employment as may be
determined after a full and complete
canvass by the Director of Port Control for the purpose of compiling the
list. The compensation to be paid for
the services shall be fixed by the
Board of Control. The contract or contracts authorized shall be prepared
by the Director of Law, approved by
the Director of Port Control, and certified by the Director of Finance. The

option to renewal for an additional
term or terms of two years. The

parts, including labor if necessary,
for the Division of Motor Vehicle

Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council has
determined that the within services

Director of Public Service is authorized to make one or more written

preceding
term, to be purchased by the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies, for the Division of Motor Vehicle Maintenance, Department of Public Service. The Director of Public
Service is authorized to enter into
one or more contracts with a term
of two years instead of one year

An emergency ordinance authorizing and directing the Director of
Public Utilities to immediately perform an energy audit in all Cityowned government facilities and
operations and to begin actively
monitoring the city’s energy use.
Whereas, many U.S. cities, including Portland, Phoenix, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Memphis,
have performed energy audits in
their
government
facilities
and
operations;
Whereas,
energy
audits
have
allowed these cities to understand
how they use their energy and to
know where they can make shortterm and long-term energy efficiency improvements;
Whereas, these cities have saved
millions of dollars by performing
energy audits,
implementing energy efficiency improvements, and
actively monitoring their energy
use;
Whereas, Cleveland has never performed a thorough energy audit of
its facilities and operations and
does not aggressively monitor its
energy use;
Whereas, Cleveland faced a $61
million dollar budget deficit in 2003
and
could
face
greater
budget
deficits in upcoming years;
Whereas, the city must promote
cost-saving measures in order to offset the possibility of future budget
deficits;
Whereas, by performing an energy audit and monitoring its ongoing
energy use, the city would become
more energy efficient and save
important tax dollars for other city
programs and operations;
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Public Utilities is hereby authorized
and directed to immediately perform
an energy audit in all City-owned
government facilities and operations
and to actively monitor the city’s
energy use.
Section 2. That this ordinance is

March 24, 2004
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to

An emergency resolution demanding that the Campbell administration uphold and enforce all valid
laws of the City, most importantly
the Fannie M. Lewis Cleveland Resident Employment Law, Chapter 188
of the Codified Ordinances of the
City of Cleveland; demanding that
the administration provide documentation and all relevant information pertaining to the propriety of
any of the City’s current laws,
including the Fannie M. Lewis

March 24, 2004
Cleveland Resident Employment Law;
demanding that the Board of Control not award any contract that
fails to include standards and procedures effectuating the Fannie M.
Lewis Cleveland Resident Employment Law; reaffirming this Council’s commitment to the purposes
and goals set forth in said Fannie
M. Lewis Cleveland Resident Employment
Law;
and
urging
the
Mayor to be likewise committed to
enforcing said law.
Whereas, the Fannie M. Lewis
Cleveland
Resident
Employment
Law, effective January 2004, was
passed by this Council in order to
ensure that residents of this City,
especially
low
income
workers,
obtain meaningful employment; and
Whereas, this Council enacted the
Fannie M. Lewis Cleveland Resident
Employment Law also to ensure
that money spent by the taxpayers
of this city benefits those who live
in this city; and
Whereas, the Fannie M. Lewis
Cleveland
Resident
Employment
Law applies to all city construction
contracts of $100,000 or more and
requires that residents of the City
perform 20% of the total construction worker hours; and
Whereas, it has come to the attention of this Council that the Campbell administration may award the
public improvement contract for the
rehabilitation
of
Kinsman
Road
without enforcing Chapter 188 of the
City’s Codified Ordinances, the Fannie M. Lewis Cleveland Resident
Employment Law; and
Whereas, the apparent ignoring of
the Fannie M. Lewis Cleveland Resident Employment Law in the pending award of this public improvement contract, and any other applicable city construction contracts, is
an affront to this Council and to the
residents of this City, especially
those who are willing and able to
work on such a project and who
need such employment; and
Whereas, the Campbell administration cannot unilaterally ignore
duly enacted laws of the City and
is bound by duty and by law to
uphold this City’s valid laws unless
and until said laws are found
unlawful; and
Whereas, this Council questions
whether the Campbell administration will ignore the Fannie M. Lewis
Cleveland
Resident
Employment
Law as it applies to all city construction contracts, thus rendering
the law irrelevant; and
Whereas, the Campbell administration is strongly advised to stay
in contact with this Council, as the
legislative body of this City, so that
it knows and understands which of
its laws are being questioned; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby demands that the Campbell administration uphold and enforce all
valid laws of the City, most importantly the Fannie M. Lewis Cleveland Resident Employment Law,
Chapter 188 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland;
demands that the administration
provide documentation and all rele-

vant information pertaining to the
propriety of any of the City’s current laws, including the Fannie M.

of Control not award any contract

to be likewise committed to enforcing said law.
