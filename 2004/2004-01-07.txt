An emergency resolution declaring the week of Dr. Martin Luther
King’s birthday, January 18th - January 25th, Voter Registration Week
in the City of Cleveland; encouraging unregistered citizens to register
to vote at one of the events being
conducted during Voter Registration
Week; and reminding citizens that
they may register to vote during
normal business hours at their nearest public library, motor vehicle
bureau, or the Cuyahoga County
Board of Elections.

The City Record
Whereas, the right to vote enables
citizens to have a voice in their government as citizens choose the people who will serve in public office;
and
Whereas, Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr., one of the greatest leaders in
the history of the United States,
emphasized the importance of voting when he stated “Voting is the
foundation stone for political action.
With it, [African Americans] can
eventually vote out of office public
officials who bar the doorway to
decent housing, public safety, jobs
and decent integrated education. It
is now obvious that the basic elements so vital to [African-American]
advancement
can
only
be
achieved by seeking redress from
government at local, state, and federal levels. To do this the vote is
essential”; and
Whereas, quality housing, education, jobs, and public safety are
issues that are of basic concern to
all residents of Cleveland, regardless of race, color or nationality; and
Whereas, the right to vote and to
have one’s vote counted is the hallmark of any democratic society; and
Whereas, the right of all Americans to vote was won through
decades of struggle, including the
loss of many lives; and
Whereas, voting is a right that
belongs to all citizens of the state
of Ohio; and
Whereas, many persons who are
eligible to register to vote choose
not to; and
Whereas, many persons who are
registered do not exercise their
democratic right to vote; and
Whereas, a large scale voter registration and education effort in the
City of Cleveland can help increase
the number of people who exercise
their right to vote and thereby
strengthen their voices in government; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby declares the week of Dr. Martin
Luther King’s birthday, January
18th - January 25th, Voter Registration Week in the City of Cleveland.
Section 2. That this Council hereby encourages unregistered citizens
to register at any of the events
being conducted in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King’s birthday.
Section 3. That this Council hereby reminds citizens that they may
register to vote during normal business hours at their nearest public
library, motor vehicle bureau, or the
Cuyahoga County Board of Elections.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period

An emergency resolution supporting an investigation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
and the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission into whether market
manipulation contributed to a 55%
surge in natural gas prices.
Whereas, the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
have been asked to investigate
whether market manipulation contributed to a 55% surge in natural
gas prices; and
Whereas, given the amount of fuel
stowed in underground storage and
available to augment fresh supplies
from pipelines, there does not appear to be a reason for increases in
spot-market and future prices; and
Whereas, gas inventories for this
winter peaked at 3.187 trillion cubic
feet on November 7, 2003, up 2.9 percent from a year earlier; and
Whereas, gas inventories for this
winter are the third largest pre-winter stockpile on record according to
Energy Department figures; and
Whereas, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, temperatures in the
United States have been 9.5 percent
warmer than normal so far this
heating season; and
Whereas, this Council is concerned about the rising natural gas
prices as such prices make it
extremely challenging, if not impossible, for low income families and
senior citizens to heat their homes;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports an investigation by the
Commodity Future Trading Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission
into
whether
market manipulation contributed to
a 55 percent surge in natural gas
prices.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to Chairman
Newsome, Commodity Future Trading
Commission,
and
Chairman
Wood, Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
