FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES REFERRED
Ord. No. 690-04.
By Council Member Jackson (by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the purchase by one or more
requirement contracts of ready mix
concrete, for the various divisions of
City government.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Finance is authorized to make one
or more written requirement contracts under the Charter and the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,

Ohio, 1976, for the requirements for
the period of one year of the necessary items of ready mix concrete, in
the approximate amount as purchased during the preceding term, to
be purchased by the Commissioner
of Purchases and Supplies on a unit
basis for the various divisions of
City government. Bids shall be
taken in a manner that permits an
award to be made for all items as
a single contract, or by separate
contract for each or any combination of the items as the Board of
Control determines.
Alternate bids
for a period less than one year may
be taken if deemed desirable by the
Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies until provision is made for the
requirements for the entire term.
Section 2. That the costs of the
contract
or
contracts
shall
be
charged against the proper appropriation accounts and the Director
of Finance shall certify the amount
of the initial purchase, which purchase, together with all later purchases, shall be made on order of
the Commissioner of Purchases and
Supplies under a requisition against
the contract or contracts certified by
the Director of Finance. (RL 104786)
Section 3. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Referred to Directors of Finance,
Law; Committee on Finance.
Ord. No. 691-04.
By Council Members Coats, Cimperman and Jackson (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance determining the method of making the
public improvement of installing
and constructing backup electric
generation at various buildings and
facilities of the Division of Water;
authorizing the Director of Public
Utilities to enter into one or more
contracts for the making of the
improvement; authorizing one or
more contracts for professional services
necessary
to
make
the
improvement; authorizing one or
more contracts for the purchase,
rental, or lease of equipment, materials, and supplies necessary for the
improvement; and authorizing the
acquisition of interests in real property necessary for the improvement.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland’s
Division of Water was forced to
interrupt service to customers during the blackout of August 14, 2003;
and
Whereas, the Division of Water
desires to eliminate its reliance on
other utilities and the national
transmission
grid
by
installing
backup electric generators at key
facilities throughout the water system as soon as possible; and
Whereas, because of the expedited timetable, the necessity to coordinate design and construction at
multiple locations, and the complexities in obtaining environmental permitting and zoning compliance in
the various municipalities, it is efficient and cost-effective to construct
the project under a single contract
for both design and construction;
and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore

714

April 28, 2004
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That, under Section 167
of the Charter of the City of Cleveland, it is determined to make the

Section 2. That the Director of
Public Utilities is authorized to
enter into one or more contracts for
the making of the above Improvement with the lowest responsible
bidder or bidders after competitive
bidding for a gross price for the

Upon request of the director the contractor shall furnish a correct schedule of unit prices, including profit

Improvement, including but not limited to the design, construction management, permitting and other regulatory compliance, operation, and
maintenance of the Improvement or
its components authorized by this
ordinance. The selection of the consultant or consultants for the services shall be made by the Board of
Control on the nomination of the
Director of Public Utilities from a
list of qualified consultants available for the employment as may be
determined after a full and complete
canvass by the Director of Public
Utilities for the purpose of compiling the list.
The compensation to

An emergency resolution supporting initiatives to make Cleveland a
truly bicycle-friendly city by 2010;
supporting the City Planning Commission in the adoption of the Bike
Lane Design Guide of the Pedestrian and Bicycle Information Center;
and urging the Ohio Department of
Transportation to reinstate the bike
lanes
into
the
Euclid
Corridor
Transportation
Project
between
Cleveland State University and Case
Western Reserve University
Whereas, in September, 2002, the
City of Cleveland announced its
intention to make Cleveland a bicycle-friendly city by 2010; and
Whereas,
bike
lanes,
signed,
shared roadways and multi-purpose
trails will make up the transportation network that bicyclists will use
in Cleveland; and
Whereas, bicycles are a legal
mode of transportation in the state
of Ohio and bicyclists enjoy the
same rights and have the same
responsibilities as motorists; and
Whereas, bicycling is a means of
affordable transportation; and
Whereas, studies performed by the
Federal Highway Administration on
bike lanes have shown them to be
a highly effective way of increasing
safety for both the bicycle rider and
motorist; and
Whereas, these same studies have
proven that streets with bike lanes
have increased bicycle ridership;
and
Whereas, bicycling is an excellent
form of recreation that can lead to
improved health and physical fitness; and
Whereas, bicycling is environmentally sound and helps ease traffic
congestion; and
Whereas, with the exception of
lane width, the Bike Lane Design
Guide specifications are consistent
with the manual on Uniform Traffic
Control and the AASHTO Guide for
the Development of Bicycle Facilities; and
Whereas, the City of Chicago has
used these guidelines since 1999 and
is
considered
the
most
bicyclefriendly large city in the United
States; and

22
Whereas, the City of Cleveland’s
Divisions of Engineering and Construction and Traffic Engineering
have reviewed and approved the
Bike Lane Design Guide; and
Whereas, if the City of Cleveland
does not adopt a set of local design
guidelines, all questions about the
design of bicycle lanes and other onstreet bicycle facilities will be decided by the Ohio Department of Transportation; and
Whereas, if bike lane design decisions are left to the Ohio Department of Transportation, the Euclid
Corridor Transportation Project may
not include the bike lanes between
Cleveland State University and Case
Western Reserve University specifically requested by the City; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland supports initiatives to make Cleveland a truly
bicycle-friendly city by 2010; supports the City Planning Commission
in the adoption of the Bike Lane
Design Guide of the Pedestrian and
Bicycle
Information
Center;
and
urges the Ohio Department of Transportation to reinstate the bike lanes
into the Euclid Corridor Transportation Project between Cleveland
State University and Case Western
Reserve University.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

An emergency resolution supporting the elimination of the so-called
“two-thirds” rule and overhaul of
the Ohio Schools Facilities Commission’s reimbursement policies for
rehabilitation which will allow the
Cleveland Municipal School District
maximum flexibility in its decisions
regarding whether an older neighborhood school can be rehabilitated
for continued use in our City and in
communities throughout the State of
Ohio.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has architecturally and historically
significant school buildings listed or
eligible for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places; and
Whereas, the exteriors of these
historic neighborhood schools are
constructed of the finest building
materials available; and
Whereas, many of these fine older
buildings can and should be rehabilitated to meet the 21st century
educational needs of Cleveland’s
school children; and
Whereas, the historic rehabilitation of neighborhood schools will
beautify Cleveland neighborhoods
and likely result in increased property values: and

The City Record
Whereas, the Ohio Schools Facilities Commission’s Design Manual
and reimbursement rules are biased
against rehabilitation in favor of
new construction, significantly limiting the options of local school districts; and
Whereas, the Columbus Landmark
Foundation in its 2002 Historic
Schools Technical Assistance Consortium Final Report, demonstrated
that there are cost savings in building renovation verses new construction with the renovated building
providing 21st Century “suitability”:
and
Whereas, cost savings can be
gained
to
provide
21st
century
school building facilities by revising
the methodology to further evaluate
adequacy of historic buildings and
their renovation: and
Whereas, the Ohio Schools Facilities
Commission
should
develop
reimbursement
guidelines
which
give greater consideration to the
issues concerning older urban school
building and sites and their respective importance effecting the fabric
of urban neighborhoods: and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland hereby supports
the elimination of the so-called “twothirds” rule and overhaul of the Ohio
Schools
Facilities
Commission’s
reimbursement policies for rehabilitation which will allow the Cleveland Municipal School District maximum flexibility in its decisions
regarding whether an older neighborhood school can be rehabilitated
for continued use in our City and in
communities throughout the State of
Ohio
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
copies of this resolution to the members of the Ohio School Facilities
Commission, the Cleveland Municipal School Board, and the Ohio
House and Senate Committees on
Education.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS

Members
Cintron,
Zone, Coats, Brady, Westbrook, Conwell, Rybka, Lewis, Britt, Cimperman, Dolan, Gordon, Jackson, Johnson, Jones, O’Malley, Pierce Scott,
Polensek, Reed, Sweeney and White.
An emergency resolution supporting the employees of the Cleveland
Public Library System and the Service Employees International Union
District 1199 in its effort to negotiate library workers’ rights and benefits with the Cleveland Public
Library Board and urging an expeditious and reasonable settlement
between the union and the Library
Board.
Whereas, in May, 2003, the taxpayers of the City of Cleveland
voted overwhelmingly to increase
property taxes to support the Cleveland Public Library; and
Whereas, said property tax increase will generate an average of
$14 million dollars per year for the
next five years; and
Whereas, the tax levy was supported by Cleveland City Council;
and
Whereas, Cleveland Public Library
is currently in negotiations with the
library employee union, Service Employees International Union District
1199; and
Whereas, the Cleveland Public
Library is wasting thousands of tax
dollars in such contract negotiations
attempting to take away longstanding benefits and rights from the
library employees; and
Whereas, the Cleveland Public
Library
proposes
to
subcontract
book preparation and cataloging
work to southern states without providing
any
documentation
that
shows savings to the library; and
Whereas, such proposal would
send tax dollars out of the City and
further reduce the City’s shrinking
tax base; and
Whereas, the Cleveland Public
Library is increasing the number of
part-time jobs over additional good,
full-time jobs that could support
Clevelanders and their families; and
Whereas, the Cleveland Public
Library refuses to provide health
care coverage for part-time employees; and
Whereas, Service Employees International Union District 1199 has set
a strike date for April 20, 2004; and
Whereas, such a strike will hurt
the Cleveland Public Library, the
City of Cleveland and the entire
community; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports the employees of the
Cleveland Public Library System
and the Service Employees International Union District 1199 in its
effort to negotiate library workers’
rights and benefits with the Cleveland Public Library Board and
urges an expeditious and reasonable
settlement between the union and
the Library Board.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby directed to transmit certified
copies of this resolution to Andrew
Venable, Director of the Cleveland
Public
Library,
the
Board
of

The City Record
Trustees of the Cleveland Public
Library, and to the appropriate representatives of the Service Employees InternationalUnion District 1199
and the Board of the Cleveland
Municipal School District.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
