An emergency resolution supporting the Hagel-Harkin Amendment to
the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act (IDEA), which would
provide an additional, mandatory $2
billion per year to the IDEA.
Whereas, the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)
was passed by the United States
Congress in 1975; and
Whereas, the IDEA guarantees
disabled students a free and public
education in the least restrictive
environment possible; and
Whereas, the IDEA authorized the
federal government to pay for 40%
of the costs school districts spend to
educate a disabled student; and
Whereas, however, Congress has
never appropriated the full 40%; and
Whereas, President Bush’s FY
2005 education budget proposes a $1
billion increase in IDEA funding,
which would bring the total funding
to IDEA to $11.7 billion; and
Whereas, this increase would provide 19.7% of the national average
per pupil expenditure, which is still
only half of the “full funding” level
that Congress committed to paying
when the IDEA passed in 1975; and
Whereas, funding for special education affects all students, not just
those with disabilities because in
order to make up for the federal
funding shortfall, many schools are
forced to take money from their general education budgets to provide
for services within their IDEA budget, which they are obligated to provide by law; and
Whereas, although President Bush
has increased funding for IDEA in
the past several years, the annual
increase of $1 billion a year will not
reach the promised level of 40%
until 2035; and

856

May 12, 2004
Whereas, local governments cannot afford to wait that long for
funding; and
Whereas,
the
Hagel-Harkin
Amendment to the IDEA, which will
be introduced this week to the U.S.
Senate, will provide $2 billion per
year in mandatory funding to IDEA
in addition to the amount appropriated by Congress; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby
supports
the
Hagel-Harkin
Amendment to the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)
which would provide an additional,
mandatory $2 billion per year to the
IDEA.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit

representatives
of

it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

Whereas, on April 22, 2004, a

An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Delegation to the U.S. Congress to vote to repeal the 2003 tax
breaks which cause disastrous fiscal
problems in this country’s urban
centers and to redirect a portion of
the restored funds to the states so
that painful budget cuts may be
stopped; and further urging said
Ohio Delegation to vote against any
future tax breaks, which erode the
funding available for critical domestic priorities.
Whereas, this Council believes
that the City of Cleveland must provide quality services to its residents;
and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has experienced cuts to its budget
because of Ohio’s budget deficits
over the last few years; and
Whereas, Ohio needs new revenue
to prevent these and other deep budget cuts as well as to pay for education, affordable housing, child
care, health care, prescription drugs,
public safety, environmental programs, local aid, human services,
and other badly needed state and
local programs; and
Whereas, if significant revenue is
not forthcoming, the City of Cleve-

871

33
land will face increased pressure to
raise property taxes, raise fees,
and/or cut vital services; and
Whereas, Ohio is in this fiscal crisis because the sluggish national
economy has resulted in substantial
loss of revenues; and
Whereas, President Bush and the
U.S. Congress could have provided
$85 billion in aid to the states during this nationwide fiscal crisis,
which would have eliminated every
state’s deficit; and
Whereas, instead, the President
and Congress chose to pass a tax
bill that provides only $20 billion in
aid to states and gives away $330
billion in tax breaks; and
Whereas, the 2003 federal tax law
will cost Ohio millions of dollars
over the next decade; and
Whereas, Ohio has lost 213,100
jobs since the start of the recession;
and
Whereas, the 2003 federal tax law
will yield an average tax cut totaling only $380 over 4 years to most
of Ohio’s taxpayers; and
Whereas, by 2006, 89% of Ohio residents will receive less than $100 in
tax cuts; and
Whereas, there is little evidence
that
these
aforementioned
tax
breaks have the “trickle down”
effect promoted by the U.S. government; and
Whereas, history has shown that
large tax giveaways and inequality
of wealth are often followed by
weak economic growth and job loss;
and
Whereas, Ohio relies on federal
aid in the form of Medicaid reimbursements, general economic assistance, increased spending on transportation and housing development,
direct homeland security funding
and a strong Social Security system;
and
Whereas, the federal government
has required that states do more,
but has not provided adequate funding to do so; and
Whereas, the 2003 federal tax law
undermines our state and local
efforts in areas such as homeland
security, election reform, and the No
Child Left Behind Act; and
Whereas, the 2003 federal tax law
provides little tax relief to the vast
majority of the citizens of Ohio; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the Ohio Delegation to the
U.S. Congress to vote to repeal the
2003 tax breaks which cause disastrous fiscal problems in this country’s urban centers and to redirect a
portion of the restored funds to the

all the members elected to Council,

Cleveland
Regional
Transit Authority and Geauga Lake
Park officials to reinstate the bus
route, or otherwise provide transportation, to Geauga Lake Park, formerly known as Six Flags Amusement Park, so that our youth may
maintain summer employment at the

Whereas, it has come to this
Council’s attention that the Greater
Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (RTA) along with officials at
Geauga Lake Park, have discontinued service from Cuyahoga County
to the amusement park located in
Geauga County, Geauga Lake Park,
formerly
known
as
Six
Flags
Amusement Park; and
Whereas, many Cuyahoga County
and city of Cleveland residents,
mostly youth, have held jobs at this
amusement park during the summer
months; and
Whereas, often, these youth working at the park have no other
recourse but to take public transportation to get to work; and
Whereas, it is incumbent upon
RTA to provide service from Cuyahoga County to Geauga Lake Park
so that these youth and all others
relying
on
public
transportation
may keep their summer employment
at the park; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
