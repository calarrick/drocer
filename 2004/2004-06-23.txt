ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 1191-04.
By Council Member Conwell.
An
emergency
resolution
proclaiming September 11, 2004 and
each
anniversary
thereafter
as
“American Heroes Day” to remember the victims of accidents, violence, crime and natural causes and
to honor the thousands of fire fighters, emergency medical service officers, police officers and public officials who dedicate and sometimes
give their lives to help and serve
the public good; and urging all citizens to honor our American heroes
and to celebrate our American spirit on this day and to work to rebuild
individual lives and communities so
tragically affected.
Whereas, on September 11, 2001,
this nation suffered the most egregious terrorist attack on American
soil in its history, leaving more than
3,000 persons dead, including hundreds of fire fighters, police officers,
and emergency medical personnel;
and
Whereas, one of the worst acts of
human malice in American history
became one of America’s finest
moments, as the American people
united in their efforts to recover the
remains of victims, assist victims’
families and demonstrate to the
world that terrorism is ineffective
and cannot destroy the spirit of a
diverse, freedom-loving people; and
Whereas,
the
memory
of
the
events of September 11, 2001 reminds
us of the thousands of everyday
heroes who do not seek hero status,
but who nevertheless perform acts
of courage and extraordinary service to their fellow citizens; and
Whereas, this Council is proud of
the heroes who live and work in the
City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,

1254

June 23, 2004
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby proclaims September 11, 2004 and
each
anniversary
thereafter
as
“American Heroes Day” to remember
the victims of accidents, violence,
crime and natural causes and to
honor the thousands of fire fighters,
emergency medical service officers,
police officers and public officials
who dedicate and sometimes give
their lives to help and serve the public good.
Section 2. That this Council further urges all citizens to honor our
American heroes and to celebrate
our American spirit on this day and
to work to rebuild individual lives
and communities so tragically affected.
Section 3. That the Clerk is hereby directed to transmit certified
copies of this resolution to President
George W. Bush and the appropriate
members of the United States Congress representing northeast Ohio.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Section 2. Authorization of the
2004 Bonds. This Council finds and
determines it is necessary and proper and in the best interest of the
City to issue the 2004 Bonds for the
purpose of refunding the Refunded
Bonds. The 2004 Bonds may be
issued in one or more Series. The
principal amount of each Series of
2004 Bonds is to be the amount set
forth in the Certificate of Award
authorized in Section 2. The aggregate principal amount of 2004 Bonds
of all Series issued for the purpose
of refunding the Refunded Bonds
shall not exceed $175,000,000 and
shall be the amount determined by
the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial
Advisor, to be necessary to refund
the Refunded Bonds and to obtain
aggregate net present value debt
service savings with respect to the
Refunded Bonds of not less than
three percent (3%). The proceeds
from the sale of each Series of 2004
Bonds shall be allocated, deposited
and applied as provided in Section 4
of this Ordinance.
The 2004 Bonds may be issued in
one or more separate Series, each
bearing a distinctive designation,
provided that the 2004 Bonds of each
Series satisfy the requirements of
this Ordinance. Separate Series of
2004 Bonds may be issued at the
same or different times. The 2004
Bonds of each Series shall be designated as provided in the applicable Certificate of Award. A separate
Certificate of Award and a separate
Supplemental
Indenture
may
be
delivered for each Series.
In the event that the Director of
Finance,
based
on
the
written
advice of a Financial Advisor, determines that the City’s best interests
will be served by causing a Series
of 2004 Bonds to be obligations bearing interest at variable interest
rates, then the Director of Finance
is authorized to so specify in the
Certificate of Award for that Series.
If the Director of Finance so determines, then the method and procedure by which the variable rate of
interest to be borne by the 2004
Bonds of that Series shall be determined as provided in the applicable
Supplemental Indenture, whether by
auction, by reference to a market
index, by a remarketing agent or
otherwise; provided that no Series of
2004 Bonds shall bear interest at a
rate in excess of sixteen percent
(16%) per year. Notwithstanding
that limitation, a Series of 2004

16
Bonds held by a provider of a Credit Support Instrument may bear
interest at a rate not in excess of
twenty-five percent (25%) per year
as provided in the agreement with
the provider of the Credit Support
Instrument. The Director of Finance
may determine that the terms of a
variable rate Series of 2004 Bonds
may or may not permit the Holders
to tender their variable rate 2004
Bonds for purchase by the City. If
the Director of Finance designates
any Series of 2004 Bonds as variable
rate 2004 Bonds, and if the Holders
of that Series of 2004 Bonds are to
be entitled to tender those 2004
Bonds for purchase, then the Director of Finance shall also designate
in the Certificate of Award for those
variable rate 2004 Bonds, the tender
agent or agents and the remarketing agent or agents, which designations shall be based on the determination of the Director of Finance,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the parties
so designated possess the requisite
resources and experience to provide
the services required of them and
that the terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide
such services are fair and commercially reasonable. The Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
agreements in connection with the
delivery of the 2004 Bonds, and from
time to time thereafter so long as
the 2004 Bonds are outstanding,
with providers of Credit Support
Instruments, tender agents (which
may be the Trustee), remarketing
agents (which may be any of the
Original Purchasers) and others as
may be determined by the Director
of Finance to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the method of
determining the variable interest
rates, permitting holders the right
of tender and providing for payment
of the purchase price of, or debt service on, the variable rate 2004
Bonds. In the event the variable rate
2004 Bonds are issued as auction
rate obligations, the Director of
Finance is authorized, to enter into
agreements from time to time, so
long as the 2004 Bonds are outstanding, with auction agents and
others, or to cause the Trustee to
enter into those agreements, based
on the written advice of a Financial
Advisor that the parties so designated
possess
the
requisite
resources and experience to provide
the services required of them and
that the terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide
such services are fair and commercially reasonable.
Regardless of whether a Series of
2004 Bonds bears interest at variable or fixed rates, the Director of
Finance is authorized to contract for
Credit Support Instruments, and to
pay the costs of them from proceeds
of the 2004 Bonds, if he determines,
based on the written advice of a
Financial Advisor, that the Credit
Support Instrument or Instruments
will result in a savings in the cost
of the financing to the City.
The Refunded Bonds shall be designated by the Director of Finance
in the Certificate of Award and
shall consist of those Outstanding
Bonds the refunding of which will
enable the City, in the judgment of
the Director of Finance, based on
the written advice of a Financial

The City Record
Advisor, to obtain aggregate net
present value debt service savings
of not less than three percent (3%).
The Refunded Bonds shall be called
for redemption or retired on the date
or dates specified in the Certificate
of Award. The redemption dates so
specified shall be the dates required
under the Code for compliance with
Section 149(d) of the Code and other
applicable federal tax laws.
Section 3. Sale of 2004 Bonds. The
2004 Bonds shall be sold to the Original Purchasers pursuant to one or
more Bond Purchase Agreements
substantially in the form of the
Bond Purchase Agreement now on
file with the Clerk in the File referenced in Section 1 with such
changes not inconsistent with the
Indenture or this Ordinance and not
substantially adverse to the City as
may be approved by the officer signing the Bond Purchase Agreement
on behalf of the City. The approval
of any changes by that officer and
the determination by that officer
that the change is not substantially
adverse to the City shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing and
delivery
of
the
Bond
Purchase
Agreement by that officer. The
Director of Finance shall sign and
deliver the Certificate of Award and
Bond Purchase Agreement for the
2004 Bonds of each Series, one or
more of which shall specify and set
forth the following details with
respect to the 2004 Bonds:
(a)
the
aggregate
principal
amount; provided that amount shall
not exceed $175,000,000 assuming
that the 2004 Bonds are to be initially offered to the public at a price
at least equal to their aggregate
principal amount; however, if any of
the 2004 Bonds are to be initially
offered to the public at an original
issue discount, the maximum aggregate principal amount of 2004 Bonds
shall be increased over that amount
by an amount equal to the aggregate original issue discount net of
the aggregate original issue premium;
(b) the date or dates of the 2004
Bonds;
(c) the purchase price to be paid
to the City by the Original Purchasers, which amount shall be not
less than: (i) 97% of the amount
determined by subtracting from the
aggregate principal amount of the
2004 Bonds any aggregate original
issue discount net of any aggregate original issue premium with
respect to the 2004 Bonds, plus (ii)
any accrued interest on the 2004
Bonds from their date to the date
of their delivery to the Original
Purchasers;
(d) whether any 2004 Bonds are
subject to optional redemption prior
to maturity and, if so, the earliest
optional redemption date for those
2004 Bonds subject to prior redemption, which shall be not later than
ten years from the first interest payment date of the applicable Series,
and the applicable redemption price,
which shall be not greater than
102%
of
the
principal
amount
redeemed;
(e) the dates on which principal
of the 2004 Bonds is to be paid,
which shall be not later than 30
years from the date of delivery, with
an identification of whether the payment is due by stated maturity or

1260

June 23, 2004
by mandatory sinking fund redemption of 2004 Bonds of a particular
maturity;
(f) the interest rates to be borne
by 2004 Bonds bearing interest at a
fixed rate, which shall not exceed
amounts that result in an average
yield in excess of six percent (6%),
and the method by which the interest rate is to be determined for 2004
Bonds bearing interest at variable
rates, consistent with Section 2. The
2004 Bonds of the same Series and
same maturity may bear interest at
different interest rates;
(g) the particular Outstanding
Bonds or portions thereof to be
Refunded Bonds;
(h) any deposit required to be
made to the Debt Service Reserve
Fund; and
(i) the title and Series designation
for the Bonds.
It is determined that the terms of
the 2004 Bonds as so determined
within the limitations set forth in
this Ordinance and as so specified
and set forth in the Certificate of
Award will be in the best interest
of the City and consistent with all
legal requirements.
Section 4. Application of Proceeds
of 2004 Bonds. The proceeds of the
sale of the 2004 Bonds shall be
deposited as follows:
(a) to the Trustee, for deposit to
the credit of the Interest Account in
the Debt Service Fund, the amount,

Supplemental
Indenture
for
the
application of any amounts held in

The City Record
on behalf of the City, to sign and
deliver to the Trustee, in trust for
the Original Purchasers and subsequent holders of the 2004 Bonds, one
or more Supplemental Indentures,
approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, not inconsistent with this Ordinance, the Certificate of Award and the Indenture
and not substantially adverse to the
City as may be approved by the officers signing the same on behalf of
the City. The determination by those
officers that a Supplemental Indenture is not substantially adverse to
the City shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing and delivery
of that Supplemental Indenture by
those officers.
The Mayor, Director of Finance
and Director of Public Utilities, or
any two of them, are authorized and
directed, in the name and on behalf
of the City, to sign and deliver one
or more Escrow Agreements between the City and the Trustee as
Escrow Agent, approved as to form
and correctness by the Director of
Law, providing for the establishment of an Escrow Fund as a trust
fund in the custody of the Trustee
and the investment, dedication and
application of the moneys deposited
in the accounts therein to the payment of the Refunded Bonds and
further providing for the payment of
the fees and expenses of the Trustee
for the performance of its duties as
Escrow Agent. Each Escrow Agreement shall provide for the redemption of the applicable Refunded
Bonds subject to redemption in
accordance with the Certificate of
Award and shall provide irrevocable
instruction to the Trustee to effect
such redemption in accordance with
the Indenture. The Mayor, Director

debt service savings and minimize
negative arbitrage. The Director of
Finance is authorized and directed
to take such other actions as may
be
necessary
or
appropriate
to
accomplish the refunding of the
Refunded Bonds, including without
limitation, the retention of a firm of
independent certified public accountants to verify that the securities to
be in an Escrow Fund are of such
maturities or redemption dates, and
interest payment dates, and bear
such interest, as will be sufficient,
together with any available moneys
in an Escrow Fund, for the payment
of debt service on the Refunded
Bonds.
Section 7. Rebate Fund. There is
hereby established and ordered to be
maintained one or more separate
accounts (except when invested as
provided in the Indenture) within
the Rebate Fund held in the custody
of the Trustee under the Indenture.
The Rebate Fund is not pledged to
the payment of debt service and is
free and clear of any pledge or lien
given under the Indenture as security for the 2004 Bonds or the Outstanding
Bonds.
Calculations
of
excess earnings that may be due

1261

17
and payable to the federal government pursuant to the Code and
deposits to those accounts of the
Rebate Fund shall be made as provided in the applicable Supplemental Indenture.
Section 8. Other Provisions for
Payment of Outstanding Bonds. The
City may, from time to time, deposit
funds in trust with the Trustee for
the payment of principal and interest requirements on any Outstanding Bonds if, in the judgment of the
Director of Finance and the Director of Public Utilities, based on the
written advice of a Financial Advisor, doing so will improve the debt
service coverage ratio of the Waterworks System (being the ratio of
Net Revenues to Annual Debt Service Requirements, as defined in the
Indenture). The Director of Finance
is authorized to deposit into an
escrow fund, from time to time, moneys transferred from Fund No. 52-001
of the Water Division, in amounts
that, in the aggregate, do not exceed
$50,000,000, with the actual amount
of any deposit to be determined by
the Director of Finance in consultation with the Director of Public Utilities. In order to cause any amounts
so deposited to be dedicated and
applied solely to the payment of the
principal of and interest and any
redemption premium on the designated Outstanding Bonds, as and
when due at maturity or upon prior
redemption, the Mayor, Director of
Finance and Director of Public Utilities, or any two of them, are authorized and directed, in the name and
on behalf of the City, to sign and
deliver one or more escrow agreements approved as to form and correctness by the Director of Law, providing for the establishment of an
escrow fund as a trust fund in the
custody of the Trustee and the
investment, dedication and application of the moneys deposited therein and further providing for the payment to the Trustee of fees and
expenses for its performance of its
duties under the agreement. The
officers signing the agreement on
behalf of the City shall determine
that the agreement satisfies the
requirements of this Section, and
that determination shall be conclusively evidenced by the signing of
the agreement by those officers. The
Mayor, Director of Finance and
Director of Public Utilities, or any
two of them, are authorized, in the
name and on behalf of the City, to
sign and deliver agreements, approved as to form and correctness
by the Director of Law, with one or
more institutions, including agreements which will enable the City to
more
efficiently
structure
any
escrow funds established pursuant
to this Section, and thereby maximize debt service savings and minimize negative arbitrage. The Director of Finance is authorized and
directed to take such other actions
as may be necessary or appropriate
to accomplish any defeasance of the
designated Outstanding Bonds to be
paid from any escrow fund, including without limitation, the retention
of a firm of independent certified
public accountants to verify that the
securities to be deposited in escrow
are of such maturities or redemption
dates, and interest payment dates,
and bear such interest, as will be

18
sufficient, together with any available moneys, for the payment of
debt service on the designated Outstanding Bonds.
Section 9. Interest Hedge Agreements. This Council finds that by
engaging in interest hedge transactions, from time to time, the City
can, in effect, convert interest on all
or a portion of the 2004 Bonds from
a fixed rate to a floating rate, or
from a floating rate to a fixed rate,
or exchange one floating rate for
another floating rate with respect to
all or any portion of the 2004 Bonds
or otherwise hedge its interest rate
risk and thereby may reduce its cost
of borrowing by optimizing the relative amounts of fixed and floating
rate obligations or minimizing the
risk of variations in its debt service
costs or maximizing savings. To permit the City to have the flexibility
to undertake interest rate swap,
swaption, rate cap, rate collar and
other hedging transactions, from
time to time, and to establish the
procedures
for
approving
those
transactions, this Council authorizes
the execution and delivery of one or
more hedge agreements (each, a
“Hedge Agreement”) and any related agreements necessary for the
consummation of the transactions
contemplated by each Hedge Agreement.
The Director of Finance may
authorize one or more interest rate
hedge transactions in accordance
with the applicable Hedge Agreement; provided that (a) the maximum aggregate notional amount of
interest rate hedge transactions outstanding at any one time, net of offsetting interest rate hedge transactions, shall not exceed such amount
as will result in a lowering of the
ratings assigned to the Bonds by the
rating agencies, as is evidenced by
written correspondence from the rating agencies or policies published in
writing by the rating agencies, and
(b) the term of each interest rate
swap transaction shall not exceed 30
years. The approval of each interest
rate hedge transaction by the Director of Finance shall be conclusively
evidenced by the signing and delivery of the applicable Hedge Agreement by the Director of Finance.
The Director of Finance may obtain
the services of a swap advisor or
other financial advisor determined
by the Director of Finance to be
knowledgeable about hedging transactions to advise the City concerning any Hedge Agreement undertaken pursuant to this Section.
The City’s payment obligations
under each Hedge Agreement shall
be payable from the Net Revenues
of the Waterworks System and may
be secured by a pledge of the Net
Revenues on a parity with the
pledge given under the Indenture to
secure Bonds, subject to the requirements of Article XI of the Indenture
with respect to Parity Obligations.
The obligation of the City to make
payments under a Hedge Agreement
does not and shall not represent or
constitute a general obligation, debt,
bonded indebtedness or a pledge of
the faith and credit of the City.
Nothing shall give any party to a
Hedge Agreement the right to have
excises, ad valorem or other taxes

The City Record
levied by the City or the State for
the payment of any amounts due
under a Hedge Agreement.
Section 10. Covenants of the City.
The City, by issuance of the 2004
Bonds, covenants and agrees with
the Holders of the 2004 Bonds, that:
(a) The City will use the proceeds
of the 2004 Bonds to refinance any

Bonds,
to
fund
any
required deposit to the Debt Service
Reserve Fund, and to pay costs
relating to the issuance of the 2004
Bonds.
(b) The Clerk, or other appropriate officer of the City, will furnish
to the Original Purchasers and to
the Trustee a true transcript of proceedings, certified by the Clerk or
other officer, of all proceedings had

2004 Bonds, together with information from the City’s records as is
necessary to determine the regularity and validity of the issuance of
the 2004 Bonds.
(c) The City will, at any and all
times, cause to be done all such further acts and things and cause to be
signed and delivered all further
instruments as may be necessary to
carry out the purpose of the 2004
Bonds and this Ordinance or as may
be required by Section 13, Article
XVIII of the Constitution of Ohio or
the Charter of the City or the Indenture or the applicable Supplemental
Indenture and will comply with all
requirements of law applicable to
the Waterworks System and the
operation thereof.
(d) The City will observe and perform all its agreements and obligations provided for in the 2004 Bonds,
this Ordinance, the Indenture and
each Supplemental Indenture. All of
the obligations under this Ordinance
and the Indenture and each Supplemental Indenture are hereby established
as
duties
specifically
enjoined by law and resulting from
an office, trust or station upon the
City within the meaning of Section
2731.01, Ohio Revised Code.
(e) The City will use, and will
restrict the use and investment of,
the proceeds of the 2004 Bonds in
such manner and to such extent as
may be necessary so that (a) the
2004 Bonds will not (i) constitute
private activity bonds, arbitrage
bonds or hedge bonds under Sections
141, 148 or 149 of the Code or (ii) be
treated other than as bonds to which
Section 103(a) of the Code applies,
and (b) the interest thereon will not
be treated as an item of tax preference under Section 57 of the Code.
(f) The City covenants that (a) it
will take or cause to be taken such
actions that may be required of it
for the interest on the 2004 Bonds to
be and to remain excluded from
gross income for federal income tax
purposes, (b) it will not take or
authorize to be taken any actions
that would adversely affect that
exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting for it, will, among other acts of
compliance, (i) apply the proceeds
of the 2004 Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing,
(ii) restrict the yield on investment
property acquired with those proceeds, (iii) make timely rebate payments to the federal government,
(iv) maintain books and records and
make calculations and reports, and
(v) refrain from certain uses of pro-

1262

June 23, 2004
ceeds, and, as applicable, of property financed with such proceeds, all
in such manner and to the extent
necessary to assure such exclusion
of that interest under the Code.
Each covenant made in this section with respect to the 2004 Bonds
is also made with respect to all
issues for which any portion of the

Ord. No. 1189-04.
By Council Member Westbrook.
An emergency ordinance to amend
Section 3103.09 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as
amended by Ordinance No. 1035-04,
passed May 24, 2004, relating to the
unsafe structure and exterior property nuisances.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 3103.09 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended by
Ordinance No. 1035-04, passed May
24, 2004, is amended to read as follows:
Section 3103.09 Unsafe Structures
and Exterior Property Nuisances;
Violation
and
Remedial
Notices;
Cost Recovery
(a) Legislative Findings.
Council of the City of Cleveland
finds that:
(1) Structures that are vacant and
open to entry at doors, windows or
other points accessible to the general public:
A. Attract children to enter;
B. Become harborage for vermin;
C. Serve as temporary abode for
derelicts, vagrants and criminals;
and
D. Are likely to be damaged by
vandals or set ablaze by arsonists.
(2) Unkept grounds surrounding
such vacant, open structures invite
the dumping of garbage and rubbish
thereupon;
(3) Thousands of structures in
this City are made of wood-frame
construction
that
is
more
combustible than other building types;
(4) Thousands of structures in
this City are situated on narrow lots
and in close proximity to one another, thereby increasing the risk of
conflagration and spread of insect
and rodent infestation;
(5) Population loss and economic
decline experienced by the City in
recent years has caused the incidence of vacant, open structures,
high grass, weeds, junk, debris, and
junk motor vehicles to increase significantly;
(6) Such vacant, open structures
often become dilapidated because
they are not repaired by the owners
or persons in control of said structures;
(7) Structures that are vacant and
open to entry, high grass, weeds,
junk, debris, and junk motor vehicles depress the market value of
surrounding properties;
(8) The existence of certain hazardous conditions may require a
structure to be vacated; such conditions include but are not limited to:

June 23, 2004
A. Danger of structural collapse;
B. Inadequate heat or use of dangerous heating mechanism;
C. Danger of fire; and
D. Lack of plumbing in safe working order.
(9) Structures that remain boarded for an extended period of time
contribute to blight, cause a decrease in neighboring property values, create targets for arson, and
lead to the cancellation of homeowners’ insurance for neighboring
property owners.
(10) The following conditions provide
harborage
and
breeding
grounds for pests or otherwise create human-health problems:
A. Grass over 8 inches in height.
B. Noxious weeds including Russian, Canadian, or common thistle;
wild lettuce; wild mustard; wild
parsley; ragweed; milk weed; iron
weed; wild plants that can cause
skin reaction upon contact or produce or aggravate hay fever, asthma, allergic respiratory reaction, or
similar conditions; and all other noxious weeds.
C. Refuse including trash, junk,
garbage and food waste, offal, animal wastes, tires, and all other
waste materials.
D. Stagnant surface water.
(11) As used in this Chapter,
“junk motor vehicle” means a motor
vehicle that meets all of the following criteria:
A. Three model years old or older;
B. Apparently inoperable; and
C. Extensively damaged, including, but not limited to, any of the
following: missing wheels, tires,
engine, motor, or transmission. (R.C.
§505.173)
(b) Declaration of Nuisance.
(1) All buildings or structures
that are injurious to or a menace to
the public health, safety or welfare,
or are structurally unsafe, unsanitary or not provided with adequate
safe egress, or which constitute a
fire hazard, or which are vacant and
open to public entry, or which are
otherwise dangerous to human life
or injurious to the public, or which
in relation to existing use constitute
a hazard to the public health, safety or welfare by reason of inadequate
maintenance,
dilapidation,
obsolescence or abandonment, are,
severally, for the purposes of this
Building
Code,
declared
to
be
“unsafe structures”. All such unsafe
structures or conditions are hereby
declared to be public nuisances. The
public nuisance shall be abated by
correction of the violations to the
minimum standards of the Codified
Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
applicable City rules and regulations, the Ohio Revised Code, and
Ohio Administrative Code including
the Ohio Building Code, or by demolition.
(2) The conditions listed in division (a)(10) of this section are
declared to be nuisances that shall
be removed, destroyed, or abated
from any property on which they
are found.
(3) Junk motor vehicles as defined in division (a)(11) of this section are declared to be nuisances
that shall be removed or abated
from any property on which they
are found. Junk motor vehicles are
declared to be a nuisance because:
A. They harbor rodents, vermin,
and other pests;
B. They contain toxic substances
and flammable liquids and fumes;

The City Record
C. They attract children to enter;
D. They serve as temporary abode
for derelicts, vagrants and criminals;
E. They diminish neighboring
property values; and,
F. They are likely to be damaged
by vandals or set ablaze by arsonists.
(c) Effective Boarding Pending
Rehabilitation.
(1) Permits:
Pending the correction of the violations to the minimum standards of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, applicable City
rules and regulations, the Ohio
Revised Code, and the Ohio Administrative Code, including the Ohio
Building Code, the owner of a structure
may
secure
the
structure
through effective boarding. In order
to effectively board the structure,
the owner of the structure shall
apply, within 3 days of receiving a
notice of violation, to the Division
of Building and Housing for a permit to board. The Division of Building and Housing shall review the
condition of the structure, determine
if it can be effectively boarded, and
grant or deny the owner's permit to
board, setting forth special requirements, if any, necessary for compliance with minimum standards for
effective boarding. The owner shall
effectively board the structure within 3 days of the issuance of a boarding permit, or within such other
time limit that the Director deems
appropriate.
Structures
that
are
boarded without first obtaining a
boarding permit shall continue to be
considered public nuisances subject
to demolition. Within thirty (30)
days of the issuance of a permit to
board, the owner of the structure
shall apply for a rehabilitation permit pursuant to Section 3105.06 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976. The Director may
grant an extension of time for
acquiring a rehabilitation permit
upon the owner’s written request
and for good cause shown. Failure
of the owner to obtain a rehabilitation permit subsequent to effective
boarding will result in the structure
being deemed a public nuisance, and
scheduled for demolition.
(2) Materials:
The effective boarding of a structure shall include, but not be limited to, doors, windows, or other areas
of the structure open to ingress and
egress and to weather elements at
any and all levels of the structure.
Such openings shall be secured by
plywood, not less than 1/2" thick, or
other material of equal strength, cut
and fit into the openings. Openings
in excess of forty-eight inches wide
shall be framed with 2" x 4" lumber
and plywood, or equivalent material
fastened twenty-four inches on center onto frame. The plywood or
equivalent material shall be fastened into the openings by screw
type nails or lag screws.
(3) Maintenance:
Upon
effectively
boarding
the
structure, the owner shall monitor
and maintain the structure and its
surrounding premises in a safe, sanitary and secured condition. Any
portion of the exterior structure
which is deemed to be potentially
hazardous due to deteriorated conditions, or to be structurally unsound shall be removed or treated in
such a manner so as to eliminate
the hazard. The exterior premises

1289

45
shall be maintained free of high
weeds, debris, junk vehicles, and
conditions that may provide harborage for rodents. Failure of the
owner to properly maintain the
building in the above condition, will
result in the structure being deemed
a public nuisance, and scheduled for
demolition.
(4) Rehabilitation:
Rehabilitation of the structure
shall commence within 30 days of
receiving a rehabilitation permit
pursuant to Section 3105.06 of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976 unless such time period is
extended with permission from the
Director. If rehabilitation of the
effectively boarded structure does
not commence within this time period, or if the rehabilitation permit is
otherwise invalidated or revoked,
then the Director may declare that
the nuisance has not been abated
and schedule the structure for demolition.
(d) Examination and Condemnation.
(1) The Director is authorized to
examine or cause to be examined
every building or other structure
reported to be unsafe or damaged or
injurious to or a menace to the public, and shall make a written record
of such examination.
(2) The Director may designate as
a public nuisance those particular
structures or conditions found to be
unsafe pursuant to division (b) of
this section.
(3) The Director may also declare
that a nuisance structure which, due
to its advanced state of dilapidation,
substantial fire damage or structural infirmity, is an immediate hazard
to human life or health, may only
be abated by immediate repair and
rehabilitation to the minimum standards of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, applicable
City rules and regulations, the Ohio
Revised Code, and Ohio Administrative Code including the Ohio Building Code, or by demolition.
(4) Whenever the Director finds a
vacant structure open to entry at
doors, windows or other points
accessible to the general public, he
may cause the structure to be
secured at those points of entry. The
Director shall be authorized at any
time to enter upon the premises to
secure the structure in order to
lessen the severity of the public nuisance. In securing such structure,
the Director may call upon any
department, division or bureau of
the City for whatever assistance
may be necessary, or may, by private contract, secure such structure.
Such securing shall not be deemed
to constitute “effective boarding''
pursuant to division (b) of this section, and it does not abate the nuisance condition of an unsafe structure, as declared pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section, unless so
declared in writing by the Director.
Subsequent notice, issued pursuant
to
division
(e)(1)
below,
shall
include the fact that the Director
has found it necessary to take
appropriate action to secure the
structure.
(e) Notice of Violation.
(1) Whenever the Director finds a
building, structure or portion thereof to be unsafe and determines it or
the property on which it is located
to be a public nuisance as defined
in this Chapter, he shall forward by
certified mail to the owner, agent or

46
person in control of such building,
structure or portion thereof and to
any mortgagee of record a written
notice
of
violation
stating
the
defects thereof. Such notice of violation shall require the owner within a stated time to abate the nuisance condition of such structure by
correction of the violations and
defects to the minimum standards of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, applicable City
rules and regulations, the Ohio
Revised Code, and Ohio Administrative Code including the Ohio Building Code, or by demolition and
removal of the building, structure,
or portion thereof. The notice also
shall state that if the nuisance is
not abated within the required time
that the Director may take appropriate action to repair, remove, or
otherwise abate the public nuisance
and that the owner, agent or person
in control shall be responsible for
the costs. The handing of the violation notice to the owner, agent or
person in control of the building,
structure or portion thereof is legal
and valid service and no other form
of
service
is
necessary
(actual
notice).
(2) If the person to whom such
notice and order is addressed is not
found after a reasonable and diligent search, then such notice and
order shall be sent by certified mail
to his tax mailing address, if available, as indicated on the County tax
duplicate, and a copy of such notice
shall be posted in a conspicuous
place on the premises to which it
relates. Such mailing and posting
shall be deemed legal service of
such notice.
(3) An owner, agent or person in
control of such structure or building,
a mortgagee of record, or a lien
holder of record who has received a
notice of violation or a notice to
make corrections to the minimum
standards of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, applicable City rules and regulations,
the Ohio Revised Code, and Ohio
Administrative Code including the
Ohio Building Code, or to demolish
and remove, as provided for in this
section, shall inform prospective
purchasers, vendees, grantees, assignees, lessees, or land contractees
thereof of such notice of violation or
the notice to make corrections, or to
demolish and remove. No person
shall transfer to a vendee, grantee,
assignee, lessee, land contractee or
any other transferee any interest in
a building, structure or portion
thereof after receiving a notice of
violation to make corrections, or to
demolish and remove the same,
without first providing the transferee with a copy of such notice.
(4) A. No person, agent, firm or
corporation shall sell, by land contract or otherwise, any interest in
any structure or building without
furnishing the buyer, prior to the
sale a copy of any outstanding
notice or order from the City, including any notice of violation or any
outstanding notice to make corrections to the minimum standards of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio 1976, applicable City rules
and regulations, the Ohio Revised
Code including the Ohio Building
Code, or any outstanding notice to
demolish and remove.
No buyer or grantee, by land contract or otherwise, shall obtain any
interest in any structure or building

The City Record
without obtaining from the seller,
prior
to
sale,
the
documents
described above.
B. No person, agent, firm or corporation acting in the capacity of an
escrow agent in any real estate
transaction involving the sale of a
structure or building situated in the
City, shall disburse any funds unless the provisions of this division
have been met.
C. Any buyer or grantee, by land
contract or otherwise, of a structure
or building, shall begin at the date
of transfer to comply with any
notice or order obtained or to be
obtained pursuant to this division
and, within ten days of the date of
transfer, shall notify the Director, in
writing, of the actions that will be
taken to comply. The Director may
then establish a reasonable time to
comply.
(f) Vacating Buildings and Prohibiting Use.
The Director may also require in
the notice issued pursuant to division (e)(1) of this section that the
building, structure or portion thereof be vacated, not be reoccupied, or
used until the specified repairs and
improvements are completed, inspected, and approved by the Director. The Director may cause to be
posted at each entrance to such
building or structure a notice as follows: “THIS STRUCTURE IS IN A
DANGEROUS CONDITION AND HAS
BEEN CONDEMNED AND ITS USE
HAS BEEN PROHIBITED BY THE
DIRECTOR
OF
BUILDING
AND
HOUSING.” Such notice shall remain
posted until the required corrections
are made or demolition is completed. No person shall remove such
notice without written permission of
the Director, nor shall any person
use or enter the building or structure except for the purpose of making the required corrections or
demolishing or effectively boarding
the building or structure, or securing the structure pursuant to division (d)(4) of this section.
(g) Right to Appeal.
The owner, agent or person in control shall have a right to appeal
from the notice and decision of the
Director as provided in this section
and appear before the Board of
Building Standards and Building
Appeals at a specified time and
place to show cause why he should
not comply with such notice. Any
notice served by the Director shall
automatically become a final order
if a written notice of appeal before
the Board is not filed in the office
of the Board within the time set
forth in such notice from the Director. In the absence of an appeal, all
actions taken pursuant thereto shall
constitute a valid exercise of the
police powers of the City of Cleveland.
(h) Noncompliance with Notice.
(1) Director Authorized To Demolish, Remove, or Abate. In case
the owner, agent or person in control fails, neglects or refuses to comply with the notice to repair or rehabilitate, or to demolish and remove
a public nuisance or unsafe building, structure or portion thereof, the
Director
may
take
appropriate
action to demolish and remove an
unsafe structure or to remove or
abate any condition that is defined
as a nuisance under this Chapter.
(2) Action by Director of Law.
The Director may advise the Director of Law of the facts in the case,

1290

June 23, 2004
who may institute appropriate action in the court to cause correction
of the violations and defects, or
demolition and removal, or effective
boarding of such building or structure pending rehabilitation.
(3) Rehabilitation Permits Not
Bar To Director’s Action To Abate.
The securing of rehabilitation permits for such building or structure
shall not in and of itself bar the
Director from taking action to abate
the nuisance.
(4) Effective Boarding by Director. The Director may, with respect
to any condemned structure, also
take appropriate action to effectively board such structure, or to secure
it pursuant to division (d)(4) of this
section. The Director shall specifically state in writing his findings
with respect to such structure, and
shall determine whether to secure or
to effectively board, based upon factors which may include the following: the distance of the structure
from neighboring structures, the
type of structure, the extent to
which the structure is secured, the
likelihood of vandalism or arson, the
extent of the deterioration, the economic likelihood of eventual rehabilitation of the structure, or cost of
securing or effectively boarding the
structure.
(5)
Failure
To
Comply
with
Notice. In case the owner, agent or
person in control fails, neglects or
refuses to comply with the notice to
repair or rehabilitate, or to demolish
and remove a public nuisance or
unsafe building, structure or portion
thereof, or to remove or abate any
other condition that is defined as a
nuisance under this Chapter, the
Director
may
take
appropriate
action to take repair or maintenance
measures or to otherwise abate the
public nuisance. The Director shall
specifically state in writing the
findings with respect to the structure, and shall determine whether to
perform repair or maintenance upon
factors which may include the following: the distance of the structure
from neighboring structures, the
type of structure, the extent of deterioration, the likelihood of vandalism or arson, the economic likelihood of eventual complete rehabilitation of the structure, the cost of
repair or maintenance.
(6) Notice of Intent To Demolish.
Except as provided in subsection (i)
hereof, the Director shall give written notice informing the owner,
agent, or person in control, mortgagee of record and lien holders of
record of the City’s intention to
demolish and remove the unsafe
building or structure at least 30
days prior to such intended action
by the City. Such notice may be
effective concurrently with the violation notice. A condemned structure, once effectively boarded by the
owner pending rehabilitation that
subsequently becomes open to entry,
may
then
be
demolished
and
removed, subject to the Director giving written notice as stated in divisions (e)(1) and (h) of this section,
upon a finding by the Director that
the structure can no longer be effectively boarded.
(i) Junk Motor Vehicle Removal
(1) Notice. The Director shall send
written notice, by certified mail
with return receipt requested, to the
person having the right of possession of the property on which a junk
motor vehicle, as defined in this

June 23, 2004
Chapter, is left. This notice shall
notify the person having right of
possession of the property that within ten days of mailing of the notice,
the junk motor vehicle either shall
be covered by being housed in a
garage or other suitable structure or
removed from the property. The
notice shall also be posted in a conspicuous place on the property.
(2) Director Authorized To Remove Junk Motor Vehicles. The
Director is authorized to provide for
and order the removal of a junk
motor vehicle when the junk motor
vehicle has not been either covered
by being housed in a garage or
other suitable structure or removed
from the property, within ten days
of the date of mailing and posting
of the notice as set forth above.
(j) Cases of Emergency.
In cases of emergency that, in the
opinion of the Director, involve
immediate danger to human life or
health, the Director shall promptly
cause the building, structure or portion thereof to be made safe or
removed. For this purpose he may
at once enter such structure or land
on which it stands, or any abutting
land or structure, with such assistance and at such cost as he deems
necessary. He may request the
Director of Public Safety to enforce
the orders he gives that are necessary to cause the building, structure
or portion thereof to be made safe
or removed. The Director of Public
Safety has the authority to enforce
such orders. He may order adjacent
structures and premises to be vacated, and protect the public by an
appropriate fence or such other
means as may be necessary, and for
this purpose may close a public or
private way.
(k) Costs.
(1) Any and all expenses or costs
incurred under this section for the
removal, repair, alteration, securing
or boarding of a building or structure or for abating any other nuisance shall be paid by the owner of
such building or structure, except
when such expenses or costs are
incurred with respect to a government or school building owned by a
governmental entity or political subdivision and are funded by federal
money.
(2) Whenever an inspection is
made after the compliance date stated on a Notice of Violation of the
Building Code, the Housing Code, or
the Zoning Code or after a compliance date determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to determine
whether the violation has been
remedied and the violation has not
been remedied, or an additional permit is obtained for work previously
permitted and the original permit
has expired or was appropriately
voided, a fee of $100.00 shall be
charged for each such inspection,
except that this fee shall not apply
to one-family and two-family owneroccupied dwelling structures.
(3) If the owner fails to pay for
the costs of removal, repair, alteration, securing or boarding or of
inspections of violations that have
not been remedied within 30 days
from the date the Director of Building and Housing sends a statement
of the charges and costs incurred
therein, the Director may certify
such amount to the Commissioner of
Assessments and Licenses. The Commissioner
of
Assessments
and
Licenses shall make written return

The City Record
to the County Auditor of the action
under this section with a statement
of the charges for services, the
amount paid for the performing of
such labor and a proper description
of the premises. Certification to the
County Auditor is for the purpose of
making expenses and costs a lien
upon such lands, to be collected as
other taxes and returned to the City
with the General Fund, with special
accounting thereof in accordance
with Ohio R.C. 715.261.
(4) Notwithstanding the method of
collection set forth in this division,
the Director of Law may take any
action necessary to collect the costs
of demolition, boarding, or other nuisance abatement from the owner or
other responsible party.
