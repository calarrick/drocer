purpose of defraying the expenses
incident to the administration of the
provisions of this Chapter.
(c) The owner shall promptly notify the Commissioner in writing of

to the administration of the provisions of this Chapter. No additional fee or permit application is

for a permit to the Commissioner of
Building and Housing for review
and approval. The Commissioner of
Building and Housing shall determine whether or not the provisions
of the Building or Zoning Codes
would be violated by the installation
of the telephone, and particularly,
set back requirements, use restrictions, restrictions as to attachments
to structures, and if located in a

that a specified number of parking
spaces be available for use by the
business. These officials shall notify the Director in writing of any
objections to the permit within thirty days after receiving the application.

then the Commissioner shall also
refer it to the City Planning Commission or Landmarks Commission,
whichever is applicable, and that
commission shall notify the Director in writing of any objections to
the permit within thirty days after
receiving the application. In deciding whether or not to object to the
issuance of the permit, the City
Planning
Commission
or
Landmarks
Commission,
acting
in
accordance with its rules and regulations, shall consider whether the
placement of the phone is consistent with the design review standards for the district; whether it is
consistent with other streetscape
elements in the vicinity and any
overall streetscape plan for the district; whether there have been
streetscape improvements in the
area such as special lighting, landscaping,
pavers,
and
the
like;
whether there is any visual clutter
concerns if a pay telephone is

667

27
installed; and whether there are
any architectural or historical considerations. As used in this division, “design review district” means
any area in which building permits
require review and approval of
either the City Planning Commission or the Landmarks Commission.
(f) A permit application shall be
disapproved if a telephone has been
determined to be a nuisance pursuant to this Chapter within 500 feet
of the proposed telephone location
within the previous two years, and
may be disapproved if the applicant
has violated this Chapter within the
previous one year.
(g) Upon receipt of a completed
application that demonstrates that
the telephone will be in compliance
with this chapter and all required
information and fees, the Commissioner shall issue to the owner an
outdoor pay telephone permit and
shall provide the owner with a label
to be affixed to each telephone identifying the registration number and
location of the telephone. The Commissioner shall ordinarily approve
or disapprove a permit within 45
days of the receipt of a completed
application and fee, unless the exercise of due diligence by the Commissioner requires that a longer
period of time be taken.
A telephone for which a permit is issued
shall be installed within 30 days of
the issuance of the permit or the
permit is void and no longer effective. No refund of permit fees shall
be given if the permit becomes void.
