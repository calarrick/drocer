dream and joining the National
League of Cities in urging state and
federal leaders to work with the
City of Cleveland to develop programs and policies that will maximize access to affordable housing,

Whereas, the American Dream is
rooted in principles of fairness,
opportunity, and a chance to succeed; and

cities and towns are on the front of
service delivery and are the level of
government that citizens look to
first to ensure a good quality of life
and a bright future; and
Whereas, the National League of
Cities believes that government at
all levels has a responsibility to
work together to develop policies
and programs that will give every
American an opportunity to achieve
the American dream; and
Whereas, a new National League
of Cities public opinion survey
shows that two-thirds of Americans
believe the dream is becoming harder to achieve especially for young
families and nearly three quarters
believe government should actively
work to help people achieve the
American dream; and
Whereas, this Council is committed to working with other governmental leaders to maximize access
to affordable housing, strengthen
public education, create opportunities
to
develop
marketable
job
skills, and build an inclusive community; and

peace, property, health or safety,

An emergency resolution encouraging the Board of Trustees of the
Cleveland Public Library and the
Director of the Cleveland Public
Library to conduct or participate in
an analysis to determine the advantages and disadvantages of merging

Whereas, Cleveland has the highest poverty rate in the nation and

October 6, 2004
its homeowners can least afford
additional tax burdens; and
Whereas, in November of 2003,

valued at $100,000 pay $36.00 a year
in property taxes to fund the Cuyahoga County Public Library; and
Whereas, the Main Library of the
Cleveland Public Library is located
in downtown Cleveland and is utilized by both City of Cleveland
homeowners and suburban homeowners; and
Whereas, during these challenging economic times, it is imperative

potential savings could be used to
offset the property tax increases
sought by the Cleveland Municipal
School District; and

now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
