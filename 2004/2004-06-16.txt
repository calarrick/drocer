An emergency ordinance to amend
Section 3103.09 of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as
amended by Ordinance No. 1035-04,
passed May 24, 2004, relating to the
unsafe structure and exterior property nuisances.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Section 3103.09 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, as amended by
Ordinance No. 1035-04, passed May
24, 2004, is amended to read as follows:
Section 3103.09 Unsafe Structures
and Exterior Property Nuisances;
Violation
and
Remedial
Notices;
Cost Recovery
(a) Legislative Findings.
Council of the City of Cleveland
finds that:

1160

June 16, 2004
(1) Structures that are vacant and
open to entry at doors, windows or
other points accessible to the general public:
A. Attract children to enter;
B. Become harborage for vermin;
C. Serve as temporary abode for
derelicts, vagrants and criminals;
and
D. Are likely to be damaged by
vandals or set ablaze by arsonists.
(2) Unkept grounds surrounding
such vacant, open structures invite
the dumping of garbage and rubbish
thereupon;
(3) Thousands of structures in
this City are made of wood-frame
construction
that
is
more
combustible than other building types;
(4) Thousands of structures in
this City are situated on narrow lots
and in close proximity to one another, thereby increasing the risk of
conflagration and spread of insect
and rodent infestation;
(5) Population loss and economic
decline experienced by the City in
recent years has caused the incidence of vacant, open structures,
high grass, weeds, junk, debris, and
junk motor vehicles to increase significantly;
(6) Such vacant, open structures
often become dilapidated because
they are not repaired by the owners
or persons in control of said structures;
(7) Structures that are vacant and
open to entry, high grass, weeds,
junk, debris, and junk motor vehicles depress the market value of
surrounding properties;
(8) The existence of certain hazardous conditions may require a
structure to be vacated; such conditions include but are not limited to:
A. Danger of structural collapse;
B. Inadequate heat or use of dangerous heating mechanism;
C. Danger of fire; and
D. Lack of plumbing in safe working order.
(9) Structures that remain boarded for an extended period of time
contribute to blight, cause a decrease in neighboring property values, create targets for arson, and
lead to the cancellation of homeowners’ insurance for neighboring
property owners.
(10) The following conditions provide
harborage
and
breeding
grounds for pests or otherwise create human-health problems:
A. Grass over 8 inches in height.
B. Noxious weeds including Russian, Canadian, or common thistle;
wild lettuce; wild mustard; wild
parsley; ragweed; milk weed; iron
weed; wild plants that can cause
skin reaction upon contact or produce or aggravate hay fever, asthma, allergic respiratory reaction, or
similar conditions; and all other noxious weeds.
C. Refuse including trash, junk,
garbage and food waste, offal, animal wastes, tires, and all other
waste materials.
D. Stagnant surface water.
(11) As used in this Chapter,
“junk motor vehicle” means a motor
vehicle that meets all of the following criteria:
A. Three model years old or older;
B. Apparently inoperable; and
C. Extensively damaged, including, but not limited to, any of the
following: missing wheels, tires,
engine, motor, or transmission. (R.C.
§505.173)
(b) Declaration of Nuisance.
(1) All buildings or structures
that are injurious to or a menace to
the public health, safety or welfare,

June 16, 2004
or are structurally unsafe, unsanitary or not provided with adequate
safe egress, or which constitute a
fire hazard, or which are vacant and
open to public entry, or which are
otherwise dangerous to human life
or injurious to the public, or which
in relation to existing use constitute
a hazard to the public health, safety or welfare by reason of inadequate
maintenance,
dilapidation,
obsolescence or abandonment, are,
severally, for the purposes of this
Building
Code,
declared
to
be
“unsafe structures”. All such unsafe
structures or conditions are hereby
declared to be public nuisances. The
public nuisance shall be abated by
correction of the violations to the
minimum standards of the Codified
Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
applicable City rules and regulations, the Ohio Revised Code, and
Ohio Administrative Code including
the Ohio Building Code, or by demolition.
(2) The conditions listed in division (a)(10) of this section are
declared to be nuisances that shall
be removed, destroyed, or abated
from any property on which they
are found.
(3) Junk motor vehicles as defined in division (a)(11) of this section are declared to be nuisances
that shall be removed or abated
from any property on which they
are found. Junk motor vehicles are
declared to be a nuisance because:
A. They harbor rodents, vermin,
and other pests;
B. They contain toxic substances
and flammable liquids and fumes;
C. They attract children to enter;
D. They serve as temporary abode
for derelicts, vagrants and criminals;
E. They diminish neighboring
property values; and,
F. They are likely to be damaged
by vandals or set ablaze by arsonists.
(c) Effective Boarding Pending
Rehabilitation.
(1) Permits:
Pending the correction of the violations to the minimum standards of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, applicable City
rules and regulations, the Ohio
Revised Code, and the Ohio Administrative Code, including the Ohio
Building Code, the owner of a structure
may
secure
the
structure
through effective boarding. In order
to effectively board the structure,
the owner of the structure shall
apply, within 3 days of receiving a
notice of violation, to the Division
of Building and Housing for a permit to board. The Division of Building and Housing shall review the
condition of the structure, determine
if it can be effectively boarded, and
grant or deny the owner's permit to
board, setting forth special requirements, if any, necessary for compliance with minimum standards for
effective boarding. The owner shall
effectively board the structure within 3 days of the issuance of a boarding permit, or within such other
time limit that the Director deems
appropriate.
Structures
that
are
boarded without first obtaining a
boarding permit shall continue to be
considered public nuisances subject
to demolition. Within thirty (30)
days of the issuance of a permit to
board, the owner of the structure
shall apply for a rehabilitation permit pursuant to Section 3105.06 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976. The Director may
grant an extension of time for

The City Record
acquiring a rehabilitation permit
upon the owner’s written request
and for good cause shown. Failure
of the owner to obtain a rehabilitation permit subsequent to effective
boarding will result in the structure
being deemed a public nuisance, and
scheduled for demolition.
(2) Materials:
The effective boarding of a structure shall include, but not be limited to, doors, windows, or other areas
of the structure open to ingress and
egress and to weather elements at
any and all levels of the structure.
Such openings shall be secured by
plywood, not less than 1/2" thick, or
other material of equal strength, cut
and fit into the openings. Openings
in excess of forty-eight inches wide
shall be framed with 2" x 4" lumber
and plywood, or equivalent material
fastened twenty-four inches on center onto frame. The plywood or
equivalent material shall be fastened into the openings by screw
type nails or lag screws.
(3) Maintenance:
Upon
effectively
boarding
the
structure, the owner shall monitor
and maintain the structure and its
surrounding premises in a safe, sanitary and secured condition. Any
portion of the exterior structure
which is deemed to be potentially
hazardous due to deteriorated conditions, or to be structurally unsound shall be removed or treated in
such a manner so as to eliminate
the hazard. The exterior premises
shall be maintained free of high
weeds, debris, junk vehicles, and
conditions that may provide harborage for rodents. Failure of the
owner to properly maintain the
building in the above condition, will
result in the structure being deemed
a public nuisance, and scheduled for
demolition.
(4) Rehabilitation:
Rehabilitation of the structure
shall commence within 30 days of
receiving a rehabilitation permit
pursuant to Section 3105.06 of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976 unless such time period is
extended with permission from the
Director. If rehabilitation of the
effectively boarded structure does
not commence within this time period, or if the rehabilitation permit is
otherwise invalidated or revoked,
then the Director may declare that
the nuisance has not been abated
and schedule the structure for demolition.
(d) Examination and Condemnation.
(1) The Director is authorized to
examine or cause to be examined
every building or other structure
reported to be unsafe or damaged or
injurious to or a menace to the public, and shall make a written record
of such examination.
(2) The Director may designate as
a public nuisance those particular
structures or conditions found to be
unsafe pursuant to division (b) of
this section.
(3) The Director may also declare
that a nuisance structure which, due
to its advanced state of dilapidation,
substantial fire damage or structural infirmity, is an immediate hazard
to human life or health, may only
be abated by immediate repair and
rehabilitation to the minimum standards of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, applicable
City rules and regulations, the Ohio
Revised Code, and Ohio Administrative Code including the Ohio Building Code, or by demolition.

1161

(4) Whenever the Director finds a
vacant structure open to entry at
doors, windows or other points
accessible to the general public, he
may cause the structure to be
secured at those points of entry. The
Director shall be authorized at any
time to enter upon the premises to
secure the structure in order to
lessen the severity of the public nuisance. In securing such structure,
the Director may call upon any
department, division or bureau of
the City for whatever assistance
may be necessary, or may, by private contract, secure such structure.
Such securing shall not be deemed
to constitute “effective boarding''
pursuant to division (b) of this section, and it does not abate the nuisance condition of an unsafe structure, as declared pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section, unless so
declared in writing by the Director.
Subsequent notice, issued pursuant
to
division
(e)(1)
below,
shall
include the fact that the Director
has found it necessary to take
appropriate action to secure the
structure.
(e) Notice of Violation.
(1) Whenever the Director finds a
building, structure or portion thereof to be unsafe and determines it or
the property on which it is located
to be a public nuisance as defined
in this Chapter, he shall forward by
certified mail to the owner, agent or
person in control of such building,
structure or portion thereof and to
any mortgagee of record a written
notice
of
violation
stating
the
defects thereof. Such notice of violation shall require the owner within a stated time to abate the nuisance condition of such structure by
correction of the violations and
defects to the minimum standards of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, applicable City
rules and regulations, the Ohio
Revised Code, and Ohio Administrative Code including the Ohio Building Code, or by demolition and
removal of the building, structure,
or portion thereof. The notice also
shall state that if the nuisance is
not abated within the required time
that the Director may take appropriate action to repair, remove, or
otherwise abate the public nuisance
and that the owner, agent or person
in control shall be responsible for
the costs. The handing of the violation notice to the owner, agent or
person in control of the building,
structure or portion thereof is legal
and valid service and no other form
of
service
is
necessary
(actual
notice).
(2) If the person to whom such
notice and order is addressed is not
found after a reasonable and diligent search, then such notice and
order shall be sent by certified mail
to his tax mailing address, if available, as indicated on the County tax
duplicate, and a copy of such notice
shall be posted in a conspicuous
place on the premises to which it
relates.
Such mailing and posting
shall be deemed legal service of
such notice.
(3) An owner, agent or person in
control of such structure or building,
a mortgagee of record, or a lien
holder of record who has received a
notice of violation or a notice to
make corrections to the minimum
standards of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, applicable City rules and regulations,
the Ohio Revised Code, and Ohio
Administrative Code including the
Ohio Building Code, or to demolish

22
and remove, as provided for in this
section, shall inform prospective
purchasers, vendees, grantees, assignees, lessees, or land contractees
thereof of such notice of violation or
the notice to make corrections, or to
demolish and remove. No person
shall transfer to a vendee, grantee,
assignee, lessee, land contractee or
any other transferee any interest in
a building, structure or portion
thereof after receiving a notice of
violation to make corrections, or to
demolish and remove the same,
without first providing the transferee with a copy of such notice.
(4) A. No person, agent, firm or
corporation shall sell, by land contract or otherwise, any interest in
any structure or building without
furnishing the buyer, prior to the
sale a copy of any outstanding
notice or order from the City, including any notice of violation or any
outstanding notice to make corrections to the minimum standards of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio 1976, applicable City rules
and regulations, the Ohio Revised
Code including the Ohio Building
Code, or any outstanding notice to
demolish and remove.
No buyer or grantee, by land contract or otherwise, shall obtain any
interest in any structure or building
without obtaining from the seller,
prior
to
sale,
the
documents
described above.
B. No person, agent, firm or corporation acting in the capacity of an
escrow agent in any real estate
transaction involving the sale of a
structure or building situated in the
City, shall disburse any funds unless the provisions of this division
have been met.
C. Any buyer or grantee, by land
contract or otherwise, of a structure
or building, shall begin at the date
of transfer to comply with any
notice or order obtained or to be
obtained pursuant to this division
and, within ten days of the date of
transfer, shall notify the Director, in
writing, of the actions that will be
taken to comply. The Director may
then establish a reasonable time to
comply.
(f) Vacating Buildings and Prohibiting Use.
The Director may also require in
the notice issued pursuant to division (e)(1) of this section that the
building, structure or portion thereof be vacated, not be reoccupied, or
used until the specified repairs and
improvements are completed, inspected, and approved by the Director. The Director may cause to be
posted at each entrance to such
building or structure a notice as follows: “THIS STRUCTURE IS IN A
DANGEROUS CONDITION AND HAS
BEEN CONDEMNED AND ITS USE
HAS BEEN PROHIBITED BY THE
DIRECTOR
OF
BUILDING
AND
HOUSING.” Such notice shall remain
posted until the required corrections
are made or demolition is completed. No person shall remove such
notice without written permission of
the Director, nor shall any person
use or enter the building or structure except for the purpose of making the required corrections or
demolishing or effectively boarding
the building or structure, or securing the structure pursuant to division (d)(4) of this section.
(g) Right to Appeal.
The owner, agent or person in control shall have a right to appeal
from the notice and decision of the
Director as provided in this section
and appear before the Board of

The City Record
Building Standards and Building
Appeals at a specified time and
place to show cause why he should
not comply with such notice. Any
notice served by the Director shall
automatically become a final order
if a written notice of appeal before
the Board is not filed in the office
of the Board within the time set
forth in such notice from the Director. In the absence of an appeal, all
actions taken pursuant thereto shall
constitute a valid exercise of the
police powers of the City of Cleveland.
(h) Noncompliance with Notice.
(1) Director Authorized To Demolish, Remove, or Abate. In case
the owner, agent or person in control fails, neglects or refuses to comply with the notice to repair or rehabilitate, or to demolish and remove
a public nuisance or unsafe building, structure or portion thereof, the
Director
may
take
appropriate
action to demolish and remove an
unsafe structure or to remove or
abate any condition that is defined
as a nuisance under this Chapter.
(2) Action by Director of Law.
The Director may advise the Director of Law of the facts in the case,
who may institute appropriate action in the court to cause correction
of the violations and defects, or
demolition and removal, or effective
boarding of such building or structure pending rehabilitation.
(3) Rehabilitation Permits Not
Bar To Director’s Action To Abate.
The securing of rehabilitation permits for such building or structure
shall not in and of itself bar the
Director from taking action to abate

record of the City’s intention to
demolish and remove the unsafe
building or structure at least 30

Chapter, is left. This notice shall
notify the person having right of
possession of the property that within ten days of mailing of the notice,
the junk motor vehicle either shall
be covered by being housed in a
garage or other suitable structure or
removed from the property. The
notice shall also be posted in a conspicuous place on the property.
(2) Director Authorized To Remove Junk Motor Vehicles. The
Director is authorized to provide for
and order the removal of a junk
motor vehicle when the junk motor
vehicle has not been either covered
by being housed in a garage or
other suitable structure or removed
from the property, within ten days
of the date of mailing and posting
of the notice as set forth above.
(j) Cases of Emergency.
In cases of emergency that, in the
opinion of the Director, involve
immediate danger to human life or
health, the Director shall promptly
cause the building, structure or portion thereof to be made safe or
removed. For this purpose he may
at once enter such structure or land
on which it stands, or any abutting
land or structure, with such assistance and at such cost as he deems
necessary. He may request the
Director of Public Safety to enforce
the orders he gives that are necessary to cause the building, structure
or portion thereof to be made safe
or removed. The Director of Public
Safety has the authority to enforce
such orders. He may order adjacent
structures and premises to be vacated, and protect the public by an
appropriate fence or such other
means as may be necessary, and for
this purpose may close a public or
private way.
(k) Costs.
(1) Any and all expenses or costs
incurred under this section for the
removal, repair, alteration, securing
or boarding of a building or structure or for abating any other nuisance shall be paid by the owner of
such building or structure, except
when such expenses or costs are
incurred with respect to a government or school building owned by a
governmental entity or political subdivision and are funded by federal
money.
(2) Whenever an inspection is
made after the compliance date stated on a Notice of Violation of the
Building Code, the Housing Code, or

June 16, 2004
the Zoning Code or after a compliance date determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to determine
whether the violation has been
remedied and the violation has not
been remedied, or an additional permit is obtained for work previously
permitted and the original permit
has expired or was appropriately
voided, a fee of $100.00 shall be
charged for each such inspection,
except that this fee shall not apply
to one-family and two-family owneroccupied dwelling structures.
(3) If the owner fails to pay for
the costs of removal, repair, alteration, securing or boarding or of
inspections of violations that have
not been remedied within 30 days
from the date the Director of Building and Housing sends a statement
of the charges and costs incurred
therein, the Director may certify
such amount to the Commissioner of
Assessments and Licenses. The Commissioner
of
Assessments
and
Licenses shall make written return
to the County Auditor of the action
under this section with a statement
of the charges for services, the
amount paid for the performing of
such labor and a proper description
of the premises. Certification to the
County Auditor is for the purpose of
making expenses and costs a lien
upon such lands, to be collected as
other taxes and returned to the City
with the General Fund, with special
accounting thereof in accordance
with Ohio R.C. 715.261.
(4) Notwithstanding the method of
collection set forth in this division,
the Director of Law may take any
action necessary to collect the costs
of demolition, boarding, or other nuisance abatement from the owner or
other responsible party.

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 1099-04.
By Council Member Sweeney.
An emergency resolution authorizing the Mayor to sign a dedication plat for Cleveland Parkway
S.W.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
owns the land for Cleveland Parkway, S.W.; and
Whereas, it is required that a plat
be signed by the Mayor on behalf of
the City of Cleveland dedicating to

public use the land for Cleveland
Parkway, S.W.; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure in that
the same provides for the preservation of public property, health and
the usual daily operation of a
municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Mayor be and
is hereby authorized and directed on
behalf of the City of Cleveland, to
sign and execute a plat dedicating
to public use Cleveland Parkway,
S.W. as shown on said plat as prepared by the Division of Engineering and Construction of the City of
Cleveland.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted June 7, 2004.
Effective June 11, 2004.

Res. No. 1118-04.
By Council Members Westbrook,
Gordon, Zone, Brady, Lewis, Cimperman, Coats, O’Malley, Polensek,
and Jackson.
An emergency resolution supporting the Northeast Ohio Campaign
for American Manufacturing and its
mission to inform the public and
elected officials of the importance
and economic impact of manufacturing to our communities and to
implement policies that enhance the
competitiveness of American-based
manufacturing and requesting President Bush and the United States
Congress to do its part to help
achieve greater equity in competitive conditions and international
trade practices.
Whereas, this Council is concerned about the decline of manufacturing jobs in northeast Ohio due
to the U.S. trade deficit and manipulation by foreign governments of
their currencies; and
Whereas, manufacturing is critical to the health of northeast Ohio’s
economy, generating high quality
products,
personal
opportunity,
careers, wealth, high standards of
living and economic growth that
together make up the American
Dream; and
Whereas, the manufacturing sector faces intense global competition
and, in many cases, unfair trade
practices, making it difficult for
many companies
to operate profitably and earn a fair return on capital invested; and
Whereas,
44,000
manufacturing
jobs have been lost in greater Cleveland between November 1999 and
November 2003, of which 13,000 were
lost directly due to the US trade
deficit; and
Whereas, lost manufacturing jobs
translate into the loss of family supporting wages, which further translates into less money spent in retail
stores, for arts and entertainment,

1188

June 16, 2004
for transportation, and for legal and
accounting services; and
Whereas, a dollar of lost manufacturing production leads to another $1.50 in losses to the service-sector; and
Whereas, the loss of manufacturing companies, equipment, design
and production capacity undermines
our national defense and our capacity to innovate the next generation
of products; and
Whereas, the U.S. trade deficit
from 1994 to 2000 took more than
135,000 jobs and job opportunities
from Ohio’s economy; 100,000 of
these jobs were from the high-paying manufacturing sector; and
Whereas, United States’ exports of
manufactured goods have fallen by
$100 billion from their peak in 2000,
which accounts for up to 40% of the
total decline in production and jobs;
and
Whereas, U.S. manufacturers that
attempt to do business in China and
other nations face market barriers
and unfair trade practices, raw
material and other subsidies, technical trade restriction, violations of
intellectual property rights and nonmarket-based industrial policies that
limit U.S. exports and increase
import penetration of our markets;
and
Whereas, China, Taiwan, Korea
and Japan are engaged in government currency intervention, through
purchases of U.S dollars to keep
their currencies from appreciating,
despite large trade surpluses and
investment inflows; and
Whereas, intervention by the Chinese government has maintained
the Chinese yuan at its artificially
low 1994 value, which by some estimates is 40% below its market
value; and
Whereas, unless addressed immediately, foreign currency manipulation and unfair trading practices
will further weaken the manufacturing sector in northeast Ohio and
the United States and encourage
even larger U.S. trade deficits; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports the Northeast Ohio Campaign for American Manufacturing
and its mission to inform the public
and elected officials of the importance and economic impact of manufacturing to our communities and
to implement policies that enhance
the competitiveness of Americanbased manufacturing.
Section 2. That this Council hereby requests President Bush and the
United States Congress to do its part
to help achieve greater equity in
competitive conditions and international trade practices.
Section 3. That the Clerk is hereby directed to send copies of this
resolution to President George Bush,
Senators Voinovich and DeWine and
to the U.S. Representatives from
Northeast Ohio.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency

June 16, 2004
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted June 7, 2004.
Effective June 11, 2004.

Res. No. 1126-04.
By Council Member Gordon.
An emergency resolution objecting to a New C2 Liquor Permit at
4519 Bush Avenue.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Department of Liquor
Control of an application for a New
C2 Liquor Permit at Sukhdev S.
Chauhan, DBA Tower Food Mart,
4519 Bush Avenue, 1st Floor, Cleveland, Ohio 44109, Permanent Number
14050630010; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of
notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby record its objection to a New C2
Liquor
Permit
at
Sukhdev
S.
Chauhan, DBA Tower Food Mart,
4519 Bush Avenue, 1st Floor, Cleveland, Ohio 44109, Permanent Number

4303.26 of the Revised Code of Ohio.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she is hereby directed to
transmit two certified copies of this
resolution, together with two copies
of a letter of objection and two
copies of a letter requesting that the

The City Record
hearing be held in Cleveland, Cuyahoga County.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted June 7, 2004.

By Council Member Johnson.

116th Street and repealing Resolution No. 1326-03, objecting to said
renewal.
Whereas, this Council objected to
a D5 Liquor Permit to 3019 East
116th Street by Resolution No. 132603 adopted by the Council on July
16, 2003; and
Whereas, this Council wishes to
withdraw its objection to the above
renewal and consents to said renewal; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
