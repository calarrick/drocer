An emergency resolution urging
awareness, education, training and
funding to stop the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
Whereas, the HIV/AIDS epidemic
is one of the most important public
health issues in the world; and
Whereas, HIV, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, is a virus that is
transmitted from person to person
through the direct exchange of
blood, semen, vaginal fluids and
breast milk. This virus gradually
weakens and eventually destroys
the body’s immune system; and
Whereas, the latency period from
the HIV infection to full blown

The City Record
AIDS is approximately 12 years and
continues to increase; and
Whereas, AIDS, Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, is a medical
condition in which an individual
meets a series of diagnostic criteria
established by the Centers for Disease Control; such criteria include:
the
individual
is
HIV
Positive
(HIV+); has a white blood cell
count at below 200; and suffers from
a disease or secondary infection
defined by the CDC; and
Whereas, an individual infected
with HIV or AIDS can infect another
person
through
the
direct
exchange of blood, semen, vaginal
fluids and breast milk; and
Whereas, a person inflicted with
HIV or AIDS can look and feel perfectly healthy with no outward
signs of the illness; and
Whereas, the number of people
who
are
HIV+
are
currently
unknown, but that the number is
many times greater than the number of reported cases of AIDS; and
Whereas, the World Health Organization estimates the existence of
approximately 37 million cases of
HIV globally as of mid-1998; and
Whereas, the Centers for Disease
Control report 641,086 cumulative
cases of AIDS in the United States,
of which an estimated 250,394 are
alive and living with AIDS; and
Whereas, the Ohio Department of
Health has conservatively estimated
18,000 cases of HIV in Ohio; and
Whereas, the number of reported
cases of AIDS in Ohio is 9,565; and
Whereas, the Ohio Department of
Health has conservatively estimated
that 4,500 HIV+ people live in Cuyahoga County; and
Whereas, there are 2,783 reported
AIDS cases in the Cuyahoga region,
comprised of Cuyahoga, Ashtabula,
Geauga, Lake, Lorain and Medina
counties; and
Whereas, the Cuyahoga County
Region accounts for 29% of the
AIDS cases on Ohio; and
Whereas,
in
1995,
Cleveland
became an AIDS Tier One City and
the City of Cleveland’s Department
of Public Health declared a State of
Emergency in Cleveland; and
Whereas, the epidemiological profile of AIDS cases in Cuyahoga
County reports that males represent
approximately 83% of the cases and
females account for slightly more
than 15% of the total AIDS cases
known to exist in 1997; and
Whereas, most new cases of HIV
infection in women resulted from
heterosexual contact; and
Whereas, an estimated 1,205 of the
reported AIDS cases in Cuyahoga
County are residents in the City of
Cleveland; and
Whereas, there is a disproportionate percentage of minorities living
with AIDS in Cleveland. Of the
AIDS cases in Cleveland, 68% are
African American, although they
represent only 41% of the population; 11% are Hispanic, although
they represent only 5% of the population of the City; and
Whereas, the Centers for Disease
Control and other experts say the
most effective method to stop the
HIV/AIDS epidemic is through prevention; and
Whereas, the Cleveland City Council’s Public Health Committee is
committed to the goal of stopping
the spread of HIV/AIDS; and
Whereas, the Public Health Committee is committed to bringing services and prevention education to
all segments of the population of
Cleveland; and

2129

7
Whereas, no one is immune from
HIV/AIDS and no one has been
cured of HIV/AIDS; and
Whereas, the only way not to die
of AIDS is not to become infected
with HIV; now, therefore;
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland recommends that
the federal, state and local governments of the United States incorporate a prevention policy into all programs and grants that impact people
with
HIV/AIDS.
Prevention
should be incorporated into every
education and health and human
services program funded by all levels of government.
Section 2. That the Council urges
the elimination of discrimination in
housing against people living with
HIV/AIDS. Cuyahoga Metropolitan
Housing Authority and other low
income housing agencies are encouraged to work with the AIDS Housing Council to offer vouchers and
housing opportunities to people living with HIV/AIDS. Further, the
City of Cleveland is urged to conduct a study to project the housing
needs for people with HIV/AIDS in
the next five years and to develop
the capacity to meet that need; and
that the addition of direct services,
such as alcohol and substance addiction programs and intervention services, should be incorporated in the
housing programs for people with
HIV/AIDS.
Section 3. That the Council recommends that the State of Ohio
Board of Education adopt a policy
of health education for all students
for at least one semester each year
of education (K- 12); that the types
of courses taught reflect current,
critical public health issues; that
the students are taught basic living
instruction
from
proper
hygiene and nutrition to sex education and the prevention of communicable diseases such as Sexually Transmitted Disease (STDs)
and HIV/AIDS.
Section 4. That the Council urges
the Cuyahoga County Juvenile Court
system to adopt a program to educate the youth that go through the
system on basic living instruction
from proper hygiene and nutrition
to sex education and the prevention
of communicable diseases such as
Sexually
Transmitted
Disease
(STDs) and HIV/AIDS. Further, all
youth that utilize the Juvenile Court
System in any capacity should be
instructed
through
a
mandatory
HIV/AIDS prevention program.
Section 5. That the Council recommends that the State of Ohio
mandate the reporting of HIV cases
and that such reporting be standard
throughout the state and should be
consistent with the Federal guidelines set forth by the Centers for
Disease Control. Reporting should
be done in age brackets, modes of
transmission and race and ethnicity
categories consistent with the Federal guidelines set forth by the Centers for Disease Control.
Section 6. That the Council seek
and encourage the representation of
Council on committees that fund or
review performances of agencies
and HIV/AIDS service providers
that provide services in the City of
Cleveland.
Section 7. That the Council strongly recommends that all social service agencies funded by the City of
Cleveland have at least one staff
person who is trained in HIV/AIDS
prevention and education.

8
Section 8. That the Council recommends and encourages the implementation within the City of a uniform reporting system to determine
the effectiveness and efficiency of
the City’s overall goal to stop the
spread of HIV/AIDS and urges the
hiring of an independent evaluator

Section 9. That the Council urges
that a review of all federal, state
and local laws be done to determine
whether there is any impediment to
developing or creating an effective
policy towards the eradication of
the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

CHAPTER 396
NOTIFICATION, ENVIRONMENTAL
ABATEMENT AND
SECURING OF CLOSED OR
VACATED FACILITIES

As used in this Chapter:
(a) “Close” or “closing” means the
permanent cessation of business
operations at a facility. For purposes of this Chapter, “permanent”
means a period of time longer than
ninety (90) days and does not
include transfer of the business
operation to another entity which
will resume the operations within
the 90-day timeframe.
(b) “Facility” means an industrial
structure of any size or a commercial structure where such commercial structure is larger than one
hundred fifty thousand (150,000)
square feet.
(c) “Regulated substances” means
all hazardous and flammable substances regulated by this Title, as
well as petroleum, tires, and any
other hazardous or flammable substances regulated pursuant to federal, state, or local environmental
laws.
(d) “Vacate” or “vacant” means
abandoning a facility, or a majority of the facility as measured in
square footage, such that no regular activities or regular occupancy
by persons associated with the
facility is occurring. It does not
include:
(1) Storage of materials regulated
by and in compliance with the
remainder of this Title.
(2) Storage of materials regulated
by and in compliance with state or
federal environmental law.
(3) Storage of materials being
actively used in normal business
processes. The burden is on the
owner, operator, or party in control
to show that the materials are in
active use.
(4) Storage of materials that are
not regulated substances and that
are stored by an entity that is in the
commercial storage business as a
part of that business.
Section 396.02 Legislative Findings and Declaration of Nuisance
(a) Council of the City of Cleveland finds that:
(1) Non-residential sites which are
closed for business but vacant and
open to entry by the general public
attract children to enter who may
encounter health or environmental
hazards, harbor vermin, serve as
temporary abode for vagrants and
criminals, invite dumping and illegal storage of hazardous and flammable substances, and are likely to
be damaged by vandals or set
ablaze by arsonists.

The City Record
(2) Unkempt and open grounds on
such sites invite the dumping of
garbage, rubbish, hazardous and
other regulated substances, and the
accumulation of combustible material.
(3) Thousands of structures in
this City are made of wood-frame
construction which is more combustible than other building types.
(4) Thousands of structures in
this City are situated on narrow lots
and in close proximity to one another, thereby increasing the risk of
conflagration and the spread of environmental contamination through the
water and the air.
(b) All facilities which are injurious to or a menace to the public
health, safety or welfare, or which
constitute a fire hazard, or which
are vacant and open to public entry
are declared to be a nuisance and
are to be abated in accordance with
this Chapter.
(c) The owner, operator, or party
in control of any facility which is
closed or vacant as of the effective
date of this chapter shall comply
with the requirements of this Chapter by July 1, 1999.

altered if any change occurs within
its banks.
B. Maintain engineering documentation required in division (c) (4) of
Section 3167.04 that the flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse
will not be diminished.
C. Require that all necessary
maintenance will be provided for by
the applicant for the altered or relocated portion of such watercourse so
that the flood carrying capacity will
not be diminished.
(5)
Make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of
the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example,
where there appears to be a conflict
between a mapped boundary and
actual field conditions). Where a
map boundary and elevations disagree, the elevations delineated in
the flood elevation profile shall prevail. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to appeal
the interpretation as provided in
division (e) of Section 3167.04.
(e)
(1)
A. The Board of Building Standards and Building Appeals as
established by the Charter shall
hear
and
decide
appeals
and
requests for variances from the
requirements of this chapter.
B. Such Board shall hear and
decide appeals when it is alleged
there is an error in any requirement,
decision or determination made by
the Commissioners of Building and
Housing and Engineering and Construction in the enforcement or
administration of this chapter.
C. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Board or any taxpayer,
may appeal such decision to the
Court of Common Pleas, Cuyahoga
County, Ohio, as provided in RC
Chapter 2506.
D. In passing upon such applications, the Board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant
factors, standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and
1. The danger that materials may
be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
2. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
3. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such
damage on the individual owner;
4. The importance of the services
provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
5. The availability of alternative
locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
6. The necessity to the facility of
a waterfront location, where applicable;
7. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
8. The relationship of the proposed
use to the comprehensive plan and
flood plain management program
for that area;

2153

31
9. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
10. The expected heights, velocity,
duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters, and
the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
11. The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems, and
streets and bridges.
E. Upon consideration of the factors of division (e)(1)D. of this section and the purposes of this chapter, the Board of Building Standards
and Building Appeals may attach
such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to
further the purposes of this chapter.
F. The Secretary of the Board of
Building Standards and Building
Appeals shall maintain the records
of all appeal actions and report any
variances to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency upon request.
2.
A. Generally, variances may be
issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected
on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded
by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level,
providing items 1 through 11 in division (e)(1)D. of this section have
been fully considered. As the lot
size increases beyond this one-half
acre,
the
technical
justification
required for issuing the variance
increases.
B. Variances may be issued for
the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure’s continued designation as
a historic structure and the variance
is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
C. Variances shall not be issued
within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during
the base flood discharge would
result.
D. Variances shall only be issued
upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
E. Variances shall only be issued
upon:
1. A showing of good and sufficient cause;
2. A determination that failure to
grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
3. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that
which is allowed in this chapter,
additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified
in division (e)(1)D. of this section
or conflict with existing local laws
or ordinances.
F. Variances may be issued by a
community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for
other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent
use provided that the criteria of division (e)(2)A. to E. of this section are
met, and the structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the
base flood and create no additional
threats to public safety.

32
G. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be
permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood
elevation and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with
the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
