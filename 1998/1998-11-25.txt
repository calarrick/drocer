Res. No. 2067-98.
By Councilman White.
An emergency resolution urging
Governor elect Robert Taft and the
Ohio State Legislature to examine
minority set-aside laws in order to
develop a law that will guarantee
aid for minorities that can withstand constitutional challenge.
Whereas, as a result of a recent
federal court ruling that the State
law of setting aside portions of public construction projects for minorities are considered unconstitutional,
Ohio Governor George V. Voinovich
ended the State of Ohio minority setaside program that provided billions
of dollars in compensation to minority-owned companies as compensation for previous discrimination; and
Whereas, between 1991 and 1998,
the State of Ohio has awarded contracts in excess of $1.6 billion to
minority-owned companies; and
Whereas, many minority contractors could possibly be shut out of
government
contracts
thus
compounding the discrimination they
have encountered in private industry
that can greatly diminish business
opportunities for these groups as well
as increasing barriers for access into
state government contracts; and
Whereas, many of these minorityowned businesses need such a setaside program in order to effectively compete in a open and sometimes
discriminatory market place; now,
therefore.
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges Ohio Governor elect Robert Taft and the
State Legislature to review the
minority set-aside program, and to
examine how the present law can be
modified to ensure aid to minorityowned companies while being made
to withstand any constitutional challenge.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby is directed to
transmit two certified copies of
this resolution to Ohio Governor
elect Robert Taft, and the Ohio
House of Representatives, and Congressmen Louis Stokes and Dennis
Kucinich.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,

immediately upon its adoption and

An emergency resolution urging
the President of the United States to
request an investigation of the
Ugandan Tuberculosis Study and
other medical research practices
where experiments are conducted on
patient populations who are diagnosed with a specific health disease
to determine the effectiveness of
new drugs and medications in treating certain diseased conditions and
if such research can be harmful to
the health of those participants in
such studies.
Whereas, the Monday, November
9, 1998, Cleveland Plain Dealer
Newspaper carried the news article
entitled “Living Proof, Ugandans in

November 25, 1998
American-run study expected treatment, but some pills were dummies” that reported a study sponsored by the United States Government conducted by Researchers for
Case Western Reserve University
and the Center for Disease Control
on a population of 2,018 Ugandans
with HIV and latent tuberculosis;
and
Whereas, this medical research
study had randomly assigned this
specific
population
to
different
groups that consisted of a treated
and untreated group; and
Whereas, the untreated control
group was not to be given antituberculosis
medications
until
being fully diagnosed with the disease, which constituted withholding
a proven drug from a patient population in need of such medication;
and
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland is concerned about
the research methodology of such
medical experiments by medical
centers and universities specializing in medical research that are
being conducted on certain populations of individuals who have
specific diseases in order to determine the effectiveness of new or
present drugs in treating certain
diseases, while withholding such
medications from a control group
population who have been diagnosed with a specific health disease; and
Whereas, the untreated control
group population in such studies do
not receive any kind of medication
or therapy to treat their diseased
condition, which can exacerbate
their medical condition and places
them at further risk of deteriorating
health; now, therefore.
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges the President of the United States, the Ohio
House
of
Representatives
and
members of Congress to strongly
urge the United States Federal
Government to conduct a full scale
investigation on these controversial medical research practices and
to
determine
if
another
more
appropriate
alternative
can
be
identified where the health of
those individuals participating in
such experiments are not put at
risk.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby is directed to
transmit two certified copies of this
resolution to the President of the
United States, Donna Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, Ohio Senate, Ohio House of
Representatives,
Ohio
Senators
John H. Glenn and Michael DeWine, and United States Congressmen
Louis
Stokes
and
Dennis
Kucinich.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
