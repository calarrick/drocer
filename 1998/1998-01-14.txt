RULES OF THE COMMISSIONER
OF THE DIVISION OF
ASSESSMENTS AND LICENSES
Pursuant to Chapter 443, section
012, of the Codified Ordinances of
The City of Cleveland, I am authorized to promulgate such rules and
regulations, not inconsistent with the
provisions of Chapter 443 as I shall
deem necessary to carry out the provisions of that chapter. I present the
following rules and regulations to be
effective ten days after they are published in The City Record.
1. Any licensed Cleveland Taxicab
Driver who services Cleveland Hopkins
International
Airport
shall
remain in or near his or her vehicle
while waiting in the taxicab queue
line, and shall maintain a distance
of no more than approximately 15
feet between his or her cab and the
cab immediately in front of the driver’s own vehicle. The approximately 15 foot allowance shall only be
allowed in the instance of a driver
who is using a lavatory and can not
return to his or her vehicle prior to
the advance of the taxicab line. In
all other cases, taxicabs shall be
maintained at a distance of approximately 2 feet or less apart. This
rule is promulgated to advance a
tight taxicab queue line, which does
not back up onto the Airport Roadway. This rule may be enforced by
any on-duty Airport Traffic Control
Officer,
The
Commissioner
of
C.H.I.A. and his or her agents, The
Commissioner of Assessments and
Licenses and his or her agents.
2. Any licensed Cleveland Taxicab
Driver who services Cleveland Hopkins International Airport shall pull
his or her vehicle to the airport
roadway curb at any such time as
they are accepting a fare, unless
otherwise
instructed
by
Airport

Traffic Control Officers or the Commissioner of Hopkins Airport and
his or her agents. No fare shall be
solicited or accepted from the center
lane or from an unsafe distance of
more than one foot from the curb.
Also, every driver, at all times, shall
secure that his or her vehicle transmission is safely in the “Park” position before a passenger may step
into the vehicle or place baggage in
the trunk.
Any Airport Traffic Control Officer or The Commissioner of Hopkins
Airport and his or her agents who
observe a violation of this rule shall
make a report to the Commissioner
of Assessments and Licenses. The
Commissioner shall find the penalty
for this violation to be no less than
a fourteen day suspension of license
for the offending driver.
3. Any licensed Cleveland Taxicab
Driver who services Cleveland Hopkins International Airport must exit
his or her taxicab to assist customers by loading their luggage
into the vehicle. The driver may
also permit an Airport Taxi Supervisor to load luggage, but this does
not preclude the fact that the efficient loading of luggage is the
responsibility of the driver.
The
loading
requirement
is
mandatory for the driver and may
not be extended to the Airport Taxi
Supervisor when the volume of traffic on the airport roadway requires
the Airport Taxi Supervisor to focus
his or her attention on hailing and
directing the next available taxicabs to the loading gate.
The taxicab driver shall make the
determination whether the Airport
Taxi Supervisor is permitted to load
a customer’s luggage into the vehicle. If a driver first attempts to load
luggage and then has a dispute with
the Airport Taxi Supervisor regarding who will load the luggage, the
driver shall allow the starter to load
the luggage without argument or
inconvenience to the customer, and
afterward make a complaint report
to the Commissioner of Assessments
and Licenses on the specified complaint form. The driver must indi-

39
cate all pertinent information. The
Commissioner will investigate each
reported incident, and make a follow up with the taxicab company
which employs the Supervisor. Airport Taxicab Supervisors and Airport Traffic Officers may also make
a complaint.
4. Any licensed taxicab driver who
services any area in the City of
Cleveland including Cleveland Hopkins International Airport shall not
allow a customer to load his or her
own luggage into a taxicab trunk
unless the customer chooses to do so
himself or herself. The loading of
luggage is an expected service of
the driver.
