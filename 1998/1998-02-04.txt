Whereas, the Aviation Safety and
Capacity Expansion Act of 1990
authorized the U.S. Secretary of
Transportation to approve locally
imposed passenger facility charges
(“PFCs”) at airports to finance eligible capital projects; and
Whereas, pursuant to the Act (as
defined in Section 1), the City of
Cleveland, Ohio (the “City”) has
received approval from the U.S.
Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration (the
“FAA”), to impose and use PFCs to
fund certain projects at or in the
vicinity of Cleveland Hopkins International
Airport
(the
“Airport”),
including acquiring residential properties and relocating residents to
mitigate the impact of Airport noise,
and intends to seek further such
approvals; and
Whereas, this Council has determined that, to maximize the benefits of the Approved Projects (as
defined in Section 1), it may be
necessary that certain costs of the
Approved Projects be incurred and
paid in advance of the collection
of PFC revenue for the purpose;
and
Whereas, to provide funds timely
to pay such costs, this Council has
determined it to be in the best interest of the City to provide for a
revolving credit arrangement with a
bank or other financial institution,
under which the City may obtain
advances, from time to time, in
anticipation of the collection of PFC
revenue to repay those advances
(the “Revolving Credit Agreement”);
and
Whereas, this Council has further
determined that it is necessary for
the City to issue obligations (the
“Revenue Notes”) to evidence any
advances
under
the
Revolving
Credit Agreement, payable from and
secured by the Pledged Revenues
(as defined in Section 1) on the
terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein; and
Whereas, the prompt and immediate completion of the Approved Projects is necessary to maximize the
benefits thereof, including the benefit of reducing the impact of Airport
noise, and requires providing for a
Revolving Credit Agreement, issuing Revenue Notes to evidence any
advances
made
thereunder,
and
undertaking the other transactions
contemplated
herein
and,
consequently, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the immediate preservation of the
public property, health, and safety
and for the usual and daily operation of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

Administration
for
funding
from passenger facility charges,
authorizing

proper, public, municipal purposes

residential properties and the relocation of residents to mitigate the

and in the best interest of the City
to provide for a Revolving Credit
Agreement and, for the public purpose so stated, (i) the Director of
Finance is authorized to enter into
the Revolving Credit Agreement,
and (ii) the City shall issue Revenue
Notes
to
evidence
any
advances under the Revolving Credit Agreement.
Section 3. Terms and Conditions.
(a) Amount. The amount available to the City under the Revolving Credit Agreement, and thus the
aggregate amount of Revenue Notes
outstanding at any time, shall be
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance, shall be set forth in the
Revolving Credit Agreement, and
shall not exceed $10,000,000.
(b) Form. The Revenue Notes
shall be issued only in registered

money of the United States of America to the registered owner, and
shall not be transferable or assignable, in whole or in part, without
the prior written approval of the
Director of Finance of the City.
Each advance obtained by the City
under the Revolving Credit Agreement shall be evidenced by the
delivery of a Revenue Note in the
principal amount of the advance, or
the entry on the grid of a master
Revenue
Note
of
the
principal
amount of the advance. In the event
that
each
advance
under
the
Revolving Credit Agreement is evidenced by a separate Revenue Note,
that Revenue Note shall be dated
the date of the advance. In the
event that one master Revenue Note
is issued bearing a grid for the
entry of multiple advances, that
master Revenue Note shall be dated
as of the date of the first advance
under the Revolving Credit Agreement, and the date and amount of
any subsequent advance shall be
entered on the grid. The Revenue
Notes shall be signed on behalf of
the City by the Mayor and the
Director of Finance and approved

interest
from
the
date

the
advance or the most recent date to
which interest has been paid or duly
provided for, in accordance with the
Revenue
Note
evidencing
the
advance. The Director of Finance
shall negotiate with the Bank to
obtain such interest rate or rates as
are determined by the Director of
Finance to be in the best financial
interest of the City, given prevailing
market
considerations.
The
interest rate or rates may be variable, determined by reference to one
or more market indices or the
Bank's prime lending rate, or may

The City Record
be fixed; provided such rate or rates
shall not in any event exceed twelve
percent (12%) per annum.
Revenue Notes shall mature on
the date or dates approved by the
Director of Finance, provided that
any such date shall be no later than
the expiration of the City’s authorization from the FAA to collect
PFCs in the normal course. Revenue
Notes shall be subject to redemption
at the option of the City in whole
or in part prior to stated maturity
on the dates and terms approved by
the Director of Finance and provided in the Revolving Credit Agreement, provided that the optional
redemption
premium
shall
not
exceed 2% of the principal amount
of the Revenue Note to be redeemed.
(d) Source of Repayment; Security. Revenue Notes shall be special,
limited obligations of the City the
principal of and interest and any
premium (collectively, “debt service”) on which shall be payable
solely from, and secured solely by,
the Pledged Revenues as provided
in the Revolving Credit Agreement.
Revenue Notes shall not constitute
a general obligation of the City and
shall not constitute a debt, or a
pledge of the faith and credit of the
City. No holder or owner of Revenue
Notes shall ever have the right to
compel the exercise of the City’s
taxing power or to compel the City
to pay debt service on the Revenue
Notes or to make any other payments
contemplated
under
the
Revolving Credit Agreement from
any moneys of the City other than
the
Pledged
Revenues.
Revenue
Notes shall contain on the face
thereof a statement to that effect.
Neither the Revenue Notes nor the
interest thereon shall constitute a
lien upon the Approved Projects or
any other property interest other
than the Pledged Revenues in the
manner provided for in this ordinance, the Revenue Notes, and the
Revolving Credit Agreement.
(e) PFC Program. The terms and
conditions of the Revolving Credit
Agreement and the Revenue Notes,
including those of all related documents, and the carrying out of the
obligations
imposed
thereunder,
shall not be such as to induce the
FAA to initiate procedures for the
termination of the City’s PFC program under the PFC Regulations
(at 14 C.F.R. Part 158, Subpart E)
and applicable law.
Section 4. Delivery of Documents.
(a) Revolving Credit Agreement.

Finance is authorized to appoint a
bank (including the Bank) or other
institution, or other person or entity, for such purposes.

Mayor,
the
Director

gross income for federal income tax
purposes (“Tax-Exempt Notes”), the
Director of Finance, or any other
officer of the City having responsi-

14
bility for issuance of the TaxExempt Notes, is hereby authorized
(a) to make or effect any election,
selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or waiver on behalf
of the City with respect to the TaxExempt Notes as the City is permitted or required to make or give
under the federal income tax laws,
including, without limitation thereto, any of the elections provided for
in Section 148(f)(4)(C) of the Code
or available under Section 148 of
the Code, for the purpose of assuring, enhancing or protecting favorable tax treatment or status of the
Tax-Exempt Notes or interest thereon or assisting compliance with
requirements
for
that
purpose,
reducing the burden or expense of
such
compliance,
reducing
the
rebate
amount
or payments
of
penalties, or making payments of
special amounts in lieu of making
computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as rebate, or

to take any and all other actions,
make or obtain calculations, make
payments,
and
make

exposure of the City against fluctuations in prevailing interest rates
(a “Rate Exchange Agreement”).
The Director of Finance is authorized, on behalf of the City, to execute and deliver one or more Rate

determines, based upon the advice
of the City’s Financial Advisor, will
reduce the net debt service charges

the City’s purposes to an extent
that justifies the cost of the City's
entering into such Rate Exchange
Agreements.

of Council and such other officers
of the City, as may be appropriate,

By Councilman Coats.
An emergency resolution urging
the Mayor to ~examine the safety
issues involved in the proposed
acquisition and distribution of the
assets of Conrail among Norfolk
Southern and CSX Transportation
and to devise emergency evacuation
plans.
Whereas, Norfolk Southern Railroad and CSX Transportation have
proposed the acquisition and distribution of the assets of Conrail; and
Whereas, by Resolution No. 179997, passed September 22, 1997, the
Council of the City of Cleveland officially notified the U. S. Department
of Transportation of its concerns of
the proposed acquisition and distribution of the assets of Conrail by
NS and CSX; and
Whereas, although the proposed
acquisition and distribution may
offer the potential for economic
development and redevelopment in
the Cleveland area, this Council is
concerned that the proposed acquisition will have negative impacts on
our community, primarily safety
related concerns including emergency conditions relating to the
shipment of hazardous cargo; and
Now, therefore, be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland hereby requests

work on proposed emergency evacuation procedures to be followed in
the event of a major disaster resulting from railroads operating in the

days following the passage of this
resolution by Council, the Administration will report the results of its
work on this issue to the Public
Safety Committee of Council.
Section 3. That the Mayor and his
Administration work with cities in
the greater Cleveland area that will
be affected by the proposed railroad
merger and with the Greater Cleveland Growth Association, the Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating
Agency, and the Ohio Rail Development Commission, as well as state
and federal legislators.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
