RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 1824-98.
By Councilmen Westbrook, Johnson, Willis and Coats.
An emergency resolution expressing Council’s intent to ensure that
the Division of Park Maintenance is
restored to a full complement of
staff and equipment.
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland is committed to the
employment and the utilization of
City workers to provide services to
the residents of the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, this Council is vehemently opposed to the privatization
of City facilities and services; and
Whereas,
the
Department
of
Parks, Recreation and Properties
has sought authorization through
Ordinance No. 1256-98 to enter into
an agreement with a contractor, in
order to supplement the staff of the
Division of Park Maintenance, to
trim trees throughout the City; and
Whereas, this Council is adamant
that the Division of Park Maintenance must be restored to a full
complement of staff, with fully operational and efficient equipment, to
ensure that the hiring of a private
contractor is an interim and temporary measure; and
Whereas, this Council will investigate the operation of Division of
Park Maintenance to assist the Division in identifying methods to operate more effectively and efficiently
and will work with the Division to
recruit additional personnel and to
identify the means to repair or purchase needed equipment, now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland intends to ensure
that the Division of Park Maintenance of the Department of Parks,
Recreation
and
Properties
is
restored to a full complement of
staff as existed in 1989 and 1990.
The Council will allocate funds in
the 1999 budget necessary to accomplish this goal and will work with
the Division to recruit additional
employees for the City in order to
provide tree trimming service to the
residents of the City of Cleveland on
an on-going and uninterrupted basis.
Section 2. That in order to meet
the needs of the residents and to
provide for the safe and efficient
operation of the Division of Park
Maintenance, the Council will undertake an audit of the Division to
identify whether existing equipment
is operational and whether additional equipment is required to operate effectively.
Section 3. That the Council views
the hiring of a private contractor to
assist the employees of the Division
of Park Maintenance in trimming
trees as a purely interim and temporary measure, and any such additional hiring of contractors for the
Division, if requested, will not be
considered favorably by the Council.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

An emergency resolution urging
the Congress to oppose the Internet
Tax Freedom Act.
Whereas, the United States Senate
is considering the passage of the
Internet Tax Freedom Act, S. 442,
which preempts state and local
taxes and fees, but not federal taxes
and fees, on goods and services provided over the Internet; and
Whereas, the legislation under
consideration by the Senate fails to
protect state and local revenue
bases and, if enacted, would pose
great harm to local merchants; and

the passage of the Internet Tax
Freedom Act in its current form;
now therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That in consideration
of the potentially harmful impact
on local merchants, the Council of
the City of Cleveland urges the
United States Senate to oppose
action on the Internet Tax Freedom
Act, S. 442, unless the legislation is
amended to provide a firm guaran-

tee that all sales of goods and services will be subject to the same

legislation that will serve to undermine the revenue base of local

the President and Congress to support U.S. steel manufacturers by preventing the illegal dumping of foreign steel.
Whereas, LTV Corp., ClevelandCliffs, Inc., WCI Steel, Inc., the United Steel Workers of America and
other steel producers, suppliers and

financial harm to U.S. steel manufacturers and their many employees,

practices; now, therefore,
