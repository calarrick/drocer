ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 435-98.
By Councilmen Johnson and Zone.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio State legislature to adopt
legislation that will permit judges
in the Housing Court Division of
Municipal Court to refer certain
criminal cases to magistrates.
Whereas, in 1997 the City of Cleveland filed over 6500 new criminal
code violation cases in Cleveland
Housing Court, all of which were
assigned to the single Housing Division Judge; and
Whereas, the 1997 filings of 6500
cases is an increase of 1000+ over
the cases filed in 1996, which represents an 18% increase; and
Whereas, since violations of the
Cleveland Housing Code are criminal
cases,
each
case
involves
arraignment, adjudication, and sentencing, and many cases involve
criminal trials; and
Whereas, because it is a goal of
the Cleveland Housing Court to
obtain compliance by the criminal
defendants in its court, many cases
are not resolved in a single hearing but are continued after the
need for and the benefits of compliance are explained to the defendant; and
Whereas, the ever-increasing misdemeanor caseload in Cleveland
Municipal Court, particularly in the
Housing Division, makes it difficult for a judge to give cases the
individualized
attention
they
deserve; and court dockets, which
last four to five hours, disrupt the
normal work schedules of inspectors and require criminal defendants,
many
of
whom
are
employed, to be in court for several hours; and
Whereas, the Housing Court currently employs magistrates to assist
with the civil docket; and
Whereas, magistrates are experienced,
licensed
attorneys
who
review case files, conduct trials, and
recommend decisions to the judge;
and
Whereas, the judge must approve
each magistrate recommendation
before
the
recommendation
becomes the final decision of the
court; and
Whereas, the magistrates in the
Housing Court currently by law
have a very limited ability to participate in the criminal cases before
the court; and
Whereas, in many courts in other
municipalities,
judges
assign
greater responsibility to the magistrates for standard criminal matters,
thereby freeing up the judges to

20
address more complex matters and
cases having greater community
impact; and
Whereas, in all cases, the judge
will be the party responsible making the decision whether or not to
refer a matter to magistrate; and
Whereas, the state legislature is
currently
considering
legislation
that would enable magistrates to
provide judges with more assistance
in criminal cases such as permitting
them to conduct the arraignment,
trial and sentencing, with all decisions of the magistrates becoming
final only upon review and approval
by the judge;
Now, therefore, be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland, for the reasons
stated in the preambles to this
Resolution, supports passage of
state legislation empowering the
Judge of the Housing Division of
the Cleveland Municipal Court to
refer criminal cases to the Housing
Division
magistrates
for
arraignment, trial and sentencing,
with the decision whether to refer
a matter to a magistrate still resting with the Judge, and with all
decisions
of
the
magistrates
becoming final only upon review
and approval by the Judge of the
Housing Division.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council transmit copies of this resolution to members of the Ohio legislature representing the City of
Cleveland.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and b in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted March 16, 1998.
Effective March 26, 1998.
Res. No. 481-98.
By Councilman Dolan.
An emergency resolution withdrawing objection to the transfer
of ownership of a C1 and C2
Liquor Permit to 15239 Triskett
Ave., and repealing Res. No. 152197, objecting to said transfer of
ownership.
Whereas, this Council objected to
the transfer of ownership of a C1
and C2 Liquor Permit to 15239
Triskett Ave., by Res. No. 1521-97,
adopted August 13, 1997; and
Whereas, this Council wishes to
withdraw
its
objection
to
the
above transfer of ownership and
consents to said transfer of ownership; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That objection to the
transfer of ownership of a C1 and
C2 Liquor Permit to 15239 Triskett
Ave., be and the same is hereby
withdrawn and Res. No. 1521-97, containing said objection, be and the
same is hereby repealed and that

Res. No. 482-98.
By Councilman Robinson.
An emergency resolution objecting to the issuance of a C1 Liquor
Permit to 11703 Union Ave.
Whereas, Council has been notified

an application for the issuance of a
C1 Liquor Permit, to Permit No.
9154910, Union Discount Inc., DBA
Union Discount, 11703 Union Ave.,
Cleveland, Ohio 44105; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard

ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health

permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, safety
and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of
notification; now, therefore,

Ord. No. 467-A-98 (as substitute for
Ordinance No. 467-98).
By Councilman Johnson (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance to authorize the Director of Finance to
obtain a substitute credit enhancement or liquidity facility for the
City’s
Subordinated
Income
Tax
Variable Rate Refundable Bonds,
Series 1994, to authorize agreements
in connection therewith, and to
authorize amendments to the Indenture of Trust in connection therewith and to permit the conversion of
the Bonds to a tax-exempt interest
rate mode.
Whereas, pursuant to Ordinance
No. 367-94 passed on March 14, 1994
(the Bond Legislation), the City of
Cleveland, Ohio (the Issuer) issued
its Subordinated Income Tax Variable Rate Refunding Bonds, Series
1994, dated June 2, 1994 (the Bonds)
which are currently outstanding in
the aggregate principal amount of
$72,800,000; and
Whereas, pursuant to the Bond
Legislation and the Certificate of
Award authorized therein, the Bonds
were issued initially as variable
rate obligations bearing interest at
a Unit Pricing Rate, all as set forth
and provided in the Indenture of
Trust dated as of May 15, 1994 (the
Indenture) between the Issuer and
Star Bank, National Association, as
trustee, a copy of which is on file
with the Clerk of Council in File No.
467-A-98-A.
Whereas, pursuant to the Bond
Legislation, the Director of Finance
obtained a credit facility from Union
Bank of Switzerland, New York
Branch and Credit Suisse, New York
Branch to enhance the credit and
liquidity of the Bonds and, in connection therewith, entered into a letter of credit and reimbursement
agreement; and
Whereas, the credit facility has a
stated expiration date which precedes the final maturity of the
Bonds, and it is therefore necessary
to extend or replace the credit facil-

24
ity in order to continue to provide
the necessary liquidity and credit
enhancement of the Bonds; and
Whereas, the Indenture permits
the Issuer to replace an existing
credit or liquidity facility with a
substitute credit facility upon the
satisfaction of certain conditions;
and
Whereas, a substitute credit or liquidity facility may be obtained on
more favorable terms than the existing credit or liquidity facility; and
Whereas, it was anticipated at the
time of passage of the Bond Legislation that, upon the resolution of
certain federal income tax issues
raised in litigation to which the City
is not a party, an opinion of bond
counsel could be obtained to the
effect that the interest on the Bonds
is excluded from gross income for
federal income tax purposes, and it
appears that those issues may be
resolved in the near future; and
Whereas, in order to obtain the
aforesaid opinion of bond counsel
and for the Bonds to be marketable
as tax-exempt obligations it may be
necessary to amend certain provisions of the Indenture; and
Whereas, it is necessary to authorize the Director of Finance to
obtain a substitute credit facility as
soon as possible in order to provide
for the delivery of such substitute
credit facility not less than five
business days prior to the expiration
date of the current credit facility
and further to provide for the conversion of the Bonds to a tax-exempt
interest rate mode at the earliest
opportunity, and thereby to enable
the Issuer to achieve the desired
debt service savings on the Bonds,
and, as a result, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public property, health
and safety and for the usual and
daily
operation
of
a
municipal
department;
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Substitute Credit or Liquidity Facilities.
If the Director of Finance, based
upon the written advice and recommendation of the Issuer’s financial advisor, determines that it is in
the best interest of the Issuer to
obtain a substitute credit and/or
liquidity facility for the Bonds,
then the Director of Finance is
authorized to obtain a substitute
credit enhancement and/or liquidity facility for the Bonds in accordance with such recommendation
and to execute, deliver and perform
any items or agreements in connection therewith, after the same
shall have been approved as to
form and correctness by the Director of Law, which agreements may
provide for the payment of the fees
and expenses related to obtaining
such substitute credit and/or liquidity facility and the reimbursement of the provider thereof for
amounts drawn thereunder from the
Pledged Revenues, as defined in
the Bond Legislation, and the Director of Finance is authorized to have
prepared, and the Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
to sign and deliver, such amendments to the Indenture as may be
necessary
to
accommodate
the
requirements of the provider of any
such substitute credit and/or liquidity facility, after the same shall
have been approved as to form and
correctness by the Director of Law,

The City Record
provided that no such agreement or
amendment may purport to entitle
the
credit
or
liquidity
facility
provider to payment or reimbursement from any source other than
the Pledged Revenues, and provided further that, notwithstanding
any provision to the contrary contained in the Bond Legislation, no
such agreement or amendment shall
entitle the provider of any such
credit or liquidity facility to be
paid interest at a rate higher than
the maximum rate on the Bonds
permitted under the Bond Legislation
or
to
have
the
principal
amount of any Bonds for which
such credit or liquidity facility
provider has made payment retired
more rapidly than would be called
for by the Indenture, the provisions
of which Indenture are hereby ratified and approved. The Mayor, the
Director of Finance, the Director of
Law, the Clerk of Council and such
other officers of the Issuer as may
be appropriate are authorized and
directed to furnish, execute and
deliver such documents, certifications and instruments as may be
necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated in such agreements and
amendments.
Section 2. Conversion to TaxExempt Interest Rate Mode.
The Director of Finance is authorized to have prepared such amendments to the Indenture as are necessary or appropriate to provide for
the conversion of the Bonds to a
tax-exempt
interest
mode
upon
receipt of an opinion of nationally
recognized bond counsel to the
effect that interest on the Bonds is
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, and as
are not materially adverse to the
interests of the City. Those amendments shall specify, among other
matters, the method and procedure
by which the tax-exempt rate or
rates of interest on the Bonds shall
be determined, including variable
rates, if the Director of Finance
determines, based upon the advice
of the financial advisor of the
Issuer, that the Issuer’s best interests will be served by causing the
Bonds to bear interest at a variable
rate. Those amendments may also
provide for revised redemption provisions and a revised Principal
Retirement Schedule to be effective
upon such conversion if the Director of Finance determines, based
upon the advice of the financial
advisor of the Issuer, that those
revised redemption provisions and
Principal Retirement Schedule are
to the financial advantage of and in
the best interests of the City, provided that the final maturity date
of the Bonds shall not be later than
the final maturity date provided in
the Bond Legislation. The Mayor
and the Director of Finance are
authorized to sign and deliver such
amendments to the Indenture after
the same shall have been approved
as to form and correctness by the
Director of Law. The Mayor, the
Director of Finance, the Director of
Law, the Clerk of Council and such
other officers of the Issuer as may
be appropriate are authorized and
directed to furnish, execute and
deliver such documents, certifications and instruments as may from
time to time be necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated in such amendments.

Section 3. Tax Covenants.
Upon the occurrence of the conversion of the Bonds to a tax-exempt
interest mode, the Issuer covenants

other officer of the Issuer having
responsibility for issuance of the
Bonds, is hereby authorized (a) to
make or effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent,
approval, or waiver on behalf of the

burden
or
expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or payments
of penalties, or making payments of
special amounts in lieu of making

give one or more appropriate certificates of the Issuer setting forth
the reasonable expectations of the
Issuer regarding the amount and
use of all the proceeds of the Bonds,
the facts, circumstances and estimates on which they are based, and
other facts and circumstances relevant to the tax treatment of the
interest on and the tax status of the
Bonds.
Each covenant made in this Section with respect to the Bonds is
also made with respect to all issues
any portion of the debt service on
which is paid from proceeds of the
Bonds (and, if different, the original
issue and any refunding issues in a

April 1, 1998
series of refundings), to the extent

those issues as they are authorized

to the Bonds.
