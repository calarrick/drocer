Ord. No. 200-98.
By Councilmen Westbrook and
Johnson (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing a Revolving Credit Agreement
and the issuance of Special Revenue
Notes to evidence any advances
thereunder in an amount not to
exceed $10,000,000 for the purpose of
paying costs of acquiring residential
properties and relocating residents
and insulating residences to mitigate the impact of airport noise and
paying
costs
of
other
projects
approved by the Federal Aviation
Administration for funding from
passenger facility charges, authorizing the pledge of the Pledged
Revenues to secure those notes, and
authorizing and approving related
matters.
Whereas, the Aviation Safety and
Capacity Expansion Act of 1990
authorized the U.S. Secretary of
Transportation to approve locally
imposed passenger facility charges
(“PFCs”) at airports to finance eligible capital projects; and
Whereas, pursuant to the Act (as
defined in Section 1), the City of
Cleveland, Ohio (the “City”) has
received approval from the U.S.
Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration (the
“FAA”), to impose and use PFCs to
fund certain projects at or in the
vicinity of Cleveland Hopkins International
Airport
(the
“Airport”),
including acquiring residential properties and relocating residents and
insulating residences to mitigate the
impact of Airport noise, and intends
to seek further such approvals; and
Whereas, this Council has determined that, to maximize the benefits of the Approved Projects (as

290

March 4, 1998
defined in Section 1), it may be necessary that certain costs of the
Approved Projects be incurred and
paid in advance of the collection of
PFC revenue for the purpose; and
Whereas, to provide funds timely
to pay such costs, this Council has
determined it to be in the best interest of the City to provide for a
revolving credit arrangement with a
bank or other financial institution,
under which the City may obtain
advances, from time to time, in
anticipation of the collection of PFC
revenue to repay those advances
(the “Revolving Credit Agreement”);
and
Whereas, this Council has further
determined that it is necessary for
the City to issue obligations (the
“Revenue Notes”) to evidence any
advances
under
the
Revolving
Credit Agreement, payable from and
secured by the Pledged Revenues
(as defined in Section 1) on the
terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein; and
Whereas, the prompt and immediate completion of the Approved Projects is necessary to maximize the
benefits thereof, including the benefit of reducing the impact of Airport
noise, and requires providing for a
Revolving Credit Agreement, issuing Revenue Notes to evidence any
advances
made
thereunder,
and
undertaking the other transactions
contemplated
herein
and,
consequently, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the immediate preservation of the
public property, health, and safety
and for the usual and daily operation of a municipal department; now,
therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

which the imposition and use of

shall not in any event exceed twelve
percent (12%) per annum.
Revenue Notes shall mature on

a general obligation of the City and

pledge of the faith and credit of the
City. No holder or owner of Revenue
Notes shall ever have the right to
compel the exercise of the City’s
taxing power or to compel the City
to pay debt service on the Revenue

any moneys of the City other than
the
Pledged
Revenues.
Revenue
Notes shall contain on the face
thereof a statement to that effect.
Neither the Revenue Notes nor the
interest thereon shall constitute a
lien upon the Approved Projects or
any other property interest other

manner provided for in this ordinance, the Revenue Notes, and the
Revolving Credit Agreement.
(e) PFC Program. The terms and
conditions of the Revolving Credit
Agreement and the Revenue Notes,
including those of all related documents, and the carrying out of the
obligations
imposed
thereunder,
shall not be such as to induce the
FAA to initiate procedures for the
termination of the City’s PFC program under the PFC Regulations
(at 14 C.F.R. Part 158, Subpart E)
and applicable law.
Section 4. Delivery of Documents.

interest rates, and the other terms
and conditions of the Revenue Notes
as so specified and determined within the limitations set forth in this
ordinance will be in the best interest of the City and consistent with
all legal requirements.
The Director of Finance is hereby
appointed to act as the note registrar to maintain the official records
with respect to, and as the paying
agent for, the Revenue Notes; provided, however, that the Director of
Finance is authorized to appoint a
bank (including the Bank) or other
institution, or other person or entity, for such purposes.
The
Mayor,
the
Director
of
Finance, the Clerk of Council and
other City officials, as appropriate,
are directed to take all actions necessary to effect due signing, authentication and delivery of Revenue
Notes under the terms of this ordinance and the Revolving Credit
Agreement.
All costs, fees and expenses relating to the establishment of the
Revolving Credit Agreement, the
issuance of the Revenue Notes and
the securing of the Revenue Notes
by the Pledged Revenues, including

Section 6. Tax Covenants.
In the event that Revenue Notes
are to be issued as obligations bearing interest to be excluded from
gross income for federal income tax
purposes (“Tax-Exempt Notes”), the
Director of Finance, or any other
officer of the City having responsibility for issuance of the TaxExempt Notes, is hereby authorized
(a) to make or effect any election,
selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or waiver on behalf
of the City with respect to the TaxExempt Notes as the City is permitted or required to make or give
under the federal income tax laws,
including, without limitation thereto, any of the elections provided for
in Section 148(f)(4)(C) of the Code
or available under Section 148 of the
Code, for the purpose of assuring,
enhancing or protecting favorable
tax treatment or status of the TaxExempt Notes or interest thereon or
assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose, reducing the
burden or expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or
payments of penalties, or making
payments of special amounts in lieu
of making computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as
rebate, or obviating those amounts
or payments, as determined by that
officer, which action shall be in
writing and signed by the officer,

The City Record
(b) to take any and all other
actions, make or obtain calculations,
make payments, and make or give
reports, covenants and certifications
of and on behalf of the City, as may
be appropriate to assure the exclusion of interest from gross income
and the intended tax status of the
Tax-Exempt Notes, and (c) to give
one or more appropriate certificates
of the City, for inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the TaxExempt Notes, setting forth the reasonable expectations of the City
regarding the amount and use of all
the proceeds of the Tax-Exempt
Notes, the facts, circumstances and
estimates on which they are based,
and other facts and circumstances
relevant to the tax treatment of the
interest on and the tax status of the
Tax-Exempt Notes.
Section 7. Related Authorizations.
To the extent permitted under the
Revolving Credit Agreement, the
City is authorized, from time to
time, to enter into one or more
agreements in connection with or
subsequent to the issuance of Revenue Notes, for an interest rate
swap, an interest rate cap, or any
other such arrangement to lower the
effective interest rate on the Revenue Notes or to hedge the exposure
of the City against fluctuations in
prevailing interest rates (a “Rate
Exchange Agreement”). The Director of Finance is authorized, on
behalf of the City, to execute and
deliver one or more Rate Exchange
Agreements
that
he
determines,
based upon the advice of the City’s
Financial Advisor, will reduce the
net debt service charges payable on
the Revenue Notes or otherwise
enhance the timing and amount of
the payments thereof for the City’s
purposes to an extent that justifies
the cost of the City's entering into
such Rate Exchange Agreements.
The
Mayor,
the
Director
of
Finance, the Director of Port Control, the Director of Law, the Clerk

The City Record
Ord. No. 988-97.
By Mayor White and Councilmen
Robinson, Patton, White, Patmon,
Willis and Jones.
An emergency ordinance to enact
Sections 680A.01 and 680A.99 of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, relating to restricting the
placement or display of outdoor
advertisements for cigarettes, and
providing a penalty.
Whereas, Section 2927.02 of the
Ohio Revised Code makes it unlawful for any person engaged in the
manufacturing, production, distribution, wholesaling, or retailing of
cigarettes or other tobacco products
to give, sell, or otherwise distribute
cigarettes or other tobacco products
to any person under eighteen years
of age; and
Whereas, a survey conducted by
the Center for Disease Control during the spring of 1995 reported that
34.8 percent of teenagers under the
age of eighteen reported smoking,
and 16 percent of teenagers under
the age of eighteen said they
smoked 20 or more cigarettes during
the month preceding the survey; and
Whereas, according to the Food
and Drug Administration, tobacco
addiction is a major pediatric disease, with one million children taking up smoking each year; and
Whereas, according to the American Lung Association, each day,
3,000 children smoke their first cigarette; and
Whereas, more than 3.1 million
minors under the age of eighteen
consume more than 947 million
packs of cigarettes annually in the
United States, yielding gross sales
to the tobacco industry each year of
approximately $1 billion; and
Whereas, cigarettes are among
the most heavily marketed product
in America, and the tobacco industry spends approximately $4 billion
a year to promote and advertise
their products, with $421 million
going annually for outdoor advertising of cigarettes; and
Whereas, outdoor advertisements
are a unique and distinguishable
medium of advertising which subjects the general public to involuntary and unavoidable forms of solicitation, as the courts have found:
“Advertisements of this sort are
constantly
before
the
eyes
of
observers on the streets . . . to be
seen without the exercise of choice
or volition on their part. Other forms
of advertising are ordinarily seen as
a matter of choice on the part of the
observer. The young people as well
as the adults have the message of
the billboard thrust upon them by
all the arts and devices that skill
can produce. In the case of newspapers and magazines, there must
be some seeking by the one who is
to see and read the advertisement.
The radio can be turned off; but not
so the billboard . . . . These distinctions clearly place this kind of
advertisement in a position to be
classified so that regulations or prohibitions may be imposed upon all
within the class. This is impossible
with respect to newspapers and
magazines.”; and
Whereas, the Supreme Court and
other courts have recognized the
positive relationship between advertising and consumption as regards a
variety of goods and services, such
as electricity, gambling, cigarettes,
and alcohol; and
Whereas, in addition to judicial
recognition of the general link
between advertising and consumption, there is specific and convinc-

Risk Behavior Survey conducted by
the Ohio Department of Education,

Development
Division,
found that:
Smoking is related to poor academic performance as well as the use
of alcohol and other drugs.
Over one million teenagers begin
smoking each year.
Sixty-nine percent (69%) of Ohio
high school students had tried cigarette
smoking.
Sixty-six
percent
(66%) of ninth graders, 67% of
tenth graders, 69% of eleventh
graders, and 72% of twelfth graders
had tried cigarettes.
Twenty-seven percent (27%) of
Ohio high school students smoked a
whole cigarette for the first time
prior to age 13. Thirty-four percent
(34%) of ninth graders, 25% of
tenth graders, 24% of eleventh
graders, and 23% of twelfth graders
smoked a whole cigarette prior to
age 13.
Twenty-four
percent
(24%)
of
Ohio high school students reported
that they ever smoked regularly,
which was defined as smoking at
least one cigarette every day for 30
days. Twenty-five percent (25%) of
ninth graders, 24% of tenth graders,
23% of eleventh graders, and 25% of
twelfth graders smoked cigarettes
regularly. Significantly more white
(28%) than black students (8%)
reported they ever smoked regularly.

32
Eight percent (8%) of Ohio high
school students (9% of males and
7% of females) started smoking cigarettes regularly prior to age 13.
Significantly more white (9%) than
black students (3%) smoked cigarettes regularly before age 13.
Thirty percent (30%) of Ohio high
school students smoked cigarettes
one or more times during the month
prior to the completing the survey.
Significantly more white (33%) than
black students (14%) smoked at
least once during the 30 days preceding the survey.
Twenty-one
percent
(21%)
of
Ohio’s high school students smoked
two or more cigarettes per day on
the days they smoked. Significantly
more white (24%) than black students (7%) smoked two or more cigarettes per day.
Twelve percent (12%) of Ohio
high school students smoked cigarettes on school property during the
30 days prior to the survey. Significantly more white (13%) than black
students (5%) smoked cigarettes on
school property.
Eighteen percent (18%) of Ohio
high school students tried to quit
smoking cigarettes during the six
months prior to the survey. Twentyone percent (21%) of ninth graders,
17% of tenth graders, 17% of
eleventh
graders,
and
15%
of
twelfth graders tried to quit smoking cigarettes during the six months
before completing the survey. Significantly more white (21%) than
black students (4%) tried to quit
smoking; and
Whereas, cigarette advertisements
tend to emphasize youthful vigor,
sexual attraction, and independence
themes, which appeal to teenagers
and young adults struggling with
these issues; and
Whereas, tobacco use is associated with alcohol and illicit drug use,
acting as a “gateway drug” by
young people who enter a sequence
of drug use that can include tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and harder
drugs, and is associated with a
range
of
health-compromising
behaviors, including being involved
in fights, carrying weapons, and
engaging in high risk sexual behavior; and
Whereas, research conducted by
Scenic America, a nonprofit conservative organization indicates that
unlike the print media, the billboard
industry exercises no restraints on
ad placement to protect children.
“They simply put billboards anywhere they can including next to
homes,
schools,
churches,
parks,
playgrounds, health centers, sports
stadiums, shopping centers — literally everywhere”; and
Whereas, an ordinance restricting
the placement or display of advertisements for cigarettes in publicly
visible locations within the City of
Cleveland is a reasonable and necessary measure for reducing illegal
consumption
of
cigarettes
by
minors; and
Whereas,
the
restrictions
contained in the following Ordinance
will not unduly burden legitimate
business
activities
of
persons
licensed by the State of Ohio to sell
cigarettes on a retail basis; and
Whereas, in order to protect legitimate business activities and to narrowly focus its efforts on those
advertisements which most directly
affect
minors
where
they
live,
attend school, attend church, and

The City Record
engage in recreational activities,
the City of Cleveland has determined not to restrict advertisements
of cigarettes in certain designated
business and industrial zones hereinafter identified, with reasonable
and
appropriate
setbacks
from
adjoining zones; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or welfare in that it is necessary to
reduce illegal consumption of cigarettes by minors, to promote the welfare of minors exposed to advertisements for cigarettes and for the
other reasons stated in the recitals
to this ordinance, now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That, for the reasons
stated in the “Whereas” clauses and
based upon the reports, studies and
other data as to cigarette usage and
cigarette advertising contained in
File No. 988-97-A, the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
hereby supplemented by enacting
new Sections 680A.01 and 680A.99

Ord. No. 989-97.
By Mayor White and Councilmen
Robinson, Patton, White, Patmon,
Willis and Jones.
An emergency ordinance to enact
Sections 680B.01 and 680B.99 of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, relating to restricting the
placement or display of outdoor
advertisements for alcoholic beverages, and providing a penalty.
Whereas, Sections 4301.63 through
4301.632 of the Ohio Revised Code
make it unlawful for any person
under the age of 21 years to order,
attempt to purchase, consume, or
possess any beer or intoxicating
liquor in the state of Ohio, and Section 4301.69 of the Ohio Revised
Code prohibits the sale, furnishing,
or purchasing of beer or intoxicating liquor to or on behalf of underage persons by any persons, including liquor permit holders authorized
to sell such products in the State of
Ohio; and
Whereas, the Center for Science in
the Public Interest (CSPI) has
found that “for American teens, alcohol is by far the most widely used
and abused drug. Despite laws prohibiting use and possession of alcohol by minors and sales to underage
persons, over 4 million young Americans experience serious alcoholrelated
problems
before
leaving
high school.”; and
Whereas, a survey conducted in
1993 by the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration
reported that 41.3 percent of minors
between the ages of twelve and seventeen reported alcoholic beverage
consumption, and according to a
1994 CSPI study, 16.3% of minors 1217 years of age, and 61.3% of minors
18-21 years of age reported alcohol
use within the 30 days prior to the
study; and
Whereas, research by the CSPI
reveals further that:
The median age at which children
begin drinking is just over thirteen
years, and that 67% of 8th graders
have tried alcohol.
Children feel intense peer pressure to drink alcohol. In a 1990 survey, 35% of 4th graders and 49% of
sixth graders said they felt pressured by their classmates to drink.
Junior and senior high school students drink 35% of all wine coolers
sold in the United States and 1.1 billion cans of beer each year.
Underage drinkers find alcohol
easy to obtain. In one study conducted in Washington D.C., 19 and
20-year-old youths purchased a sixpack of beer in 97 out of 100
attempts.
Alcohol use has been involved in
as many as 50% - 65% of all suicides among youths.
Alcohol-related traffic crashes are
the number one killer of 16-to-24year-olds.
High school students who drink
are four times more likely to have
had sexual intercourse and twice as
likely to have had four or more sex
partners, behaviors which increase
the risk for HIV infection; and
Whereas, alcoholic beverages are
among the most heavily marketed
product in America, and in 1991 the
alcoholic beverage industry spent
approximately $1 billion to promote
and advertise its products, with
more than $81.5 million targeted
specifically for outdoor advertising
of its products; and
Whereas, outdoor advertisements
are a unique and distinguishable
medium of advertising which subjects the general public to involun-

tary and unavoidable forms of solicitation, as the courts have found:
“Advertisements of this sort are
constantly

with respect to newspapers and

Whereas, the Supreme Court and
other courts have recognized the
positive relationship between advertising and consumption as regards a
variety of goods and services, such
as electricity, gambling, cigarettes,
and alcohol; and
Whereas, in addition to judicial
recognition of the general link
between advertising and consumption, a report by a Maryland Drug
and Alcohol Abuse Commission on
“The Impact of Alcohol Advertising
and the Use of Alcohol in Television
Programs and Films on Underage
Drinking” (January 1993) concluded:
Research consistently showed that
children’s
attitudes
favorable
to
alcohol are significantly related to
their exposure to alcohol advertisements.
Specific alcoholic beverage advertising practices such as use of cartoon characters and animals (e.g.,
“Spuds McKenzie”) that are especially appealing to children and
youth, using rock stars and athletes
as spokespersons, and associating
drinking with sports and other
activities that have a great appeal
to youth such as race car driving,
rock climbing, water sports, etc.,
greatly contribute to attitudes favorable to alcohol among youth.
Children are exposed to billboards
advertising alcohol on a regular
basis simply by walking to school
or playing in their neighborhood,
and there is no practical means of
parental monitoring or limiting of
exposure to these public advertisements.
The “overwhelming majority” of
research studies showed a definite
correlation between alcohol advertising and underage drinking.
Glamorous
“lifestyle”
alcoholic
beverage advertisements have a
“profound influence” on young people’s attitudes about alcohol; and
Whereas,
research
shows
that
when children’s exposure to alcohol
advertising increases, they:
Perceive drinking as more attractive, acceptable, and rewarding;
View drinkers more positively
(i.e., more friendly, relaxed, fun-loving, happy, sophisticated, etc.);
Are more likely to see beer drinking as “cool” and “macho”;
Are more likely to believe that
drinking is a way to relax and deal
with stress;
Are more likely to agree that it is
okay for teenagers to drink;
Are more likely to name alcohol
than water as an appropriate beverage for adults; and
Have increased expectations to
drink in the future; and

301

33
Whereas, a variety of studies indicate that alcohol is involved in at
least one-half of all the major causes of death among youth: motor
vehicle crashes, suicides, homicides,
drowning, and other accidents. Alcohol-related accidents are now the
leading cause of death among young
people; and
Whereas, The 1993 Ohio Youth
Risk Behavior Survey conducted by
the Ohio Department of Education,
Student Development Division, found
that:
Alcohol is a major contributing
factor in approximately half of all
homicides, suicides, and motor vehicle crashes, which are leading causes of death and disability among
young people.
Heavy drinking among youth has
been linked conclusively to physical
fights, destroyed property, academic
and job problems, and trouble with
law enforcement authorities.
Overall, 34% of Ohio high school
students had their first drink of
alcohol or other than a few sips
prior to age 13. Forty-four percent
(44%) of ninth graders, 35% of
tenth graders, 31% of eleventh
graders, and 24% of twelfth graders
reported that they drank before age
13.
Eighty percent (80%) of Ohio
high school students had at least
one drink of alcohol during their
life.
During the 30 days prior to the
survey, 46% of Ohio high school students reported that they’d had at
least one drink of alcohol.
During the 30 days preceding the
survey, 30% of Ohio high school students had five or more drinks of
alcohol in a row. Twenty-six percent
(26%) of ninth and tenth graders,
33% of eleventh graders, and 37% of
twelfth graders drank five or more
drinks in a row.
Five percent (5%) of Ohio’s high
school students had at least one
drink of alcohol on school property
during the 30 days preceding the
survey; and
Whereas, according to 1992 reports
by then U.S. Surgeon General, Dr.
Antonia Novello (“Youth and Alcohol: Dangerous and Deadly Consequences”) and then U.S. Inspector
General, Richard Kusserow (“Youth
and Alcohol: Drinking and Crime”):
About one-third of all juvenile
males arrested said they had used
alcohol in the previous 72 hours.
Nearly 40% of youths in adult correctional facilities reported drinking
before committing the crime.
Eighteen percent (18%) of high
school females and 39% of high
school males say that “it’s okay to
force sex if the girl is drunk.”
A “striking association” exists
between alcohol use and using
firearms to commit suicide by 10-to19-year-olds.
Forty percent (40%) to 50% of
young males who drowned had consumed alcohol prior to drowning.
Forty percent (40%) to 50% of
youths injured diving had consumed
alcohol prior to diving.
Among high school seniors, twice
as many frequent binge drinkers
skipped school (55% versus 25%),
and nearly five times as many
seniors who binged frequently damaged school property (36% versus
8%); and
Whereas, alcoholic beverage advertisements tend to emphasize youthful
vigor, sexual attraction, and independence themes, which appeal to
teenagers and young adults struggling with these issues; and

34
Whereas, alcohol use is associated with tobacco and illicit drug use,
acting as a “gateway drug” by
young people who enter a sequence
of
drug
use
that
can
include
tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and
harder drugs, and is associated with
a

of
health-compromising
behaviors, including being involved
