state; and
Whereas, the place for which the

By Councilmen Cimperman, Dolan,

An emergency resolution supporting the principles embodied in The
Charter for Change intended to
bring peace, justice and equality to
all the people of Ireland.
Whereas, the Cleveland City Council has sought to seek justice for the
people in Northern Ireland through
the passage of legislation such as
the MacBride Principles; and
Whereas, there is today in Northern Ireland a rare moment of hope
for a just and lasting peace for all
Irish people. The commitment by all
necessary parties to the peace talks
in Belfast, under the chairmanship
of the American Special Envoy, presents an historic opportunity for the
achievement of the long sought
after goal of everlasting peace and
equality; and
Whereas, a concerned group of
people from Northern Ireland, after
reflecting on what changes and
what guarantees of rights are needed for nationalists and unionists to
work together to build a future as
equals, has designed The Charter
for Change, which corresponds to

30
the basic ideas of liberty, justice
and democracy embodied in sacred
documents such as the United States
Constitution and Bill of Rights, in
domestic and international law and
treaties and in basic notions of fair
play and equity; and
Whereas, the denial of equal and
full rights for all people has been
the root cause of the conflict in
Northern Ireland. All people everywhere should, at a basic minimum,
be guaranteed these rights, and the
people in the North of Ireland no
exception. These rights must be
guaranteed through the peace talks
no matter what governance structures are ultimately negotiated by
the parties and government this
year; and
Whereas,
Irish-Americans
persuaded President Clinton to provide
leadership in the Northern Ireland
peace process, resulting in the Special Envoy from the United States to
chair the talks.
Now, therefore be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland wholeheartedly
endorses The Charter for Change as
a democratic agenda that must be
enacted to ensure that peace, justice
and full reconciliation be achieved
in Ireland.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council transmit copies of this resolution
to President Clinton, the Secretary
of State and the sponsors of The
Charter for Change movement in
Ireland.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

An emergency resolution opposing
State House Bill 386 which bill will
prohibit
public
authorities
from
imposing certain labor requirements
as a condition of being awarded certain public contracts.
Whereas, if passed, House Bill 386
of the 122nd Ohio General Assembly
will
prohibit
public
authorities,
including the City of Cleveland, in
all public contracts and the procurement of products and services
from (1) requiring the successful
bidder, contractor or subcontractor
from entering into or adhering to
agreements with any labor organization and (2) requiring the successful bidder, contractor and subcontractor to enter into, adhere to or
enforce any agreement that requires
the employees of said bidder, contractor or subcontractor to become
members of or affiliated with a
labor organization as a condition of
employment or continued employment; and
Whereas, House Bill 386 permits
an interested party to file a civil
action within two years of the date
on which a contract for a public
improvement was signed for alleged
violation of the bill, may make the
public authority a party to the
action, requires a court to award

court costs and attorney fees to a
prevailing plaintiff, and possibly
void the contract.
Now, therefore, be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio State Legislature and Governor Voinovich to rejects House
Bill 386 due to its anti-labor tenor
and not being in the public’s best
interest.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council transmit copies of this resolution
to
Governor
Voinovich,
House
Speaker Davidson and the Cuyahoga
County delegation.
Section 3. That this resolution is

An emergency resolution urging
the Mayor to negotiate with the NFL
and the new owner of the Cleveland
Browns to cover all costs overruns
at the new Cleveland Stadium.
Whereas, during the Council deliberations in 1996 on the new Cleveland Stadium for the Cleveland
Browns football team, Mayor White
and the NFL represented that the
cost of a “state of the art” stadium
for an NFL football team would be
$220 Million; and
Whereas, the NFL agreed to participate in the financing of the Stadium when costs exceed $220 Million; and
Whereas, subsequent to the execution of the appropriate agreements, Mayor White announced that
the cost of the new Cleveland Stadium would be $248 Million and that
the project would come in “on time”
and “on budget”; and
Whereas, costs for the new Cleveland Stadium may exceed the $248
Million budget, presently estimated
to be in the range of $13 Million to
$23 Million; and
Whereas, the NFL recently signed
the largest TV contract in history
for the right to televise NFL games,
which contract exceeds $17 Billion;
and
Whereas, due to the extraordinary
amount of profit the NFL and the
new owner of the Cleveland Browns
will receive from the Browns franchise, the NFL and the new owner
should be responsible for all cost
overruns exceeding the $248 Million
budget.
Now, therefore, be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
Mayor White to negotiate with the
NFL and the new owner of the
Cleveland Browns to agree to be
responsible for all cost overruns
incurred in connection with the new
Cleveland Stadium that exceed the
$248 Million budget. This demand is
made based upon the amount of public investment already committed by
this community to the project and
the lost revenues this community
has suffered with the relocation of
the Browns to Baltimore and the
projected amount of revenue the

618

NFL and new owner will receive
from the new Cleveland Browns and
Stadium.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council transmit copies of this resolution
to NFL Commissioner Tagliabue and
members of the NFL Executive Committee.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

An emergency resolution urging
the U. S. Postal Service to designate
a Centennial Stamp in honor of the
lifetime achievements of Paul Robeson.
Whereas, April 9, 1998 marked the
100th Birthday of the great Paul
Robeson:
actor,
athlete,
scholar,
author, humanitarian, and fighter
for
civil
rights
for
all
people
throughout the world; and
Whereas, Paul Robeson, rose to
prominence when segregation was
legal in the United States and African-Americans were being lynched
by mobs; and
Whereas, Paul Robeson, the son of
a runaway slave, had many life
achievements including an academic scholarship to Rutgers University, an All-American football player,
class valedictorian, Phi Beta Kappa,
four varsity letters, lawyer, author,
and world renowned theatrical performer and singer who was fluent
in several languages and sang
songs in over 50 languages all
around the globe; and
Whereas, during his lifetime, Paul
Robeson spoke out strongly for
labor
and
civil
rights,
opposed
racism and colonialism and fought
extremely hard for the rights of
working people; and
Whereas, during the height of the
McCarthy Era, Mr. Robeson had his
passport revoked for eight years;
due to his beliefs and outspokenness
he sacrificed his fame and personal
fortune and endured great personal
hardship for his principles.
Now, therefore, be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the U. S. Postal Service Citizen’s
Stamp Advisory Committee to designate a Centennial Stamp in 1998 in
honor of the lifetime achievements
of the great humanitarian Paul
Robeson and joins the thousands of
other individuals and groups, including the Congressional Black Caucus
in petitioning said Postal Service
Advisory Committee.
