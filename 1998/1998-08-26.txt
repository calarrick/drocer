An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Department of Transportation to use existing railroad tracks
to create passenger rail service
between Cleveland and Columbus,
and opposing the construction of a
third lane in each direction on Interstate 71 between Columbus and the
service area of the Northeast Ohio
Areawide Coordinating Agency.
Whereas, ODOT hopes to reconstruct a 140-mile section of I-71
between Cleveland and Columbus,
involving 10 years of work and
$302 million of taxpayers’ dollars;
and
Whereas, ODOT proposes to add
passenger
rail
service
between
Cleveland and Columbus, costing
initially more than $32 million, on
existing tracks; and
Whereas, ODOT recommends that
the existing Amtrak station in
downtown Cleveland be the northern terminus for I-71 passenger rail;
and
Whereas, the proposal to provide
passenger
rail
service
between
Cleveland and Columbus has been
greeted by many, including local
and regional governments and newspaper editorial boards, as a most
welcome concept; and
Whereas, ODOT nonetheless also
plans to widen I-71 by one permanent lane in each direction for most
of the distance between Cleveland
and Columbus as a means of accommodating traffic during the reconstruction period; and
Whereas, the 30-year cost of building and maintaining the additional
highway capacity provided by the
third lane in each direction is estimated at $500 million; and
Whereas, once I-71 is reconstructed, ODOT planners believe the rightof-way
may
not
permit
further
widening without extremely high
additional acquisition and construction costs; and
Whereas, ODOT planners note
that additional travel capacity can
be expanded in a cost-effective
manner simply by adding rail cars
to fast, modern passenger trains;
and

38
Whereas,
expanding
passenger
rail service into downtown Cleveland from other cities in the Great
Lakes region and Midwest would
improve the City’s travel, meeting
and convention and tourism economy by providing a convenient, costeffective
and
time-efficient,
allweather
transportation
link
to
downtown attractions at the North
Coast, Tower City, Gateway and
University Circle, and in particular
to the newly planned Transportation
Center at a new Cleveland Convention Center; and
Whereas, a balanced transportation system for Ohio, which coordinates links between highways, passenger rail lines, airports and other
modes of travel, will increase mobility of all citizens and expand economic development opportunities for
large and small communities alike
along the I-71 corridor;
Now, therefore be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Cleveland City
Council hereby strongly supports
the introduction of passenger rail
service linking Cleveland, Galion
and Columbus; and
Section 2. That the Cleveland City
Council hereby supports the possible expansion of said passenger
rail line to Dayton and Cincinnati;
and
Section 3. That the Cleveland City
Council hereby encourages the Ohio
Department of Transportation, the
Ohio Rail Development Commission,
CSX, Norfolk Southern, Amtrak and
others to work together to start passenger rail service between Cleveland and Columbus as soon as possible; and
Section 4. That the Cleveland City
Council hereby encourages coordinated connections to permit travelers to transfer easily to Greater
Cleveland Regional Transit Authority services and to Cleveland Hopkins
International
Airport
to
improve mobility for all travelers;
and
Section 5. That the Cleveland City
Council hereby supports all efforts
aimed at guaranteeing that passenger rail service be provided, without
the need for transfer, the complete
distance to the planned Transportation Center in downtown Cleveland;
and
Section 6. That the Cleveland City
Council hereby opposes the construction of a permanent third lane
in each direction of I-71 for the distance between the limits of the
cities of Medina and Columbus
except when a merge lane is deemed
by the local Metropolitan Planning
Organization imperative to safety
and Level of Service in conjunction
with high-volume interchanges, and
except as deemed necessary for
truck-climbing in steep incline areas;
and
Section 7. That the Cleveland City
Council hereby supports the planning and implementation of Intelligent Traffic Systems concurrent
with reconstruction as a means of
enhancing Level of Service and safety without permanent additional
highway capacity.
Section 8. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Department of Transportation to use existing railroad tracks
to create passenger rail service
between Cleveland and Columbus,
and opposing the construction of a
third lane in each direction on Interstate 71 between Columbus and the
service area of the Northeast Ohio
Areawide Coordinating Agency.

70
Whereas, ODOT hopes to reconstruct a 140-mile section of I-71
between Cleveland and Columbus,
involving 10 years of work and
$302 million of taxpayers’ dollars;
and
Whereas, ODOT proposes to add
passenger
rail
service
between
Cleveland and Columbus, costing
initially more than $32 million, on
existing tracks; and
Whereas, ODOT recommends that
the existing Amtrak station in
downtown Cleveland be the northern terminus for I-71 passenger rail;
and
Whereas, the proposal to provide
passenger
rail
service
between
Cleveland and Columbus has been
greeted by many, including local
and regional governments and newspaper editorial boards, as a most
welcome concept; and
Whereas, ODOT nonetheless also
plans to widen I-71 by one permanent lane in each direction for most
of the distance between Cleveland
and Columbus as a means of accommodating traffic during the reconstruction period; and
Whereas, the 30-year cost of building and maintaining the additional
highway capacity provided by the
third lane in each direction is estimated at $500 million; and
Whereas, once I-71 is reconstructed, ODOT planners believe the rightof-way
may
not
permit
further
widening without extremely high
additional acquisition and construction costs; and
Whereas, ODOT planners note
that additional travel capacity can
be expanded in a cost-effective
manner simply by adding rail cars
to fast, modern passenger trains;
and
Whereas,
expanding
passenger
rail service into downtown Cleveland from other cities in the Great
Lakes region and Midwest would
improve the City’s travel, meeting
and convention and tourism economy by providing a convenient, costeffective
and
time-efficient,
allweather
transportation
link
to
downtown attractions at the North
Coast, Tower City, Gateway and
University Circle, and in particular
to the newly planned Transportation
Center at a new Cleveland Convention Center; and
Whereas, a balanced transportation system for Ohio, which coordinates links between highways, passenger rail lines, airports and other
modes of travel, will increase mobility of all citizens and expand economic development opportunities for
large and small communities alike
along the I-71 corridor;
Now, therefore be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Cleveland City
Council hereby strongly supports
the introduction of passenger rail
service linking Cleveland, Galion
and Columbus; and
Section 2. That the Cleveland City
Council hereby supports the possible expansion of said passenger
rail line to Dayton and Cincinnati;
and
Section 3. That the Cleveland City
Council hereby encourages the Ohio
Department of Transportation, the
Ohio Rail Development Commission,
CSX, Norfolk Southern, Amtrak and
others to work together to start passenger rail service between Cleveland and Columbus as soon as possible; and
Section 4. That the Cleveland City
Council hereby encourages coordinated connections to permit travel-

The City Record
ers to transfer easily to Greater
Cleveland Regional Transit Authority services and to Cleveland Hopkins
International
Airport
to
improve mobility for all travelers;
and
Section 5. That the Cleveland City
Council hereby supports all efforts
aimed at guaranteeing that passenger rail service be provided, without
the need for transfer, the complete
distance to the planned Transportation Center in downtown Cleveland;
and
Section 6. That the Cleveland City
Council hereby opposes the construction of a permanent third lane
in each direction of I-71 for the distance between the limits of the
cities of Medina and Columbus
except when a merge lane is deemed
by the local Metropolitan Planning
Organization imperative to safety
and Level of Service in conjunction
with high-volume interchanges, and
except as deemed necessary for
truck-climbing in steep incline areas;
and
Section 7. That the Cleveland City
Council hereby supports the planning and implementation of Intelligent Traffic Systems concurrent
with reconstruction as a means of
enhancing Level of Service and safety without permanent additional
highway capacity.
Section 8. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

offender
be
granted
work
release from imprisonment after the
offender has served the three, ten,

Ohio in connection with a loan from
the department to fund costs of a
municipal stadium, authorizing the
issuance of a Bond to evidence the
loan and the obligation of the City
to repay the loan and authorizing
and approving related matters.
Whereas, pursuant to Ordinance
Nos. 303-96, 304-96, 305-96, and 306-96
(the “1996 Authorizing Legislation”)
each passed by this Council on
March 8, 1996, this Council authorized the City to enter into various
agreements providing for the construction, financing and operation of
a new municipal stadium and the
commitment by the National Football League of an NFL franchise
with a home territory of Cleveland,
Ohio to play its home games in the
stadium; and
Whereas, a portion of the costs of
the stadium are to be paid from
State
capital
appropriations,
of
which $15,000,000 was appropriated
by the General Assembly of the
State for the State capital biennium
ended June 30, 1998 and the balance
is expected to be appropriated in the
State capital bill to be enacted for
the current capital biennium beginning July 1, 1998 and ending June
30, 2000; and
Whereas, as of this date the General Assembly has not introduced or
enacted legislation providing any

1493

81
State capital appropriations for the
current biennium; and
Whereas,
the
State,
acting
through its Department of Development, will make available an alternative source of funds in order to
permit the City to continue the construction of the stadium and thereby enable the facility to be timely
completed and available for the play
of NFL football in the fall of 1999
and thereby assure the timely delivery to the City of the NFL franchise
and the Cleveland Browns team
name, colors and heritage.
Whereas,
the
Department
of
Development will provide that financial assistance pursuant to a loan
under Revised Code Chapter 166
(that loan and the obligation of the
City to repay that loan will be evidenced by the Bond authorized herein); and
Whereas, the City presently anticipates that any funds loaned by the
Director to the City will be repaid
from subsequent State capital appropriations to be made by the General Assembly, but provision is made
herein
for
payment
from
other
sources in the event such appropriations are not made; and
Whereas, the Director of Finance
as fiscal officer of this City has certified to this Council that the estimated life or period of usefulness of
the improvement to be financed is
at least five years and the estimated maximum maturity of the Bond
evidencing the loan, as described
herein, is 30 years; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the daily operation of a
municipal department and providing
for the immediate preservation of
the public peace, property, health or
safety in that the loan from the
State and the issuance of the Bond
to evidence that loan are needed to
provide funds to proceed in a timely manner with the construction of
the stadium to ensure an NFL franchise will be located in the City at
the earliest possible time; now,

accrue for the period after that date.
The Bond shall be subject to prepayment prior to stated maturity, in
whole or in part on any date, at a
prepayment price equal to the principal amount prepaid, plus any

certain events as provided in the
Loan Agreement. Any such prepayment prior to maturity shall be
made by payment of the prepayment
price to the Director, as the registered owner, on the prepayment
date.
If less than all of the outstanding
principal of the Bond is to be prepaid at one time, the principal
installments of the Bond shall be
prepaid as selected by the City. If
money for the prepayment of all or
a portion of the principal amount of
the Bond is paid to the registered
owner on the applicable prepayment
date,
interest
on
the
principal
amount
prepaid

August 26, 1998
The
Director
of
Finance
is
appointed to act as the authenticating agent, bond registrar and transfer agent (collectively, the “Registrar”) for the Bond. Pursuant to and
in accordance with Section 9.96, Ohio
Revised Code, the City may hereafter designate a different person to
serve as Registrar and enter into a
contract for the provision by that
person as Registrar of any of the
services described in division (C) of
Section 9.96, which contract may be
signed on behalf of the City by the
Director of Finance.
The Bond shall not be valid or
become obligatory for any purpose
or be entitled to any security or benefit under this Ordinance unless and
until a certificate of authentication
printed on the Bond is signed by the
Registrar as authenticating agent.
Authentication
by
the
Registrar
shall be conclusive evidence that the
Bond so authenticated has been duly
authenticated and delivered under
this Ordinance and is entitled to the
security and benefit of this Ordinance.
So long as the Bond remains outstanding, the City will cause to be
maintained and kept by the Registrar, at the Registrar’s office, all
books and records necessary for the
registration, exchange and transfer
of the Bond as provided in this Section (the “Register”). The registered
owner shall be regarded as the
absolute owner of the Bond for all
purposes of this Ordinance. Payment
of or on account of principal of or
interest on the Bond shall be made
only to or upon the order of the registered owner. Neither the City nor
the Registrar shall be affected by
any notice to the contrary, but the
registration may be changed as
herein provided. All such payments
shall be valid and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability on the Bond, including interest,
to the extent of the amount or
amounts so paid.
The Bond, upon presentation and
surrender thereof at the office of the
Registrar, together with a request
for exchange signed by the registered owner or by a person authorized by the registered owner to do
so by a power of attorney satisfactory to the Registrar, may be
exchanged, at the option of the registered owner, for a Bond in a
denomination equal in the aggregate to the unmatured and unredeemed principal amount of the
Bond surrendered, bearing interest
at the Applicable Rate and maturing on the same date or dates and
in the same principal installments.
The Bond may be transferred only
on the Register, upon presentation
and surrender thereof at the office
of the Registrar, together with an
assignment executed by the registered owner or by a person authorized by the registered owner to do
so by a power of attorney in a form
satisfactory to the Registrar. Upon
that transfer, the Registrar shall (i)
reissue the surrendered Bond to the
transferee, or (ii) if requested by
the transferee, complete, authenticate and deliver a new Bond in the
authorized denomination, provided
that in all cases in which a Bond is
exchanged or transferred hereunder
for a new Bond, the City shall execute the new Bond by the officers
authorized under this Ordinance and
the
Registrar
shall
undertake
actions to authenticate and deliver
the Bond only after execution of the
new Bond by the duly authorized
officers of the City.

August 26, 1998
Every exchange or transfer of the
Bond shall be without charge to the
registered owner; except that the
City and the Registrar may make a
charge sufficient to reimburse them
for any tax or excise required to be
paid with respect to the exchange
or transfer. The City or the Registrar may require that those charges,
if any, shall be paid before the procedure for the transfer or exchange
is begun. Any Bond issued upon a
transfer or exchange shall be the
valid special obligation of the City,
evidencing the same obligation, and
entitled to the same benefits under
this Ordinance, as the Bond surrendered
upon
that
transfer
or
exchange.
Any Bond surrendered to the Registrar pursuant to this Ordinance for
the purpose of payment or retirement, or for exchange, replacement
or transfer, shall be canceled by the
Registrar, unless, in the case of a
transfer, the surrendered Bond is to
be reissued to the transferee. Certification of the surrender and cancellation of Bonds shall be made,
and retention of canceled Bonds
shall be retained for a period of four
years and then destroyed by the
Registrar.
Section 5. Delivery of Loan Agreement and Bond. The Mayor and the
Director of Finance are authorized
to sign and deliver, in the name and
on behalf of the City and in their
official capacities, a Loan Agreement in substantially the form of
the loan agreement now on file with
the Clerk of Council in File No.122198-A. After the Loan Agreement is
executed, it shall not be changed or
amended without the prior legislative authorization of Cleveland City
Council and such Loan Agreement
shall contain a provision stating
that such prior legislative approval
by
Cleveland
City
Council
is
required in order to change or
amend the Loan Agreement. The
Bond evidencing the loan and the
agreement to repay the loan shall
be and is hereby awarded and sold
at private sale to the Director, in
accordance with this Ordinance and
the Loan Agreement, at a purchase
price equal to the par value thereof. It is hereby determined that the
price for and the terms of the Bond,
and the sale thereof, all as provided and to be provided in this Ordinance and the Loan Agreement, are
in the best interest of the City and
in compliance with all legal requirements.
The
Mayor,
the
Director
of
Finance, the Clerk of Council and
other City officials are authorized
and directed to make the necessary
arrangements with the Director to
establish the date, location, procedure and conditions for the delivery
of the Loan Agreement and the
Bond to the Director, and to take all
steps necessary to effect due execution and delivery of the Loan Agreement and the Bond to the Director,
together with a true transcript of
proceedings with reference thereto
upon payment of the purchase price
under the terms of this Ordinance.
The Mayor, the Director of Finance,
the Director of Law, the Clerk of
Council and other City officials, as
appropriate, are each authorized and
directed to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and
other documents and instruments
and to take such actions as are necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance, the Loan Agreement and the
Bond.

The City Record
Section 6. Allocation, Appropriation and Expenditure of Proceeds of
Loan - Project Fund. The proceeds
from the loan, as evidenced by the
sale of the Bond, shall be deposited
and credited to a separate account
of the proper fund, and those proceeds shall be used to pay costs of
the Project, including, without limitation, financing costs in connection
with the delivery of the Loan Agreement and the issuance of the Bond,
and are hereby appropriated for that
purpose. Prior to the expenditure of
any proceeds, the Finance Director
shall notify the Council.
Section 7. Repayment of the Loan.
The loan, and the Bond evidencing
the loan, shall be a special obligation of the City. Debt service on the
Bond (evidencing the repayment of
the loan) shall be payable solely
from State Local Government Fund
distributions to the City. If those
distributions
are
insufficient
