Res. No. 2067-98.
By Councilman White.
An emergency resolution urging
Governor elect Robert Taft and
the
Ohio
State
Legislature
to
examine minority set-aside laws in
order to develop a law that will
guarantee aid for minorities that
can withstand constitutional challenge.
Whereas, as a result of a recent
federal court ruling that the State
law of setting aside portions of public construction projects for minorities are considered unconstitutional,
Ohio Governor George V. Voinovich
ended the State of Ohio minority
set-aside program that provided billions of dollars in compensation to
minority-owned companies as compensation for previous discrimination; and
Whereas, between 1991 and 1998,
the State of Ohio has awarded contracts in excess of $1.6 billion to
minority-owned companies; and
Whereas, many minority contractors could possibly be shut out of
government
contracts
thus
compounding the discrimination they
have encountered in private industry that can greatly diminish business opportunities for these groups
as well as increasing barriers for
access into state government contracts; and
Whereas, many of these minorityowned businesses need such a setaside program in order to effectively compete in a open and sometimes
discriminatory market place; now,
therefore.
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges Ohio Governor elect Robert Taft and the
State Legislature to review the
minority set-aside program, and to
examine how the present law can be
modified to ensure aid to minorityowned companies while being made
to withstand any constitutional challenge.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby is directed to
transmit two certified copies of
this resolution to Ohio Governor
elect Robert Taft, and the Ohio
House
of
Representatives,
and
Congressmen
Louis
Stokes
and
Dennis Kucinich.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
