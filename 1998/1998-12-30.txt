Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
hereby supplemented by enacting
new Sections 396.01, 396.02, 396.03,

2204

December 30, 1998
396.04, 396.05, 396.06, 396.07, 396.08,
396.09 and 396.99 thereof to read,
respectively, as follows:
CHAPTER 396
NOTIFICATION, ENVIRONMENTAL
ABATEMENT AND
SECURING OF CLOSED OR
VACATED FACILITIES

Section 396.01 Definitions
As used in this Chapter:
(a) “Close” or “closing” means the
permanent cessation of business
operations at a facility. For purposes of this Chapter, “permanent”
means a period of time longer than
ninety (90) days and does not
include transfer of the business
operation to another entity which
will resume the operations within
the 90-day timeframe.
(b) “Facility” means an industrial
structure of any size or a commercial structure where such commercial structure is larger than one
hundred fifty thousand (150,000)
square feet.
(c) “Regulated substances” means
all hazardous and flammable substances regulated by this Title, as
well as petroleum, tires, and any
other hazardous or flammable substances regulated pursuant to federal, state, or local environmental
laws.
(d) “Vacate” or “vacant” means
abandoning a facility, or a majority of the facility as measured in
square footage, such that no regular activities or regular occupancy
by persons associated with the
facility is occurring. It does not
include:
(1) Storage of materials regulated
by and in compliance with the
remainder of this Title.
(2) Storage of materials regulated
by and in compliance with state or
federal environmental law.
(3) Storage of materials being
actively used in normal business
processes. The burden is on the
owner, operator, or party in control
to show that the materials are in
active use.
(4) Storage of materials that are
not regulated substances and that
are stored by an entity that is in the
commercial storage business as a
part of that business.
Section 396.02 Legislative Findings and Declaration of Nuisance
(a) Council of the City of Cleveland finds that:
(1) Non-residential sites which are
closed for business but vacant and
open to entry by the general public
attract children to enter who may
encounter health or environmental
hazards, harbor vermin, serve as
temporary abode for vagrants and
criminals, invite dumping and illegal storage of hazardous and flammable substances, and are likely to
be damaged by vandals or set
ablaze by arsonists.
(2) Unkempt and open grounds on
such sites invite the dumping of
garbage, rubbish, hazardous and
other regulated substances, and the
accumulation of combustible material.
(3) Thousands of structures in
this City are made of wood-frame
construction which is more combustible than other building types.
(4) Thousands of structures in
this City are situated on narrow lots
and in close proximity to one anoth-

December 30, 1998
er, thereby increasing the risk of
conflagration and the spread of environmental contamination through the
water and the air.
(b) All facilities which are injurious to or a menace to the public
health, safety or welfare, or which
constitute a fire hazard, or which
are vacant and open to public entry
are declared to be a nuisance and
are to be abated in accordance with
this Chapter.
(c) The owner, operator, or party
in control of any facility which is
closed or vacant as of the effective
date of this chapter shall comply
with the requirements of this Chapter by July 1, 1999.
Section 396.03 Notification and Fee
Requirements
(a) No later than sixty (60) days
before closing or vacating a facility
the owner, operator, or party in control of the facility shall submit to
the Fire Chief a written notice that
the facility will be closed or vacated, accompanied by a check or
money order payable to the “City of
Cleveland” for the sum of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00). Copies
of the notice shall also be submitted to the Director of Economic
Development, the Commissioner of
Environment, and the Commissioner
of Building and Housing.
(b) The notice shall designate a
contact person who works or resides
in Cuyahoga County and who shall
be available both before and after
closing or vacating the facility,
until the time that the property is
transferred to another owner, operator, or party in control. The contact
person shall provide access to the
facility
to
City
employees
and
agents to inspect the facility for the
purpose of ascertaining compliance
with this Chapter. The contact person shall respond to requests for
information regarding the facility;
however, the designation of a contact person does not preclude a City
employee or agent from requesting
information from or making notifications directly to the owner, operator, or party in control.
(c) The notice shall include the
address and telephone number of
the principal office or residence of
the owner, as well as the operator
or party in control, and the address
and telephone number of the contact
person.
(d) The notice shall include the
date on which the facility proposes
to close or be vacated and shall
include any plans for transfer of the
property to another owner, operator,
or party in control, if known.
(e) A person or entity acquiring
title to or control over any facility
which is closed or vacant shall comply with the requirements of this
Section within sixty (60) days after
acquiring title or control.
Section 396.04 Duties of Owner,

B. Maintain engineering documentation required in division (c) (4) of
Section 3167.04 that the flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse
will not be diminished.
C. Require that all necessary
maintenance will be provided for by
the applicant for the altered or relocated portion of such watercourse so
that the flood carrying capacity will
not be diminished.
(5)
Make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of
the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example,
where there appears to be a conflict
between a mapped boundary and
actual field conditions). Where a
map boundary and elevations disagree, the elevations delineated in
the flood elevation profile shall prevail. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to appeal
the interpretation as provided in
division (e) of Section 3167.04.
(e)
(1)
A. The Board of Building Standards and Building Appeals as
established by the Charter shall
hear
and

administration of this chapter.
C. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Board or any taxpayer,
may appeal such decision to the
Court of Common Pleas, Cuyahoga
County, Ohio, as provided in RC
Chapter 2506.
D. In passing upon such applications, the Board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant
factors, standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and
1. The danger that materials may
be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
2. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
3. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such
damage on the individual owner;
4. The importance of the services
provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
5. The availability of alternative
locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
6. The necessity to the facility of
a waterfront location, where applicable;
7. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
8. The relationship of the proposed
use to the comprehensive plan and
flood plain management program
for that area;
9. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
10. The expected heights, velocity,
duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the flood waters, and
the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
11. The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems, and
streets and bridges.
E. Upon consideration of the factors of division (e)(1)D. of this section and the purposes of this chapter, the Board of Building Standards
and Building Appeals may attach
such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to
further the purposes of this chapter.
F. The Secretary of the Board of
Building Standards and Building
Appeals shall maintain the records
of all appeal actions and report any
variances to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency upon request.
2.
A. Generally, variances may be
issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected
on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded
by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level,
providing items 1 through 11 in division (e)(1)D. of this section have
been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond this one-half acre,
the technical justification required
for issuing the variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for
the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure’s continued designation as
a historic structure and the variance
is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
C. Variances shall not be issued
within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during
the base flood discharge would result.

36
D. Variances shall only be issued
upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering
the flood hazard, to afford relief.
E. Variances shall only be issued
upon:
1. A showing of good and sufficient cause;
2. A determination that failure to
grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
3. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that
which is allowed in this chapter,
additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified
in division (e)(1)D. of this section
or conflict with existing local laws
or ordinances.
F. Variances may be issued by a
community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for
other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent
use provided that the criteria of division (e)(2)A. to E. of this section are
met, and the structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the
base flood and create no additional
threats to public safety.
G. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be
permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood
elevation and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with
the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
