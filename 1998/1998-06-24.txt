which Outstanding Revenue Bonds
will enable the Issuer, in the judgment of the officer or officers signing the Series 2002 Certificate of
Award, to obtain net present value
debt service savings with respect to
the Revenue Bonds so refunded. The
Current Refunded Bonds shall be
called for redemption on the date or

Section 15. Incorporation of Bond
Legislation. It is understood and
acknowledged that the Series I
Bonds and Series 2002 Bonds are
being issued pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms of the
Bond Legislation and of the Series
I and Series 2002 Bond Legislation,
and that the Series I Bonds and
Series 2002 Bonds are subject to the
terms and conditions of the Bond
Legislation except to the extent that
such terms and conditions are modified or amended by or pursuant to
the Series I and Series 2002 Bond
Legislation. All terms, conditions,
covenants and warranties contained
in the Bond Legislation, except as
otherwise provided in or pursuant to
the Series I and Series 2002 Bond
Legislation, shall apply with like
force and effect to the Series I
Bonds and Series 2002 Bonds as if
originally made in connection with
the issuance thereof.
Section
16.
Interest
Rate
Exchange Agreement. The Governing
Body finds that by engaging in
interest
rate
swap
transactions,
from time to time, the Issuer can, in
effect, convert interest on all or a
portion of the Revenue Bonds from
a fixed rate to a floating rate, or
from a floating rate to a fixed rate,
and thereby may reduce its cost of
borrowing by optimizing the relative amounts of fixed and floating
rate obligations from time to time
and minimizing the risk of variations in its debt service costs. To
permit the Issuer to have the flexibility to undertake such interest
rate swap transactions and to establish the procedures for approving
such transactions, this Governing
Body authorizes the execution and
delivery
of
an
Interest
Rate
Exchange Agreement (the “Rate

The City Record
Exchange Agreement”) and any
related agreements necessary for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by such Rate
Exchange Agreement.
Upon the recommendation of the
financial advisor of the Issuer to the
Director of Finance that an interest
rate swap transaction be undertaken by the Issuer, the Director of
Finance may authorize such an
interest rate swap transaction in
accordance with the Rate Exchange
Agreement; provided that (a) the
maximum
aggregate
notional
amount of interest rate swap transactions outstanding at any one time,
net of offsetting interest rate swap
transactions, shall not exceed an
amount equal to the greater of (i)
twenty percent of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all
Outstanding Revenue Bonds issued
under the Mortgage, or (ii) such
amount as will not result in a lowering of the ratings assigned to the
Outstanding Revenue Bonds by the
rating agencies, as is evidenced by
written correspondence from the rating agencies or policies published in
writing by the rating agencies and
(b) the term of each interest rate
swap transaction shall not exceed 30
years. The aggregate amount of all
such rate interest swap transactions
in effect as of any time shall be
determined on a net basis; that is,
where
any
such
transaction
is
entered into to offset or reverse an
earlier transaction, to the extent of
the offsetting or reversing effect,
the amounts of such offsetting or
reversing interest rate swap transactions shall not be included in the
aggregate total. The approval of
each interest rate swap transaction
by the Director of Finance shall be
conclusively evidenced by the execution of the applicable interest rate
swap transaction by the Director of
Finance or any other person duly
authorized by this Council to execute interest rate swap transactions.
The Issuer may pay any amounts
due
under
the
Rate
Exchange
Agreement and the interest rate
swap transactions from the Net Revenues of the Waterworks System
held in or for the credit of the Additions and Improvements Fund under
the Original Mortgage, as supplemented, and any other available
moneys of the Issuer permitted by
law to be used for the purpose of
making those payments. Nothing in
the Rate Exchange Agreement or
the interest rate swap transactions,
however, shall be deemed to prohibit the Issuer from using, of its own
volition, to the extent that it is
authorized by law to do so, any
other resources for the fulfillment of
any of the terms and conditions of
or its obligations under the Rate
Exchange Agreement or the interest
rate swap transactions.
Anything in this Series I and
Series 2002 Bond Legislation, the
Rate Exchange Agreement or any
interest rate swap transaction to the
contrary notwithstanding, the obligation of the Issuer to make payments under the Rate Exchange
Agreement and any interest rate
swap transaction does not and shall
not represent or constitute a general obligation, debt, bonded indebtedness or a pledge of the faith and
credit of the Issuer, the State of
Ohio or any other political subdivision thereof. Nothing herein gives
any party to the Rate Exchange
Agreement the right to have excises, ad valorem or other taxes levied
by the Issuer or the State of Ohio

1102

June 24, 1998
or by the taxing authority of any
other political subdivision for the
payment of any amounts due under
the Rate Exchange Agreement and
the interest rate swap transactions.

Issuer within the meaning of Section 2731.01, Ohio Revised Code.
(f) The Issuer will use, and will
restrict the use and investment of,
the proceeds of the Series I Bonds
and Series 2002 Bonds in such manner and to such extent as may be

than as bonds to which Section
103(a) of the Code applies, and (b)
the interest thereon will not be
treated as an item of tax preference
under Section 57 of the Code.
(g) The Issuer hereby covenants
that (a) it will take or cause to be
taken such actions that may be
required of it for the interest on the

to be and to remain excluded from

purposes, (b) it will not take or
authorize to be taken any actions

compliance, (i) apply the proceeds
of the Series I Bonds and Series 2002
Bonds to the respective governmental purposes of each borrowing, (ii)

Each covenant made in this section with respect to the Series I
Bonds and Series 2002 Bonds is also
made with respect to all issues for
which any portion of the Debt Service is paid from proceeds of the
Series I Bonds and Series 2002 Bonds
(and, if different, the original issue
and any refunding issues in a series
of refundings), to the extent such
compliance is necessary to assure
exclusion of interest on the Series I
Bonds and Series 2002 Bonds from
gross income for federal income tax
purposes,
and
the
Director
of
Finance, or any other officer having
responsibility with respect to the
Series I Bonds and Series 2002 Bonds
, is authorized to take such actions
with respect to those issues as they

The

Section
19.
Defeasance: Defeasance Agreement. This Governing
Body finds and determines that is
necessary and proper, and in the
best interest of the Issuer to defease
the Defeased Bonds (hereinafter
defined)
from
moneys
currently
available for such purpose in accordance

The
Defeased Bonds shall be designated

Agreement and shall consist of the
Outstanding Series A Bonds, Series
D Bonds, Series E Bonds, Series F
Bonds, Series G Bonds and Series H

Mortgage and will enable the Issuer,
in the judgment of the officer or
officers
signing
the
Defeasance
Agreement to realize net present
value debt service savings with
respect to the Revenue Bonds so
defeased, reduce further the debt
service charges payable by the
Issuer and thereby reduce the cost
of borrowing on its outstanding
debt. The Director of Finance is
hereby authorized to deposit into
the
Defeasance
Fund
available
monies in accordance with the Mortgage in an amount not to exceed
$30,000,000 determined by the Director of Finance in consultation with
the Director of Public Utilities. In

Defeased Bonds are deemed paid
and discharged, and in order to
cause the amounts so deposited to
be dedicated and applied solely to
the payment of the principal of and
interest and any redemption premium on the Defeased Bonds, as and
when due to and including the

for its performance of its fiduciary
duties as Defeasance Agent on
behalf of the Issuer. The officers
executing the Defeasance Agreement on behalf of the Issuer shall
determine
that
such
Defeasance
Agreement satisfies the requirements of this Section 19 which determination shall be conclusively evidenced by the execution of the
Defeasance Agreement by such officers. The Defeasance Agreement
shall provide for the redemption of
those Defeased Bonds in accordance
with the Mortgage and shall provide

Fund, and thereby maximize debt

arbitrage.
The
Director
of
Finance is authorized and directed
to take such other actions as may
be
necessary
or
appropriate
to

Bond Legislation, or any application
thereof, is for any reason held to be
