FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTION REFERRED
Res. No. 1120-98.
By Councilmen Jackson, Gordon,
Patmon and Johnson (by departmental request).
An emergency resolution supporting the application by the City of
Cleveland to the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency to receive a
multi-property Urban Setting Designation in certain of the areas of the
City designated for commercial and
industrial development.
Whereas,
the
Ohio
legislature
enacted Ohio’s Voluntary Action
Program (“VAP”) in July, 1994, to
address the problems of property
development,
particularly
in
the
urban centers of Ohio, due to concerns about the environmental condition of property, the extent of
cleanup necessary, the cost of such
cleanups, and the legal liability that
may exist due to environmental contamination; and
Whereas, the Voluntary Action
Program is designed to provide
legal and financial incentives for
the voluntary cleanup of contaminated property, thereby encouraging
significant re-investment in and redevelopment of urban properties
throughout Ohio, and through such
Program an owner or other person
may undertake a voluntary action to
determine if a property is contaminated and to pursue a cleanup under
applicable
standards
established
under the VAP; and
Whereas, the level of cleanup
required for ground water under a
property in order to meet the standards of the Voluntary Action Program and to protect public health,
depends, in part, on whether the
ground water is used for potable
purposes in the surrounding area,
and the VAP law and regulations
allow for a property to be designated as an “urban setting” in densely
populated areas where there are
large public water systems and the
ground water is not used for potable
purposes such that contaminated
ground water does not pose a substantial risk to public health and
thus a cleanup of such a property
will be less costly; and
Whereas, in order to foster development of properties within the City
of Cleveland, that may otherwise
not be developed due to concern
over environmental conditions, the
City of Cleveland is applying to the
Ohio
Environmental
Protection
Agency (“EPA”) for an Urban Setting Designation (“USD”) pursuant
to the authority of Ordinance No.
1157-97, passed by this Council on
August 13, 1997, for large areas of
the City, in order to pre-qualify such
properties within the City for special
Urban
Setting
Designation
cleanup standards for ground water,
which will eliminate the cost of
thousands of dollars to individual
property owners or developers to
apply for a property-specific Urban
Setting Designation, will assist owners and developers to avoid months
of delays for projects and will
encourage rather than discourage
development of so-called “Brownfield” properties within the City; and
Whereas, the areas of the City
which are covered by this first
application by the City for a multiproperty Urban Setting Designation
extend throughout the City in certain of the areas designated for commercial and industrial development,
as set forth in the maps contained
in the file described below; and

18
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that it will encourage
commercial and industrial development in the City of Cleveland; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland hereby declares
its support for the proposed multiproperty Urban Setting Designation
for the City of Cleveland, as set
forth in the application for such designation submitted by the City of
Cleveland, and as set forth in the
maps contained in File No. 1120-98A, and this Council urges the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency to
promptly approve the City’s application for an Urban Setting Designation for said properties.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution along with a
representative map of the areas of
the City included in the City’s application for an Urban Setting Designation to the Director of the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

indicated in the outline of required
steps in the correspondence of April
30, 1998, addressed to the Board of
County
Commissioners
from
the
Director of the Ohio Department of
Youth Services, Geno Natalucci-Persichetti; and
Whereas,
the
local
community
authority is constituted in the City
Council who is not opposed to the

local community
approval unless and until the following conditions have been satisfied:
(a) A detailed timetable for all
phases being constructed has been
provided; and

The City Record
Whereas, the proposed site on and
about the existing premises for the
Juvenile Court on 22nd Street is contrary to the City Zoning Code, in
that Section 337.08(e)(8) specifically
prohibits correctional facilities in
this zoning district, and that any
use in contradiction of the Code
which is non-conforming in nature
must obtain a zoning variance for
any “enlargement or expansion” pursuant to Chapter 359 of the Codified
Ordinances of the City of Cleveland,
1976; and
Whereas, the County Commissioners have not addressed the concerns
as protected under Chapter 161 of
the Codified Ordinances relating to
Landmark Commission approvals,
and buildings of a special historic,
community, or aesthetic interest or
value; and
Whereas, as the protector of the
local community, it is this Council’s
duty, before approving the proposed
plan, to assure that the proper care
is being provided to the children of
this community, and that the plan
will provide a viable institution for
the protection of the health, safety,
and welfare of our constituents; and
Whereas, although Council is not
opposed to the plan at this time,
approval is being withheld until
such time as the aforementioned
conditions and concerns have been
satisfied, and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department;
Now, therefore, be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland, does hereby and
herein formally serve notice upon the

conditions indicated above have been
satisfied, and do further serve notice
upon the aforementioned that the
subject site is not in compliance with
all Code and Zoning requirements as

Section 2. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland is ready, willing
and able to work with the County

Ord. No. 978-98.
By Mayor White.
An emergency ordinance approving and ratifying an agreement with
Norfolk Southern Corporation and
Norfolk Southern Railway Company
to ameliorate adverse environmental
impacts due to changes in rail traffic resulting from the railroads’
acquisition of certain Conrail assets.
Whereas, on June 23, 1997, Norfolk
Southern Corporation and Norfolk
Southern Railway Company (“NS”)
and
CSX
Corporation
and
CSX
Transportation, Inc. (“CSX”) filed a
joint application with the Surface
Transportation
Board
(“Board”)
seeking authority for NS and CSX to
acquire and divide certain assets of
Conrail; and
Whereas, on September 22 1997,
this Council approved Resolution No.
1799-97, wherein the Council, inter
alia strongly urged the Board to
review the proposed acquisition and
distribution of the assets of Conrail
with consideration of the negative
impacts
such
transaction
would
have on the citizens of the City of
Cleveland and the Greater Cleveland
area, including safety issues such as
increase in injuries to citizens and
the increase in delays in emergency
equipment response, and environmental issues related to air and
noise pollution and the shipment of
hazardous cargo; and
Whereas, Cleveland intervened in
the proceeding before the Board in
order to avoid significant adverse
environmental
impacts
resulting
from anticipated increases in rail
traffic in Cleveland’s neighborhoods
should the Board approve the joint
application; and
Whereas, on May 22, 1998, the
Mayor executed a Memorandum of
Agreement with NS which, subject
to ratification and approval by this
Council, would commit NS to make
changes to its Operating Plan, capital investments in Cleveland and
financial contributions to Cleveland
in order to ameliorate and mitigate
the adverse environmental impacts
in
Cleveland
resulting
from
increases in rail traffic by NS and
would result in significant benefits
to the City and its residents; and
Whereas, this Council hereby ratifies and approves the agreement
made by the Mayor and NS; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That, notwithstanding
any ordinance to the contrary, this
Council hereby ratifies and approves
the Memorandum of Agreement with
Norfolk Southern Corporation and
Norfolk Southern Railway Company
to ameliorate certain adverse environmental impacts due to changes
in rail traffic resulting from the
railroads’ acquisition of certain Conrail assets, which was executed by
the Mayor and NS on May 22, 1998
and reads as follows:
MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
This Memorandum of Agreement
is entered into this 22nd day of May,
1998 by and between the City of
Cleveland, Ohio, by and through its
Mayor and subject to the approval
of the City Council, and Norfolk
Southern Corporation and Norfolk
Southern
Railway
Company,
by
their undersigned Chairman/President/Chief Executive Officer.

The City Record
Whereas, Norfolk Southern Corporation and Norfolk Southern Railway Company (collectively, “NS”)
are among the Applicants in the
railroad control proceeding currently pending before the United States
Surface Transportation Board (the
“STB”) under Finance Docket No.
33388 (the “Conrail Application”), in
which NS and CSX Corporation and
CSX Transportation, Inc. (collectively, “CSX”) are seeking authority to
jointly acquire Conrail, Inc. and
Consolidated Rail Corporation (collectively, “Conrail”) and to thereafter separately operate parts of the
rail lines, facilities and other assets
of Conrail; and
Whereas, NS submitted to the STB
an Operating Plan and Environmental Report as part of the Conrail
Application,
which
submissions
describe certain changes in rail traffic and operations that are projected to result from the Conrail Transaction (the “Transaction”); and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
Ohio (“Cleveland” or the “City”) has
participated as a party in the proceedings at the STB regarding the
Conrail Application and has in filings and comments submitted to the
STB requested that the STB order
NS and CSX to take certain actions
to avoid what the City has described
as significant adverse environmental impacts of the Transaction upon
the City and its residents, or alternatively, that the STB condition any
approval of the Conrail Application
on the imposition of various conditions designed to mitigate such
impacts; and
Whereas, the STB’s Section of
Environmental
Analysis
(“SEA”)
issued
a
Draft
Environmental
Impact Statement (“DEIS”) with
respect to the Conrail Application in
December 1997 which included a
characterization of the City as a
community with “unique circumstances” and directed NS to consult
with government agencies, elected
officials and interested parties in
Cleveland regarding certain projected train traffic increases on certain
lines to be operated by NS postTransaction in Cleveland; and
Whereas, NS and the City have
engaged in such consultations with
the goal of reaching agreement on
mitigation measures to ameliorate
the adverse environmental impacts
in
Cleveland
of
the
projected
changes in rail traffic and operations on rail lines and facilities to
be operated by NS post-Transaction
resulting from the Transaction; and
Whereas, the City recognizes the
concerns of its neighboring communities,
particularly
the
City
of
Berea, Ohio, regarding potential
adverse impacts of the Transaction,
and has sought to reach an agreement with NS that does not harm the
interests of those communities while
preserving the right and ability of
those communities to pursue their
own agreements to protect the interests of residents and businesses
located therein; and
Whereas, NS and the City have
reached agreement on such mitigation measures and have made certain other commitments to each
other
as
described
hereinafter,
including but not limited to certain
commitments by NS to make certain
changes to its Operating Plan, certain capital investments and certain
financial contributions for mitigation of Transaction impacts and for
the benefit of the City; and
Whereas, the Mayor has agreed to
recommend to the Council of the

1020

June 17, 1998
City of Cleveland that it approve
this Agreement and authorize the
Mayor and the appropriate Directors
of the City to take such further
actions as are necessary to effectuate the terms hereof;
NOW THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY STIPULATED AND AGREED
AS FOLLOWS:
I. Modifications to Operating Plan.
In consideration of the concerns of
Cleveland and other communities in
the Greater Cleveland area about
increases in train frequencies projected for certain of the lines that
NS will operate following approval
by the Surface Transportation Board
of
the
Conrail
Application,
NS
agrees to modify its original Operating Plan. The modifications to the
Operating
Plan
are
summarized
herein and are described more fully
in NS’ Mitigation Proposal for Train
Frequencies in Greater Cleveland
and Vicinity, which was submitted
to the STB on April 16, 1998 (hereinafter, the “Mitigation Proposal”).
A. Cloggsville Connection Construction: NS agrees to construct
what is termed the “Cloggsville Connection,” which construction is comprised
of
two
main
elements:
upgrading the rail lines and facilities between the NS Nickel Plate
line at Cloggsville and the Conrail
Lakefront line at CP-190 to doubletrack main line standards through
changes
and
improvements
to
tracks, bridges, connections, signals
and other appurtenant rail facilities,
as described more fully in the Mitigation
Proposal;
and
building
approximately 7,950 feet of new rail
line to connect two parallel rail
lines that are approximately 2,100
feet apart, thereby creating a double connection at Vermilion between
NS’ Nickel Plate line and the Conrail Chicago line to be operated by
NS post-Transaction, instead of the
single connection described in NS’
original
Operating
Plan,
as
described more fully in the Mitigation Proposal.
1. Funding: The cost of the construction and improvements to the
rail lines and facilities between
Cloggsville and CP-190 is currently
estimated at $24,350,000. The cost of
constructing a double connection at
Vermilion is currently estimated at
$3,000,000 more than constructing
the single connection originally proposed in the Operating Plan. NS
hereby commits to fund up to the
full cost of these Cloggsville Connection
projects.
(NS
previously
committed in its Operating Plan to
spend the approximately $2,587,000
needed to construct a single connection at Vermilion.) NS’ commitment to fund up to the full cost of
these projects is not limited to the
current cost estimates contained
herein.
2. Schedule: NS estimates that construction of the double connection at
Vermilion will take three to five
months to complete, and that construction of the improvements to the
rail lines and facilities between
Cloggsville and CP-190 will take 18
to 24 months to complete, and NS
hereby agrees to use its best efforts
to complete these construction projects within these time frames. NS
will commence implementation of
both elements of the Cloggsville
Connection projects within ten days
of the date on which the approval
by the STB of the Conrail Application has become effective, and NS
will
advance
completion
thereof
with reasonable expedition in view

June 17, 1998
of operating, engineering and other
construction-related constraints, and
any need to obtain additional governmental approvals.
3. Government Approvals. NS commitment to construct the Cloggsville
Connection project and to do so in
accordance
with
the
schedule
detailed above is subject to the
acquisition of any necessary federal,
state and local regulatory, governmental, environmental and other permits, approvals and authorizations
for the projects specified herein,
including but not limited to any necessary
and
applicable
STB
approvals. NS shall make all necessary
efforts to obtain such approvals
within a time frame that will permit
completion of the projects within the
estimated time frames described in
Section I. A. 2. hereof.
4. Removal/Relocation of Utility
Facilities. If the Cloggsville Connection construction requires the
removal and/or relocation of any
electric utility poles or facilities, the
allocation of cost of such removal
and/or relocation shall be determined in accordance with existing
easements, licenses and other agreements applicable to such utility
poles or facilities; and NS specifically agrees that no order of the
STB approving the Conrail Application or any part thereof shall be
interpreted to preempt the application of the terms of any such existing easements, licenses or other
agreements to any such removal or
relocation. NS will cooperate with
the applicable utility company to
minimize or avoid interruption of
service to utility customers.
B. Rerouting of Trains from Nickel
Plate to Conrail Lines: NS agrees to
further modify its Operating Plan as
follows. Within twenty (20) days
after completion of construction of
the double connection at Vermilion,
NS will reroute approximately 10.6
trains per day from a Rochester, PA
— Youngstown, OH — Ashtabula,
OH — Cleveland (Cloggsville) —
Vermilion routing through Cleveland
via the NS Nickel Plate line (as provided in the original Operating
Plan),
to
a
Rochester,
PA
—
Alliance, OH — White, OH — Cleveland (CP 181) — Berea, OH — Vermilion routing through Cleveland
via Conrail lines to be operated by
NS
post-Transaction.
Once
this
rerouting is accomplished, NS projects that average daily freight train
traffic on the Nickel Plate line will
be approximately 26.0 trains between
Ashtabula
and
Cleveland
(Cloggsville)
and
approximately
23.5
trains
between
Cleveland
(Cloggsville) and Vermilion.
C. Rerouting of Trains from Nickel Plate to Cloggsville Connection
Route: NS agrees to further modify
its Operating Plan as follows. Within twenty (20) days after completion
of the construction and improvements to the lines and facilities
between Cloggsville and CP-190, NS
will reroute approximately 9.6 trains
per day from a Cleveland (Cloggsville) to Vermilion routing via the
NS Nickel Plate line (as provided in
the original Operating Plan) to the
Cleveland (Cloggsville) — CP-190 —
Berea — Vermilion routing created
by virtue of the aforesaid construction and improvements. Once this
rerouting is accomplished, NS projects that average daily freight
train traffic on the following line
segments will be: Cleveland (Cloggsville) to CP-190 — 13.8; CP-190 to
Berea — 63.1; Berea to Vermilion —
55.1.

The City Record
D. Revisions to Traffic Projections: Table 1, attached hereto, contains the average daily freight train
traffic projections from NS’ original
Operating Plan for the lines to be
operated by NS in Cleveland and the
Greater Cleveland area post-Transaction. NS agrees to modify its Operating Plan by substituting the average daily freight train traffic projections
contained
in
Table
2,
attached hereto, for these lines. Once
the rerouting associated with completion of the full Cloggsville Connection is accomplished, the projections contained in Table 2 hereto
will be in effect, including the following projections of average daily
freight train traffic: 26.0 trains on
the
Nickel
Plate
line
between
Ashtabula
and
Cleveland
(Cloggsville); 13.9 trains on the Nickel
Plate line between Cleveland (Cloggsville) and Vermilion; 40.3 trains on
the Pittsburgh line (currently operated by Conrail) between White, OH
and Cleveland (CP-181); 53.5 trains
on the Lakefront line (currently
operated by Conrail) between CP-181
and CP-190, 13.8 trains on the “Cloggsville Connection” line between
Cleveland (Cloggsville) and CP-190;
and 63.1 trains on the Lakefront line
between CP-190 and Berea, OH.
II. Grade Separation Projects. Subject to the approval of the projects
by the appropriate state authorities
and the availability and commitment of funding from federal, state
and other public sources necessary
to complete the projects, NS agrees
to contribute up to $1,500,000 in the
aggregate toward two grade separation projects, one at Dille Road
and one at London Road. The total
cost of the Dille Road and London
Road grade separation projects is
estimated to be $13,500,000. It is
expected that amounts exceeding
NS’ contribution will come from public sources, including but not limited to funds provided by the federal
government and/or the Ohio Rail
Development Commission. NS shall
pay its portion of the cost of each
of these projects in accordance with
such schedule(s) as may be established by the appropriate government agency or agencies with jurisdiction over the projects.
III. Community Impacts Fund. In
consideration of Cleveland’s concerns about adverse environmental
impacts from the Transaction, and
in order to assist Cleveland with
mitigation thereof, NS will provide
a total amount of $10,000,000 (ten
million dollars) to Cleveland over a
period of five years for a Community Impacts Fund (“CIF”) to be
established by the City.
A. Schedule of NS Payments. NS
will make payments to Cleveland to
fund the CIF as follows: An initial
payment of $2,000,000 (two million
dollars) will be made no later than
30 days after the date on which the
STB’s approval of the Transaction
has become effective; the balance of
$8,000,000 (eight million dollars)
will be paid in four equal annual
installments, each installment of
$2,000,000 (two million dollars) to be
paid no later than 12 months after
the prior payment.
B. Purpose and Use of CIF. Cleveland will utilize the CIF at its sole
discretion for mitigation projects
designed to mitigate what the City
deems to be adverse environmental
impacts resulting from the Transaction and associated with the rail
lines and facilities that will be oper-

ated in Cleveland by NS post-Transaction. Such impacts may include,
but are not limited to, those in the
areas of noise and vibration, emergency response and vehicular delay,
hazardous materials transport and
response, pedestrian and vehicular
safety, grade crossing maintenance,
and cultural preservation. CIF funds
may be used for purposes determined by the City to be related to
protection of the City’s neighborhoods from the adverse impacts of
the Transaction, which may include
but are not limited to projects
designed to mitigate some or all of
these impacts, including but not limited to noise mitigation projects,
hazardous materials training and
equipment, grade crossing maintenance projects, home value guarantees, fencing projects adjacent to
parks and other pedestrian safety
projects,
landscaping,
a
maintenance endowment fund and other
projects that, in the sole discretion
of the City, are reasonably related
to the impacts of the Transaction
and are associated with the lines
and facilities to be operated by NS
post-Transaction. It is also understood that the City may expend up
to $250,000 of CIF monies as “seed
money” for the furtherance of proposals to preserve and enhance the
Mill Creek Waterfall and to better
incorporate the Mill Creek Waterfall
into the Cleveland Metroparks in the
event and to the extent that the City
determines
that
such
proposals
merit such expenditures.
C. Establishment and Administration of CIF. The CIF shall be established and administered solely by
the City or its duly appointed
designee(s). NS agrees to participate as a consultant to the City
and/or its designee(s) with respect
to CIF matters affecting or relating
to NS operations or property. Cleveland shall have sole responsibility
for selecting, managing and maintaining
CIF
mitigation
projects,
except as stated hereinafter.
D.
Construction/Installation
of
Noise
Mitigation
Structures
and
Landscaping. The City may, in its
discretion, utilize CIF funds for
noise walls, noise barriers and/or
other
structures,
improvements,
equipment
or
appurtenances
designed to mitigate noise (hereinafter, collectively, “noise mitigation structures”) as well as for landscaping designed to mitigate noise
or visual impacts (hereinafter “landscaping”). To the extent that any
such projects are to be constructed
or installed on NS’ right of way or
other NS property, the City shall be
required to consult with NS and to
obtain NS’ concurrence with respect
to the design, schedule for construction and/or installation, and, to
the extent permitted by law, the
identity of individuals or entities
performing the construction and/or
installation. NS agrees not to unreasonably withhold such concurrence.
The City understands that all noise
mitigation structures or landscaping
constructed and/or installed on NS’
right of way and/or property must
be in compliance with any applicable federal law or regulations governing railroads, including but not
limited to the regulations of the
Federal
Railroad
Administration,
and must conform with any applicable engineering and other standards of NS. NS shall grant the City
such easements or licenses as may
be necessary for construction and/or
installation of such noise mitigation
structures and landscaping.

66
E. Ownership and Maintenance of
Noise
Mitigation
Structures
and
Landscaping.
1. Any noise mitigation structures constructed or installed on NS
right of way or NS property by the
City shall become the property of
NS, subject to the following agreements regarding maintenance of
such noise mitigation structures.
NS shall be solely responsible for
maintaining the structural integrity of such noise mitigation structures in accordance with applicable
law and regulations, including all
necessary preventive maintenance,
ongoing maintenance and repairs;
provided, however, that the City
shall bear responsibility for keeping the walls free from graffiti or
other visual defacement of such
structures.
2. Any landscaping constructed or
installed on NS right of way or NS
property by the City shall be owned
by the City, and the City shall have
sole responsibility for the maintenance of such landscaping. NS shall
grant the City such rights of access
as may be necessary for the City to
perform such maintenance of the
landscaping.
F. Maintenance Endowment Fund.
As stated in subsection B of this section, CIF funds may be used for,
among other things, a Maintenance
Endowment
Fund.
Such
Maintenance Endowment Fund would be
used for maintenance of landscaping constructed or installed by the
City pursuant to subsections D and
E of this Section and for other maintenance projects related to or associated with impacts from the rail
lines and facilities to be operated by
NS post-Transaction which impacts
are not ordinarily the responsibility
of the railroad under applicable
laws and regulations. The parties
agree that prior to the expiration of
a period of five years from the date
on which the STB’s approval of the
Transaction has become effective,
NS and the City will engage in discussions regarding the question of
whether the Maintenance Endowment Fund should be continued
beyond the five-year period of the
CIF and, if so, for what period of
time and with what level of additional NS commitment of funds. It is
understood that NS’ agreement to
participate
in
such
discussions
regarding the Maintenance Endowment Fund does not commit NS to
entering into an agreement with the
City at that time regarding continuation of the Maintenance Endowment Fund. It is also understood
that the establishment of the Maintenance Endowment Fund does not
alter NS’ maintenance obligations
under applicable laws, regulations
or agreements, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement.
G. Liability. In providing funds to
the CIF, NS does not in any way
acknowledge that the mitigation
projects to be implemented through
the CIF are required as a matter of
law. Nor does NS acknowledge or
warrant that the projects to be
implemented through the CIF will
necessarily achieve any mitigation
or any particular level or degree of
mitigation of the adverse impacts
they are intended to remedy. To the
extent permitted by law, Cleveland
agrees to bear full legal responsibility for any and all damages,
claims or injury arising out of the
administration of the CIF by the

The City Record
City, the selection, construction and
installation of projects undertaken
with CIF funds by the City, the
maintenance of any landscaping
constructed or installed by the City
pursuant to subsections D and E of
this section, and the maintenance of
other projects undertaken with CIF
funds by the City where such other
projects are not constructed on NS
property. NS agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless the City against
any and all damages, claims or
injury arising out of the maintenance of noise mitigation structures
by NS pursuant to subsection E of
this
section.
Further,
Cleveland
agrees to include in any contract
related to the CIF for projects
undertaken with CIF funds which
requires the contractor to enter onto
any property owned by NS a requirement that the contractor indemnify
and hold harmless NS against any
claims related to the construction,
installation or maintenance of such
projects.
IV. Modification of Commitments
in the Event of Operating Changes.
Given the fluctuating nature of rail
freight traffic over time, and the
possibility that a change in circumstances could have a significant
effect on the assumptions and projections of the NS Operating Plan,
the parties recognize that deviations
from the projected average train frequencies set forth in NS’ Operating
Plan as revised by Table 2 hereto
may be necessary. To preserve NS’
operating flexibility while affording
a mechanism for addressing certain
future impacts of any substantial
increases in NS train traffic over the
projections contained in Table 2, the
parties agree as follows:
A. Nickel Plate Line Noise Mitigation. Except as provided hereinafter, if during the eight-year period beginning on the date on which
construction of the Cloggsville Connection has been fully completed,
there is any period of twelve consecutive months in which the average daily number of trains on the
Nickel Plate line between Cloggsville and Vermilion equals or
exceeds 26 trains per day on an
annualized basis, NS shall contribute $2,600,000 in additional funds
to the CIF for noise mitigation projects along this rail segment. Such
payment shall be made within 90
days after the end of such twelvemonth period. The provisions of this
subsection shall not apply to train
movements prior to the date on
which construction of the Cloggsville Connection has been fully
completed, and none of the twelvemonth periods of traffic increases
referred to in this subsection shall
include any period prior to such
Cloggsville Connection project completion date.
B. W. 117th Street Grade Crossing
Mitigation. If during the five-year
period beginning on the date on
which construction of the Cloggsville Connection has been fully
completed, there is any period of
twelve consecutive months in which
the average daily number of trains
on the Nickel Plate line between
Cloggsville and Vermilion equals or
exceeds 19 trains per day on an
annualized basis, NS shall work
cooperatively
with
Cleveland
in
seeking the support of and funding
from the applicable state authorities
for a grade separation project for

1022

June 17, 1998
the W. 117th Street grade crossing,
and NS shall contribute up to 10 percent of the cost of funding such project. NS shall pay its portion of the
cost of such project in accordance
with such schedule as may be established by the appropriate government agency or agencies with jurisdiction over the project.
C. Aetna and Bessemer Streets
Grade Crossing Mitigation. If during
the five-year period beginning on
the date on which construction of
the Vermilion double connection has
been fully completed, there is any
period of twelve consecutive months
in which the average daily number
of trains on the existing Conrail line
to be operated by NS post-Transaction between White, OH and Cleveland (CP-181) equals or exceeds 45
trains per day on an annualized
basis, NS shall: (1) work cooperatively with Cleveland in seeking the
support of and funding from the
applicable
state
authorities
for
grade separation projects for the
Aetna Street and Bessemer Street
grade crossings, and NS shall contribute up to 10 percent of the cost
of funding such project and NS shall
pay its portion of the cost of such
project in accordance with such
schedule as may be established by
the appropriate government agency
or agencies with jurisdiction over
the project; and (2) in the event that
it is not advisable or possible to construct a grade separation at Aetna
Street and Bessemer Street, or at
either of them, NS will cooperate
with the City on developing an
alternative capital improvement or
improvements, to be negotiated by
NS
and
the
City,
designed
to
improve access to emergency and
other public safety responders for
the neighborhoods surrounding such
grade crossing(s), with NS’ funding
commitment
for
such
capital
improvement(s) to be up to 10 percent of the cost of a grade separation at such grade crossing(s) but
not to exceed the total cost of such
capital improvement(s).
D. Mitigation for Capacity Increases. Except as provided hereinafter,
if during the ten-year period beginning on the date on which the STB’s
approval of the Transaction has
become effective, NS decides to
increase capacity through the construction of an additional main rail
line in Cleveland or of a rail siding
in excess of three miles in length in
Cleveland, NS agrees to provide
prior notice of such project(s) to the
City and to enter into good faith discussions with the City regarding the
question of whether there are any
significant environmental impacts
resulting from such project(s) and
regarding the possible mitigation of
any such impacts. As used herein,
the terms “construction of an additional main rail line” and “construction . . . of a rail siding in excess
of three miles in length” do not
include the construction of industrial tracks or spurs, nor do they
include
other
rehabilitation,
improvement or upgrading of any
existing track or the signals or
structures appurtenant thereto, nor
do they include the addition of any
main line track by or on behalf of
any other railroad on the right of
way of NS unless NS has the ability to use such main line track. It is
understood that NS’ agreement to
participate in good faith discussions
regarding the environmental im-

June 17, 1998
pacts of and possible mitigation of
such impacts of those projects contemplated by this subsection of the
Agreement, does not constitute an
acknowledgement that such projects
will have significant environmental
impacts or commit NS to entering
into an agreement with the City at
that time regarding mitigation of
such impacts. It is further agreed
and understood that the provisions
of this subsection shall not apply to
the capacity increases to be constructed as part of the Cloggsville
Connection project.
E. NS Reports to Cleveland.
1. In furtherance of this Section
IV, NS agrees to provide the City on
a monthly basis with an accurate
written report on the average daily
number of freight trains that operated over each NS line in the City.
Each such report shall be provided
to the City by NS within 30 days of
the end of the applicable month,
and shall be contemporaneously
submitted by NS to the STB. NS
shall provide such monthly reports
for a period of ten years from the
date on which the STB’s approval
of the Transaction has become
effective.
2. In furtherance of this Section
IV, NS also agrees to notify the City
in writing of the date on which construction of the Vermilion double
connection has been fully completed and the date on which construction of the remainder of the Cloggsville Connection project has been
fully completed, with each such
written notification to be provided
within 15 days of each such completion date.
3. In furtherance of this Section
IV, NS also agrees to provide timely advance written notification to
the City of any planned capacity
increases to which the terms of subsection D hereof would apply.
V. Agreements Regarding Berea
Interlocking and Other Train Frequency Issues.
The City desires to reduce the frequency of train operations through
residential neighborhoods and to
minimize the adverse environmental
impacts of the Transaction on the
City of Cleveland and the surrounding communities, including but not
limited to the City of Berea. NS
believes that the integrity of its
Operating Plan for train operations
in and around Cleveland would be
compromised if too many trains had
to be crossed at the Berea interlocking between the Lakefront line
to be operated by NS post-Transaction and the Short line to be operated by CSX post-Transaction. NS
has
determined
after
extensive
study that a maximum of 15 trains
per day can be crossed at the Berea
interlocking without causing undue
congestion or unduly disrupting NS
operations; and the City acknowledges and accepts the validity of
this determination by NS. NS agrees
that as many as 15 CSX trains can
and will be accommodated to operate via trackage rights on the Lakefront line to be operated by NS postTransaction for as long as NS controls operations on said Lakefront
line.
VI. Community/Railroad Committee. The parties hereby acknowledge their intent to continue the
working relationship that has developed between them and to work

The City Record
together to strengthen that relationship over time as long as NS conducts operations in the City. NS and
the City agree to jointly establish a
Community/Railroad
Committee
(the
“Committee”)
comprised
of
twelve (12) persons: Three members
appointed by NS, three members
appointed by the Mayor, three members appointed by the City Council
President, and three members of the
community appointed by the Mayor.
The purpose of the Committee shall
be to provide a forum for ongoing
discussion and dialogue between NS
and the City regarding issues of
mutual
concern.
The
Committee
shall meet quarterly, beginning in
the first quarter after the effective
date of the STB’s approval of the
Conrail Application, and continuing
thereafter according to a schedule
established by the Committee itself.
Issues to be discussed by the Committee may include, but are not limited to, matters discussed in this
Section VI, as well as consideration
of citizen complaints relating to NS’
operations, potential joint economic
and job training initiatives, and
general monitoring of the mutual
obligations set forth in this Agreement. The Committee will prioritize
these issues, and will develop for
each issue an appropriate process
and time schedule. It is understood
that with respect to each of the
issues of concern identified in this
Section VI, the parties’ agreement to
discuss the issue at the Committee
does not commit either NS or the
City to enter into any agreements
regarding the issue following such
discussions, but the City and NS
agree to make efforts to resolve
issues brought to the Committee.
A. Asset Management. In consideration of concerns expressed by the
City
regarding
ongoing
maintenance, condition and appearance of
existing NS railroad facilities in
Cleveland and of railroad facilities
to be operated by NS in Cleveland
post-Transaction, including railroad
bridges, rights of way and rail
yards, NS agrees that within twelve
months of the date on which the
STB’s approval of the Transaction
shall have become effective, NS and
the City shall conduct joint inspections of such facilities and NS shall,
upon completion of such twelve
month period, submit to the City an
asset management plan for its rail
facilities in Cleveland. The scope
and content of such asset management plan shall be determined by
discussions between NS and the City
at the Committee. NS also agrees
that within 180 days after the date
on which the STB’s approval of the
Transaction
shall
have
become
effective, NS will provide the City
with an inventory of all NS bridges,
rights of way, rail yards and railroad operating properties located in
Cleveland. NS agrees to maintain
the
structural
integrity
of
its
bridges in Cleveland and to maintain its rail facilities in Cleveland
in accordance with all applicable
laws,
regulations
and
existing
agreements to which NS is a party
or for which NS is or will be legally responsible. NS agrees to complete any unfinished components of
the program of railroad bridge
painting/repair agreed to by Conrail
and the City in 1993 with respect to
those Conrail bridges on the lines to
be operated by NS post-Transaction.
The parties agree that they will

1023

67
attempt to resolve any disputes or
issues with regard to asset management through discussions at the
Committee.
B. Surplus Properties. NS agrees to
provide the City with an inventory
of all surplus real properties in
Cleveland owned or controlled by NS
post-Transaction. Such an inventory
shall be provided within 90 days of
the
date
on
which
the
STB’s
approval of the Transaction shall
have become effective. NS agrees to
discuss with the City’s Economic
Development Director and the Committee possible dispositions of such
surplus real property, including but
not limited to possible dispositions
that would result in the use of such
property for City-supported economic or community development. For
purposes of this Agreement, the
term “surplus real properties” means
those properties located in the City
that, as of the effective date of the
Transaction, are owned or controlled
by NS and are either not then in use
by NS in connection with its rail
operations or are not believed by NS
to have the potential to be used in
the future in connection with its rail
operations.
C. Billboards. NS will provide the
City with an inventory of all billboard leases for billboards on NS’
post-Transaction
rights
of
way,
bridges and other property in Cleveland, within 90 days of the date on
which the STB’s decision approving
the Transaction shall have become
effective. Such inventory shall indicate, to the extent that the information is available to NS, the locations of the billboards covered by
the leases and the terms of such
leases. Where such information is
not available to NS, NS shall provide
the City with pertinent information
about the lease or prior parties in
interest to the lease that is reasonably available to NS. NS agrees not
to enter into any lease that would
have the effect of adding a billboard
to a location where there is no billboard or increasing the number of
billboards at a location where there
is already one or more billboards, as
of the effective date of the Transaction. NS further agrees to take the
following actions to eliminate the
advertising of tobacco and alcohol
products on the billboards on its
property in Cleveland: (1) If a current billboard lease permits NS to do
so, NS will instruct the lessee that
the billboard cannot be used for
such advertisements; (2) when each
current billboard lease term expires,
NS will incorporate a prohibition on
tobacco and alcohol advertisements
into the terms of any renewal or
replacement lease; and (3) if any
billboard
lease
shall
not
have
expired by the end of five years
from the date on which the STB’s
decision approving the Transaction
shall have become effective, NS
shall otherwise take all legal and
practicable steps to eliminate tobacco and alcohol advertisements from
any billboard covered by such lease.
NS also agrees to ongoing discussions with the City at the Committee regarding the City’s desire to
eliminate all billboards from railroad property.
D. Capacity Increases. If during
the ten-year period beginning ten
years after the date on which the
STB’s approval of the Transaction
has become effective, NS decides to
increase capacity through the con-

68
struction in Cleveland of an additional main rail line or of a rail siding in excess of three miles in
length (as such terms are defined
in Section IV. D. hereof), NS will
provide
timely
written
advance
notice to the Community/Railroad
Committee, and NS agrees to enter
into good faith discussions with the
Committee regarding the question
of whether there are any significant environmental impacts resulting
from
such
project(s)
and
regarding the possible mitigation
of any such impacts. Prior to the
expiration of the ten-year period
beginning ten years after the date
on which the STB’s approval of the
Transaction has become effective,
NS agrees to discuss with the Committee the question of whether
there should be any continuation of
NS’ commitment to discuss such
capacity increases with the Committee.
E. Lakefront Track Realignment.
NS agrees to discuss with the City
at the Committee the issue of
potentially
realigning
railroad
tracks along a portion of the Lakefront so as to consolidate NS and
CSX tracks into a single rail corridor there.
F. Mill Creek Waterfall. NS agrees
to discuss with the City at the Committee questions with respect to proposals to preserve and enhance the
Mill Creek Waterfall and to better
incorporate the Mill Creek Waterfall
into the Cleveland Metroparks.
G. Business Development. The par ties agree to enter into discussions
with the City’s Economic Development Director and the Committee
with the goal of developing an intermodal
business
development
alliance between NS and Cleveland.
The parties may also discuss business development along the NS
rights of way.
H. Old River Channel. The parties
agree to discuss at the Committee
proposals for development of the Old
River Channel and the pedestrian
tunnels on the Lakefront line.
I. [Intentionally omitted.]
J. Permitting Generally. The City
agrees to discuss with NS at the
Committee any issues, concerns or
problems that NS is or may experience in obtaining permits or other
types of approvals from City or
other local governmental organizations for any of NS’ business operations and activities in Cleveland for
which such permits or approvals are
required.
K. Other Topics. Other topics of
discussion at the Committee may
include, but are not limited to, the
following: the I-480/I-71 Junction
and Rockport Yard improvements;
the Cloggsville construction and
improvements; redevelopment of the
southeast quadrant of East 93rd and
Quincy; issues relating to the Flats
Industrial
Railroad;
the
East
9th/Ontario Intermodal Yard; public
transit; and issues relating to hazmat.
VII. Other Understandings and
Undertakings.
A. NS acknowledges that it is
bound by any system-wide mitigation measures mandated by the STB
for hazardous materials transport
and intends to apply NS’ own system-wide
program
for
the
safe
transportation of hazardous materials (as further described in Attachment A hereto) to the lines and

The City Record
facilities it will operate in Cleveland post-Transaction. In addition
to the program described in Attachment A, NS agrees to provide the
City with four OREIS (Operation
Respond) software packages, to
install such software for the City
and to train the City’s personnel in
the use of such software; to provide,
upon request, periodic training in
railroad/hazmat issues, including
classroom, tabletop and full-scale
drills; to provide the City with
annual reports of the number of car
loads of hazardous materials that
have
moved
through
the
City
(including a breakdown by four (4)
digit STCC code of the types of
materials transported); and to coordinate with the City’s personnel or
authorized agents the latter’s periodic access to NS yards, lines and
facilities for the purpose of hazardous materials incident preparedness and planning. It is expressly
understood that nothing in this
Agreement would absolve NS of its
legal, regulatory or business responsibilities associated with hazmat
transportation or incidents in Cleveland.
B. With respect to the Cloggsville Connection projects, Cleveland agrees to cooperate with NS,
if such cooperation is requested, in
obtaining any applicable City or
local
governmental
permits
or
approvals for the projects, and
agrees to use its good offices to
assist in resolving any issues that
may arise with respect to these
projects between NS and any utility companies or other interested
third parties.
C. Cleveland agrees that through
NS’ consultations with the officials
and elected representatives of the
City of Cleveland, which consultations
have
culminated
in
this
Agreement, NS has complied with
the directives in the DEIS regarding
consultations with the City of Cleveland with respect to potentially significant impacts resulting from the
Transaction.
D. The City agrees not to seek at
the STB, in any court, or in any
other forum, any conditions or mitigation with respect to NS in connection with the STB’s approval of
the Conrail Application that would
be contrary to or otherwise inconsistent with this Agreement, the
terms hereof or the acknowledgements made herein. NS agrees not
to seek at the STB, in any court, or
in any other forum, any conditions
or mitigation in connection with
the STB’s approval of the Conrail
Application that would be contrary
to or otherwise inconsistent with
this Agreement, the terms hereof or
the acknowledgements made herein.
E. NS and the City agree that neither of them will enter into any
agreement with any other individual or entity, seek any decision or
order of the STB or of any court, or
take any other actions that would
be contrary to or would otherwise
be inconsistent with this Agreement, the terms
hereof or the
acknowledgements
made
herein;
provided, however, that nothing in
this subsection E shall prevent the
City from protecting its rights or
pursuing
all
available
remedies
with respect to CSX in connection
with the Conrail Application as
long as the City does not seek the
imposition of a remedy that is con-

1024

June 17, 1998
trary to or otherwise inconsistent
with this Agreement, the terms
hereof, or the acknowledgements
made herein.
F. Notwithstanding
any
other
terms
of
this
Agreement,
this
Agreement shall not constrain the
City
from
pursuing
efforts
to
obtain reductions in the numbers of
trains projected to be operated by
CSX post-Transaction on the Short
line,
through
negotiations
with
CSX and/or requests for conditions
at the STB. Notwithstanding any
other terms of this Agreement, this
Agreement shall not constrain the
City
from
pursuing
efforts
to
obtain
other
mitigation
with
respect to CSX, through negotiations with CSX and/or requests for
conditions at the STB, provided
that
such
mitigation
does
not
relate to NS.
G. The parties agree that as long
as the City shall have complied with
the terms of this Agreement, including particularly the terms of subsections D and E of this Section, the
imposition by the STB of conditions
on the Transaction that would have
the effect of requiring more than 15
trains per day to cross at the Berea
interlocking shall not itself void
this Agreement pursuant to Section
X. A. hereof.
H. The parties acknowledge and
agree that NS’ commitment to build
the Cloggsville Connection and NS’
commitment to accommodate as
many as 15 CSX trains per day on
the Lakefront line to be operated
by NS post-Transaction are unique
commitments that are essential to
the purpose of this Agreement.
Accordingly, in the event that NS
notifies the City or the City otherwise determines that NS has not or
cannot fulfill either of these commitments (or both of them), the
parties agree that: (a) if such notification or determination occurs
during the term of any STB oversight proceeding with respect to
the Transaction, the City shall
have the right to petition the STB
for an order compelling specific
performance by NS of such commitment(s); and (b) if such notification
or
determination
occurs
after the term of any STB oversight proceeding with respect to
the Transaction, NS shall consent
to the reopening of the Conrail
Application by the STB for the purpose of the STB considering a petition by the City for an order compelling specific performance by NS
of such commitment(s); and (c) in
either event, if the STB determines
that specific performance of such
commitment(s)
shall
not
be
ordered, the parties agree that the
STB’s
approval
of
the
Conrail
Application shall be reopened for
the limited purpose of reconsideration of the adverse environmental
impacts of the Transaction upon
the City and of the conditions
imposed by the STB for mitigation
of
such
adverse
environmental
impacts. The parties’ agreement to
this subsection H does not constitute a waiver by either party of
any other remedies that may be
available to it with respect to the
rights and obligations set forth in
this Agreement.
VIII. Submission to City Council.
Upon execution of this Agreement,
the City’s Mayor and appropriate
Director(s) shall immediately take

June 17, 1998
all actions necessary to place this
Agreement before the Council of the
City of Cleveland for its earliest
consideration. The Mayor and such
Director(s) shall recommend to the
City Council that it approve this
Agreement, and shall take all other
necessary and appropriate actions to
ensure the most expeditious consideration of the Agreement by the
City Council.
IX. STB Notification. Promptly
upon execution of this Agreement
and its approval by the City Council:
A. NS and Cleveland will notify
the STB in writing that they have
entered into this Agreement and
will advise the STB of the terms of
this Agreement. NS and Cleveland
will further request at that time
that the STB adopt the terms of this
Agreement as a condition of the
STB’s approval of the Conrail Application; and
B. The City will advise the STB
in writing that, in consideration of
this Agreement, it is withdrawing
its opposition to, and its request for
conditions upon, so much of the Conrail Application as relates to NS’
acquisition of control of Conrail and
NS’ proposed post-Transaction rail
operations.
X. Conditions. The commitments
set forth above are conditioned on:
A. The STB’s approval of the Conrail Application, provided that such
approval (1) adopts the terms of
this Agreement as a condition of
such approval, and (2) includes the
STB’s approval of NS’ Operating
Plan, as modified by the NS Mitigation Proposal and the commitments
made herein; and
B. The acceptance by NS of any
other conditions imposed by the STB
upon the approval of the Conrail
Application; and
C. The approval of the Conrail
Application by the STB having
become effective.
IN
WITNESS
WHEREOF,
the
undersigned have duly executed this
Agreement, all as of the day and
year first above written.
