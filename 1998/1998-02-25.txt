FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES REFERRED
Ord. No. 286-98.
By
Councilman
Johnson
(by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing and directing the purchase by
requirement contract of lumber, for
the various divisions of City government, for a period not to exceed
two years.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Finance is hereby authorized and
directed to make a written requirement contract in accordance with
the Charter and the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, for
the requirements for the period of
two (2) years for the necessary
items of lumber in the approximate
amount as purchased during the preceding term, to be purchased by the
Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies upon a unit basis for the various divisions of the Department of
Finance. Bids shall be taken in such
manner as to permit an award to be
made for all items as a single contract, or by separate contract for
each or any combination of said
items as the Board of Control shall
determine. Alternate bids for a period less than two (2) years may be
taken if deemed desirable by the
Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies until provision is made for the
requirements for the entire term.
Section 2. The cost of said contract shall be charged against the
proper appropriation account and
the Director of Finance shall certify thereon the amount of the initial
purchase thereunder, which purchase, together with all subsequent
purchases, shall be made on order of
the Commissioner of Purchases and
Supplies pursuant to a requisition
against such contract duly certified
by the Director of Finance. (RL
22988)

Section 3. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Ord. No. 287-98.
By
Councilman
Johnson
(by
departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing and directing the Director of

Municipal Court, to enter into contract with the Legal Aid Society of
Cleveland for legal services necessary to defend indigents charged
with violation of ordinances of the
City of Cleveland, provided such violation may result in incarceration,
for the Cleveland Municipal Court.
Whereas, in Argersinger v. Hamlin and Scott v. Illinois, the United
States Supreme Court held that no
indigent criminal defendant may be
sentenced to a term of imprisonment
unless he has been afforded the
right to assistance of appointed
counsel in his defense; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
through the Cleveland Municipal
Court, is therefore obligated to provide an indigent defendant appointed counsel in order to permit the
imposition of a sentence including a
term of imprisonment; and
Whereas, it is the recommendation
of the Cleveland Municipal Court,
the district of which encompasses
Bratenahl and the City of Cleveland,
that such indigent defense should be
provided by the Legal Aid Society of
Cleveland; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Finance, for the Cleveland Municipal Court, is hereby authorized and
directed to enter into contract with
the Legal Aid Society of Cleveland
for
legal
services
necessary
to
defend indigents charged with violation of ordinances of the City of
Cleveland, provided such violation
may result in incarceration, for the
period of one year beginning January 1, 1998 through December 31,
1998,
at
the
estimated
cost
of
$857,500.00, payable from Fund No.
01-01-15-0320, Request No. 24751.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

may be taken if deemed desirable
by the Commissioner of Purchases
and Supplies until provision is made
for the requirements for the entire

the Director of Finance shall certify thereon the amount of the initial
purchase thereunder, which purchase, together with all subsequent
purchases, shall be made on order of
the Commissioner of Purchases and
