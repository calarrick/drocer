FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES REFERRED
Ord. No. 1596-98.
By Councilman Johnson (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the purchase by requirement
contract of window washing services, for the various divisions of
City government, for a period not to
exceed two years.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Finance is hereby authorized to
make a written requirement contract in accordance with the Charter
and the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland,
Ohio,
1976,
for
the
requirements for the period of two
(2) years for the necessary items of
window washing services in the
estimated sum of $120,000, to be purchased by the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies upon a unit
basis for the various divisions of
City government. Bids shall be
taken in such manner as to permit
an award to be made for all items
as a single contract, or by separate
contract for each or any combination of said items as the Board of
Control shall determine. Alternate
bids for a period less than two (2)
years may be taken if deemed desirable by the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies until provision
is made for the requirements for the
entire term.
Section 2. The cost of said contract shall be charged against the
proper appropriation account and
the Director of Finance shall certify thereon the amount of the initial
purchase thereunder, which purchase, together with all subsequent
purchases, shall be made on order of
the Commissioner of Purchases and
Supplies pursuant to a requisition
against such contract duly certified
by the Director of Finance. (RL
22996)

September 16, 1998
Section 3. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Referred to Directors of Finance,
Law; Committee on Finance.
Ord. No. 1597-98.
By Councilman Johnson (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Finance to enter
an amendment to license agreement
with
International
Business
Machines Corporation, Contract No.
53044, to correctly state the software
licensed and the charges therefor.
Whereas, pursuant to Ordinance
No. 606-98, passed April 27, 1998, the
Director of Finance entered into an
agreement with International Business Machines Corporation (“IBM”),
Contract No. 53044, for the license of
MVS 370 computer software, based
upon its January 13, 1998 proposal;
and
Whereas, IBM’s January 13, 1998
proposal incorrectly identified the
software licensed and the license
charges; and
Whereas, by its June 26, 1998 proposal, IBM has correctly identified
the MVS 370 software licensed and
the charges therefor, and the City
wishes to amend said Contract No.
53044 to incorporate such proposal;
and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Finance is hereby authorized to
enter into an amendment to the
license agreement with International Business Machines Corporation,
Contract No. 53044, to correct the
identification of and license charges
for the MVS 370 software licensed to
the City of Cleveland, as set forth
in IBM’s June 26, 1998 proposal.
Section 2. That cost of the amendment hereby authorized shall be
paid from Fund No. 70 SF 140,
