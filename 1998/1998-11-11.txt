BY HAND DELIVERY
The Honorable Jay Westbrook
President of Council
Cleveland City Council
601 Lakeside Avenue
Cleveland, Ohio 44114
Re: Ordinance No. 1845-98
Dear Council President Westbrook:
I
am
reluctantly
disapproving
Ordinance No. 1845-98 and return it
to you with my veto noted thereon
and my objections outlined below.
Ordinance
No.
1845-98,
which
amends Codified Ordinance Section
173.071 to mandate that Council
members receive expense reimburse-

1871

ments within two business days, is
an exercise of authority that the
Council does not have and which is
given to others pursuant to the City
Charter. Furthermore, the Ordinance
runs contrary to good accounting
practices as recommended by the
City’s auditors and could result in
violations of Treasury Regulations
relating
to
such
reimbursement
plans.
The Controlling Charter Provisions
The City Charter bestows upon
the Director of Finance and the
Commissioner of Accounts the duty
to supervise the City’s money. If the
Director or the Commissioner fails
in this duty, then each may be saddled with personal liability. The
Council cannot order the Director or
the Commissioner to make a payment that the Director or the Commissioner has not investigated and
found to be legal and proper. The
Director and the Commissioner must
have adequate time to determine
whether a payment is legal and
proper.
This conclusion is supported by
several Charter sections. Charter
Section 94 gives the Director of
Finance charge of “the administration of the financial affairs of the
City, including the keeping and
supervision of all accounts; the custody and disbursement of City funds
and moneys. . . .” Charter Section 95
prescribes the accounting procedure
that the Director of Finance must
follow and gives the Director discretion to describe the form of
accounts. Charter Section 97 designates the Commissioner of Accounts
as “the chief accounting officer of
the City.” Charter Section 97 further
states that the Commissioner of
Accounts “shall, under the supervision of the Director of Finance,
install and maintain accounting procedures in conformity with Section
95 of the Charter.”
Charter Section 105 addresses the
means and manner for making a
claim for payment. It states, “No
claim against the City shall be paid
unless it be evidenced by a voucher
approved by the head of the department or office for which the indebtedness was incurred. . . . The Commissioner of Accounts shall examine
all payrolls, bills and other claims
and demands against the City and
shall issue no warrant for payment
unless he finds that the claim is in
proper form, correctly computed and
duly approved; that it is justly and
legally due and payable; that an
appropriation has been made therefor which has not been exhausted,
or that the payment has been otherwise legally authorized; and that
there is money in the City Treasury
to make payment.” Charter Section
105 further gives the Commissioner
power to investigate any claim. The

4
head of the department is individually liable for “negligent or corrupt
approval of any such claim.” The
Commissioner of Accounts is individually liable for issuing a warrant
contrary to law or ordinance.
Thus, the Charter makes issuance
of warrants in payment of claims an
administrative function of the Director of Finance and the Commissioner of Accounts. Each of them may
be individually liable for warrants
issued contrary to law. In an opinion requested by the City of Cleveland, the Ohio Attorney General
determined that when the Charter
contains specific provisions as to
the means and manner of making
claims against the City, the Charter
must be strictly followed. “When the
people of a charter city make a specific provision as to the means by,
and the manner in which, and the
conditions
under
which
claims
against the city must be presented
and allowed, the charter provisions
must be strictly followed.” 1938
Ohio.Atty.Gen.Ops. 370, paragraph 1
of the syllabus. The opinion examined Cleveland’s Charter Section 105
and found that “power is delegated
therein to the Commissioner of
Accounts to fully investigate any
claims.” Id. at p. 372. The Attorney
General further found, “The people
of the City of Cleveland by the adoption of this section of the charter
threw safeguards around their public funds and the City Council can
not go beyond them.” Id. at 372. The
Attorney General concluded, “Where
the city charter provides that all
claims against the city shall be presented
to
the
Commissioner
of
Accounts, by him examined into and
found to be justly and legally due
and payable before he draws his
warrant therefor, the city council
has no power or authority to order
the city treasurer to draw his check
in payment of a claim.” Id. at paragraph 3 of the syllabus.
Thus, pursuant to the City’s charter and the opinion of the Ohio
Attorney General, issuing warrants
in payment of expenses is an administrative function that cannot be disturbed by the City Council. Ordinance No. 1845-98 provides that members of Council shall receive reimbursement within two business days
following approval by the Clerk of
Council
and
submission
to
the
Department of Finance. As shown
above, the Director of Finance and
the Commissioner of Accounts must
be able to investigate the legality
and appropriateness of any claim
and the Council cannot order payment
if
the
Commissioner
of
Accounts has not been able to examine the claim. It follows that the
Director of Finance and the Commissioner of Accounts must be given
sufficient time to examine claims.
Two days is not sufficient time, nor
is it within the power of Council to
determine that two days is sufficient time.
Charter Section 78 gives each
director the power to prescribe rules
and regulations to carry out their
charter mandated duties. Charter
Section 78 states, “The director of
each department shall have the
supervision
and
control
of
the
department. He shall have power to
prescribe rules and regulations, not
inconsistent with this Charter. . .for
the distribution and performance of
its business. . . .” The Director of
Finance and the Commissioner of
Accounts have prescribed a procedure, consistent with Charter Section 105, for the payment of claims

The City Record
for expense reimbursements. This
procedure is reasonable and within
their power to prescribe.
Prudent Accounting Practices
The
procedure
regarding
the
issuance of warrants for reimbursement of expenses was developed
after an audit of the City’s disbursement process. In their management report, the auditors specifically
cautioned
against
the
issuance of manual checks “since
manual checks are more prone to
human error, more costly, and more
difficult to control.” The amendment
to Codified Ordinance Section 173.071
proposed by Ordinance No. 1845-98
would make manual checks unavoidable because the current system cannot accommodate a two day turnaround.
The current system allows for
reimbursement within five business days. If a legally substantiated claim for reimbursement is
submitted by the Monday deadline,
a warrant is ready by Friday. This
system of issuing warrants once
per week is based on the auditor’s
recommendation and is prudent because it reduces the amount of
staff time spent processing warrants as efficiencies are gained,
there are less bank-to-bank wire
transfers to reimburse commingled
cash,
wire
transfer
costs
are
reduced as transfer to and from
the same accounts are consolidated and there is simpler daily reconciliation of the commingled cash
account.
That the Commissioner of Accounts be given sufficient time to
examine a claim is also supported
by recommendations of an IRS auditor after investigation of the Council’s own difficulties with expense
accounts. The City and the Council,
through its own lawyer, made representations to the Internal Revenue Service that the daily mileage
log would be reviewed by the Commissioner of Accounts and/or the
Department of Law prior to reimbursement.
This
recommendation
was part of the Settlement Agreement between the IRS and the City
and the Council incorporated this
recommendation into it “Council
Member Business Expenditure Policies and Procedures.” In order for
this to happen, there must be more
than two days within which to
make a review. It does not seem
prudent for the Council to take any
action
that
circumvents
good
accounting practices in light of the
difficulties many members encountered because of previous expense
reimbursement reports and substantiation. I am sure that Council members do not want a repeat of these
difficulties.
Finally,
if
expense
reimbursements are not properly substantiated to the City through the Director
of Finance and the Commissioner of
Accounts, then the reimbursements
issued will be considered taxable
income by the Internal Revenue Service. Treasury regulations require
that expenses must be substantiated to the payor, which is the City
of Cleveland, not the Clerk of Council.
As
Charter
Section
105
describes, the Clerk of Council, is
but one step in the authorization of
payment.
The
Commissioner
of
Accounts, under the supervision of
the Director of Finance, must be
satisfied that a claim is legal and
just.
If
the
Commissioner
of
Accounts is not given adequate time

1872

November 11, 1998
to do this then the reimbursement
plan becomes taxable and all reimbursements must be included in
wages of the Council members (who
may then seek to deduct the reimbursement amounts from their personal tax returns).
With these reasons, I hereby veto
Ordinance No. 1845-98.
Sincerely,
MICHAEL R. WHITE
