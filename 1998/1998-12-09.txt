& Bsmt., Cleveland, Ohio 44109; and
Whereas, the granting of this

Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard

The City Record
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement officers or agents of the Department of
Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation

4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.

Res. No. 2125-98.
By Councilmen Willis, Johnson,
Coats and Westbrook.
An emergency resolution urging
the Administration to institute a
civil lawsuit against firearm manufacturers.
Whereas, firearms are the weapons
most commonly used in homicides in
this country and are involved in the
deaths of approximately 34,000 persons each year; and
Whereas, firearms were used to
commit 69% of all homicides in this
country in 1995 and 68% of all homicides in 1996; and
Whereas, in 1990, 82% of all
homicides of persons aged 15-19
were committed with firearms and

2045

25
homicide is the second leading
cause of deaths for youths aged 1519; and
Whereas, firearm manufacturers,
knowingly
design,
manufacture,
market, and distribute thousands of
firearms in order to facilitate their
entry into and possession in Cleveland and other cities, where they
are often used in the commission of
crimes, including crimes in which
residents of Cleveland are killed,
maimed or terrorized; and
Whereas, the cities of Chicago
and New Orleans have instituted
civil lawsuits against firearm manufacturers under public nuisance
and product liability theories; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that firearm manufacturers know and foresee their conduct creates an unreasonable threat
to public health and safety; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council urges
the Administration to explore the
feasibility of instituting a lawsuit
against firearm manufacturers on
the basis of public nuisance, product
liability or other appropriate legal
theories.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit a
copy of this resolution to the Mayor,
the Director of Law and to the Attorney General of the State of Ohio.

hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives

An emergency resolution urging
awareness, education, training and
funding to stop the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
Whereas, the HIV/AIDS epidemic
is one of the most important public
health issues in the world; and
Whereas, HIV, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, is a virus that is

the HIV infection to full blown
AIDS is approximately 12 years and
continues to increase; and
Whereas, AIDS, Acquired Immunodeficiency
Syndrome,

Centers for Disease Control; such
criteria include: the individual is
HIV Positive (HIV+); has a white
blood cell count at below 200; and
suffers from a disease or secondary infection defined by the
CDC; and
Whereas, an individual infected
with HIV or AIDS can infect another
person
through
the
direct
exchange of blood, semen, vaginal
fluids and breast milk; and
Whereas, a person inflicted with
HIV or AIDS can look and feel perfectly healthy with no outward
signs of the illness; and
Whereas, the number of people
who
are
HIV+
are
currently
unknown, but that the number is
many times greater than the number of reported cases of AIDS; and
Whereas, the World Health Organization estimates the existence of
approximately 37 million cases of
HIV globally as of mid-1998; and
Whereas, the Centers for Disease Control report 641,086 cumulative cases of AIDS in the United
States,
of
which
an
estimated
250,394 are alive and living with
AIDS; and
Whereas, the Ohio Department of
Health has conservatively estimated
18,000 cases of HIV in Ohio; and
Whereas, the number of reported
cases of AIDS in Ohio is 9,565; and
Whereas, the Ohio Department of
Health has conservatively estimated
that 4,500 HIV+ people live in Cuyahoga County; and
Whereas, there are 2,783 reported
AIDS cases in the Cuyahoga region,
comprised of Cuyahoga, Ashtabula,
Geauga, Lake, Lorain and Medina
counties; and
Whereas, the Cuyahoga County
Region accounts for 29% of the
AIDS cases on Ohio; and
Whereas,
in
1995,
Cleveland
became an AIDS Tier One City and
the City of Cleveland’s Department
of Public Health declared a State of
Emergency in Cleveland; and
Whereas, the epidemiological profile of AIDS cases in Cuyahoga
County reports that males represent
approximately 83% of the cases and
females account for slightly more
than 15% of the total AIDS cases
known to exist in 1997; and
Whereas, most new cases of HIV
infection in women resulted from
heterosexual contact; and
Whereas, an estimated 1,205 of the
reported AIDS cases in Cuyahoga
County are residents in the City of
Cleveland; and
Whereas, there is a disproportionate percentage of minorities living
with AIDS in Cleveland. Of the
AIDS cases in Cleveland, 68% are
African American, although they
represent only 41% of the population; 11% are Hispanic, although
they represent only 5% of the population of the City; and
Whereas, the Centers for Disease
Control and other experts say the
most effective method to stop the
HIV/AIDS epidemic is through prevention; and

The City Record
Whereas, the Cleveland City Council’s Public Health Committee is
committed to the goal of stopping
the spread of HIV/AIDS; and
Whereas, the Public Health Committee is committed to bringing services and prevention education to
all segments of the population of
Cleveland; and
Whereas, no one is immune from
HIV/AIDS and no one has been
cured of HIV/AIDS; and
Whereas, the only way not to die
of AIDS is not to become infected
with HIV; now, therefore;
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland recommends that
the federal, state and local governments of the United States incorporate a prevention policy into all programs and grants that impact people
with
HIV/AIDS.
Prevention
should be incorporated into every
education and health and human
services program funded by all levels of government.
Section 2. That the Council urges
the elimination of discrimination
in housing against people living
with HIV/AIDS. Cuyahoga Metropolitan
Housing
Authority
and
other low income housing agencies
are encouraged to work with the
AIDS Housing Council to offer
vouchers and housing opportunities
to
people
living
with
HIV/AIDS. Further, the City of
Cleveland is urged to conduct a
study to project the housing needs
for people with HIV/AIDS in the
next five years and to develop the
capacity to meet that need; and
that the addition of direct services,
such as alcohol and substance
addiction programs and intervention services, should be incorporated in the housing programs for
people with HIV/AIDS.
Section 3. That the Council recommends that the State of Ohio
Board of Education adopt a policy
of health education for all students
for at least one semester each year
of education (K- 12); that the types
of courses taught reflect current,
critical public health issues; that
the students are taught basic living
instruction
from
proper
hygiene and nutrition to sex education and the prevention of communicable diseases such as Sexually Transmitted Disease (STDs)
and HIV/AIDS.
Section 4. That the Council urges
the
Cuyahoga
County
Juvenile
Court system to adopt a program to
educate the youth that go through
the system on basic living instruction from proper hygiene and nutrition to sex education and the prevention of communicable diseases
such as Sexually Transmitted Disease (STDs) and HIV/AIDS. Further, all youth that utilize the Juvenile Court System in any capacity
should be instructed through a
mandatory
HIV/AIDS
prevention
program.
Section 5. That the Council recommends that the State of Ohio
mandate
the
reporting
of
HIV
cases and that such reporting be
standard throughout the state and
should be consistent with the Federal guidelines set forth by the
Centers
for
Disease
Control.
Reporting should be done in age
brackets, modes of transmission
and race and ethnicity categories
consistent with the Federal guidelines set forth by the Centers for
Disease Control.

Section 6. That the Council seek
and encourage the representation of
Council on committees that fund or
review performances of agencies

that provide services in the City of
Cleveland.
Section 7. That the Council strongly recommends that all social service agencies funded by the City of
Cleveland have at least one staff
person who is trained in HIV/AIDS
prevention and education.
Section 8. That the Council recommends and encourages the implementation within the City of a uniform reporting system to determine
the effectiveness and efficiency of
the City’s overall goal to stop the
spread of HIV/AIDS and urges the
hiring of an independent evaluator
to document and monitor this reporting system.
Section 9. That the Council urges
that a review of all federal, state
and local laws be done to determine
whether there is any impediment to
developing or creating an effective
policy towards the eradication of
