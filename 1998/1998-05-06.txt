Ohio, is authorized and empowered
pursuant to Article XVIII of the
Constitution of the State of Ohio and
the Charter of the Issuer, among
other things: (a) to own and operate the public utility hereinafter
defined and referred to as “Cleveland Public Power”; (b) to make,
from time to time, such additions,
extensions, improvements, replacements and alterations to Cleveland

the mortgaged properties may operate the same for a period of years
from the date of such sale.
Whereas, by and pursuant to Ordinance No. 1516-91, duly passed on
July 24, 1991 (the “Original Bond
Legislation”), this Council authorized the issuance of Public Power
System Improvement First Mortgage
Revenue Bonds, dated September 1,
1991 in the aggregate principal
amount of $66,930,000, consisting of
Series 1991A Bonds in the aggregate
amount of $13,895,000 for the purposes of paying Capital Costs and
Series 1991B Bonds in the aggregate

amount of $53,035,000 for the purpose of advance refunding all of the
outstanding revenue bonds that had
previously been issued for Cleveland
Public Power (collectively herein
the “Series 1991 Bonds”), all as
defined in the Original Bond Legislation; and
Whereas, the Series 1991 Bonds
are issued under and secured on a
parity with any Additional Bonds by
a Trust Indenture, dated as of September 1, 1991 (the “Original Indenture”), between the Issuer and Star
Bank, N.A., Cincinnati, Ohio, as
Trustee (the “Trustee”), and reference is hereby made to the Original
Indenture as if rewritten in full
herein; and
Whereas, the Original Bond Legislation provides, in Section 12 thereof, that the Issuer may issue Additional Bonds on a parity with the
Series 1991 Bonds for certain purposes including the payment of Capital Costs and the refunding of
obligations issued for that purpose;
and
Whereas, pursuant to Ordinance
No. 1133-93, duly passed on June 7,
1993 (the “1994A Bond Legislation”)
this Council authorized the issuance
of Additional Bonds, entitled Public
Power System First Mortgage Revenue
Bonds,
Series
1994A
(the
“Series 1994A Bonds”), in the aggregate principal amount of $179,775,000
for the purpose of providing funds
for capital improvements to Cleveland Public Power and to refinance
notes issued for such purpose; and
Whereas, pursuant to Ordinance
No. 55-94, duly passed on June 6,
1994 (the “1994B Bond Legislation”)
this Council authorized the issuance
of additional Bonds, entitled Public
Power System First Mortgage Revenue
Bonds,
Series
1994B
(the
“Series 1994B Bonds”) in the aggregate principal amount of $39,330,000
for the purpose of providing funds
for the payment of a judgment
involving the Issuer and Cleveland
Public Power and to refinance notes
issued for such purpose (the Series
1994A Bonds and the Series 1994B
Bonds are hereinafter collectively
referred to as the “Series 1994
Bonds”); and
Whereas, pursuant to Ordinance
No. 1003-95, duly passed on June 19,
1995 (the “1996 Bond Legislation”),
this Council authorized the issuance
of Additional Bonds entitled Public
Power System First Mortgage Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 1996,
Sub-Series

(the

Bonds”) in the aggregate principal
amount of $123,720,000 for the purpose of providing funds for the
advance refunding of a portion of
the Series 1994A Bonds that had
been issued for Cleveland Public
Power; and
Whereas, this Council has determined that, in order to reduce the
Bond Service Charges payable by
the Issuer, it will be necessary for
the Issuer to refund, in advance, a
portion of the Series 1991 Bonds and
a portion of the Series 1994A Bonds
(such portions hereinafter referred
to as the “Prior Bonds”) and to provide for the current refunding, when
permitted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, of a
portion of the Series 1991 Bonds
through the issuance and sale of certain additional debt obligations; and
Whereas, this Council has further
determined that the refundings provided for in this Ordinance will
result in a reduction in the debt service charges payable by the Issuer;
and

632

May 6, 1998
Whereas, this Council has further
determined that in order to reduce
further the debt service charges
payable by the Issuer and thereby
reduce the cost of borrowing on its
outstanding debt by optimizing the
relative amounts of fixed and floating rate obligations from time to
time or the risk of variations in its
debt service costs, and to increase
the predictability of cash flow from
earnings on invested funds and
thereby improve its ability to manage its funds and revenues during
the period of the proposed transaction it may be necessary for the
Issuer to engage in an interest rate
swap transaction with a notional
amount not to exceed $60,000,000;
and
Whereas, this Council has further
determined that, in order to provide
funds for such purposes, it will be
necessary for the Issuer to issue and
sell the series of Bonds authorized
herein, on the terms set forth herein; and, as a result, this ordinance
constitutes an emergency measure
providing for the immediate preservation of the public property, health
and safety and for the usual and
daily
operation
of
a
municipal
department; now, therefore,

of
Term

Any Series 2001 Bonds which are
Term Bonds shall be subject to
mandatory redemption, through the
application of Mandatory Sinking
Fund Installments, on each Mandatory Redemption Date at one hundred percent (100%) of the principal
amount thereof plus accrued interest
to such date, in the years and in the
principal amounts set forth in the
Principal Retirement Schedule. For
the purpose of effecting the manda-

The City Record
tory redemption of the Series 2001
Bonds which are Term Bonds, the
Trustee shall cause to be redeemed
on
each
Mandatory
Redemption
Date an aggregate principal amount
of Series 2001 Bonds which are Term
Bonds equal to the Mandatory Sinking
Fund
Installment
for
such
Mandatory Redemption Date, and
the Trustee shall do so on behalf of
the Issuer and in the manner provided in the Indenture.
At its option, to be exercised on
or before the forty-fifth (45th) day
immediately preceding any Mandatory Redemption Date, the Issuer
may (i) deliver to the Trustee for
cancellation
Series
2001
Bonds
which are Term Bonds then subject
to mandatory redemption, in any
aggregate principal amount, or (ii)
receive a credit against the Mandatory Sinking Fund Installment next
payable
(and
the
corresponding
mandatory redemption obligation)
for any Series 2001 Bonds that are
Term Bonds then subject to mandatory redemption and which prior to
such
date
have
been
redeemed
(other than through the application
of the Mandatory Sinking Fund
Installments) or purchased for cancellation
and
canceled
by
the
Trustee and not theretofore applied
as a credit against any Mandatory
Sinking Fund Installment. Each
Series 2001 Bond which is a Term
Bond so delivered or previously
redeemed shall be credited by the
Trustee at one hundred percent
(100%) of the principal amount
thereof against the Mandatory Sinking Fund Installment payable on
such Mandatory Redemption Date.
If, as a result of any such credits,
the aggregate of amounts included
in the amounts deposited monthly in
the Principal Payment Account of
the Bond Service Fund equals or
exceeds
the
Mandatory
Sinking
Fund Installment, net of such credits, payable on the next Mandatory
Redemption Date, then no further
such amounts shall be required to
be
included
in
such
monthly
deposits to be made prior to such
Mandatory Redemption Date, and
any excess of the aggregate of the
amounts included in such amounts
deposited over such Mandatory Sinking Fund Installment shall be credited against future Mandatory Sinking Fund Installments in direct
order, and the principal amount the
Series 2001 Bonds to be redeemed by
mandatory
redemption
shall
be
accordingly reduced. If the Issuer
intends to avail itself at any time
of the provisions of this paragraph
with respect to credits against
Mandatory Sinking Fund Installments, the Issuer will on or before
the forty-fifth (45th) day immediately
preceding
such
Mandatory
Redemption
Date
furnish

the Director of Finance, stating the
extent to which such provisions of
this paragraph are to be availed of
with respect to such Mandatory
Sinking Fund Installment and corresponding mandatory redemption

on any Interest Payment Date, on

By Councilmen Patmon, Westbrook and Dolan.
An emergency resolution requesting that the Ohio General Assembly
oppose
a
consumer
bailout
of
FirstEnergy as part of the state’s
plan to open up the electric utility
industry to competition.
Whereas, affordably priced electric service is essential to the
health, safety and economic wellbeing of all Ohioans; and
Whereas, northern Ohio electric
ratepayers have been paying some
of the highest rates for electricity
in the United States for decades
because of utility investments in
nuclear power plants; and
Whereas, northern Ohio electric
consumers currently pay rates that
are thirty to fifty percent higher
than customers of other Ohio utilities, presenting a significant economic disadvantage to the region’s
residential and business customers;
and
Whereas, the Ohio General Assembly is considering proposals to bring
customer choice to the electric utility industry, which will affect the
cost of electricity; and
Whereas, legislation now pending
in the Ohio General Assembly, S.B.
237 and H.B. 732, would force northern Ohio residential and small business customers to continue to pay
for utilities’ nuclear power plant
investments (stranded costs) once
competition is introduced; and
Whereas, full recovery of stranded costs would cost the average
FirstEnergy customer at least $1,618
over a five-year period;
Now, therefore, be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That electric utility
competition in Ohio must not penalize ratepayers or taxpayers by forcing them to bail out utilities’ past
bad investments (stranded costs).
Section 2. That electric utility
competition in Ohio must result in
immediate
and
significant
price
reductions for all northern Ohio customers, including residential and
small businesses.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council be and she is hereby directed to
transmit certified copies of this resolution to Governor George Voinovich, Ohio Senate President Richard
Finan, Ohio House Speaker Jo Ann
Davidson, and State Representative
Troy Lee James and State Senator

that all persons employed by a contractor under contract with the City
of Cleveland “be paid wages which

May 6, 1998
are not less than are paid by the
City of Cleveland for similar or like
work; but if said City has not established a rate of wages for any particular class of work to be performed
under the terms of this contract,
than said employees shall be paid
wages not less than are generally
paid therefor by others employing
union labor in said City”; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department;
Now, therefore, be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:

the Ohio State Legislature and Governor Voinovich to reject House Bill
168 which will repeal Ohio’s prevailing rate of wages and determines this
to be in the public’s best interest.

Speaker Davidson and the Cuyahoga
