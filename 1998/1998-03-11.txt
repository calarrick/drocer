FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTION REFERRED
Res. No. 435-98.
By Councilmen Johnson and Zone.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio State legislature to adopt
legislation that will permit judges
in the Housing Court Division of
Municipal Court to refer certain
criminal cases to magistrates.
Whereas, in 1997 the City of Cleveland filed over 6500 new criminal
code violation cases in Cleveland
Housing Court, all of which were
assigned to the single Housing
Division Judge; and

8
Whereas, the 1997 filings of 6500
cases is an increase of 1000+ over
the cases filed in 1996, which represents an 18% increase; and
Whereas, since violations of the
Cleveland Housing Code are criminal
cases,
each
case
involves
arraignment, adjudication, and sentencing, and many cases involve
criminal trials; and
Whereas, because it is a goal of
the Cleveland Housing Court to
obtain compliance by the criminal
defendants in its court, many cases
are not resolved in a single hearing
but are continued after the need for
and the benefits of compliance are
explained to the defendant; and
Whereas, the ever-increasing misdemeanor
caseload
in
Cleveland
Municipal Court, particularly in the
Housing Division, makes it difficult
for a judge to give cases the individualized attention they deserve;
and court dockets, which last four
to five hours, disrupt the normal
work schedules of inspectors and
require criminal defendants, many
of whom are employed, to be in
court for several hours; and
Whereas, the Housing Court currently employs magistrates to assist
with the civil docket; and
Whereas, magistrates are experienced,
licensed
attorneys
who
review case files, conduct trials, and
recommend decisions to the judge;
and
Whereas, the judge must approve
each
magistrate
recommendation
before the recommendation becomes
the final decision of the court; and
Whereas, the magistrates in the
Housing Court currently by law
have a very limited ability to participate in the criminal cases before
the court; and
Whereas, in many courts in other
municipalities,
judges
assign
greater responsibility to the magistrates for standard criminal matters,
thereby freeing up the judges to
address more complex matters and
cases having greater community
impact; and
Whereas, in all cases, the judge
will be the party responsible making the decision whether or not to
refer a matter to magistrate; and
Whereas, the state legislature is
currently
considering
legislation
that would enable magistrates to
provide judges with more assistance
in criminal cases such as permitting
them to conduct the arraignment,
trial and sentencing, with all decisions of the magistrates becoming
final only upon review and approval
by the judge;
Now, therefore, be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland, for the reasons
stated in the preambles to this Resolution, supports passage of state
legislation empowering the Judge of
the Housing Division of the Cleveland Municipal Court to refer criminal cases to the Housing Division
magistrates for arraignment, trial
and sentencing, with the decision
whether to refer a matter to a magistrate still resting with the Judge,
and with all decisions of the magistrates becoming final only upon
review and approval by the Judge
of the Housing Division.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council transmit copies of this resolution
to members of the Ohio legislature
representing the City of Cleveland.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of

The City Record
all members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
