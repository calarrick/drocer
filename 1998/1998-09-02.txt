REPRINT
Res. No. 1515-98.
By
Councilmen
Coats,
Rybka,
Westbrook and White.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio Department of Transportation to use existing railroad tracks
to create passenger rail service
between Cleveland and Columbus,
and opposing the construction of a
third lane in each direction on
Interstate 71 between Columbus and
the service area of the Northeast
Ohio
Areawide
Coordinating
Agency.

Whereas, ODOT hopes to reconstruct a 140-mile section of I-71
between Cleveland and Columbus,
involving 10 years of work and $302
million of taxpayers’ dollars; and
Whereas, ODOT proposes to add
passenger
rail
service
between
Cleveland and Columbus, costing
initially more than $32 million, on
existing tracks; and
Whereas, ODOT recommends that
the existing Amtrak station in
downtown Cleveland be the northern terminus for I-71 passenger rail;
and
Whereas, the proposal to provide
passenger
rail
service
between
Cleveland and Columbus has been
greeted by many, including local
and regional governments and newspaper editorial boards, as a most
welcome concept; and
Whereas, ODOT nonetheless also
plans to widen I-71 by one permanent lane in each direction for most
of the distance between Cleveland
and Columbus as a means of accommodating traffic during the reconstruction period; and
Whereas, the 30-year cost of building and maintaining the additional
highway capacity provided by the
third lane in each direction is estimated at $500 million; and
Whereas, once I-71 is reconstructed, ODOT planners believe the rightof-way
may
not
permit
further
widening without extremely high
additional acquisition and construction costs; and
Whereas, ODOT planners note
that additional travel capacity can
be expanded in a cost-effective manner simply by adding rail cars to
fast, modern passenger trains; and
Whereas,
expanding
passenger
rail service into downtown Cleveland from other cities in the Great
Lakes region and Midwest would
improve the City’s travel, meeting
and convention and tourism economy by providing a convenient, costeffective
and
time-efficient,
allweather
transportation
link
to
downtown attractions at the North
Coast, Tower City, Gateway and
University Circle, and in particular
to the newly planned Transportation
Center at a new Cleveland Convention Center; and
Whereas, a balanced transportation system for Ohio, which coordinates links between highways, passenger rail lines, airports and other
modes of travel, will increase mobility of all citizens and expand economic development opportunities for
large and small communities alike
along the I-71 corridor;
Now, therefore be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Cleveland City
Council hereby strongly supports
the introduction of passenger rail

1528

September 2, 1998
service linking Cleveland, Galion
and Columbus; and
Section 2. That the Cleveland City
Council hereby supports the possible
expansion of said passenger rail
line to Dayton and Cincinnati; and
Section 3. That the Cleveland City
Council hereby encourages the Ohio
Department of Transportation, the
Ohio Rail Development Commission,
CSX, Norfolk Southern, Amtrak and
others to work together to start passenger rail service between Cleveland and Columbus as soon as possible; and
Section 4. That the Cleveland City
Council hereby encourages coordinated connections to permit travelers to transfer easily to Greater
Cleveland Regional Transit Authority services and to Cleveland Hopkins
International
Airport
to
improve mobility for all travelers;
and
Section 5. That the Cleveland City
Council hereby supports all efforts
aimed at guaranteeing that passenger rail service be provided, without
the need for transfer, the complete
distance to the planned Transportation Center in downtown Cleveland;
and
Section 6. That the Cleveland City
Council hereby opposes the construction of a permanent third lane
in each direction of I-71 for the distance between the limits of the
cities of Medina and Columbus
except when a merge lane is deemed
by the local Metropolitan Planning
Organization imperative to safety
and Level of Service in conjunction
with high-volume interchanges, and
except as deemed necessary for
truck-climbing
in
steep
incline
areas; and
Section 7. That the Cleveland City
Council hereby supports the planning and implementation of Intelligent Traffic Systems concurrent
with reconstruction as a means of
enhancing Level of Service and safety without permanent additional
highway capacity.
Section 8. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Passed August 19, 1998.
