An emergency resolution urging
the Congress to oppose the Internet
Tax Freedom Act.

which preempts state and local
taxes and fees, but not federal taxes
and fees, on goods and services provided over the Internet; and

1709

15
Whereas, the legislation under
consideration by the Senate fails to
protect state and local revenue
bases and, if enacted, would pose
great harm to local merchants; and

Freedom Act in its current form;
now therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That in consideration
of the potentially harmful impact
on local merchants, the Council of
the City of Cleveland urges the
United States Senate to oppose
action on the Internet Tax Freedom
Act, S. 442, unless the legislation is
amended to provide a firm guarantee that all sales of goods and services will be subject to the same
sales
taxes
as
over-the-counter
sales by local merchants and further urges the House of Representatives and the President of the
United States to oppose passage of
legislation that will serve to undermine the revenue base of local

An emergency resolution urging
Congress to support the reauthorization of the Local Law Enforcement`Block Grant at increased funding levels.
Whereas, Congress is currently
considering the reauthorization of
funding for the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant (LLEBG) program which provides funds to cities
and towns to assist in the reduction
and prevention of crime; and
Whereas, the funding levels that
are under consideration are insufficient and the formula for allocation
of those funds may be altered, thereby resulting in less money being
available to municipalities, such as
Cleveland, to fight crime; and
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland is gravely concerned
about the level of crime throughout
our City and desire Congress to provide adequate funding assistance to
aid in the reduction and prevention
of crime; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

An emergency resolution urging
the President and Congress to support U.S. steel manufacturers by preventing the illegal dumping of foreign steel.
Whereas, LTV Corp., ClevelandCliffs, Inc., WCI Steel, Inc., the United Steel Workers of America and
other steel producers, suppliers and
workers are deeply concerned about
the rising tide of foreign imports of
steel; and
Whereas, this coalition contends
that the Asian financial crisis has
caused Asian and European steel
producers to divert their steel to the
United States, illegally dumping the
steel at prices below production
costs or home market prices; and
Whereas, if illegal dumping has
occurred and is permitted to continue, such practices would cause
financial harm to U.S. steel manufacturers and their many employees,
many of whom are residents of the
City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, the President and Congress have the authority and tools
available to promptly investigate
and prevent any illegal dumping
practices; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges the President and Congress to support United States steel manufacturers and
their thousands of employees by
promptly investigating and preventing any illegal dumping of steel by
