By Councilmen Patmon, Coats,

An emergency resolution objecting to the current planned site for
the construction of a new juvenile
detention center and urging the
Cuyahoga County Commissioners to
find sufficient land for the construction of this new facility.
Whereas, the Cuyahoga County
Juvenile Detention Center is over-

511

15
crowded and is inadequate thus
creating a potential threat to the
safety of both residents and staff;
and
Whereas, the National Juvenile
Detention Association criticized the
present facility for being one of the
most adult-oriented, bleak, depressing,
unsafe
and
psychologically
harmful facilities ever reviewed;
and
Whereas,
a
juvenile
detention
facility should provide rehabilitation for juvenile offenders under
conditions that are conducive for
such activities, thus enabling juveniles to become productive members
of society instead of being continually involved in criminal activity
which can result in a young offender progressing through the criminal
justice system; and
Whereas, the planned site for the
new juvenile detention center is considered to be inadequate because the
tract of land that the facility will
be built on is too small; and
Whereas,
the
planned
tower
design for the juvenile detention
center according to experts can
result in a potential safety hazard
thus placing the juveniles and
staff at tremendous risk and danger; and
Whereas, the City and County can
find suitable land for major downtown economic development projects
such as Gateway, Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame Museum, Great Lakes
Science Center, Wyndham Hotel, the
Federal Courthouse project, and the
New Football Stadium, but have
failed to put forth that same effort
on finding a suitable site to build a
new juvenile detention center; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council does
hereby object to the Cuyahoga County Commissioners plan to construct
a new juvenile detention center on
a tract of land that is inadequate for
juvenile offenders.
Section
2.
That
this
Council
objects to the design of any juvenile
detention facility that threatens the
health and safety of juveniles and
staff.
Section
3.
That
this
Council
strongly urges the Cuyahoga County Commissioners to find a suitable site for the new juvenile
detention.
Section
4.
That
this
Council
pledges to cooperate with the County Commissioners and the Juvenile
Court judges in finding a site
whereby the most appropriate juvenile detention facility can be built
that offers safety, protection and
rehabilitation to juveniles in the
area.
Section 5. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby be directed to
transmit a certified copy of this resolution to the Cuyahoga County
Commissioners and Juvenile Court
Administrative Judge.
Section 6. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all members elected to Council, it
shall take effect immediately upon
its adoption and approval by the
Mayor, otherwise it shall take effect
and be in force from and after the
earliest period allowed by law.
Adopted April 6, 1998.
Awaiting the approval or disapproval of the Mayor.
