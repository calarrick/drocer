subject matter may be substituted
for any pending ordinance or resolution by a majority vote of all the
members elected to Council, upon
the recommendation of any committee to which such legislation has

table as a final disposition thereof.

action. A majority vote of all the
members elected to Council shall be
necessary for the adoption of an
amendment to any legislation pending before the Council.

at which such vetoed ordinance or
resolution is returned, if such meeting shall occur not less than one (1)
week after receipt of such ordinance
or resolution, proceed to reconsider
the same. After the adoption of the
motion so to reconsider, the question

passed (or adopted) notwithstanding the veto of the Mayor. Those
voting aye vote to override the
