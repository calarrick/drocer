FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL

Res. No. 1705-98.
By Councilmen Jackson, Cimperman, Gordon, Polensek, Westbrook,
White,
Sweeney,
Dolan,
Rybka,
Lewis, Zone, Cintron, Britt, Patmon,
Jones, Willis, Robinson and Melena.
An emergency resolution supporting the Platform developed by the
tenants of public and subsidized
housing on August 29, 1998 and urging HUD to reconsider its policy
that will result in the displacement
of 1800 families.
Whereas, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)

The City Record
is charged with the responsibility of
providing safe, sanitary and decent
housing for residents throughout the
country and in Cleveland; and
Whereas, there are over 11,000 project-based subsidized housing units
in Cleveland; and
Whereas, there are over 12,000
public housing units in Cuyahoga
County; and
Whereas, approximately 90% of
the project-based subsidized contracts will expire in the next five
years; and
Whereas,
HUD’s
policy
will
extend the project-based contracts
for only one year at a time once the
project-based
subsidy
contracts
expire; and
Whereas, HUD’s policy is to use
Section 8 vouchers or certificates to
house low-income people rather than
to subsidize a unit; and
Whereas, HUD is now taking
enforcement action against projectbased properties that are below
housing quality standards (HQS);
and
Whereas, it is long overdue that
HUD
take
enforcement
action
against private owners that have
not maintained their property to
HQS; and
Whereas,
while
enforcement
actions should be taken, they should
not, however, result in displacement
of residents; and
Whereas, over 1800 families in
Cleveland
are
threatened
with
being displaced from their homes
through HUD’s use of Section 8
vouchers
and
certificates
and
through the initiation of enforcement action; and
Whereas, the use of Section 8
vouchers and certificates and the
enforcement actions is not solely for
the well-being of the housing residents; and
Whereas, the use of Section 8
vouchers and certificates and the
enforcement actions are also for
political and budgetary reasons;
and
Whereas, the Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority (CMHA)
Section 8 department is in disarray;
and
Whereas, HUD has sanctioned
CMHA’s Section 8 department for its
inability to process vouchers and its
inability to ensure quality housing;
and
Whereas, there is not enough
quality rental and affordable housing in the Cleveland area to accommodate 1800 families; and
Whereas, neighborhoods and suburban communities are unable or
unwilling to absorb the 1800 families; and
Whereas, HUD’s policy of using
Section 8 vouchers and certificates
and its enforcement policy will
result in new ghettoes, substandard
housing, and homelessness; and
Whereas, public housing is a significant portion of available housing
for low income people; and
Whereas, public housing is also
subject to HUD policy that has budgetary and political motives that are
not in the best interest of low
income people; and
Whereas, HUD’s desire to abandon
low income housing programs will
result in the dismantling of public
housing; and
Whereas, the long range effect of
HUD’s policy toward public housing
is the displacement of thousands of
people from their neighborhoods and
communities; and
Whereas, the result of HUD’s policy toward public housing will pro-

1609

13
duce the same results associated
with project-based subsidized housing, namely the creation of ghettoes,
substandard housing and homelessness; and
Whereas, in response to HUD’s
policy and its effects to undermine
public and subsidized housing, a
Town Hall Meeting was held on
August 29, 1998; and
Whereas, the purpose of the Town
Hall Meeting was to develop a “Platform” for the tenants of public and
subsidized housing and to oppose
the immediate displacement of 1800
families; and
Whereas, over 670 people attended
the meeting and participated in creating a Platform for public and subsidized housing; and
Whereas, the people that attended
the meeting and developed the Platform were from all neighborhoods of
Cleveland and from some suburban
communities; and
Whereas, the attendees of the
Town Hall Meeting were unified in
their sincere concern for the 1800
families that are threatened with
immediate displacement; and
Whereas, the attendees of the
Town Hall Meeting were unified in
their strong support of the Platform that was developed; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland supports the objectives of the Platform developed at
the Town Hall Meeting on August
29, 1998, as found in File No. 170598-A.
Section
2.
That
this
Council
strongly requests that HUD reassess
its policy and mission in order that
1800 families within the City of
Cleveland are not displaced from
their homes.
Section 3. That this Council urges
HUD and the owners of projectbased housing to make all necessary
repairs so that the units are safe
and up to housing quality standards,
and to do so promptly and without
displacing any tenants.
Section 4. That this Council is
willing to work with HUD on a policy and plan for replacement units
before displacement occurs.
Section 5. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland believes that public and subsidized housing should
be made available to those individuals and families that are in
need
of
federal
assistance
to
ensure safe, sanitary and decent
housing for all residents of the
City of Cleveland and the surrounding communities.
Section 6. That the Clerk of Council is requested to transmit a copy
of this Resolution to Andrew Cuomo,
Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development and to the Director
and Board of the Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority.
Section 7. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
