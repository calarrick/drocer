Whereas, Council has been notified by the Director of Liquor Control of an application for the transfer of ownership and location of a
C2 and C2X Liquor Permit from Permit No. 8729764, Swanson Mini Market Inc., DBA Swanson Mini Market,
2541-43 E. 55th St., Cleveland, Ohio
44104, to Permit No. 9760154, Woodhill Best Grocery Co., DBAWoodhill
Food Mart, 2664 Woodhill Rd., Cleveland, Ohio 44104; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and

January 21, 1998

Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, safety
and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of
notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby record its objection to the transfer of ownership and location of a
C2 and C2X Liquor Permit from Permit No. 8729764, Swanson Mini Market Inc., DBA Swanson Mini Market,

Director of Liquor Control to set a
hearing for said application in
