FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES READ IN FULL
AND PASSED
Ord. No. 467-A-98 (as substitute for
Ordinance No. 467-98.
By Councilman Johnson (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance to authorize the Director of Finance to
obtain a substitute credit enhancement or liquidity facility for the
City’s
Subordinated
Income
Tax
Variable Rate Refundable Bonds,
Series 1994, to authorize agreements
in connection therewith, and to
authorize amendments to the Indenture of Trust in connection therewith and to permit the conversion of
the Bonds to a tax-exempt interest
rate mode.
Whereas, pursuant to Ordinance
No. 367-94 passed on March 14, 1994
(the Bond Legislation), the City of
Cleveland, Ohio (the Issuer) issued
its Subordinated Income Tax Variable Rate Refunding Bonds, Series
1994, dated June 2, 1994 (the Bonds)
which are currently outstanding in
the aggregate principal amount of
$72,800,000; and
Whereas, pursuant to the Bond
Legislation and the Certificate of
Award authorized therein, the Bonds
were issued initially as variable
rate obligations bearing interest at
a Unit Pricing Rate, all as set forth
and provided in the Indenture of
Trust dated as of May 15, 1994 (the
Indenture) between the Issuer and
Star Bank, National Association, as
trustee, a copy of which is on file
with the Clerk of Council in File No.
467-A-98-A.
Whereas, pursuant to the Bond
Legislation, the Director of Finance
obtained a credit facility from Union
Bank of Switzerland, New York
Branch and Credit Suisse, New York
Branch to enhance the credit and
liquidity of the Bonds and, in connection therewith, entered into a letter of credit and reimbursement
agreement; and
Whereas, the credit facility has a
stated expiration date which precedes the final maturity of the
Bonds, and it is therefore necessary
to extend or replace the credit facility in order to continue to provide
the necessary liquidity and credit
enhancement of the Bonds; and
Whereas, the Indenture permits
the Issuer to replace an existing
credit or liquidity facility with a
substitute credit facility upon the
satisfaction of certain conditions;
and
Whereas, a substitute credit or liquidity facility may be obtained on
more favorable terms than the existing credit or liquidity facility; and
Whereas, it was anticipated at the
time of passage of the Bond Legislation that, upon the resolution of
certain federal income tax issues
raised in litigation to which the City
is not a party, an opinion of bond
counsel could be obtained to the
effect that the interest on the Bonds
is excluded from gross income for
federal income tax purposes, and it
appears that those issues may be
resolved in the near future; and
Whereas, in order to obtain the
aforesaid opinion of bond counsel
and for the Bonds to be marketable
as tax-exempt obligations it may be
necessary to amend certain provisions of the Indenture; and
Whereas, it is necessary to authorize the Director of Finance to
obtain a substitute credit facility as
soon as possible in order to provide
for the delivery of such substitute

10
credit facility not less than five
business days prior to the expiration
date of the current credit facility
and further to provide for the conversion of the Bonds to a tax-exempt
interest rate mode at the earliest
opportunity, and thereby to enable
the Issuer to achieve the desired
debt service savings on the Bonds,
and, as a result, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public property, health
and safety and for the usual and
daily
operation
of
a
municipal
department;
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. Substitute Credit or Liquidity Facilities.
If the Director of Finance, based
upon the written advice and recommendation of the Issuer’s financial
advisor, determines that it is in the
best interest of the Issuer to obtain
a substitute credit and/or liquidity
facility for the Bonds, then the
Director of Finance is authorized to
obtain a substitute credit enhancement and/or liquidity facility for the
Bonds in accordance with such recommendation and to execute, deliver
and perform any items or agreements in connection therewith, after
the same shall have been approved
as to form and correctness by the
Director of Law, which agreements
may provide for the payment of the
fees and expenses related to obtaining such substitute credit and/or
liquidity facility and the reimbursement of the provider thereof for
amounts drawn thereunder from the
Pledged Revenues, as defined in the
Bond Legislation, and the Director
of Finance is authorized to have prepared, and the Mayor and the Director of Finance are authorized to sign
and deliver, such amendments to the
Indenture as may be necessary to
accommodate the requirements of
the provider of any such substitute
credit and/or liquidity facility, after
the same shall have been approved
as to form and correctness by the
Director of Law, provided that no
such agreement or amendment may
purport to entitle the credit or liquidity facility provider to payment
or reimbursement from any source
other than the Pledged Revenues,
and provided further that, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in the Bond Legislation, no such agreement or amendment shall entitle the provider of
any such credit or liquidity facility
to be paid interest at a rate higher
than the maximum rate on the
Bonds permitted under the Bond
Legislation or to have the principal
amount of any Bonds for which such
credit or liquidity facility provider
has made payment retired more
rapidly than would be called for by
the Indenture, the provisions of
which Indenture are hereby ratified
and approved. The Mayor, the Director of Finance, the Director of Law,
the Clerk of Council and such other
officers of the Issuer as may be
appropriate
are
authorized
and
directed to furnish, execute and
deliver such documents, certifications and instruments as may be necessary or appropriate to consummate
the transactions contemplated in
such agreements and amendments.
Section 2. Conversion to TaxExempt Interest Rate Mode.
The Director of Finance is authorized to have prepared such amendments to the Indenture as are nec-

The City Record
essary or appropriate to provide for
the conversion of the Bonds to a taxexempt interest mode upon receipt
of an opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel to the effect that
interest on the Bonds is excluded
from
gross
income
for
federal
income tax purposes, and as are not
materially adverse to the interests
of the City. Those amendments shall
specify, among other matters, the
method and procedure by which the
tax-exempt rate or rates of interest
on the Bonds shall be determined,
including variable rates, if the
Director
of
Finance
determines,
based upon the advice of the financial advisor of the Issuer, that the
Issuer’s best interests will be served
by causing the Bonds to bear interest at a variable rate. Those amendments may also provide for revised
redemption provisions and a revised
Principal Retirement Schedule to be
effective upon such conversion if
the Director of Finance determines,
based upon the advice of the financial advisor of the Issuer, that those
revised redemption provisions and
Principal Retirement Schedule are
to the financial advantage of and in
the best interests of the City, provided that the final maturity date of
the Bonds shall not be later than the
final maturity date provided in the
Bond Legislation. The Mayor and
the Director of Finance are authorized to sign and deliver such
amendments to the Indenture after
the same shall have been approved
as to form and correctness by the
Director of Law. The Mayor, the
Director of Finance, the Director of
Law, the Clerk of Council and such
other officers of the Issuer as may
be appropriate are authorized and
directed to furnish, execute and
deliver such documents, certifications and instruments as may from
time to time be necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated in such amendments.
Section 3. Tax Covenants.
Upon the occurrence of the conversion of the Bonds to a tax-exempt
interest mode, the Issuer covenants
that it will use, and will restrict the
use and investment of, the proceeds
of the Bonds in such manner and to
such extent as may be necessary so
that the interest on the Bonds will
be excluded from gross income for
federal income tax purposes.
The Issuer further covenants that
(a) it will take or cause to be taken
such actions that may be required
of it for the interest on the Bonds
to be and to remain excluded from
gross income for federal income tax
purposes, (b) it will not take or
authorize to be taken any actions
that would adversely affect that
exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting for it, will, among other acts of
compliance, (i) apply the proceeds
of the Bonds to the governmental
purposes of the borrowing, (ii)
restrict the yield on investment
property, (iii) make timely and adequate payments to the federal government, (iv) maintain books and
records and make calculations and
reports, and (v) refrain from certain
uses of those proceeds and, as
applicable,
of
property
financed
with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the extent necessary to
assure such exclusion of that interest under the Code.
The Director of Finance, or any
other officer of the Issuer having
responsibility for issuance of the
Bonds, is hereby authorized (a) to

398

March 25, 1998
make or effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent,
approval, or waiver on behalf of the
Issuer with respect to the Bonds as
the Issuer is permitted or required
to make or give under the federal
income tax laws, including, without
limitation thereto, any of the elections
provided
for
in
Section
148(f)(4)(C) of the Code or available under Section 148 of the Code,
for the purpose of assuring, enhancing or protecting favorable tax
treatment or status of the Bonds or
interest thereon or assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose,
reducing
the
burden
or
expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or payments
of penalties, or making payments of
special amounts in lieu of making
computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as rebate, or
obviating those amounts or payments, as determined by that officer,
which action shall be in writing and
signed by the officer, (b) to take
any and all other actions, make or
obtain calculations, make payments,
and make or give reports, covenants
and certifications of and on behalf
of the Issuer, as may be appropriate
to assure the exclusion of interest
from gross income and the intended
tax status of the Bonds, and (c) to
give one or more appropriate certificates of the Issuer setting forth
the reasonable expectations of the
Issuer regarding the amount and
use of all the proceeds of the Bonds,
the facts, circumstances and estimates on which they are based, and
other facts and circumstances relevant to the tax treatment of the
interest on and the tax status of the
Bonds.
Each covenant made in this Section with respect to the Bonds is
also made with respect to all issues
any portion of the debt service on
which is paid from proceeds of the
Bonds (and, if different, the original
issue and any refunding issues in a
series of refundings), to the extent
such compliance is necessary to
assure exclusion of interest on the
Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes, and the officers identified above are authorized
to take actions with respect to those
issues as they are authorized in this
Section to take with respect to the
Bonds.
Section 4. Open Meeting Determination.
It is found and determined that all
formal actions of this Council concerning and relating to the passage
of this ordinance were adopted in an
open meeting of this Council and
that all deliberations of this Council and of any of its committees that
resulted in such formal action were
in meetings open to the public, in
compliance with law.
Section 5. Recitals.
It is hereby determined and recited that all acts, conditions and
things necessary to be done precedent to and in the issuing of the
Bonds and the conversion of the
Bonds to a tax-exempt interest rate
mode in order to make the same
legal, valid and binding special
obligations issued by the City of
Cleveland, Ohio have happened, been
done and performed or will happen,
be done and performed in regular
and due form as required by law;
and that no limitation of indebtedness or taxation, either statutory or
constitutional, is applicable to the
issuance or conversion of the Bonds.

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 435-98.
By Councilmen Johnson and Zone.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio State legislature to adopt
legislation that will permit judges
in the Housing Court Division of
Municipal Court to refer certain
criminal cases to magistrates.
Whereas, in 1997 the City of Cleveland filed over 6500 new criminal
code violation cases in Cleveland
Housing Court, all of which were
assigned to the single Housing Division Judge; and
Whereas, the 1997 filings of 6500
cases is an increase of 1000+ over
the cases filed in 1996, which represents an 18% increase; and
Whereas, since violations of the
Cleveland Housing Code are criminal
cases,
each
case
involves
arraignment, adjudication, and sentencing, and many cases involve
criminal trials; and
Whereas, because it is a goal of
the Cleveland Housing Court to
obtain compliance by the criminal
defendants in its court, many cases
are not resolved in a single hearing
but are continued after the need for
and the benefits of compliance are
explained to the defendant; and
Whereas, the ever-increasing misdemeanor
caseload
in
Cleveland
Municipal Court, particularly in the
Housing Division, makes it difficult
for a judge to give cases the individualized attention they deserve;
and court dockets, which last four
to five hours, disrupt the normal
work schedules of inspectors and
require criminal defendants, many
of whom are employed, to be in
court for several hours; and
Whereas, the Housing Court currently employs magistrates to assist
with the civil docket; and
Whereas, magistrates are experienced,
licensed
attorneys
who
review case files, conduct trials, and
recommend decisions to the judge;
and
Whereas, the judge must approve
each
magistrate
recommendation
before the recommendation becomes
the final decision of the court; and
Whereas, the magistrates in the
Housing Court currently by law
have a very limited ability to participate in the criminal cases before
the court; and
Whereas, in many courts in other
municipalities,
judges
assign
greater responsibility to the magistrates for standard criminal matters,
thereby freeing up the judges to
address more complex matters and
cases having greater community
impact; and
Whereas, in all cases, the judge
will be the party responsible making the decision whether or not to
refer a matter to magistrate; and
Whereas, the state legislature is
currently
considering
legislation
that would enable magistrates to
provide judges with more assistance
in criminal cases such as permitting
them to conduct the arraignment,
trial and sentencing, with all decisions of the magistrates becoming
final only upon review and approval
by the judge;
Now, therefore, be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland, for the reasons
stated in the preambles to this Resolution, supports passage of state
legislation empowering the Judge of
the Housing Division of the Cleve-

414

March 25, 1998
land Municipal Court to refer criminal cases to the Housing Division
magistrates for arraignment, trial
and sentencing, with the decision
whether to refer a matter to a magistrate still resting with the Judge,
and with all decisions of the magistrates becoming final only upon
review and approval by the Judge
of the Housing Division.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council transmit copies of this resolution
to members of the Ohio legislature
representing the City of Cleveland.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and b in force from
and after the earliest period allowed
by law.
Adopted March 16, 1998.
Awaiting approval or disapproval
of the Mayor.
Res. No. 481-98.
By Councilman Dolan.
An emergency resolution withdrawing objection to the transfer
of ownership of a C1 and C2
Liquor Permit to 15239 Triskett
Ave., and repealing Res. No. 152197, objecting to said transfer of
ownership.
Whereas, this Council objected to
the transfer of ownership of a C1
and C2 Liquor Permit to 15239
Triskett Ave., by Res. No. 1521-97,
adopted August 13, 1997; and
Whereas, this Council wishes to
withdraw its objection to the above
transfer of ownership and consents
to said transfer of ownership; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That objection to the
transfer of ownership of a C1 and
C2 Liquor Permit to 15239 Triskett
Ave., be and the same is hereby
withdrawn and Res. No. 1521-97,
containing said objection, be and
the same is hereby repealed and
that this Council consents to the
immediate
transfer
ownership
thereof.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted March 16, 1998.
Awaiting approval or disapproval
of the Mayor.
Res. No. 482-98.
By Councilman Robinson.
An emergency resolution objecting to the issuance of a C1 Liquor
Permit to 11703 Union Ave.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Director of Liquor Control
of
an
application
for
the
issuance of a C1 Liquor Permit, to
Permit No. 9154910, Union Discount
Inc., DBA Union Discount, 11703
Union Ave., Cleveland, Ohio 44105;
and

March 25, 1998
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, safety
and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of
notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby
record
its
objection
to
the
issuance of a C1 Liquor Permit, to
Permit No. 9154910, Union Discount
Inc., DBA Union Discount, 11703
Union Ave., Cleveland, Ohio 44105,
and requests the Director of Liquor
Control to set a hearing for said
application in accordance with provisions of Section 4303.26 of the
Revised Code of Ohio.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby is directed to
transmit two certified copies of this
resolution, together with two copies
of a letter of objection and two
copies of a letter requesting that the
hearing be held in Cleveland, Cuyahoga County.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted March 16, 1998.
Awaiting approval or disapproval
of the Mayor.
