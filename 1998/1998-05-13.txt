An emergency resolution requesting that the Ohio General Assembly
oppose
a
consumer
bailout
of
FirstEnergy as part of the state’s
plan to open up the electric utility
industry to competition.
Whereas, affordably priced electric service is essential to the
health, safety and economic wellbeing of all Ohioans; and
Whereas, northern Ohio electric
ratepayers have been paying some
of the highest rates for electricity
in the United States for decades
because of utility investments in
nuclear power plants; and
Whereas, northern Ohio electric
consumers currently pay rates that
are thirty to fifty percent higher
than customers of other Ohio utilities, presenting a significant economic disadvantage to the region’s
residential and business customers;
and
Whereas, the Ohio General Assembly is considering proposals to bring
customer choice to the electric utility industry, which will affect the
cost of electricity; and
Whereas, legislation now pending
in the Ohio General Assembly, S.B.
237 and H.B. 732, would force northern Ohio residential and small business customers to continue to pay
for utilities’ nuclear power plant
investments (stranded costs) once
competition is introduced; and
Whereas, full recovery of stranded costs would cost the average
FirstEnergy customer at least $1,618
over a five-year period;
Now, therefore, be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That electric utility
competition in Ohio must not penalize ratepayers or taxpayers by forcing them to bail out utilities’ past
bad investments (stranded costs).
Section 2. That electric utility
competition in Ohio must result in
immediate
and
significant
price
reductions for all northern Ohio customers, including residential and
small businesses.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council be and she is hereby directed to
transmit certified copies of this resolution to Governor George Voinovich, Ohio Senate President Richard
Finan, Ohio House Speaker Jo Ann
Davidson, and State Representative
Troy Lee James and State Senator
C.J. Prentiss.
