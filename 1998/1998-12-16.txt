the Administration to institute a
civil lawsuit against firearm manufacturers.
Whereas, firearms are the weapons
most commonly used in homicides in
this country and are involved in the
deaths of approximately 34,000 persons each year; and
Whereas, firearms were used to
commit 69% of all homicides in this
country in 1995 and 68% of all homicides in 1996; and
Whereas, in 1990, 82% of all homicides of persons aged 15-19 were
committed with firearms and homicide is the second leading cause of
deaths for youths aged 15-19; and
Whereas, firearm manufacturers,
knowingly
design,
manufacture,
market, and distribute thousands of
firearms in order to facilitate their
entry into and possession in Cleveland and other cities, where they
are often used in the commission of
crimes, including crimes in which
residents of Cleveland are killed,
maimed or terrorized; and
Whereas, the cities of Chicago
and New Orleans have instituted
civil lawsuits against firearm manufacturers under public nuisance
and product liability theories; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation

liability or other appropriate legal

An emergency resolution urging
awareness, education, training and
funding to stop the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
Whereas, the HIV/AIDS epidemic
is one of the most important public
health issues in the world; and
Whereas, HIV, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, is a virus that is
transmitted from person to person
through the direct exchange of
blood, semen, vaginal fluids and
breast milk. This virus gradually
weakens and eventually destroys
the body’s immune system; and
Whereas, the latency period from
the HIV infection to full blown
AIDS is approximately 12 years and
continues to increase; and
Whereas, AIDS, Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, is a medical
condition in which an individual
meets a series of diagnostic criteria
established by the Centers for Disease Control; such criteria include:
the
individual
is
HIV
Positive
(HIV+); has a white blood cell
count at below 200; and suffers from
a disease or secondary infection
defined by the CDC; and
Whereas, an individual infected
with HIV or AIDS can infect another
person
through
the
direct
exchange of blood, semen, vaginal
fluids and breast milk; and
Whereas, a person inflicted with
HIV or AIDS can look and feel perfectly healthy with no outward
signs of the illness; and
Whereas, the number of people
who
are
HIV+
are
currently
unknown, but that the number is
many times greater than the number of reported cases of AIDS; and
Whereas, the World Health Organization estimates the existence of
approximately 37 million cases of
HIV globally as of mid-1998; and
Whereas, the Centers for Disease
Control report 641,086 cumulative
cases of AIDS in the United States,
of which an estimated 250,394 are
alive and living with AIDS; and
Whereas, the Ohio Department of
Health has conservatively estimated
18,000 cases of HIV in Ohio; and
Whereas, the number of reported
cases of AIDS in Ohio is 9,565; and
Whereas, the Ohio Department of
Health has conservatively estimated
that 4,500 HIV+ people live in Cuyahoga County; and
Whereas, there are 2,783 reported
AIDS cases in the Cuyahoga region,
comprised of Cuyahoga, Ashtabula,
Geauga, Lake, Lorain and Medina
counties; and
Whereas, the Cuyahoga County
Region accounts for 29% of the
AIDS cases on Ohio; and
Whereas,
in
1995,
Cleveland
became an AIDS Tier One City and
the City of Cleveland’s Department
of Public Health declared a State of
Emergency in Cleveland; and
Whereas, the epidemiological profile of AIDS cases in Cuyahoga
County reports that males represent
approximately 83% of the cases and
females account for slightly more

2087

29
than 15% of the total AIDS cases
known to exist in 1997; and
Whereas, most new cases of HIV
infection in women resulted from
heterosexual contact; and
Whereas, an estimated 1,205 of the
reported AIDS cases in Cuyahoga
County are residents in the City of
Cleveland; and
Whereas, there is a disproportionate percentage of minorities living
with AIDS in Cleveland. Of the
AIDS cases in Cleveland, 68% are
African American, although they
represent only 41% of the population; 11% are Hispanic, although
they represent only 5% of the population of the City; and
Whereas, the Centers for Disease
Control and other experts say the
most effective method to stop the
HIV/AIDS epidemic is through prevention; and
Whereas, the Cleveland City Council’s Public Health Committee is
committed to the goal of stopping
the spread of HIV/AIDS; and
Whereas, the Public Health Committee is committed to bringing services and prevention education to
all segments of the population of
Cleveland; and
Whereas, no one is immune from
HIV/AIDS and no one has been
cured of HIV/AIDS; and
Whereas, the only way not to die
of AIDS is not to become infected
with HIV; now, therefore;
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland recommends that
the federal, state and local governments of the United States incorporate a prevention policy into all programs and grants that impact people
with
HIV/AIDS.
Prevention
should be incorporated into every
education and health and human
services program funded by all levels of government.
Section 2. That the Council urges
the elimination of discrimination in
housing against people living with
HIV/AIDS. Cuyahoga Metropolitan
Housing Authority and other low
income housing agencies are encouraged to work with the AIDS Housing Council to offer vouchers and
housing opportunities to people living with HIV/AIDS. Further, the
City of Cleveland is urged to conduct a study to project the housing
needs for people with HIV/AIDS in
the next five years and to develop
the capacity to meet that need; and
that the addition of direct services,
such as alcohol and substance addiction programs and intervention services, should be incorporated in the
housing programs for people with
HIV/AIDS.
Section 3. That the Council recommends that the State of Ohio
Board of Education adopt a policy
of health education for all students
for at least one semester each year
of education (K- 12); that the types
of courses taught reflect current,
critical public health issues; that the
students are taught basic living
instruction from proper hygiene and
nutrition to sex education and the
prevention of communicable diseases such as Sexually Transmitted
Disease (STDs) and HIV/AIDS.
Section 4. That the Council urges
the Cuyahoga County Juvenile Court
system to adopt a program to educate the youth that go through the
system on basic living instruction
from proper hygiene and nutrition
to sex education and the prevention
of communicable diseases such as
Sexually
Transmitted
Disease
(STDs) and HIV/AIDS. Further, all
youth that utilize the Juvenile Court
System in any capacity should be
instructed
through
a
mandatory
HIV/AIDS prevention program.

30
Section 5. That the Council recommends that the State of Ohio
mandate the reporting of HIV cases
and that such reporting be standard
throughout the state and should be
consistent with the Federal guidelines set forth by the Centers for
Disease Control. Reporting should
be done in age brackets, modes of
transmission and race and ethnicity
categories consistent with the Federal guidelines set forth by the Centers for Disease Control.
Section 6. That the Council seek
and encourage the representation of
Council on committees that fund or
review performances of agencies
and HIV/AIDS service providers
that provide services in the City of
Cleveland.
Section 7. That the Council strongly recommends that all social service agencies funded by the City of
Cleveland have at least one staff
person who is trained in HIV/AIDS
prevention and education.
Section 8. That the Council recommends and encourages the implementation within the City of a uniform reporting system to determine
the effectiveness and efficiency of
the City’s overall goal to stop the
spread of HIV/AIDS and urges the
hiring of an independent evaluator
to document and monitor this reporting system.
Section 9. That the Council urges
that a review of all federal, state
and local laws be done to determine
whether there is any impediment to
developing or creating an effective
policy towards the eradication of
the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
Section 10. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to transmit
