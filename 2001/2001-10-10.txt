VETO
File No. 1787-01-A.
September 26, 2001
The Honorable Bill Patmon
City Hall
601 Lakeside Ave.
Cleveland, Ohio 44113
Dear Councilman Patmon:
This letter serves to notify you
that I am vetoing Ordinance No.
1787-01, which you introduced and
passed under suspension with no
public input at the September 17,
2001 City Council meeting. This ordinance seeks to amend the new
boundary lines originally passed by
City Council on June 11, 2001 as part
of the census driven citywide ward
boundary realignment. This unannounced legislation was passed only
two weeks before the City’s primary elections on October 2, 2001.
The comprehensive new boundary
lines passed early this summer were
the culmination of months of detailed consultations between City
Council consultants and individual
Council Members designed to assure
ample time for the consideration of
all relevant factors before implementing the new ward boundaries.
Thus, more than three months after
the new comprehensive ward boundary changes were agreed upon and
passed unanimously by City Council,
your proposal to revise the boundary of Ward 8 in the midst of City
Council elections raises serious concerns and objections that necessitate a veto. The reasons for this
veto are threefold:
First, Ordinance No. 1787-01 would
cause unacceptable havoc and confusion in the Ward 7 and 8 Council
elections. State law prohibits the
Board of Elections from establishing
new precincts if the precinct boundaries are altered 25 days before a
primary or general election. As
there are less than 14 days, and
counting, until the primary election,
the residents affected by this ordinance would find themselves in a
situation in which they would be
residents of Ward 7 but voters in
Ward 8 precincts for Ward 8 candidates. The dubious timing of this
ordinance would thus create an
unjustifiable electoral aberration at
the expense of hundreds of residents
who deserve the right to vote for
City
Council
candidates
in
the
wards in which they live.
Second, this ordinance would disenfranchise hundreds of voters by
changing the boundary lines of
Ward 8 less than two weeks before
the primary election. These voters,

4
many of whom have been residents
of Ward 8 for upwards of ten years,
would now be switched into Ward 7
under a cloak of darkness. With less
than two weeks remaining before
the primary election, the great
majority of these voters would
remain unaware of their new status
and of their options for Council person until they arrived at the polls.
In fact, this late and sudden change
may place their status with the
Board of Elections in limbo, preventing them from having an opportunity to vote during the primary.
Third, this ordinance debases the
democratic principle of free and fair
elections. Our democratic process,
while largely protected by law and
government institutions, also critically depends on its participants to
act in good faith to uphold the spirit of the process. Elections free from
suspicions of corrupting influences
are the base upon which all else is
built in our society; indeed, America’s visceral understanding of the
need to defend the sanctity of elections from manipulation is perhaps
the key element of our country’s
success as a democracy. Your introduction and passage under suspension of Ordinance No. 1787-01 less
than two weeks before the City
Council primary elections not only
betrays a fundamental disregard for
this principle of the democratic
process, it reeks of underhanded
scheming and back room dealing
intended
to
influence
the
vote
turnout in your ward.
As you may be aware, another
ward boundary change ordinance
was passed on September 17, 2001.
This legislation, Ordinance No. 178901, proposes an amendment to correct an error in a Ward 13 and 14
boundary change passed last August
that severed a portion of Ward 14
from the rest of the ward. Ordinance
No. 1789-01 is fundamentally different from Ordinance 1787-01 for several reasons, and therefore will not
be vetoed.
First, Ordinance No. 1789-01 proposes a minor boundary change that
would remedy the current Charter
violation of the Ward 14 boundary.
The boundary change ordinance
passed in August, which was drafted by City Council, contained an
error in the legal description of the
ward boundary that severed a portion of Ward 14 from the rest of the
word. As the City Charter prohibits
incongruous ward boundaries, this
amendment is needed to bring the
ward boundary back into compliance.
Second, although the timing of
this ordinance is unfortunate, there
will be no practical impact on the
election in this case, as no residents
or precincts will be switched to
another ward. Thus, there is no
potential to place the integrity of
the election in jeopardy, as the voting status of all Ward 13 and 14 residents will remain the same. In addition, except for this small boundary
alteration, the substance of the
boundary change intended by the
Ward 13 and 14 Councilmen was
introduced and passed with ample
time before the coming election.
In this case then, a no veto prevents the Ward 14 election from taking place with a ward boundary in
violation of the City Charter, and
allows a boundary change made in
the spirit of good government and
the democratic process. Ordinance
No. 1789-01 will be allowed to take
effect without my signature.

The City Record
In regard to Ordinance No. 1787-01,
our Founding Father’s bestowed
upon us a model of government that
provides for checks and balances so
that a government as a whole may
have pause to consider the true ramifications of a decision before it
becomes final. In this instance, I
must exercise my obligation to prevent your effort to pass an ordinance that short changes hundreds
of voters, gives no consideration to
the pragmatics of staging a proper
election, and that has overwhelming
potential to directly influence the
outcome of an impending election in
which you stand as a candidate. I
hereby veto Ordinance No. 1787-01.
Sincerely,
MICHAEL R. WHITE
Mayor
Received.

Enterprise would be at a competitive disadvantage by operating at
this location; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure in that

City of Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Director of

Avenue; said abatement shall be
subject to annual review of the Tax
Incentive Review Council.
Section 3. That the terms of said
tax abatement shall be in accordance with the terms as set forth in
the Summary contained in File No.

Law shall prepare and approve said

hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
