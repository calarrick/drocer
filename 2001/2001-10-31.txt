supporting the governor’s compromise which gives Ohio’s Health District Advisory Councils the option of
overriding any smoking ban passed
by the local health boards.
Whereas, state representatives are
threatening to pass a bill which
would cause local health boards to
win approval of the local city council where said health boards recommend elimination of smoking in
restaurants or other public places;
and
Whereas, such a bill would make
it harder for local health boards to
ban smoking in public places; and
Whereas, gaining the approval of
local city councils is extremely difficult if not impossible; and

The City Record
Whereas,
Governor
Taft
has
threatened to veto the bill, but state
representatives want to override
any veto; and
Whereas, Governor Taft has proposed a compromise wherein Ohio’s
Health District Advisory Councils
may override any smoking ban
passed by local health boards; and
Whereas,
such
a
compromise
makes
the
health
boards
more
accountable in that the Health District Advisory Councils would help
determine impact on restaurants,
bars
and
other
establishments
before allowing smoking bans; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports Governor Taft in his opposition to making health boards obtain
city council approval before banning
smoking in public places and further supports the governor’s compromise which gives Ohio’s Health
District
Advisory
Councils
the
option of overriding any smoking
ban passed by the local health
boards.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
Governor Bob Taft and the leaders
of the Ohio House of Representatives.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

An emergency resolution opposing
House Bill 191 which provides that
a municipality which collects over
$100 million in annual income tax
receipts give back to each commuter’s place of residence 25% of
the income tax paid to the central
city.
Whereas, pending House Bill 191
provides that a municipality which
collects over $100 million in annual
income tax receipts must return to
the commuter’s place of residence
25% of the income tax paid to the
central city; and
Whereas,
Columbus,
Dayton,
Cleveland, Toledo and Cincinnati
are cities that would be affected by
such a bill; and
Whereas, initial estimates say
that this would reduce the income
tax receipts in Columbus, Dayton,
Cleveland, Toledo and Cincinnati by
8 to 18%; and
Whereas, if H.B. 191 passes, the
above cities could have to lay off
police and fire personnel, and stop
other day-to-day city services that
would impact the safety, health and
welfare of the citizens of such
cities; and
Whereas, if H.B. 191 passes, the
above cities’ budgets would be
reduced so drastically as to cause
irreversible economic downturns in
the regions of those cities; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes House Bill 191 which provides
that a municipality which collects

tax receipts give back to each commuter’s place of residence 25% of

Res. No. 2054-01.
By Councilmen Reed and Jones.
An emergency resolution opposing
House Bill 258 which provides that
no municipal employee may be
required to live in any specific area
of the state.
Whereas, pending House Bill 258
provides that no municipal employee may be required to live in any
specific area of the state; and
Whereas, if passed, House Bill 258
would overturn all charters, ordinances,
civil
service
policies,
employment contracts and collective
bargaining agreements which contain provisions causing employees
to live in certain areas; and
Whereas, House Bill 258 overturns
local voter decisions and local personnel decisions and would open the
door for abuse by state representatives; and
Whereas, this bill purports to
eliminate the ability of local governments
to
set
conditions
of
employment for municipal employees; and
Whereas, further, this bill overturns the decisions of local governments, local voters and local unions
without the agreement of such bodies; and
Whereas, this bill is bad public
policy in that it would eliminate
future ability on the part of local
voters and local governments to
determine for themselves certain
conditions of employment for municipal employees; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,

the City of Cleveland:

Section 670B.06 Inspection; Enforcement; Removal Orders; License
and Permit Suspension and Revocation; Appeal
(a) It shall be the responsibility
of the Commissioner to perform an
annual inspection of all pay telephones that are installed on private
property and in the right-of-way in
the City, to ensure that they are in
compliance with this Chapter. The
Commissioner will provide a report
to the Director listing all pay telephones not in compliance with this
Chapter, the owners of such telephones, and the owners of the properties where such telephones are
located.
(b) Any owner of a pay telephone
who is not in compliance with this
Chapter shall be notified in writing
by the Commissioner of the violation, a copy of which shall be sent
to the property owner where such
violations exist. The owner of the
pay telephone must correct the violations within five (5) business
days of the mailing of such notice.
If the owner fails to correct the violations within the time required, the
Commissioner may order the telephone removed, and the license or
permit of the owner suspended,
until all violations are corrected, or
revoked.
(c) An order of removal, or license
or permit suspension or revocation,
shall be sent in writing to the pay
telephone owner, and a copy shall
be sent to the property owner where
such violations exist. The City may
remove the phone within five (5)
business days of the mailing of such
notice, at the owner’s expense. The
owner shall reimburse the City for
the cost of removing and storing the
telephone before the owner may
reclaim the telephone. Such costs
shall also include the cost of removing any installation ancillary to the
outdoor pay telephone and the cost
of restoring the public right-of-way
to its original condition.
(d) An owner may appeal a violation notice, a removal order, or an
order of suspension or revocation to
the Board of Zoning Appeals within
14 days of the date of receipt of the
notice or order. The Board shall
promptly notify the Clerk of Council of any appeal and of the hearing date. The Board shall hear the
appeal within 14 days after the
appeal is filed, and the Board shall
issue a decision within 14 days after
the conclusion of the hearing. No
notice of the hearing is required to
be provided to adjoining property
owners.
(e) If the license, contract or permit of an owner is suspended or
revoked, the owner must remove all
telephones installed pursuant to that
license, contract or permit, and the
owner may not install any more telephones until the suspension is lifted
or a new license or permit is issued
or contract is executed. An appeal
to the Board of Zoning Appeals of
a removal order, or of a suspension
or
revocation,
shall
stay
such
removal order.
(f) If an owner’s license, contract
or permit is revoked, the owner
must apply for a new license, contract or permit and pay all fees
required for a license or permit
prior to the installation of any telephone. After the revocation of a
permit, the owner may not reapply
for a permit for the same location
for one year after the date the

October 31, 2001
revocation is effective and after
the conclusion of any appeal therefrom.
(g) If an owner does not comply
with an order to correct a violation
of the requirements to maintain a
telephone clean or free of graffiti,
stickers or advertising within five
(5) business days from the mailing
of such an order, the Commissioner
may take action necessary to clean
or
remove
graffiti,
stickers or
advertising from the telephone at
the owner’s expense. The owner
shall reimburse the City for such
expenses.
Section 670B.07 Public Nuisance;
Removal
of
Outdoor
Pay
Telephones
(a) Upon request in writing by
the member of Council in whose
ward an outdoor pay telephone is
located in the right-of-way or on private property, or upon receipt of verbal or written citizen complaints
concerning such an outdoor pay
telephone, the Director of Public
Safety shall conduct an investigation into whether the installation
and maintenance of the outdoor pay
telephone constitutes a public nuisance. Upon determination by the
Director of Public Safety that a particular outdoor pay telephone constitutes a public nuisance, the Director shall order that special telephone service features as are acceptable to the Director shall be provided by the outdoor pay telephone
or, if the Director determines it is
necessary, that the telephone be
removed. Nothing in this Section
shall preclude the Director from
ordering the removal of a telephone
without first requiring the implementation of special features. A particular outdoor pay telephone shall
constitute a public nuisance when
the Director of Public Safety determines that one or more of the following conditions exist:
(1) The outdoor pay telephone has
been used in the commission of illegal drug transactions or other criminal activity, or substantially contributes by its presence to the commission of illegal drug transactions
or other criminal activity as evidenced by significant numbers of
such crimes occurring in the vicinity of the telephone;
(2) The existence of the outdoor
pay telephone has substantially contributed by its presence to the congregation of persons who have made
loud noises and other disturbances
that have disrupted persons residing
near the telephone or disrupted business enterprises located near the
telephone;
(3) The existence of the outdoor
pay telephone has substantially contributed by its presence to the congregation
of
persons
consuming
alcoholic beverages, except where
such consumption is expressly authorized by a state license, or consuming illegal or controlled substances;
(4) The existence of the outdoor
pay telephone has substantially contributed by its presence to the congregation of persons who have interfered with pedestrian or vehicular
traffic in the public right-of-way
near the telephone;
(5) Usage of the outdoor pay telephone between the hours of 1:00 a.m.
and 5:00 a.m. is significantly and
repeatedly above normal usage for
similarly situated outdoor pay telephones during the same hours so as

The City Record
to indicate that the telephone is
being used in the commission of illegal drug activity or other criminal
activity;
(6) The pay telephone has been
used to abuse the 911 system.
(b) The special features shall be
instituted,
or
the
owner
shall
remove the telephone, and restore
the right-of-way to its original condition, if applicable, within five
(5) business days of an order to
institute special features or remove the telephone. Removal of a
nuisance pay telephone shall be
governed by the provisions of Section 670B.06.
(c) If the Director determines that
the nuisance may be abated by the
reduction in the total number of pay
telephones in an area, the removal
of pay telephones shall be ordered
based upon the total period of time
that a telephone has been permitted
by the City, with the telephones permitted for the least amount of time
being ordered removed first.
(d) The Director of Public Safety
will inform in writing the member
of Council who made the complaint
regarding the pay telephone the
result of such investigation and the
Director shall notify the member in
writing of any order issued by the
Director.
(e) If an outdoor pay telephone
has been removed from a location
because it is a nuisance, no other
pay telephone may be installed at
the same location or within 500 feet
of that location for a minimum of
one year.
(f) The owner of an outdoor pay
telephone may appeal from the
determination of a nuisance and the
order of special features or removal
as set forth in Section 670B.06.
Section 670B.08 PUCO Regulations
Nothing in this Chapter shall be
read so as to limit the authority of
the PUCO to regulate outdoor pay
telephones within the City of Cleveland,
nor
to conflict with the
authority of the PUCO to approve
any special services for pay telephones.
Section 670B.99 Penalty
Any owner as defined in this
Chapter, or any owner, lessee, or person in possession or control of private property where an outdoor pay
telephone is or has been located,
who violated any part of this Chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor
and fined one hundred ($100.00) dollars for a first offense and five hundred dollars ($500.00) for a second or
subsequent offense. Each day that a
violation occurs or continues constitutes a separate offense.
Section 3. That the contracts for
pay telephones in the right-of-way

section is enacted by this ordinance,
shall be in the form as set forth in
File No. 1989-01-A on file with the
