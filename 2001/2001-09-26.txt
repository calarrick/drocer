Res. No. 1771-01.
By Councilmen Westbrook and
Cimperman.
An emergency resolution declaring September 14, 2001 “Literacy
Day” in the City of Cleveland and
commending literacy organizations
throughout the city for their ongoing efforts to create a community of
readers.
Whereas, the ability to read is recognized as one of the primary building blocks of a happy and successful life; and a love of reading can
enrich one’s life by providing the
mind with countless new vistas and
ideas; and
Whereas, the month of September
has been designated National Literacy Month, providing an opportunity for all concerned citizens to
reflect on the state of literacy in the
City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, the Plain Dealer recently
reported that 66% of Cleveland fourth
graders and 40% of fourth graders
statewide would have been held back
this year if they had been forced to
meet the state’s “reading guarantee,”
and in Cuyahoga County alone, 18 out
of 31 school districts showed a
decline in reading scores; and
Whereas, this problem is complicated by the lack of literacy skills
reflected
among
Cleveland
residents; for example, 41% of adults in
Cleveland do not have a high school
diploma, and only one in three
ninth-graders graduate; and
Whereas,
low
literacy
rates
impact crime rates, with 85% of all
juvenile offenders exhibiting reading deficiencies; and
Whereas, the above challenges
can be met only through a concerted and focused effort within the
Greater Cleveland community, as
demonstrated
by
the
Cleveland
Reads coalition of literacy organizations, with programs at over 200
sites throughout the city; and
Whereas, such coalitions unite
local
efforts,
and
by
working
beyond the boundaries of any one
institution, strengthen and enhance
direct literacy services through the
provision of research and development, advocacy, and network building; now, therefore,
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland recognizes September 14, 2001 as “Literacy Day” in
the City of Cleveland, and commends Cleveland Reads and its
member
organizations
for
their
ongoing work to improve the quality of life by promoting literacy
efforts and community involvement.
Section
2.
That
this
Council
encourages the residents of the City
to contribute their time, resources
and expertise to the literacy efforts
within their own neighborhoods and
communities.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Jones.
An emergency resolution urging
the President and members of Congress to support legislation that will
provide immediate federal funding

to such terrorist activities, commending City employees, especially

all their hard work of last week,

nation must have the support of all
Americans in the pursuit of those
who are responsible for the attacks
of last Tuesday, and of the eradication of terrorism in this country; and
