Res. No. 1245-01.
By Councilmen Willis and Jackson.
An emergency resolution urging
the Federal, State and local agencies to conduct an investigation of
Government Lien Service and the
conduct of its business in the City
of Cleveland.

The City Record

of Cleveland seeks to request an

respect to this property; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that any result of an
investigation of Government Lien
Service and the conduct of its business will benefit Cleveland residents; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Federal, State and local government to conduct an investigation of
Government Lien Service and its

By Councilmen Polensek, Dolan,
Patmon, Sweeney, Rybka, Brady and
Jones.
An emergency resolution urging
the President and members of Congress to support legislation that will
provide immediate federal funding
relief for commercial airlines.
Whereas, the monumental loss of
revenue and increases in costs associated with the tragic events of September 11, 2001 have placed the
entire commercial aviation industry
in severe financial peril, with a loss
of over $1 billion in the three day
period in which the carriers were
grounded; and
Whereas, a 50% reduction in revenue is anticipated over the next
three months; this reduction in revenue is anticipated to amount to $17
billion by the end of the year; and
Whereas, the commercial airline
industry is projecting that initial
employee
layoff’s
could
exceed
100,000 jobs; and
Whereas, as a hub to Continental
Airlines, Cleveland is deeply concerned about the severe negative
impact
that
the
schedule
and
employee reductions may have on
Cleveland’s economy and that of the
Northeast Ohio region; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
joins with Gordon Bethune, Continental chairman and chief executive officer, in calling on the President and members of Congress to
take immediate action to restore
stability to the airline industry and
urges the federal government to
take all necessary steps to assist
the airlines in this difficult time,
now, therefore

Be it resolved by the Council of

copy of this resolution to President
Bush, members of the Ohio congressional
delegation
and
Gordon
Bethune, Chairman and CEO of Continental Airlines.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives

An
emergency
resolution
condemning last Tuesday’s terrorist
attacks on the United States of
America, supporting the President
of the United States in the response
to such terrorist activities, commending City employees, especially
fire fighters and police officers, for
all their hard work of last week,
condemning the damage done to the
Islamic Center in Parma and urging
calm and tolerance from all Americans during this time of trouble.
Whereas, on September 11, 2001,
this nation experienced a tragedy of
such magnitude the likes of which
we have never seen before; and
Whereas, the President of the
United States and the leaders of this
nation must have the support of all
Americans in the pursuit of those
who are responsible for the attacks
of last Tuesday, and of the eradication of terrorism in this country; and
Whereas, City employees, especially the fire fighters and police
officers, worked very hard last
week to help alleviate fears in the
City and to ensure the safety of
Cleveland’s citizens; and
Whereas, the damage done to the
Islamic Center in Parma was apparently a result of ignorance of the
Islamic religion and anger about the
tragic events of last week; and
Whereas, in these troubled times,
there is no room for intolerance or
bigotry and we as Americans must
respect all peoples of different
nationalities and religions; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby condemns last Tuesday’s terrorist attacks on the United States of
America, supports the President of
the United States in the response to
such terrorist activities, commends
City employees, especially fire fight-

An emergency resolution objecting to the transfer of ownership of

44103 to Permit No. 3554828, Naameh
Hammad, DBA White Front Market,
7819-21 Cedar Avenue, Cleveland,
Ohio 44103; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best
interests of the entire community;
and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to
Section 4303.26 of the Ohio Revised
Code. Council’s objection to said
permit must be received by the
Director of Liquor Control within
30 days of notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
