entrance from the Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage, one or both of the
following conditions apply.
A. The proposed use will occupy
an existing building that lacks such
pedestrian entrance, and the addition of a conforming pedestrian
entrance is made infeasible by the
configuration of the interior space
or other factors related to the
design and placement of the building.
B. Placement of the pedestrian
entrance in a location other than on
the
Pedestrian
Retail
Street
Frontage will result in more suitable pedestrian access.
(4) In the case of a proposed use
with more than forty (40) feet of
frontage along the Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage, the subject space
was designed for use at such size
and the proposed use, in the determination of the City Planning Commission,
will
not
have
adverse
impacts on the functioning of nearby pedestrian-oriented retail uses.
(5) In the case of an interior side
yard more than four (4) feet in
width and located within forty (40)
feet
of
a
Pedestrian
Retail
Frontage, the subject building will
be occupied by residential units
which require the greater side yard
area to allow for desirable levels of
light and air.
(g) Maximum Setbacks. Notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
the
underlying zoning district, properties in PRO Districts shall conform
to the following regulations with
respect to maximum setbacks.
(1) Front Street Yard. No main
building on a lot abutting a Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage shall be
set back more than five (5) feet
from the Pedestrian Retail Street
Frontage unless the City Planning
Commission has approved establishment of a surface parking lot in
such location as a Conditional Use.
Such building features as entrances
and display windows may be set
back up to an additional five (5)
feet as long as these features occupy no more than fifty percent (50%)
of the a building’s total frontage.
These setback regulations shall not
apply to portions of buildings above
the first-story level.
(2) Interior Side Yard. No portion
of an interior side yard located within forty (40) feet of a Pedestrian
Retail Street Frontage shall exceed
four (4) feet in width on the ground
floor level, unless the City Planning
Commission has approved a driveway or a residential side yard in
such location as a Conditional Use.
(3) Exceptions for Outdoor Cafes.
A building may be set back a maximum of fifteen (15) feet from the
Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage in
order to accommodate a permanent
outdoor café. If use of such café is
discontinued for a period of two (2)
years or more, the setback area
shall be landscaped or otherwise
improved in accordance with a plan
approved by the City Planning Commission.
(h) Window Areas. For any nonresidential building or storefront
facing a Pedestrian Retail Street
Frontage, not less than sixty percent (60%) of the front facade
between 2.5 and 7.5 feet in height
shall be composed of transparent
windows or doors. In addition, not
more
than
twenty-five
percent
(25%) of such window or door area

The City Record
on a building or storefront shall be
covered with permanent signs.
(i) Parking. In recognition of the
expected greater use of public transit, bicycles and walking by customers and employees traveling to
PRO Districts, the minimum number
of
parking
spaces
otherwise
required by the Zoning Code shall
be reduced by thirty-three percent
(33%) for retail business uses in
such districts. The Board of Zoning
Appeals may further reduce parking
requirements where it has been
demonstrated that additional parking is available in common or
shared parking facilities or in onstreet parking areas located within
a reasonable walking distance of
the use, given the nature of the use
and the district. The Board shall
also consider such factors as the
number of bicycle racks available in
proximity to a use. In making its
determination, the Board shall be
guided by an up-to-date analysis of
parking supply and demand and
other relevant factors submitted by
or on behalf of the applicant. The
City Planning Commission shall
maintain a file of all such parking
analyses submitted for properties in
each PRO District.
(j) Variances. The Board of Zoning Appeals may grant variances to
requirements of this section in
accordance with the applicable criteria stated in Chapter 329 of this
code.

of the City of Cleveland, provided
such violation may result in incarceration, for the Cleveland Municipal Court, for a period of six

Whereas, in Argersinger v. Hamlin and Scott v. Illinois, the United
States Supreme Court held that no
indigent criminal defendant may be
sentenced to a term of imprisonment
unless he has been afforded the
right to assistance of appointed
counsel in his defense; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
through the Cleveland Municipal
Court, is therefore obligated to provide an indigent defendant appointed counsel in order to permit the
imposition of a sentence including a
term of imprisonment; and

pursuant
to
Section
120.l4 of the Ohio Revised Code, a
county commission which has organized a county public defender commission may contract with any
municipal corporation within the
County served by the county public
defender to provide such legal representation on behalf of the municipal corporation; and
Whereas, it is the recommendation
of the Cleveland Municipal Court,
the district of which encompasses
Bratenahl and the City of Cleveland,
that such indigent defense should be
provided by the Cuyahoga County
Public Defender Commission, who
will in turn, enter into an agreement
with the Legal Aid Society of Cleveland to provide these services; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Director of
Finance, on behalf of the Cleveland
Municipal Court, is hereby authorized to enter into contract with the
Cuyahoga County Public Defender
Commission for legal services necessary to defend indigents charged
with violation of ordinances of the
City of Cleveland, provided such violation may result in incarceration,
for the period of six months beginning July 1, 2001, at an estimated
cost
of
$800,000,
with
two
(2)
options, exercisable by the Director
of Finance on behalf of the Cleveland Municipal Court, to renew for
an additional six-month term, and

The City Record
Res. No. 1101-01.
By Councilmen Lewis and Jones.
An emergency resolution opposing
the proposed Elective Alternative
Regulation Plan (“EARP”) rules
proposed by the PUCO, requesting
the PUCO to hold an additional public hearing at Cleveland City Hall
in the evening, and encouraging the
public to attend the public hearing
on June 22nd.
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland is concerned that the
Staff of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (“PUCO”) has proposed
new
rules
allowing
SBC
Ameritech and other local exchange
companies in Ohio to elect an “off
the shelf” alternative regulation
plan that will allow such companies
to double the rates for some services
like second and third phone lines
and basic Caller ID, and will allow
unlimited increases in rates for
packages of services that include
basic local telephone service, and
many other services that residential
consumers use everyday in their
homes, such as Call Waiting and
Call Forwarding, among many others, and that such increase would be
allowed without adequate notice to
consumers
or
any
oversight
or
approval by the PUCO; and
Whereas, the Council is concerned
that the PUCO is proposing to deregulate the prices of many phone services, and to allow Ameritech and
other phone companies to earn
excess profits without any controls,
even though there is no competition
in the residential telephone market
place, and no real choice for consumers; and
Whereas, this Council is deeply
concerned and disturbed that the
Chairman of the PUCO has stated
that telephone rates for every service except for a single basic service
line in the home should be allowed
to increase as high as the companies
want to raise them, because they are
not essential services,
and
consumers can simply choose not to buy
these services, despite the lack of
any competitor offering such services to consumers; and
Whereas, the proposed elective
Alternative Regulation Plan rules
would allow SBC Ameritech to abandon its existing PUCO-approved, and
heavily negotiated Alternative Regulation Plan, which does not expire
until 2003, and to choose the new
“off the shelf” Elective Alternative
Regulation Plan (“EARP”), which
could
throw
thousands
of
low
income customers off of their lifeline discount program, and could
otherwise
diminish
or
eliminate
many other commitments Ameritech
has made to the PUCO and consumers; and
Whereas, the proposed new rules
are unlawful and unnecessary, and
would harm rather than help consumers; and
Whereas,
the
PUCO
just
announced local public hearings,
including one hearing in Cleveland
in the afternoon, at the Lausche
State Office Tower, 2nd Floor Auditorium, 615 Superior Avenue, in
downtown Cleveland, at 2:00 p.m. on
Friday, June 22nd, and they will
provide an opportunity for the public to make their concerns about the
PUCO’s proposal known to the PUCO
Commissioners; now, therefore,

1159

65
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes the approval by the PUCO of the
proposed Elective Alternative Regulation Plan (“EARP”) Rules in Case
Nos. 00-1532-TP-COI, 99-563-TP-COI,
and 99-998-TP-COI, and urges the
PUCO to withdraw or disapprove the
rules, and instead to initiate a proceeding to determine the best way
to bring about real competition in
the provision of local phone service,
while fully protecting residential
consumers from higher prices for
services, before any further deregulation of rates and services is permitted.
Section
2.
That
this
Council
believes
that
a
public
hearing
should also be held in the evening
in Cleveland, to accommodate more
Cleveland-area citizens who cannot
attend a hearing during the work
day, and would welcome the PUCO
to hold such an evening hearing at
Cleveland City Hall in Council
Chambers, the site for numerous
PUCO public hearings in the past.
Section 3. That this Council urges
the citizens of Cleveland to attend
the public hearing in Cleveland to
voice their concerns about the proposed rules and their opposition to
allowing the phone company to
increase their rates without oversight or approval by the PUCO and
without any input from consumers.
Section 4. That upon approval, the
Clerk of City Council is hereby
directed to deliver a copy of this
Resolution to the Mayor, to the
City’s Law Director, and to the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio
(“PUCO”), to be filed on the public
record in Case Nos. 00-1532-TP-COI,
99-563-TP-COI, and 99-998-TP-COI.
Section 5. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period

and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has made a substantial investment
in youth and young adults from the

Camp; and
Whereas, the effectiveness of the
CCC program was recognized in September, 2000 when CCC was honored
by the U.S. Department of Labor as

and training programs in the nation;
and
Whereas, the governor of the
State of Ohio has proposed to eliminate the CCC program; and

Res. No. 315-01.
By Mayor White.
An emergency resolution supporting the introduction and passage of
legislation to provide tax benefits to
qualifying public utilities, corporations and entities who contribute to
certified
neighborhood
assistance
projects.
Whereas, the Mayor of the City of
Cleveland and Cleveland City Council are committed to neighborhood
revitalization and encourage public
and private partnerships that, with
the assistance of non-profit organizations, re-build City neighborhoods;
and
Whereas, State Senator Jeffrey
Armbruster has indicated that he
intends to introduce legislation that
would offer a tax benefit to qualifying public utilities, corporations
and entities that contribute to a certified neighborhood assistance project; and
Whereas, this legislation would
define certified neighborhood assistance projects as affordable housing
projects, community economic development projects, and community service projects operated by nonprofit
corporations; and
Whereas, affordable housing projects would assist in the construction and rehabilitation of affordable
housing; and

The City Record
Whereas,
community
economic
development projects would assist
in the development of child care
facilities, brownfield redevelopment,
storefront development, industrial
development and commercial development; and
Whereas, community service projects would assist in the provision
of community services to residents
of distressed areas or to low-income
families and such services may
include literacy initiatives, high
school equivalence diploma classes,
individual
development
account
workshops, homeless services, job
training,
neighborhood
planning,
housing
counseling,
emergency
housing assistance, and crime prevention; and
Whereas,
these
neighborhood
assistance projects will assist in the
rehabilitation of City of Cleveland
neighborhoods and provide services
that are vitally important to many
Cleveland residents; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health or safety in that the Mayor
of the City of Cleveland and the
Cleveland City Council believe that
the neighborhood assistance legislation proposed by State Senator
Jeffrey Armbruster will increase

life in the City’s neighborhoods,
now, therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Mayor of the
City of Cleveland and this Council
support the introduction and passage of legislation to provide tax

An emergency resolution to urge
the Congress of the United States,
and particularly the Greater Cleveland delegation, to act quickly to
uphold the democratic vote of the
D.C. City Council to maintain the
D.C. General Hospital as a public
hospital.
Whereas, the City Council of the
District of Columbia, voted unanimously on April 12, 2001, to maintain the D.C. General Hospital as a
public hospital, and to reject proposals to privatize the city’s health
care services; and
Whereas, D.C. General Hospital is
noted for providing life-saving services to the city’s poor, and stands
as a symbol of the struggles and
commitment of America’s urban hospitals to providing health care services to under-served minority communities, and to the under-and-uninsured; and
Whereas, the democratic decision
of the D.C. City Council, supported
by many prominent medical organizations, has been overturned by
actions of the D.C. Financial Control
Board, an entity created by the U.S.
Congress; and
Whereas, serious allegations have
been made, charging that the closing of D.C. Hospital is part of a real
estate development plan, designed
to pressure the poor, largely African
American residents of southeast D.C.
out of the city; and
Whereas, the saving of D.C. General Hospital is a national issue
touching on the General Welfare of

84
all the people, since the way a
nation treats its disadvantaged citizens, especially in its capital, is a
significant reflection on that nation’s character and morality, and
the power “to exercise exclusive
Legislation in all Cases whatsoever” over the District of Columbia, is
given by the U.S. Constitution to
the Congress as a whole; now,
therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council memorializes the Congress of the United
States,
particularly
the
Greater
Cleveland delegation, to act quickly
