giving the RTA police the ability to
issue tickets anywhere within the
City of Cleveland to vehicles parked
illegally in no parking bus stop

(a) Upon request in writing by
the member of Council in whose
ward an outdoor pay telephone is
located in the right-of-way or on private property, or upon receipt of verbal or written citizen complaints
concerning such an outdoor pay telephone, the Director of Public Safety
shall conduct an investigation into
whether the installation and maintenance of the outdoor pay telephone constitutes a public nuisance.
Upon determination by the Director
of Public Safety that a particular
outdoor pay telephone constitutes a
public nuisance, the Director shall
order that special telephone service
features as are acceptable to the
Director shall be provided by the
outdoor pay telephone or, if the
Director determines it is necessary,
that the telephone be removed. Nothing in this Section shall preclude the
Director from ordering the removal
of a telephone without first requiring the implementation of special
features. A particular outdoor pay
telephone shall constitute a public
nuisance when the Director of Public Safety determines that one or
more of the following conditions
exist:
(1) The outdoor pay telephone has
been used in the commission of illegal drug transactions or other criminal activity, or substantially contributes by its presence to the commission of illegal drug transactions
or other criminal activity as evidenced by significant numbers of
such crimes occurring in the vicinity of the telephone;
(2) The existence of the outdoor
pay telephone has substantially contributed by its presence to the congregation of persons who have made
loud noises and other disturbances
that have disrupted persons residing
near the telephone or disrupted business enterprises located near the
telephone;
(3) The existence of the outdoor
pay telephone has substantially contributed by its presence to the congregation
of
persons
consuming
alcoholic beverages, except where
such
consumption
is
expressly
authorized by a state license, or consuming illegal or controlled substances;
(4) The existence of the outdoor
pay telephone has substantially contributed by its presence to the congregation of persons who have interfered with pedestrian or vehicular
traffic in the public right-of-way
near the telephone;
(5) Usage of the outdoor pay telephone between the hours of 1:00 a.m.
and 5:00 a.m. is significantly and
repeatedly above normal usage for
similarly situated outdoor pay telephones during the same hours so as
to indicate that the telephone is
being used in the commission of illegal drug activity or other criminal
activity;
(6) The pay telephone has been
used to abuse the 911 system.
(b) The special features shall be
instituted,
or
the
owner
shall

The City Record
remove the telephone, and restore
the right-of-way to its original condition, if applicable, within five
(5) business days of an order to
institute special features or remove the telephone. Removal of a
nuisance pay telephone shall be
governed by the provisions of Section 670B.06.
(c) If the Director determines that
the nuisance may be abated by the
reduction in the total number of pay
telephones in an area, the removal
of pay telephones shall be ordered
based upon the total period of time
that a telephone has been permitted
by the City, with the telephones permitted for the least amount of time
being ordered removed first.
(d) The Director of Public Safety
will inform in writing the member
of Council who made the complaint
regarding the pay telephone the
result of such investigation and the
Director shall notify the member in
writing of any order issued by the
Director.
(e) If an outdoor pay telephone
has been removed from a location
because it is a nuisance, no other
pay telephone may be installed at
the same location or within 500 feet
of that location for a minimum of
one year.
(f) The owner of an outdoor pay
telephone may appeal from the
determination of a nuisance and the
order of special features or removal
as set forth in Section 670B.06.
Section 670B.08 PUCO Regulations
Nothing in this Chapter shall be
read so as to limit the authority of
the PUCO to regulate outdoor pay
telephones within the City of Cleveland,
nor
to conflict with the
authority of the PUCO to approve
any special services for pay telephones.
Section 670B.99 Penalty
Any owner as defined in this
Chapter, or any owner, lessee, or
person in possession or control of
private property where an outdoor
pay telephone is or has been located, who violated any part of this
Chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and fined one hundred
($100.00) dollars for a first offense
and five hundred dollars ($500.00)
for a second or subsequent offense.
Each day that a violation occurs or

Whereas,
due
to
the
horrific
events of September 11, 2001, cities
across the country, including Cleveland, have increased security measures; and

certain parking lot operators may
give consideration to raising their
parking rates for customers; and

such actions unconscionable and
urges
parking
lot
operators
to
refrain from price gouging; and

take advantage of the parking ban
imposed because of heightened security, then this Council would seek

By Councilman Jones.
An emergency resolution urging
and supporting the international
campaign to keep space for peace,
and to eliminate the use of spacebased military weapons, and welcoming the national conference on
keeping space for peace.
Whereas, the Bush Administration
is seeking to develop a space-based
weapons system, popularly known
as Star Wars, which will cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars; and
Whereas, the space-based program
would
be
completely
ineffective
against the kind of terrorist attack
that took place on September 11,
2001, and would draw needed funds
away from efforts to combat terrorism; and
Whereas, money is desperately
needed to rebuild the crumbling
infrastructure of our cities, to help
provide affordable health care, education, housing and other human
needs; and
Whereas, the citizenry of Cleveland and our nation should have
informed input into the priorities
our federal government sets; and
Whereas, this space-based program will violate the 1972 ABM
Treaty and can lead to more global
instability; and
Whereas, military planners prefer
nuclear devices be used in this
space weapons program, which can
cause environmental damage to our
planet; and
Whereas, there is no certainty
that such a space-based program
will work; and
Whereas, our nation and all of the
nations and peoples of the world
need to find avenues to resolve conflict without resorting to war, by
strengthening international institutions; and
Whereas, the people of Cleveland
and of the United States need to
learn more about this vital issue,
and to find out how they can
become involved in the growing
international
campaign
to
keep
space for peace; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland hereby welcomes
to Cleveland the national conference
on keeping space for peace, sponsored by Global Network Against
Weapons and Nuclear Power in
Space and Cleveland Peace Action
that was held on October 13, 2001 at
Cleveland State University.
Section 2. That it is the hope of
this Council that the exchange of
views that took place at this special
conference will lead to an increased
awareness on the part of participants from Cleveland and from
around the country on this vital
issue, which will affect the future
of all of us.
Section
3.
That
this
Council
strongly urges the citizens of Cleveland to become involved in the international campaign to keep space for
peace.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
