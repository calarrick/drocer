the occupants of the vehicle in
which the device was installed or
warning devices on authorized emergency vehicles or vehicles used solely for traffic purposes.
2. Add a New Section 14 to read
as follows:
“14. SOUND AMPLIFYING DEVICES
14.1 No person shall operate a
Sound Amplifying Device at such a
level that the sounds emanating
therefrom can be heard at a distance in excess of one hundred and
fifty (150) feet from the location of
said device, except when the Director or his designee determines that
allowing a sound amplifying device
to operate in excess of the limits
prescribed herein will not unreasonably damage or endanger the comfort, health, safety or welfare of the

made by considering the following
factors:
1. The nature and zoning of the
area of within which the noise
emanates;
2. The nearness of any residence
or residences;
3. The time of day the sound
amplifying device is operated;
4. The nature of the sound to be
produced, including but not limited
to, whether the sound will be
steady, intermittent, impulsive or
repetitive;
5. The level of sound to be generated by the special event;
6. Any actual conflict with other
scheduled events; and
7. Whether the type of sound to
be generated by the event is usual
or unusual for the location or area
for which an exemption is requested.”

These
amendments
shall
take
effect and be in force ten (10) days
after being published in the City

An emergency resolution approving Adelphia’s System Upgrade Plan
as presented in its Quarterly Upgrade Report submitted to Council
on May 30, 2001, and filed in File
No. 1269-01-A.
Whereas, the Council of the City of

Whereas, Section 1 (G) of said Ordinance requires that Adelphia complete an upgrade of the Cable System
in the City to a minimum of 860 MHZ
within thirty-two (32) months of the
completion of the transfer of the franchise to Adelphia or by June 1, 2003,

fact that the franchise was transferred effective November 25, 2000, the
effective date of Ordinance No. 17292000, Adelphia is required to complete

Franchise; now, therefore,

Res. No. 1271-01.
By Councilman Rybka.
An emergency resolution urging
an extended moratorium on any
additional dredgings being placed
on the Confined Disposal Facility
north of Gordon Park, known as
Dike 14, until a planning process
can be completed and other strategies for disposal are considered.

The City Record
Whereas, Dike 14, located north of
Gordon Park in Cleveland, is a Confined Disposal Facility (“CDF”) that
was built by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers for the disposal of dredging material from the Cuyahoga
River and the Port of Cleveland; and
Whereas, the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers ended its use of Dike 14
as a Confined Disposal Facility
when Cleveland’s new CDF, Dike
10B, located at Burke Lakefront Airport, opened in March of 1999; and
the closing of Dike 14 and the opening of Dike 10B by the Corps were
stipulated in the Final Environmen tal Impact Statement, Modifications
to Dike 14, September 1993, as the
actions that would make the 88-acre
Dike 14 available for State Park
use; and
Whereas, after the Army Corps
ended its use of Dike 14 as a CDF,
it turned the property over to the
Cleveland-Cuyahoga
County
Port
Authority pursuant to its agreement
with the Port Authority as the local
cooperating agency; and the intention of the City, the State and the
Port Authority has always been that
the property be turned over to the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) to become part of
the Lakefront State Park; and
Whereas, the Port Authority now
has expressed an intention to use
Dike 14 for private dredge disposal,
due to current apparent limitations
on the availability of Dike 10B
north of Burke Airport for such disposal; and
Whereas, Dike 14 has diverse
coastal wildlife habitats which have
ecological, educational and social
value that warrant protection; and
the wetlands, mudflats, grasslands,
shrub lands and woodlands of Dike
14 function as exceptional migratory bird stopover habitats, attracting
tens of thousands of birds each
year, with over 268 species of birds
documented at the site; and thus
Dike 14 is already a dynamic, yearround nature area and has the
potential, under the aegis of the
State, to provide exceptional educational, recreational and economic
benefits to Cleveland’s neighborhoods, to Cleveland’s 122 schools
and 77,000 school children, and to
Northeast Ohio’s residents and visitors of all ages; and
Whereas, flora and fauna surveys
of Dike 14 and a public planning
process are needed to determine
what kind of State Park use is best
for Dike 14; and
Whereas,
U.S.
Senator
George
Voinovich, in April and May of this
year; worked to procure the use of
Dike 10B north of Burke Lakefront
Airport for the deposit of 30,000
cubic yards of private dredge materials from LTV Steel Corporation,
rather than disposing of them at
Dike 14; and
Whereas, the Port Authority has
agreed to a moratorium on further
disposal of dredgings at Dike 14 for
at least 30 days, and an extended
moratorium is now needed to allow
for a planning process to be undertaken and for options for disposal of
the private dredgings to be considered; now therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port

1560

July 4, 2001
Authority to refrain from any and
all dredge disposal uses of Dike 14
until a planning process can be
undertaken and alternatives to the
disposal of private dredgings at
Dike 14 can be fully considered.
Section 2. That this Council urges
the Mayor and ODNR to initiate a
public planning process for Dike 14
to determine the best use of the land
for State park purposes.
Section 3. That this Council urges
ODNR to conduct flora and fauna surveys and other studies necessary to
determine the status of Dike 14 and
appropriate uses of the property.
Section 4. That this Council urges
the Mayor to refrain from issuing
any permits to the Port Authority or
anyone acting on its behalf for the
disposal of dredgings or any filling
and grading of Dike 14 until at least
the completion of studies and planning needed to protect the natural
state of the Dike and to protect the
site for public use.
Section 5. That this Council urges
the Port Authority, the Mayor and
ODNR, to arrange for the transfer of
the property known as Dike 14 to
the City or ODNR for eventual inclusion of the land in the Lakefront
State Park.
Section 6. That upon its passage
by City Council the Clerk of Council shall provide copies of this Resolution to the following: Mayor
White, Samuel W. Speck, Director,
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Scott Zody, Deputy Director,
Real Estate & Land Management,
Ohio
Department
of
Natural
Resources, Stephen L. Pfeiffer, Maritime Director, Cleveland-Cuyahoga
County Port Authority, the Director
of the Port Authority, the Board
members of the Port Authority, and
the Army Corps of Engineers.
Section 7. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

By Councilman Willis.
An emergency resolution strongly
supporting an educational system
that would provide adequate funding to ensure quality education for
our children and stating its opposition to retaining Kenneth Starr to
assist Ohio Attorney General Betty
Montgomery in advocating the position of the state before the Ohio
Supreme Court.
Whereas, education of our children is one of the primary duties
and responsibilities of our community, with such endeavor having a
long-term, palpable impact on all of
us; and
Whereas, there is a case currently
pending in the Ohio Supreme Court
that revolves around the issue of
appropriate methodology and sources
of funding for our public schools; and

July 4, 2001
Whereas, the Ohio Supreme Court
has twice ruled that the state’s
school funding system is unconstitutional, mainly because it relies too
heavily on local property taxes; and
Whereas, Ohio Attorney General
Betty Montgomery is charged with
advocating the position of the state
legislative leaders; and
Whereas, it has been reported that
the Ohio Attorney General is considering or has retained the services
of Kenneth Starr to assist her in
this matter; and
Whereas, this Council is opposed
to the hiring of Mr. Starr and
believes that there are a number of
qualified attorneys located in the
State of Ohio who could work cooperatively with the Ohio Attorney
General on this case; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes
an emergency measure providing for
the usual daily operation of a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
strongly supports an educational
system that would provide adequate
funding to ensure quality education
for our children and states that it is
opposed to retaining Kenneth Starr
to assist Ohio Attorney General
Betty Montgomery in advocating the
position of the state before the Ohio
Supreme Court.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby directed to transmit a copy of
this resolution to Ohio Attorney General Betty Montgomery and to Ohio
Governor Robert Taft.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
hereby supplemented by enacting
new Sections 346.01 through 346.11
thereof, to read as follows:

The City Record
Chapter 346
Live-Work Overlay Districts
Section 346.01 Purpose
The Live-Work Overlay (LWO)
District is established to permit and
promote shared occupancy by residential uses in combination with
work activities in suitable locations.
By
facilitating
establishment
of
such “live-work” space, the district
is intended to meet an identified
need for buildings that combine living space with work space. In addition, the district is intended to assist
in revitalizing areas impacted by
the presence of under-utilized and
deteriorated buildings suitable for
re-use as live-work space.
Section 346.02 Definitions
(a) “Live-Work Unit” means a
room or rooms used by a single
household both as a dwelling unit
and as a “Work Space,” as defined
herein, where such Work Space
occupies at least fifty percent (50%)
of the unit’s total floor area. The living space of a Live-Work unit shall
contain a kitchen area and sanitary
facilities.
(b) “Work Space” means an area
within a Live-Work Unit that is
designed or equipped exclusively or
principally for the conduct of work
activities and is to be regularly
used for such work activities by one
or more occupants of the unit.
Section 346.03 Mapping and Applicability
The LWO District shall be mapped
as an overlay district by an ordinance of Council, and shall be
mapped only in locations where the
underlying zoning district is a Business District, a Residence-Industry
District, a Semi-Industry District or
a General Industry District. The regulations of the underlying district
shall govern except where in conflict with the regulations of the
LWO District. The LWO District
shall be mapped in an area where
the underlying zoning prohibits residential occupancy only if it has
been determined that current and
anticipated future uses in the immediate vicinity will be compatible
with live-work occupancy.
Section 346.04 Certificate of Occupancy
No Live-Work Unit shall be occupied nor shall the use of a LiveWork Unit, including the work use,
be changed without issuance of a
Certificate of Occupancy by the
Commissioner of Building and Housing. Such Certificate shall be issued
only if the Commissioner determines
that the proposed work activities
and living space meet all applicable
regulations of these Codified Ordinances, including the Health and
Fire Codes.
Section 346.05 Permitted Uses
All uses permitted in the underlying zoning district shall be permitted in a LWO District except as provided in this section.
(a) Conditionally Permitted Uses.
Notwithstanding otherwise applicable restrictions on residential occupancy in Semi-Industry and General
Industry Districts, such residential
occupancy shall be permitted in a
LWO District as part of a Live-Work
Unit if approved by the City Planning Commission in accordance with
the conditional use criteria of Section 346.06.

1565

17
(b) Prohibited Uses. The following uses and activities are prohibited within a Live-Work Unit:
(1) amusement and recreation
uses, as listed in Section 343.11;
(2) adult entertainment uses, as
listed in Section 347.07;
(3) pet stores, kennels, animal
hospitals;
(4) gun and firearms sales;
(5) automotive service stations,
and motor vehicle repair garages;
and
(6) liquor sales.
Section 346.06 Conditional Use Determination
(a) Approval Criteria. The City
Planning Commission shall approve
establishment of Live-Work space as
a Conditional Use in a General
Industry District or in that portion
of a Semi-Industry District where
residential uses are otherwise prohibited if the Commission determines that the following conditions
have been met.
(1) The subject building was constructed prior to the initial effective
date of this chapter.
(2) Individuals residing in LiveWork Units will not be subject to
excessive levels of noise, vibration,
fire
hazards,
explosion
hazards,
smoke, or other potentially harmful
health or environmental conditions
by existing or likely future industrial uses and conditions in the
immediate vicinity.
(3) By virtue of the nature and
location of current and likely future
uses, existing industrial or commercial activities in the immediate
vicinity will not be impaired by the
presence of the proposed Live-Work
Units.
(b) Notice Requirements. Prior to
taking action on any application for
establishment of a Live-Work Unit,
the City Planning Commission shall
notify the Division of Fire of such
application and shall seek its comment on applicable safety issues.
Subsequent to approving establishment of a Live-Work Unit, the Commission shall notify the Division of
Fire of such approval, including the
address of the subject property.
Section
346.07
Dividing
Walls,
Access, Identification and Fire Code
Regulations
A wall dividing the living space
from the Work Space is not required
in any Live-Work Unit, but each
Live-Work Unit shall be separated
from all other uses in the building
and shall have separate access
either from the building exterior or
from an interior corridor that is separate from such other uses. The
bathroom in any Live-Work Unit
shall be enclosed and shall comply
with requirements of the Building
and Housing Code. All Live-Work
Units shall comply with applicable
Fire Code regulations, including
applicable fire resistance requirements
and
emergency
egress
requirements of the Codified Ordinances. Each exterior door providing access to Live-Work Units shall
be identified by a plaque marked in
lettering at least two (2) inches in
height with the words “Live-Work
Units” or similar language.
Section 346.08 Parking, Sign and
Yard Regulations
(a) Parking. Within a LWO District, no additional parking shall be
required for establishment of a LiveWork Unit in a building which was
constructed prior the initial effec-

18
tive date of this Chapter. For a LiveWork Unit proposed in a building
first occupied after the initial effective date of this Chapter, parking
shall be provided to meet the
requirements of the underlying zoning district. Such parking requirements shall be applied in a manner
that considers each Live-Work Unit
as a single dwelling unit and that
measures the floor area of Work
Space exclusive of the area devoted
to living space.
(b) Signs. Signs shall be permitted in accordance with the regulations applicable to the underlying
zoning district.
(c) Yards. Within a LWO District,
requirements for residential interior
side yards and rear yards shall not
apply to a Live-Work Unit established in a building which was constructed prior to the initial effective
date of this Chapter.
Section 346.09 Acknowledgment of
Industrial Use
In a General Industry District and
in any portion of a Semi-Industry
District where residential occupancy
is otherwise prohibited, the Certificate of Occupancy establishing a
Live-Work Unit or changing the use
of a Live-Work Unit shall include a
statement, signed by the applicant,
stating the following: “The applicant acknowledges that the LiveWork Unit is located in an area
zoned for industrial uses that may
be incompatible with a typical residential environment. The applicant
further acknowledges that these and
future industrial uses in this district
have the right to operate without
any restrictions other than those
applicable to uses in the underlying
industrial zoning district or otherwise imposed by law.” Such language shall be included in any lease
or deed pertaining to the Live-Work
space.
Section 346.10 Submission Requirements
In addition to otherwise required
plans and information, any application to establish a Live-Work Unit or
to change the use of a Live-Work
Unit, including the work use, shall
identify the nature of the work
activities to be performed in the
Live-Work Unit and shall be accompanied by a floor plan that identifies those areas to be used as living
space and those areas to be used as
Work Space. Such plan shall also
identify the nature and location of
equipment,
furnishings
or
other
improvements that cause the Work
Space to meet the definition in division (c) of Section 346.02. For applications subject to the conditional use
provisions of Section 346.06, the
owner or lessor of the property shall
demonstrate that the environmental
condition of the property is not
harmful to human health and safety
and is safe for residential use. Such
demonstration may be made through
the issuance of a
“No Further
Action” Letter by a Certified Professional pursuant to the requirements
for residential sites of Ohio Revised
Code Chapter 3746 et seq., (the “Ohio
Voluntary Action Program”). A “No
Further Action” Letter shall not
relieve the owner or lessor from compliance with any applicable municipal, state or federal law. If the applicant does not possess a “No Further
Action” Letter as described above,
the applicant must submit a Phase I
or Phase 2 environmental assessment, as applicable, to demonstrate

The City Record
that the site meets environmental
standards for residential use. If an
environmental
assessment
shows
environmental threats to residential
occupancy, then the owner must
demonstrate that those conditions
have been abated.
Section 346.11 Right of Appeal
Appeals from the decision of the
City Planning Commission to approve or disapprove the establishment of a Live-Work space as a Conditional Use in a General Industry
District or in that portion of a SemiIndustry District where residential
uses are otherwise prohibited shall
be made to the Board of Zoning
Appeals.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

billboard may be replaced or may be
reconstructed to an extent greater
than otherwise permitted if the City
Planning
Commission
determines
that such replacement or reconstruction will satisfy the following
conditions:
(1) Site and Design Improve ments. The site of the new or reconstructed billboard shall be landscaped
and
otherwise
improved,
through use of an ornamental base
or frame, a streamlined support
structure, or similar features effective in improving the appearance of
the site. At a minimum, evergreen
shrubs, at least three (3) feet in
height at the time of planting and
four (4) feet in height after two (2)
growing seasons, shall be planted at
maximum intervals of four (4) feet
along any side of the base of the
billboard oriented toward a public
street. Such planting shall extend at
least the full width of the billboard
panel. In addition, all portions of the
parcel(s) of land on which the billboard site is located shall be planted with grass or other suitable vegetative ground cover between the
billboard and all public streets abutting the parcel(s).
(2) Degree of Nonconformity. The
new or reconstructed billboard shall
be no greater in size, height, number of panels, or any panel dimension than is the existing billboard,
nor shall the new or reconstructed
billboard be less conforming to any
zoning regulation than is the existing billboard.
(3) Location. The new or reconstructed billboard shall be placed in
precisely the same location as the
existing billboard unless the City
Planning
Commission
determines
that a different location on the same
parcel of land would be more effective in meeting the intent of the
sign regulations, as stated in Section 350.01.
(4) Sign Type. With respect to the
“sign types” defined in division (f)
of Section 350.03, the new or reconstructed billboard shall be the same
type as the existing billboard unless
the
City
Planning
Commission
determines that a different sign
type would be more compatible with
the subject property or nearby properties.
(5) Changeable Copy. The new or
reconstructed billboard may incorporate automatic changeable copy
only if such copy is limited to a single billboard panel or two back-to-

20
back billboard panels and only if
each such panel replaces two or
more billboard panels on a single
parcel of property or two or more
billboard panels on adjacent properties.
The
replacement
billboard
panel shall not be larger than any
of the billboard panels it is replacing. In the case of a sign utilizing
changeable
copy,
each
message
shall remain fixed for at least eight
(8) seconds.
