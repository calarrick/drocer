CONDOLENCE RESOLUTIONS
September 5, 2001
The Honorable Michael D. Polensek
Cleveland City Council President
City Hall
601 Lakeside Avenue, Room 220
Cleveland, Ohio 44114
Dear Council President Polensek:
Due to unforeseen circumstances,
Reverend Kenneth W. Chalker will
be unable to serve on the Fair Campaign Finance Commission. While
Dr. Chalker’s assets will be missed
on the Commission, I am confident
that we have identified other qualified and capable members to serve
the citizens of Cleveland.
To fill the open positions, I am
removing the name of Mr. David
Cabbil from consideration for the
mayoral appointment that requires
City Council approval. Instead, Mr.
Cabbil will serve on the Commission
as my direct appointment.
To complete the Commission, I am
submitting the name of Mr. Salvatore Calandra for City Council approval. Mr. Calandra is imminently
qualified to serve as a member of
the Fair Campaign Finance Commission. With a long history in the
legal profession, he will bring a
commitment to upholding the campaign finance laws that the citizens
of Cleveland have loudly supported.
I am requesting that Mr. Calandra’s
nomination be considered an emergency measure for immediate approval at City Council’s next regularly scheduled meeting.

Res. No. 1771-01.
By Councilmen Westbrook and
Cimperman.
An emergency resolution declaring September 14, 2001 “Literacy
Day” in the City of Cleveland and
commending literacy organizations
throughout the city for their ongoing efforts to create a community of
readers.
Whereas, the ability to read is recognized as one of the primary building blocks of a happy and successful life; and a love of reading can
enrich one’s life by providing the
mind with countless new vistas and
ideas; and
Whereas, the month of September
has been designated National Literacy Month, providing an opportunity for all concerned citizens to
reflect on the state of literacy in the
City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, the Plain Dealer recently reported that 66% of Cleveland
fourth graders and 40% of fourth
graders statewide would have been
held back this year if they had been
forced to meet the state’s “reading
guarantee,” and in Cuyahoga County alone, 18 out of 31 school districts
showed a decline in reading scores;
and
Whereas, this problem is complicated by the lack of literacy skills
reflected
among
Cleveland
residents; for example, 41% of adults in
Cleveland do not have a high school
diploma, and only one in three
ninth-graders graduate; and
Whereas,
low
literacy
rates
impact crime rates, with 85% of all
juvenile offenders exhibiting reading deficiencies; and
Whereas, the above challenges
can be met only through a concerted and focused effort within the
Greater Cleveland community, as
demonstrated
by
the
Cleveland
Reads coalition of literacy organizations, with programs at over 200
sites throughout the city; and
Whereas, such coalitions unite
local
efforts,
and
by
working
beyond the boundaries of any one
institution, strengthen and enhance
direct literacy services through the
provision of research and development, advocacy, and network building; now, therefore,
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland recognizes September 14, 2001 as “Literacy Day” in
the City of Cleveland, and commends Cleveland Reads and its
member
organizations
for
their
ongoing work to improve the quality of life by promoting literacy
efforts and community involvement.
Section
2.
That
this
Council
encourages the residents of the City
to contribute their time, resources
and expertise to the literacy efforts
within their own neighborhoods and
communities.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force

September 12, 2001
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Motion to suspend rules. Charter

Whereas, on Friday, August 31,
2001, areas of the City of Cleveland
experienced a “100 year storm,”
wherein at least 3 to 4 inches of rain

Whereas, the 100 year storm lead

Whereas, residents need assistance in repairing their homes and
replacing damaged items; and
Whereas, the Administration is
urged to seek federal disaster emergency relief funds through the Federal
Emergency
Management
Agency (FEMA) to compensate residents for the losses that they sustained during the flood; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
