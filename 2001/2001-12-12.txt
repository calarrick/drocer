The City Record
Res. No. 2213-01.
By Councilmen Polensek, Cimperman, Westbrook, Rybka, Cintron,
O’Malley, Sweeney, Britt, White,
Melena, Lewis and Willis.
An emergency resolution stating
Council’s intention to file a motion
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court to oppose
LTV’s proposed cessation of operations, and supporting the workers
of LTV Steel Company in their
fight to keep LTV Steel Company
open.
Whereas,
LTV
Steel
Company
filed for bankruptcy protection in
December, 2000 and, since that time,
financial
institutions,
representatives of local, state and federal governments, union leaders and company representatives have been working cooperatively to secure a viable
and stable future for the company;
and
Whereas, in a move surprising to
workers and area community leaders, on November 21, 2001, LTV management filed a motion with the
Youngstown bankruptcy court seeking approval to immediately cease
steel making operations in Cleveland, Indiana, Illinois, and to close
coke ovens in Warren, Ohio and
Chicago; and
Whereas, if this request of LTV
management is approved by the
bankruptcy
court,
approximately
7,500
people,
including
3,200
in
Cleveland, would lose their jobs; and
Whereas, in addition to the lost
jobs, more than 50,000 LTV retirees
and dependents could lose their
health care and have pension benefits reduced; and
Whereas, this Council vehemently
opposes the proposal of LTV to
cease operations and joins with
local and federal leaders, including
Congressman Dennis Kucinich, in
urging the bankruptcy court to deny
LTV’s motion for closure; and
Whereas, as this Council has experienced, when political, community,
religious and labor leaders joined
together to keep St. Michael Hospital open, we were able to stave off
a closure that we were told even
God could not stop; and
Whereas, the livelihood of thousands of Cleveland families and the
economy of our region will be put
at great peril if LTV is permitted to
close permanently; and
Whereas, it is the intention of
this Council to file a motion on
Tuesday, November 27th in the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Youngstown
opposing the closure of LTV and
requesting the appointment of a
trustee to shepherd LTV through
the bankruptcy process so that it
may reorganize and remain in operation; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
strongly opposes the cessation of
operations of LTV Steel Company
and intends to file a motion in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court supporting the
position of Congressman Dennis
Kucinich in objecting to LTV’s

2981

25
rejection of collective bargaining
agreements, termination of retiree
benefit programs, unilateral cessation of negotiations with labor
unions, designation of key assets for
auction and proposed shutdown of
operations without adequate assurances of compliance with environmental standards.
Section
2.
That
this
Council
believes LTV Steel Company can be
saved through the intervention of a
qualified Trustee to manage and
oversee the affairs of LTV and this
Council will urge the bankruptcy
court to appoint such a Trustee to
help save the company and the jobs
of thousands of workers, and to prevent a devastating impact to the
Cleveland economy.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it

such rebuilding should be done
