FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 146-01.
By Councilmen Cimperman and
Reed.
An emergency resolution opposing
the plan recently announced by Governor Taft to expand the state-wide
lottery in order to generate additional funding for schools and urging the Governor to find another
source of funds for improvements to
our school system.
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland is cognizant of the
deplorable conditions of our city’s
school buildings and the poor academic results of many of our Cleveland school students; and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
the need for additional funding for
our school system to remedy building deficiencies and to improve the
quality of education received by our
school children; and
Whereas,
Governor
Taft
has
announced a budget plan to bolster
funding for schools premised on the
idea that Ohio will join Powerball
or another multistate lottery by
March 31, 2002; and
Whereas, such a budget is speculative and requires the approval of
the state legislature to permit the
expansion of the lottery; and
Whereas, this Council has been
and continues to be opposed to the
expansion and marketing of the lottery to poor and low-income residents of our neighborhoods since the
residents participating in the lottery
do not receive a proportionate share
of the revenues derived from the lottery; and
Whereas, while Governor Taft is
well-intentioned in his desire to
increase funding for Ohio schools,
the manner in which he proposes to
fund those initiatives is speculative
and serves to undermine the poor
and low-income neighborhoods; and
Whereas, this Council opposes the
Governor Taft’s plan to fund schools
through the expansion of the lottery
and urges the Governor to develop
a more realistic and less onerous
plan to provide additional funding
for our school students; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

16
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland is opposed to the
plan recently announced by Governor Taft to expand the state-wide
lottery in order to generate additional funding for schools throughout Ohio and urges, the Governor to
reevaluate his plan to find another
source of funds for improvements to
our school system.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to furnish a
copy of this resolution to Governor
Taft and to Barbara Byrd-Bennett,
CEO of the Cleveland Municipal
Schools.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

By Councilmen White and Jones.
An emergency resolution urging
the Mayor to increase the number of
Police Officers assigned to the
Fourth Police District in order to
enhance the public safety of neighborhood residents and to reduce the
incidence of illegal narcotic sales
that is taking place within the community.
Whereas, over the past several
years there have been an increasing
number of police officers being
assigned to the various Cleveland
Police Districts as a result of the
Fresh Start, and other law enforcement programs in order to decrease
the incidences and occurrences of
crimes and the sale of illegal narcotics; and
Whereas, drug activity is often
the gateway to other criminal activity and social disruption, that exposes neighborhood residents, young
adults, children, and visitors to an
environment, which is considered to
be very unhealthy to Cleveland’s
neighborhoods; and
Whereas, the Fourth Police District historically has the most incidences of crimes occurring within
its boundaries such as illegal narcotic sales, which has raised concerns among the residents about the
quality of public safety in their
neighborhoods; and
Whereas, by increasing the number of police officers to patrol the
neighborhoods
in
Cleveland’s
Fourth District, neighborhood residents will feel safer about their
neighborhood, and overall quality of
life; and
Whereas, an increase in the number of police officers patrolling the
Fourth Police District will greatly
contribute to a significant decrease
in the incidence of crimes that are
occurring within this community;
and

The City Record
Whereas, by improving the overall public safety for the residents
residing in the Fourth Police District a sense of well being and an
improved quality of life will be
achieved as a result of keeping the
community safe from drugs and
crime; now, therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Mayor of the City
of Cleveland be strongly urged to
hire and assign more police officers
to the Fourth Police District in
order to reduce the incidences of
crime and to decrease the sale of
illegal narcotics.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby is directed to
transmit a certified copy of this resolution to Michael R. White, Mayor
of the City of Cleveland.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it

Res. No. 105-01.
By Councilman Jones.
An emergency resolution strongly
urging the Democratic members of
the United States Senate to oppose
the confirmation of John Ashcroft as
U.S. Attorney General.
Whereas, President George W.
Bush’s nominee for U.S. Attorney
General, John Ashcroft, has refused
to disassociate himself from the
Southern Partisan Magazine, a journal which supports ideology of the
old southern confederacy; and
Whereas, the recent hearings in
the Senate Judiciary
Committee
showed that Mr. Ashcroft engaged
in vituperative personal attacks on
the nomination of African-American
Missouri Supreme Court Judge Ronnie White to the federal bench,
which was successfully opposed;
and
Whereas, the sanctity of
our
democratic system was already compromised by the actions of the United States Supreme Court in selecting George W. Bush as President,
and the Constitutional rights of all
citizens would be further threatened
by
having
someone
like
John
Ashcroft as Attorney General, with
the power and authority to deploy
the FBI and an army of prosecutors;
and
Whereas, the Bush administration
representing a minority of the voters and facing a divided Congress,
wishes for the confirmation of an
individual to U.S. Attorney General,
who has in the past stated his opposition to affirmative action, gun control, desegregation orders, and gay
rights; and
Whereas, such a confirmation of
John Ashcroft as U.S. Attorney General could result in the Attorney
General’s
Office
promoting
and

The City Record
enforcing policies that could prove
very harmful to an American citizenry that is racially, culturally,
and religiously diverse; now, therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland strongly urges the
Democratic members of the United
States Senate to oppose the confirmation of John Ashcroft as U.S.
Attorney General.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby is directed to
transmit a certified copy of this resolution to Senator Edward Kennedy
and all other Democratic members
of the Senate Judiciary Committee
on Tuesday, January 23, 2001, since
a Committee vote on the Ashcroft
nomination is scheduled for January
24, 2001.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Res. No. 106-01.
By Councilman Polensek.
An emergency resolution urging
the
Greater
Cleveland
Regional
Transit Authority to implement a
recycling collection program using
new public recycling bins at its area
bus shelters.
Whereas, trash and broken bottles
at various bus shelters owned by the
Greater Cleveland Regional Transit
Authority (RTA) are unsightly and
send a message to citizens that
those responsible for the property
cannot or will not control the problem; and
Whereas, recycling containers in
various cities throughout Canada,
such as Toronto, Ontario, have become an increasingly popular way
of cutting down on litter; and
Whereas,
several
American
cities, such as Pittsburgh, Atlantic
City,
San
Francisco
and
New
Orleans, have expressed interest in
implementing a recycling program
using the new public recycling
bins; and
Whereas, these recycling containers are large, compartmentalized
bins designed to collect waste and
litter, recyclable paper and recyclable containers such as plastic,
glass and aluminum; and
Whereas, use of these containers
by RTA would cut down on litter,
popularize recycling in the city, and
beautify the areas surrounding bus
shelters on city streets and in neighborhoods; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges the Greater
Cleveland Regional Transit Author-

136

January 31, 2001
ity to implement a recycling collection program using new public
recycling bins at its area bus shelters.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
Joseph Calabrese, CEO and General
Manager, Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
