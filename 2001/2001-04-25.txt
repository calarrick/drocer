Capped; Reporting
(a) Finding. This Council finds
that the wages earned by drivers of
public hacks are inadequate to
insure a sufficient number of taxicabs and capable drivers, and that
the public convenience and necessity require the imposition of a cap
on the expenses paid by drivers of
public hacks.
(b) Definitions. As used in this
section:
(1) “Base rates” means the drivers’ expenses charged by a company, association or independent operator to its drivers on the date of passage of the ordinance that enacts
this section.
(2) “Drivers’ expenses” means all
costs, expenses and fees paid by drivers to a company, association or
independent
operator
currently
charged or hereafter established for
the lease of a public hack, and
includes, by way of example and not
by way of limitation, the costs of
the lease itself, insurance, surcharges, and fuel.
(c) Drivers’ Expenses Capped. For
the
period
of
January
1,
2001
through December 31, 2003 a company, association or independent
operator shall not increase its drivers’ expenses by more than five
percent (5) over its “base rates”.
In the case of fuel only, changes
in the market price of the commodity may be passed along to drivers,
and any such increase shall not be
counted toward the caps imposed by
this division. Overhead costs associated with the sale of fuel by a company, association or independent
operator are subject to the caps
imposed by this division.
(d) Reporting. Within ten (10)
days after the effective date of this
section, each company, association
or independent operator shall submit a schedule of its base rates as
defined in division (b) of this section.
On or before December 31 in each
year subsequent to the effective
date of this section, each company,
association or independent operator
shall submit its then current drivers’
expenses, identifying any changes
to the same. The requirements of
this paragraph are satisfied by the
company, association or independent
operator by a certification of the
percentage
change
in
drivers’
expenses from the previous reporting period.
All reports required by this section shall be certified by an affidavit by the owner of the company,
association or independent operator,
on such forms as the Commissioner
of Assessments and Licenses shall
prescribe.”
