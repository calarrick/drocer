Permit No. 1152290, Butts Bar & Grill
Inc., DBA Butts Bar & Grill Inc.,
2109 Tate Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio
44109; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with

November 21, 2001
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to
Section 4303.26 of the Ohio Revised
Code. Council’s objection to said
permit must be received by the
Director of Liquor Control within
30 days of notification; now, therefore,

Section 1. That Council does
hereby record its objection to the

Guarantee Board to approve the
request of National City Bank and
Key Bank to guarantee a loan to
LTV Steel Corp.
Whereas, National City Bank and
Key Bank have applied to the federal Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Board seeking federal guarantees to assist in the restructuring of
LTV Steel Corp.; and
Whereas, if granted, the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Board
would guarantee 85% of the principal amount loaned, or $212.5 million
of the $250 million loan; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
Cuyahoga County, the State of Ohio
and an unidentified supplier have
agreed to guarantee 13% of the
loan; and

The City Record
Whereas, the guaranteed loans
would provide LTV with a critical
element of liquidity and stability
needed during the current economic
downturn and would support the
Company’s development of an operating
cost
structure
competitive
with the lowest cost domestic steel
producers; and
Whereas, without the assistance
of the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Board the fate of LTV Steel
Corp is grim and the plight of its
employees is uncertain; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health or safety of the citizens of
the City of Cleveland; now therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

on August 15, 2001; and
Whereas, this Council wishes to

An emergency resolution urging
the
Ohio
State
legislature
to
review Chapter 2925 of the Revised
Code and expand the area around
a school in which increased penalties are received for committing
drug offenses to fifteen hundred
feet.
Whereas,
under
Revised
Code
Chapter 2925, a drug offense is “committed in the vicinity of a school” if
the offender commits the offense on
school premises, in a school building, or within one thousand feet of
the boundaries of any school premises; and
Whereas, under the Revised Code,
committing a drug offense “within
the vicinity of a school” necessarily
increases
the
penalty
for
such
offense; and
Whereas, drug offenses are committed with increasing regularity
just outside the defined 1000 foot
boundary of school premises, which
allows drug offenders to still traffic
drugs relatively near schools, but to
get a lesser penalty for committing
the offense; and
Whereas, expanding the definition
of a drug offense “committed in the
vicinity of a school” to include
offenses committed within fifteen
hundred feet of the boundaries of
any school premises will cause more
drug offenders to be subject to the
enhanced penalty and possibly act
as a deterrent to those who may
traffic drugs near our schools; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio State legislature to review
Chapter 2925 of the Revised Code
and expand the area around a
school in which increased penalties
are received for committing drug
offenses to fifteen hundred feet.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
Governor Bob Taft and the leaders
of the Ohio State legislature.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 2110-01.
By Councilman Britt.
An emergency resolution withdrawing objection to the renewal of
a C2 and C2X Liquor Permit to 2249
East 105th Street, 1st Fl., and repealing Res. No. 1585-01 objecting to said
renewal.
Whereas, this Council objected to
the renewal of a C2 and C2X Liquor
Permit to 2249 East 105th Street, 1st
Fl., by Res. No. 1585-01 adopted by
Council on August 15,2001; and
Whereas, this Council wishes to
withdraw its objection to the above
renewal and consents to said renewal; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That objection to the
renewal of a C2 and C2X Liquor Permit to 2249 East 105th Street, 1st Fl.,
by and the same is hereby withdrawn and Res. No. 1585-01, containing said objection, be and the same
is hereby repealed and that this
Council consents to the immediate
renewal thereof.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted November 12, 2001.
Awaiting the approval or disapproval of the Mayor.

Res. No. 2111-01.
By Councilman Coats.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio State legislature to review
Chapter 2925 of the Revised Code
and expand the area around a school
in which drug offenses may be committed to fifteen hundred feet.

November 21, 2001
Whereas,
under
Revised
Code
Chapter 2925, a drug offense is “committed in the vicinity of a school” if
the offender commits the offense on
school premises, in a school building, or within one thousand feet of
the
boundaries
of
any
school
premises; and
Whereas, under the Revised Code,
committing a drug offense “within
the vicinity of a school” necessarily
increases
the
penalty
for
such
offense; and
Whereas, drug offenses are committed with increasing regularity
just outside the defined 1000 foot
boundary of school premises, which
allows drug offenders to still traffic
drugs relatively near schools, but to
get a lesser penalty for committing
the offense; and
Whereas, expanding the definition of a drug offense “committed in
the vicinity of a school” to include
offenses committed within fifteen
hundred feet of the boundaries of
any school premises will cause
more drug offenders to be subject
to the enhanced penalty and possibly act as a deterrent to those who
may traffic drugs near our schools,
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio State legislature to review
Chapter 2925 of the Revised Code
and expand the area around a
school in which drug offenses may
be committed to fifteen hundred
feet.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
Governor Bob Taft and the leaders
of the Ohio State legislature.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted November 12, 2001.
Awaiting the approval or disapproval of the Mayor.
