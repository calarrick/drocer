By Councilman Willis.
An emergency resolution declaring Council’s concern and opposition
to the decision of the Cleveland
Indians to broadcast its games
exclusively on cable television for
the 2002, 2003 and 2004 baseball seasons.
Whereas, the Cleveland Indians
baseball team recently announced
that it will broadcast its games
exclusively on cable television for
the 2002, 2003 and 2004 baseball seasons; and
Whereas, the Indians have been
on broadcast, or free, television
since 1948; and
Whereas, such decision by the
Indians prevents many residents of
the city from viewing the baseball
games since over one-half of the residences in Cleveland do not have
cable television; and
Whereas, since a bulk of the funding for Jacobs Field came from public sources and ticket prices continue to increase, this Council is disappointed in the decision of the
Indians to exclude the public from
participating in the national pasttime by viewing the games; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation of the public peace, property,
health and safety of the citizens of
the City of Cleveland; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
declares
its
disappointment
and
opposition to the decision of the
Cleveland Indians to broadcast its
games exclusively on cable television for the 2002, 2003 and 2004 baseball seasons and urges the team
owners to reconsider this ill-considered decision.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency

all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

By Counciman Cimperman.
An emergency resolution supporting Governor Taft in his opposition
to making health boards obtain city
council
approval
before
banning
smoking in public places and further
supporting the governor’s compromise which gives Ohio’s Health District Advisory Councils the option of
overriding any smoking ban passed
by the local health boards.
Whereas, state representatives are
threatening to pass a bill which
would cause local health boards to
win approval of the local city coun-

2673

11
cil where said health boards recommend elimination of smoking in
restaurants or other public places;
and
Whereas, such a bill would make
it harder for local health boards to
ban smoking in public places; and
Whereas, gaining the approval of
local city councils is extremely difficult if not impossible; and
Whereas,
Governor
Taft
has
threatened to veto the bill, but state
representatives want to override
any veto; and
Whereas, Governor Taft has proposed a compromise wherein Ohio’s
Health District Advisory Councils
may override any smoking ban
passed by local health boards; and
Whereas,
such
a
compromise
makes
the
health
boards
more
accountable in that the Health District Advisory Councils would help
determine impact on restaurants,
bars
and
other
establishments
before allowing smoking bans; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports Governor Taft in his opposition to making health boards obtain
city council approval before banning
smoking in public places and further supports the governor’s compromise which gives Ohio’s Health
District
Advisory
Councils
the
option of overriding any smoking
ban passed by the local health

An emergency resolution opposing
House Bill 191 which provides that
a municipality which collects over
$100 million in annual income tax
receipts give back to each commuter’s place of residence 25% of
the income tax paid to the central
city.
Whereas, pending House Bill 191
provides that a municipality which
collects over $100 million in annual
income tax receipts must return to
the commuter’s place of residence
25% of the income tax paid to the
central city; and
Whereas,
Columbus,
Dayton,
Cleveland, Toledo and Cincinnati
are cities that would be affected by
such a bill; and
Whereas, initial estimates say

Outdoor
Pay
Telephones
(a) Upon request in writing by
the member of Council in whose
ward an outdoor pay telephone is
located in the right-of-way or on private property, or upon receipt of verbal or written citizen complaints
concerning such an outdoor pay telephone, the Director of Public Safety
shall conduct an investigation into
whether the installation and maintenance of the outdoor pay telephone constitutes a public nuisance.
Upon determination by the Director
of Public Safety that a particular
outdoor pay telephone constitutes a
public nuisance, the Director shall
order that special telephone service
features as are acceptable to the
Director shall be provided by the
outdoor pay telephone or, if the
Director determines it is necessary,
that the telephone be removed. Nothing in this Section shall preclude the
Director from ordering the removal
of a telephone without first requiring the implementation of special
features. A particular outdoor pay
telephone shall constitute a public
nuisance when the Director of Public Safety determines that one or
more of the following conditions
exist:
(1) The outdoor pay telephone has
been used in the commission of illegal drug transactions or other criminal activity, or substantially contributes by its presence to the commission of illegal drug transactions
or other criminal activity as evidenced by significant numbers of
such crimes occurring in the vicinity of the telephone;
(2) The existence of the outdoor
pay telephone has substantially contributed by its presence to the congregation of persons who have made
loud noises and other disturbances
that have disrupted persons residing
near the telephone or disrupted business enterprises located near the
telephone;
(3) The existence of the outdoor
pay telephone has substantially contributed by its presence to the congregation
of
persons
consuming
alcoholic beverages, except where
such consumption is expressly authorized by a state license, or consuming illegal or controlled substances;
(4) The existence of the outdoor
pay telephone has substantially contributed by its presence to the con-

The City Record
gregation of persons who have interfered with pedestrian or vehicular
traffic in the public right-of-way
near the telephone;
(5) Usage of the outdoor pay telephone between the hours of 1:00 a.m.
and 5:00 a.m. is significantly and
repeatedly above normal usage for
similarly situated outdoor pay telephones during the same hours so as
to indicate that the telephone is
being used in the commission of illegal drug activity or other criminal
activity;
(6) The pay telephone has been
used to abuse the 911 system.
(b) The special features shall be
instituted,
or
the
owner
shall
remove the telephone, and restore
the right-of-way to its original condition, if applicable, within five
(5) business days of an order to
institute special features or remove the telephone. Removal of a
nuisance pay telephone shall be
governed by the provisions of Section 670B.06.
(c) If the Director determines that
the nuisance may be abated by the
reduction in the total number of pay
telephones in an area, the removal
of pay telephones shall be ordered
based upon the total period of time
that a telephone has been permitted
by the City, with the telephones
permitted for the least amount of
time being ordered removed first.
(d) The Director of Public Safety
will inform in writing the member
of Council who made the complaint
regarding the pay telephone the
result of such investigation and the
Director shall notify the member in
writing of any order issued by the
Director.
(e) If an outdoor pay telephone
has been removed from a location
because it is a nuisance, no other
pay telephone may be installed at
the same location or within 500 feet
of that location for a minimum of
one year.
(f) The owner of an outdoor pay
telephone may appeal from the
determination of a nuisance and the
order of special features or removal
as set forth in Section 670B.06.
Section 670B.08 PUCO Regulations
Nothing in this Chapter shall be
read so as to limit the authority of
the PUCO to regulate outdoor pay
telephones within the City of Cleveland,
nor
to conflict with the
authority of the PUCO to approve
any special services for pay telephones.
Section 670B.99 Penalty
Any owner as defined in this
Chapter, or any owner, lessee, or person in possession or control of private property where an outdoor pay
telephone is or has been located,
