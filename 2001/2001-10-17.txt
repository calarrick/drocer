AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 1924-01.
By Councilman Cimperman.
An emergency resolution urging
parking lot operators to act responsibly and to refrain from raising
their rates in response to the recently enacted parking ban and declaring Council’s intent to enact legislation barring rate in the event that
operators refuse to act cooperatively.
Whereas,
due
to
the
horrific
events of September 11, 2001, cities
across the country, including Cleveland, have increased security measures; and
Whereas, as part of the increased
security measures, the City’s Administration implemented a ban on
parking near certain public and private buildings; and
Whereas, with this parking ban,
certain parking lot operators may
give consideration to raising their
parking rates for customers; and
Whereas, this Council would find
such actions unconscionable and
urges
parking
lot
operators
to
refrain from price gouging; and
Whereas, in the event that parking lot operators raise their rates to
take advantage of the parking ban
imposed because of heightened security, then this Council would seek

An emergency resolution urging
and supporting the international
campaign to keep space for peace,
and to eliminate the use of spacebased military weapons, and welcoming the national conference on
keeping space for peace.

2517

11
Whereas, the Bush Administration
is seeking to develop a space-based
weapons system, popularly known
as Star Wars, which will cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars; and
Whereas, the space-based program
would
be
completely
ineffective
against the kind of terrorist attack
that took place on September 11,
2001, and would draw needed funds
away from efforts to combat terrorism; and
Whereas, money is desperately
needed to rebuild the crumbling
infrastructure of our cities, to help
provide affordable health care, education, housing and other human
needs; and
Whereas, the citizenry of Cleveland and our nation should have
informed input into the priorities
our federal government sets; and
Whereas, this space-based program will violate the 1972 ABM
Treaty and can lead to more global
instability; and
Whereas, military planners prefer
nuclear devices be used in this
space weapons program, which can
cause environmental damage to our
planet; and
Whereas, there is no certainty
that such a space-based program
will work; and
Whereas, our nation and all of the
nations and peoples of the world
need to find avenues to resolve conflict without resorting to war, by
strengthening international institutions; and
Whereas, the people of Cleveland
and of the United States need to
learn more about this vital issue,
and to find out how they can
become involved in the growing
international
campaign
to
keep
space for peace; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland hereby welcomes
to Cleveland the national conference
on keeping space for peace, sponsored by Global Network Against
Weapons and Nuclear Power in
Space and Cleveland Peace Action
that was held on October 13, 2001 at
Cleveland State University.
Section 2. That it is the hope of
this Council that the exchange of
views that took place at this special
conference will lead to an increased
awareness on the part of participants from Cleveland and from
around the country on this vital
issue, which will affect the future
of all of us.
Section
3.
That
this
Council
strongly urges the citizens of Cleveland to become involved in the
international
campaign
to
keep
space for peace.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
