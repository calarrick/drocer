Whereas, this resolution constitutes
an emergency measure for the immediate preservation of the public property, health, or safety in that the
improvements to West 117th Street
are urgently needed to further the
West 117th Streetscape Project between and among the City of Cleveland, the City of Lakewood, and Cuyahoga County and the emergency adoption of this resolution is necessary so

strip in the sidewalk and emplacing
tree pockets along the public right-ofway for the purpose of implanting
shade trees in accordance with plans,

prepared and placed in File No. 2124-

The City Record
2000-A in the Office of the Clerk of

and profiles are hereby approved.
Section 2. That so much of the
cost and expense of said improvement less in any event one-fiftieth
of the whole cost, and less the entire

found to be a proper charge, shall
be assessed by the front footage of
all lots and lands abutting upon,
and other specially benefited property adjacent to West 117th Street
from Madison Avenue to approximately 100 feet north of Clifton
Boulevard, and it is hereby determined that said lots and lands are
specially benefited by said improvements. The cost of said improvement
shall include the cost of plans, specifications, profiles and estimates
and of printing, serving and publishing notices, resolutions and ordinances, the amount of damages
resulting from the work assessed in
favor of any owner of land affected
by the work and the interest thereon, the costs incurred in connection
with the preparation, levy and collection of special assessments, the
cost of purchasing, appropriating
and otherwise acquiring therefor
any required real estate or interests
therein, the cost of all labor and
materials, and all other necessary
expenditures. The Director of Public
Service has fixed 5 years as the estimated life of said improvements.
Section 3. That the entire amounts
to be levied shall be paid in five (5)
annual installments, with interest on
deferred payments at the rate of 5.3%
per annum provided, however, that
the owner of any property assessed
may, at his option, pay the principal
amount of such assessment in cash
within 40 days from and after the
passage of the assessing ordinance.

the entire cost of said improvement
not specially assessed, as herein provided, shall be paid by the City of
Cleveland, or out of funds made

to be assessed, or upon any other
persons or corporations entitled by

in accordance with the plans, specifications and profiles now on file
in the Office of the Clerk of Council. The estimated assessment shall
be filed in the Office of the Clerk
and
kept
available
for
public
inspection.

An emergency resolution strongly
urging the administration to seek to
provide affordable health care benefits to school crossing guards during

crossing guards are extremely low,
thereby increasing the need for
affordable health care benefits; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
