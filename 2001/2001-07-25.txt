VETO
File No. 213-01-A.
June 21, 2001
BY HAND DELIVERY
Cleveland City Council
601 Lakeside Avenue
Cleveland, Ohio 44114
To the City Council of the City of
Cleveland:
I return to you herewith, disapproved and with my veto noted
thereon, Ordinance No. 213-01.
Ordinance No. 213-01 provides that
“the
Director
of
Public
Safety,
through the Division of Fire, shall
staff, operate and cause the fire
boat to be maintained with a minimum of four firefighters on regular
duty per company per twenty-four
hour day or each day of the year.”
As was explained by representatives of the Law Department numerous time at the various Council
committees meetings during which
this
legislation
was
considered,
Ordinance No. 213-01 conflicts with
Charter Section 118, which gives the
Director of Public Safety, through
the Fire Chief, exclusive control
over the assignment of Fire Division
personnel.
In Novak v. Perk (1980), 64 Ohio
St. 2d 43, the Ohio Supreme Court
examined a similar ordinance which
was passed by the Cleveland City
Council in 1976 and found that the
Council did not have the power
under Cleveland’s Charter to enact
such legislation. The Court concluded the “Section 118 clearly gives the
fire chief exclusive authority over
individual
assignments
of
fire
department personnel .... In so providing, the framers of the charter
signified an intention to place exclusive, overall control of the city’s fire
protection forces in the mayor or
safety director. Such control necessarily includes the allocation of fire
companies throughout the city. By
placing exclusive control of allocation in the executive branch, the
framers intended to limit the legislative power given the council,
precluding council from enacting an
ordinance regarding fire company
allocation.”
Because the Ohio Supreme Court
has held that Cleveland City Council does not have the power under
the Charter of the City of Cleveland
to enact legislation regarding allocation of the staff of the Fire Division, I hereby veto Ordinance 213-01.
Sincerely,
MICHAEL R. WHITE
Mayor.

Re: Adelphia/Cleveland City Council
Neighborhood Technology Fund
Dear Mr. Minter:
This is to inform you of my
appointments to the Adelphia/Cleveland
City
Council
Neighborhood
Technology Fund that is being overseen by the Cleveland Foundation.
As you know, the Fund was established pursuant to Ordinance No.
1729-2000, approved by the Council of
the City on October 16, 2000, which
approved the request of Cablevision
of Cleveland, L.P. to transfer its
cable television franchise to Adelphia Cleveland LLC.
The Cable Franchise Transfer
Ordinance
required
Adelphia
to
donate $3 million to a fund to be
held by the Cleveland Foundation
and to be used for the purpose of
promoting the use of various types
of modem telecommunications and
computer equipment and services,
including but not limited to, high
speed cable modem equipment and
services and cable equipment, programming, and services, by and for
residents of the City of Cleveland
through, among other things, training such residents in the use of such
equipment and services and making
equipment, programming and services accessible in the neighborhoods of the City. In addition, the
ordinance approving the agreement
between the City and WPS for the
City’s electric aggregation program
requires WPS to deposit $100,000 per
year for the next 5 years into this
Fund. WPS recently deposited the
first $100,000 installment into the
Fund.
Ordinance 1729-2000 (in Section 1
(C) (2)) required the creation of a
committee,
with
three
members
appointed by the Council President,
three appointed by Adelphia and one
by the Cleveland Foundation. The
Ordinance states that this committee
shall determine the projects, programs and entities to be funded
from the monies in the Fund.
By virtue of the power vested in
me by Cleveland City Council in
Ordinance No. 1729-2000, I hereby

July 25, 2001

Michael D. Polensek

by law from possessing the weapon,
and that the weapon was kept ready
at hand by the actor for defense
purposes, while he was engaged in

(a) of Section 601.99, whoever violates this section is guilty of possessing certain weapons on or about

16

By Councilman Gordon.
An emergency resolution urging
that the Ohio General Assembly and
Governor Taft support and adopt
legislation requiring that Medicaid
health care insurance providers in
Ohio accept and pay patient billings
from out of network providers located
at
municipally-owned
and/or
operated neighborhood health clinics.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
owns and/or operates a number of
neighborhood outpatient health clinics; and
Whereas, the City’s neighborhood
outpatient health clinics provide
convenient facilities for health services to the general public without
discrimination by reason of race,
creed, color or national origin; and

1703

37
Whereas, this Council wants to
ensure that high quality health care
services are conveniently and efficiently accessible to all citizens of
the City of Cleveland regardless of
their social or economic circumstances, and to encourage the citizens of the City to seek health care
when needed by providing neighborhood-based clinics for outpatient
primary care; and
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland is concerned that current Ohio law and regulations discourage
patients
from
seeking
health care at convenient neighborhood health care clinics and make
it difficult for municipally-owned
neighborhood clinics to serve all
those who come into their facilities
due to the existence of separate private Medicaid insurance providers
in the State with which health care
providers at such clinics must independently contract for coverage and
patients must independently choose
for their health care insurance coverage; now therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio General Assembly and Governor Taft to support and adopt legislation that authorizes health care
service providers at municipallyowned neighborhood health care
clinics to accept all patients for care
who are on Medicaid health care
insurance
plans,
regardless
of
whether or not the provider is within the network of a patient’s Medicaid insurance plan, and authorizing such “out-of-plan” health care
providers
to
bill
and
be
paid
through
any
patient’s
Medicaid
insurer.
Section 2. That this Council urges
the Ohio General Assembly and Governor Taft to support and adopt legislation
that
requires
Medicaid
health care insurers contracting
with the State of Ohio not to disapprove for payment the bills for
health care services at municipallyowned neighborhood health care
facilities solely on the basis that the
provider of such health care is outside the Medicaid insurer’s network
of providers.
Section 3. That upon approval, the
Clerk of City Council is hereby
directed to deliver a copy of this
Resolution to Governor Taft, the
Mayor,
the
Director
of
Public
Health, the Commissioner of Health,
and to the Ohio State Representatives and Senators representing the
citizens of Cleveland in the Ohio
General Assembly.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it

Whereas, the Mayor of the City of

improving the housing stock of the
City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, Cuyahoga County Treasurer James Rokakis created and

Loan Program (“H.E.L.P.”) in Cuyahoga County; and
Whereas, the H.E.L.P. Program
allows homeowners in Cleveland

remodel their homes or rental property at interest rates three percentage points less than the lowest rate
normally offered by a participating
bank; and
Whereas, these low interest home
improvement loans may be used for
code violation compliance and property upgrades, including maintenance repairs, remodeling improvements and landscaping improvements; and
Whereas, as of December 5, 2000,
participation in the H.E.L.P. Program has resulted in the issuance of
five hundred and sixty low interest
loans to City of Cleveland residents
with a total loan amount exceeding
five million dollars; and
Whereas, the H.E.L.P. Program
has been and continues to be an
excellent resource for City of Cleveland residents and is assisting in
improving the value and quality of
housing available within the City;

the State of Ohio to adopt and implement the Ohio Housing Rehabilitation Linked Deposit Program which
would operate in a manner similar
to Cuyahoga County’s H.E.L.P. Program and, therefore, provide additional low interest loans to citizens
of the City of Cleveland who are
interested in rehabilitating their
homes; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that the adoption and

The City Record
Res. No. 1421-01.
By Councilman Gordon.
An emergency resolution urging
that the Ohio General Assembly and
Governor Taft support and adopt
legislation requiring that Medicaid
health care insurance providers in
Ohio accept and pay patient billings
from out of network providers located
at
municipally-owned
and/or
operated neighborhood health clinics.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
owns and/or operates a number of
neighborhood outpatient health clinics; and
Whereas, the City’s neighborhood
outpatient health clinics provide
convenient facilities for health services to the general public without
discrimination by reason of race,
creed, color or national origin; and
Whereas, this Council wants to
ensure that high quality health care
services are conveniently and efficiently accessible to all citizens of
the City of Cleveland regardless of
their social or economic circumstances, and to encourage the citizens of the City to seek health care
when needed by providing neighborhood-based clinics for outpatient
primary care; and
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland is concerned that current Ohio law and regulations discourage
patients
from
seeking
health care at convenient neighborhood health care clinics and make
it difficult for municipally-owned
neighborhood clinics to serve all
those who come into their facilities
due to the existence of separate private Medicaid insurance providers
in the State with which health care
providers at such clinics must independently contract for coverage and
patients must independently choose
for their health care insurance coverage; now therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio General Assembly and
Governor Taft to support and adopt
legislation that authorizes health
care service providers at municipally-owned neighborhood health care
clinics to accept all patients for care
who are on Medicaid health care
insurance
plans,
regardless
of
whether or not the provider is within the network of a patient’s Medicaid insurance plan, and authorizing such “out-of-plan” health care
providers
to
bill
and
be
paid
through
any
patient’s
Medicaid
insurer.
Section 2. That this Council urges
the Ohio General Assembly and
Governor Taft to support and adopt
legislation that requires Medicaid
health care insurers contracting
with the State of Ohio not to disapprove for payment the bills for
health care services at municipallyowned neighborhood health care
facilities solely on the basis that the
provider of such health care is outside the Medicaid insurer’s network
of providers.
Section 3. That upon approval, the
Clerk of City Council is hereby
directed to deliver a copy of this
Resolution to Governor Taft, the
Mayor,
the
Director
of
Public
Health, the Commissioner of Health,
and to the Ohio State Representatives and Senators representing the
citizens of Cleveland in the Ohio
General Assembly.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of

1735

it shall take effect and be in force

safety code would require alteration,

Safety Director with a written statement of the landlord’s name and
address, for the purpose of receiving
documents that, under this Section,
the Safety Director is required to
serve on the landlord. If the landlord fails to provide the office of the
Safety Director with that information in a timely manner, the Safety
Director
shall
make
reasonable
efforts to identify an appropriate
name and address for the landlord
and, based on those efforts, shall
determine the name and address to

shall
make
an
initial
assessment,
in
writing,
as
to
whether a security audit of the multifamily structure or development is
appropriate and shall serve the tenants and the landlord with a copy
of the initial assessment.
(1) In the initial assessment, the
Safety Director shall find that a
security audit of the multifamily
structure or development is appropriate if the requirements in this
Section for filing a petition are met
and one or more of the following criteria are met: (i) during the thirty
day period preceding the filing of
the petition, the City of Cleveland
Police Department has received fifteen or more service calls concerning the multifamily structure or
development; (ii) within ten days
after the filing of the petition, the
City of Cleveland Councilmember of
the ward in which the multifamily
structure or development is located
advises the Safety Director, in writing, that a security audit of the multifamily structure or development is
appropriate; or (iii) there is any
other reasonable basis for concluding that, if a security audit is conducted, there is a reasonable possibility that the Safety Director will
specify additional security measures
that the landlord will be obligated
to implement in the common areas
of the multifamily structure or
development.
(2) In determining whether any
such reasonable basis exists, the
Safety
Director
shall
consider,

that the City of Cleveland Police
Department has received concerning

preliminary inspection of the common areas of the multifamily structure or development.
(3) The Safety Director shall
serve the tenants and the landlord
with a copy of the initial assessment by delivering or mailing it to
their respective addresses.
(f) If the Safety Director determines in an initial assessment that

The City Record
a security audit of the multifamily
structure or development is not
appropriate,
the
Safety
Director
shall not conduct a security audit of
the multifamily structure or development.
(g) If the Safety Director determines in an initial assessment that
a security audit of the multifamily
structure or development is appropriate, within thirty days after the
Safety Director serves the tenants
and the landlord with the initial
assessment,
the
Safety
Director
shall complete the security audit
and shall serve the tenants and the
landlord with a copy of the written
report of the security audit. The
Safety Director shall serve the tenants and the landlord with a copy
of the written report of the security
audit by delivering or mailing it to
their respective addresses.
(h) If the Safety Director determines in a security audit that the
landlord is obligated to implement
additional security measures in the
common areas of the multifamily
structure or development, the landlord is obligated to implement those
security measures within the reasonable time period(s) specified in
the security audit.
(i)
The
landlord’s
obligation
under this Section and the security
audit to implement the security measures specified in the security audit,
within the reasonable time period(s)
specified in the security audit, is an
implied term of any rental agreement for any dwelling unit in the
multifamily structure or development. If the landlord breaches that
implied term of a rental agreement,
it constitutes a breach of an obligation imposed upon the landlord by
the rental agreement, for the purposes of Section 5321.07(A) of the
Ohio Revised Code.
(j) The tenants of a multifamily
structure or development may not
file a petition pursuant to this Section if, relative to the same multifamily structure or development, a
petition has been filed and served
properly pursuant to this Section
within the preceding 12 months.
(k) If the landlord requests the
Safety Director to inspect the multifamily structure or development to
determine whether the landlord has
implemented the landlord’s obligations under the security audit, within thirty days of the request, the
Safety Director shall make that
determination, in writing, and shall
serve the tenants and the landlord
with a copy of that determination.
The Safety Director shall serve the
tenants and the landlord with a
copy of that determination by delivering or mailing it to their respective addresses.

tenant has abandoned the dwelling
unit, (ii) the landlord intends to
reenter and take possession of the

at which time any rental agreement
or lease still in effect shall be
deemed to be terminated.

forcibly entry and detainer action as
provided in Chapter 1923 of the Ohio

according to the provisions of this
Section, the tenant has abandoned.
Nothing in this Section shall relieve
a landlord from complying with the
provisions of Chapters 1923 and 5321
of the Ohio Revised Code, if the
landlord
knows,
or
reasonably
should know, that the tenant has
not abandoned the dwelling unit.
(d) The landlord shall inventory
any possessions and personal effects
of the tenant that are in the
dwelling unit and shall remove and
keep them for not less than thirty
days. The tenant may reclaim such
possessions and personal effects
from the landlord within that thirty-day period. If the tenant does not
reclaim such possessions and personal effects by the end of that thirty-day period, the landlord may dispose of them as the landlord deems
appropriate.
(e) No action shall be brought
under Section 5321.15 of the Ohio
Revised Code against a landlord
who takes action in compliance with
the provisions of this Section.
Section 375.11 Severability

the provisions of this Chapter shall
be severable.

Section 343.23 Pedestrian Retail
Overlay (PRO) District
(a)
Purpose.
The
Pedestrian
Retail Overlay (PRO) District is
established to maintain the economic viability of older neighborhood
shopping districts by preserving the
pedestrian-oriented
character
of
those districts and to protect public
safety
by
minimizing
conflicts
between vehicles and pedestrians in
neighborhood shopping districts.
(b) Mapping. The PRO District is
an overlay district which shall be
mapped only in an area where at
least seventy five (75%) of the
underlying zoning is either Local
Retail or General Retail. In every
PRO District, any street frontage to
be considered a “Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage,” as defined herein,
shall be so marked on the Zoning
Map, with either one or both sides
of a street designated as such.
(c) Applicability. The PRO District regulations shall apply only in
those portions of a PRO District in
which the underlying zoning is
either
Local
Retail
or
General
Retail. In the relevant portions of a
PRO District, the regulations of the
underlying zoning district shall govern except where in conflict with
the regulations of the PRO District,
in which case the regulations of the
PRO District shall govern.
(d) Definitions. As used in this
section, the following terms shall be
defined as stated below.
(1)
“Pedestrian
Retail
Street
Frontage” means that side or sides

activity exists or is expected to
exist and such street frontage is
specifically designated on the Zoning Map.
(2)
“Pedestrian
Retail
Space”
means that portion of a building or
property located at or closest to the
level of the public sidewalk and
within forty (40) feet of a Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage.
(3) “ Open Sales Lot” means a property or portion thereof used for the
sale of merchandise stored in outdoor, unenclosed locations.
(4) “Institutional Use” means, for
purposes of this section, a school,
day care center, place of worship,
place of assembly, hospital, nursing
home, residential treatment facility,
or similar use.
(5) “Non-Retail Office” means an
office use whose primary activity
does not involve service to customers or clients on the premises.
(e) Use Regulations. All uses permitted in the underlying retail zoning district shall be permitted in the
PRO District, except that the use of
Pedestrian Retail Spaces, as defined
herein, shall be further limited as
follows.
(1) Prohibited Uses. For Pedestrian Retail Spaces, as defined herein,
the following uses shall be prohibited:
A. open sales lots, as defined herein;
B. filling and service stations;
C. car washes;
D. lanes serving a drive-through
facility.
(2) Conditional Uses. For Pedestrian Retail Spaces, as defined herein, the following uses shall be permitted
as
Conditional
Uses,
as
approved by the City Planning Commission in accordance with the
approval criteria provided in this
section:
A. off-street parking or loading
areas;
B. driveways extending across a
public sidewalk;
C. residential, institutional and
non-retail office uses, as defined
herein,
except
that
ground-floor
entrances and lobbies serving such
uses located on upper floors or in a
basement level shall be permitted
without the requirement for conditional approval;
D. any building-enclosed use that
does not have a public pedestrian
entrance from the Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage;
E. any use with more than forty
(40) feet of frontage along the
Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage;
F. a building with an interior side
yard more than four (4) feet in
width and located within forty (40)
feet
of
a
Pedestrian
Retail
Frontage.
(f) Criteria for Conditional Uses.
The City Planning Commission shall
approve a Conditional Use application if it determines that the application meets the following criteria.
(1) In the case of a proposed residential, institutional or non-retail
office use, one or more of the following conditions apply.
A. The subject building space was
designed specifically for the type of
use proposed and, as such, occupancy by an allowed use is an unreasonable expectation.
B. Denial of the application for
occupancy by a conditional use
would result in a long-term vacancy
of the subject property, as demonstrated by the applicant.
C. It has been determined that the
proposed use is needed in the imme-

92
diate area and that suitable alternative locations are unavailable.
(2) In the case of a proposed offstreet parking or loading area or
driveway, one or both of the following conditions apply.
A. The size, shape or layout of the
subject property does not permit
placement of the parking, loading or
driveway in a more suitable location.
B. It has been demonstrated by
the applicant that placement of the
parking, loading or driveway in an
allowed location would jeopardize
the continued occupancy of the subject property by uses suited to the
PRO District.
(3) In the case of a buildingenclosed use that does not have an
entrance from the Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage, one or both of the
following conditions apply.
A. The proposed use will occupy
an existing building that lacks such
pedestrian entrance, and the addition of a conforming pedestrian
entrance is made infeasible by the
configuration of the interior space or
other factors related to the design
and placement of the building.
B. Placement of the pedestrian
entrance in a location other than on
the
Pedestrian
Retail
Street
Frontage will result in more suitable pedestrian access.
(4) In the case of a proposed use
with more than forty (40) feet of
frontage along the Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage, the subject space
was designed for use at such size
and the proposed use, in the determination of the City Planning Commission,
will
not
have
adverse
impacts on the functioning of nearby pedestrian-oriented retail uses.
(5) In the case of an interior side
yard more than four (4) feet in
width and located within forty (40)
feet
of
a
Pedestrian
Retail
Frontage, the subject building will
be occupied by residential units
which require the greater side yard
area to allow for desirable levels of
light and air.
(g) Maximum Setbacks. Notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
the
underlying zoning district, properties in PRO Districts shall conform
to the following regulations with
respect to maximum setbacks.
(1) Front Street Yard. No main
building on a lot abutting a Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage shall be
