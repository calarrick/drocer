REPORT OF THE BOARD
OF BUILDING STANDARDS
AND BUILDING APPEALS
NO MEETING

CITY OF CLEVELAND
ELECTRIC AGGREGATION
PROGRAM
RULES AND REGULATIONS
The City of Cleveland (“City”) has
created an Electric Aggregation
Program (“Aggregation Program”) to
provide electric generation and related services to customers of The
Cleveland
Electric
Illuminating
Company (“CEI”) who reside in the
City. The City has contracted with
WPS Energy Services, Inc. (“WPS”)
to provide the services for the
Aggregation Program. CEI will continue to provide transmission, distrib ution and ancillary services to customers in the Aggregation Program.
The
following
Rules
and
Regulations have been promulgated
pursuant to Ordinance No. 1960-2000,
passed by the Council of the City of
Cleveland on November 20, 2000.
I. Enrollment
As permitted by state law, the City
created an “opt-out” Aggregation
Program. Under this program, customers are automatically included in
the Aggregation Program. Customers
who wish to participate need not take
any action. Customers who do not
wish to participate must take action
in one of the following three ways:
First, customers may opt-out of the
Aggregation Program by returning
the opt-out postcard enclosed with the
initial notice within ten (10) days.
Second, the customers who did not
return the opt-out postcard are provided another opportunity, called the
Free Switching Period. Notices of the
Free Switching Period are sent to customers once the City and WPS finalize the rates that will be charged to
customers. Customers who receive a
Free Switching Period Notice and do
not wish to participate in the
Aggregation Program will have fourteen (14) days to return an enclosed
post card stating that they do not
want to participate.
Third, customers may opt out by
telephone at any time before the end
of the Free Switching Period by calling the WPS customer service number
at 216-361-1098, or toll-free at 1-800-2772157. All calls are recorded.
Customers who do not opt out by one
of these three methods are automatically enrolled in the Aggregation
Program. There are no charges for
opting out of the program at any time
before the end of the Free Switching
Period. Aggregation Program customers who opt out or switch to another supplier after the Free Switching
Period at the same location shall be
charged a switching fee.
Customers who move into the City
after program start-up, or who are in
the program and move to a different
location within the City, are eligible
to participate in the program at the
Free
Switching
Period
rate.
Customers who choose to join the
Aggregation Program at a later date,
including customers that previously
opted
out
of
the
Aggregation
Program, will be accepted into the
program at either the rate offered
during the Free Switching Period or
at a rate based on market prices.
Customers who opt out of the
Aggregation Program will automati-

cally be provided electric service by
CEI under CEI’s then-current rates.
II. Term of Enrollment
Enrollment in the Aggregation
Program is for a two-year term. Upon
the conclusion of the first term, program customers will receive a notice
stating the rates for the new term and
offering the customers the ability to
opt-out of the program without
charge by returning an enclosed postcard. The opt-out period beginning
with the second term shall be twentyone (21) days in duration.
III. Switching Fees
CEI will charge WPS a $5.00 switching fee for each customer enrolled in
the Aggregation Program. This $5.00
switching fee will be assessed to each
Aggregation Program participant
and will appear on the first month’s
bill. Aggregation Program customers
who switch to another supplier during the first year of the term for service at the same location shall be
charged a $50.00 switching fee.
Customers who switch suppliers during the second year of the term shall
be charged a $25.00 switching fee.
IV. Supplier Switch to WPS
CEI processes a customer’s switch
to an alternate generation supplier
such as WPS at the time of the customer’s monthly meter read. CEI
requires WPS to submit accounts to
be switched twelve (12) business
days prior to the scheduled meter
read
date.
Service
under
the
Aggregation Program commences
after the meter is read.
V. Rates
WPS offers the following electric
generation rates for residential and
commercial customers served by the
Aggregation Program.
Residential
July 2001-May 2002
$.0420/kWh
Residential
June 2002-May 2003
$.0455/kWh
Commercial-CEI Rate 105
May 2001-April 2002
$.0415/KWh
Commercial-CEI Rate 105
May 2002-April 2003
$.0430/KWh
VI. Billin g and Collection Policy
Billing
All customers will continue to
receive a monthly bill from CEI,
which will include charges from WPS
for the electric generation portion of
their bill. Customers are billed according to their CEI bill cycle. CEI bills
customers monthly, in 21 billing
cycles throughout the month.
Payment Terms
Customers are required to pay their
entire CEI bill in a timely manner to
avoid late charges and to maintain
good standing in the program. All
payments are applied to the CEI portion of the bill first. WPS’s charges
will be paid after the amount owed to
CEI is paid in full. Failure to pay the
full amount due, including WPS’s
charges, will lead to termination from
the program. CEI’s billing process
allows residential customers fifteen
(15) days to pay the bill and commercial customers twenty-one (21) days.
At the time of billing, CEI provides
past due notices on accounts thirty
(30) days past due and disconnection
notices to accounts sixty (60) days

2164

August 29, 2001
past due. The CEI notices will include
CEI’s charges to the customer and
will not include WPS’s charges.
Collection Process
Customers are obligated to keep
their accounts current. If WPS does
not receive payment by the bill due
date and an account balance exceeding $25.00 remains past due for thirty
(30) days at the time of billing, a written ten (10) day Past-Due Notice will
be issued. Accounts with a balance
exceeding $25.00 past due sixty (60)
days at the time of billing, and that
were previously issued a Past Due
Notice, will be issued a ten (10) day
written Notification of Intent to
Terminate letter. Accounts remaining
past due after the ten (10) day
Notification of Intent to Terminate
letter will be sent a Program
Termination and Payment Request
Notice. If amounts owed to WPS are
not paid in full within fifteen (15)
days of issuance of the Program
Termination and Payment Request
Notice,
accounts
with
balances
exceeding $25.00 past due will be terminated from the Aggregation Program and returned to CEI. Customers
with accounts returned to CEI for
non-payment are still obligated to pay
WPS the balance owed on the
account.
Customer accounts continuing as
past due after termination from the
Aggregation Program due to nonpayment may be turned over to a collection agency and reported to the credit
bureau, after ten (10) days’ written
notification.
VII. Dispute Resolution
WPS will attempt to resolve all customer complaints in a timely and
good faith manner. Initial response to
the customer’s concern will occur
within five (5) calendar days of complaint.
WPS will investigate customer complaints received from the Public
Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO)
and provide a status report to the cus tomer and the PUCO within five (5)
calendar days.
If an investigation into a complaint
received from the customer or a complaint referred by the PUCO is not
completed within fourteen (14) calen dar days, then a status report will be
given to the customer, and, if applicable, the PUCO. These status reports
will be given every five (5) calendar
days until the investigation is complete, unless the action that must be
taken takes longer than five (5) days
and the customer has been notified.
Final results of a Commission referred complaint will be provided to
the PUCO either orally (phone) or in
writing (e-mail, written correspondence), no later than five (5) calendar
days after the investigation is completed. The final results will be provided in writing to the customer no
later than five (5) calendar days after
the investigation is completed.
Customers retain the right to contact the PUCO regarding complaints
and disputes. WPS will provide customers with the current address, telephone numbers, including TDD/TTY
telephone numbers, of the PUCO.
Records of customer complaints will
be retained for one (1) year after the
occurrence of the complaint. A copy of
the complaint record will be provided
to the PUCO within five (5) days, if
requested.

An emergency resolution objecting to the closing by Dominion East
Ohio Gas Company of its Payment
and Billing Explanation Center in
Downtown Cleveland, and requesting that the Company reconsider its
decision.
Whereas, Dominion East Ohio Gas
Company has announced the closing
of its last two Payment and Billing
Explanation Centers, including one
located in Downtown Cleveland as
of September 8, 2001, and
Whereas,
72,000
customers
of
Dominion East Ohio Gas Company
depend upon these walk-in Payment
and Billing Explanation Centers,
which provide customers with the
immediate ability to, among other
things, have questions answered,
schedule
investigations
and
rereads, and have gas turned on or
off, and
Whereas, without a walk-in Payment and Billing Explanation Center, customers will be limited to
unreliable call-in centers to have
questions and problems handled,
and such centers often fail to provide proper accessibility and service
to consumers; and
Whereas, for making payments
customers will have to pay up to
$1.00 per transaction to process payments at a store, bank or other business
that
has
contracted
with
Dominion East Ohio to handle such
transactions; and more than a third
of such centers accept cash only;
and
Whereas, the need for personal
contact with representatives of the
gas company has greatly increased
with the advent in October of 2000
of the gas choice program, which
has created confusion and concern
among consumers, and with the
huge increases in rates, causing
many customers to incur delinquencies and require assistance to establish payment arrangements in order
to maintain service; and
Whereas, the closing of Dominion
East Ohio’s Payment and Billing
Explanation Center in Cleveland
would be a blatant attack on consumers in order to save the Company money as it seeks to compete
with gas marketers; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland objects to the clos-

August 29, 2001
ing of the Dominion East Ohio Gas
Company
Payment
and
Billing
Explanation Center in Downtown
Cleveland, and urges Dominion East
Ohio to reconsider the closing in
order to adequately serve the needs
of the poor, elderly, and most vulnerable residents of the City of
Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution the
Chairman of the Public Utilities
Commission of Ohio and to Dominion East Ohio Gas Company.
Section 3. That this resolution is

August 29, 2001
In the event that the Director of
Finance determines that the City’s
best interests will be served by causing all or a portion of the Temporary
Bonds to be obligations bearing
interest at variable rates, redeemable
by the City without penalty or premium on interest adjustment dates,
then the Director of Finance is
authorized to so specify in the Certificate of Award. If the Director of
Finance so determines, then the
Director of Finance shall specify in
the Certificate of Award the method
and procedure by which the variable
rate of interest to be borne by the
variable rate Temporary Bonds shall
be determined, whether by reference
to a market index, by a remarketing
agent or otherwise; provided that the
variable rate Temporary Bonds shall
not bear interest at a rate in excess
of twelve percent (12%) per annum.
That maximum interest rate shall
not apply to variable rate Temporary
Bonds during any period those Temporary Bonds are held by a provider
of
a
Credit
Support Instrument
because they could not be remarketed and the terms of the Credit Support Instrument do not permit such
a maximum rate of interest. Holders
of variable rate Temporary Bonds
may be given the right to tender
their variable rate Temporary Bonds
for purchase by the City at the times,
on the terms, and subject to the conditions set forth in the Certificate of
Award and any tender agreement;
provided that tender rights shall be
exercisable only at such times as a
Credit Support Instrument is in place
that provides for the payment of the
purchase price payable to the tendering holder of a variable rate Temporary Bond. If the Director of
Finance designates any Temporary
Bonds as variable rate Temporary
Bonds, and if the holders of the variable rate Temporary Bonds are to be
entitled to tender the variable rate
Temporary Bonds for purchase, then
the Director of Finance shall also
designate in the Certificate of Award
for those variable rate Temporary
Bonds the provider or providers for
any Credit Support Instrument, the
tender agent or agents and the
remarketing agent or agents, which
designations shall be based on the
determination of the Director of
Finance that the parties so designated possess the requisite resources
and experience to provide the services required of them and that the
terms on which the designated parties have agreed to provide such services are fair and commercially reasonable. The Director of Finance is
authorized to enter into agreements
in connection with the delivery of
the variable rate Temporary Bonds,
and from time to time thereafter so
long as the variable rate Temporary
Bonds are outstanding, with providers of Credit Support Instruments,
tender agents (which may be the
Registrar), remarketing agents, and
others as may be determined by the
Director of Finance to be necessary
or appropriate to provide for the
method of determining the variable
interest rates, permitting holders the
right of tender, providing for liquidity or credit support for the payment
of the
variable
rate Temporary
Bonds upon tender for purchase or
redemption, and providing for the
repayment
by
the City of any
amounts drawn under the Credit Support Instrument.
The Director of Finance, in connection with the original issuance of
the Temporary Bonds, and regard-

August 29, 2001
less of the Temporary Bonds bearing interest at variable or fixed
rates, is authorized to contract for a
Credit Support Instrument, and to
pay the costs of it from proceeds of
the Temporary Bonds, if she determines
that
the
Credit
Support
Instrument will result in a savings
in the cost of this financing to the
City.
Section
4.
Payment
of
Debt
Charges on the Temporary Bonds.
The debt charges on the Temporary
Bonds shall be payable in lawful
money of the United States of America, or in Federal Reserve funds of
the United States of America as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance in the Certificate of Award,
and shall be payable, without deduction for services of the Registrar as
the City’s paying agent. If agreed to
by the Original Purchaser, the Temporary Bonds shall be subject to
redemption without penalty or premium at the option of the City in
whole or in part at any time prior
to maturity as provided in this Ordinance.
If fewer than all of the Temporary Bonds of a single maturity are
to be redeemed, the selection of
Temporary Bonds of that maturity
to be redeemed, or portions thereof
in amounts of the minimum authorized denomination or any integral
multiple thereof, shall be made by
lot in a manner determined by the
Registrar. In the case of a partial
redemption of Temporary Bonds by
lot
when
Temporary
Bonds
of
denominations greater than the minimum authorized denomination are
then outstanding, each unit of principal thereof in the amount of the
minimum authorized denomination
shall be treated as if it were a separate Temporary Bond of the denomination of the minimum authorized
denomination. If it is determined
that one or more, but not all, of the
units of principal amount in the
amount of the minimum authorized
denomination represented by a Temporary Bonds are to be called for
redemption, then, upon notice of
redemption of such unit or units, the
registered owner of that Temporary
Bond shall surrender the Temporary
Bond to the Registrar (i) for payment of the redemption price of such
unit or units of principal amount
called for redemption (including,
without
limitation,
the
interest
accrued
to
the
date
fixed
for
redemption), and (ii) for issuance,
without charge to the registered
owner, of a new Temporary Bond or
Temporary Bonds of any authorized
denomination or denominations in
an
aggregate
principal
amount
equal to the unmatured and unredeemed portion of, and bearing
interest at the same rate and maturing on the same date as, the Temporary Bond surrendered.
The notice of the call for redemption of Temporary Bonds shall identify (i) by designation, letters, numbers, or other distinguishing marks,
the Temporary Bonds or portions
thereof to be redeemed, (ii) the
redemption price to be paid, (iii) the
date fixed for redemption, and (iv)
the place or places where the
amounts due upon redemption are
payable. The notice shall be given
by the Registrar on behalf of the
City by mailing a copy of the
redemption notice by first class
mail, postage prepaid, at least 30
days prior to the date fixed for
redemption, to the registered owner
of each Temporary Bond subject to

The City Record
redemption in whole or in part at
the
registered
owner’s
address
shown on the Register (as defined
in Section 5) maintained by the Registrar at the close of business on the
15th day preceding that mailing.
Failure to receive notice by mail or
any defect in that notice regarding
any Temporary Bond, however, shall
not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any
Temporary Bond.
In the event that notice of redemption shall have been given by the
Registrar to the registered owners
as provided above, there shall be
deposited with the Registrar on or
prior to the redemption date, moneys
that, in addition to any other moneys available therefor and held by
the Registrar, will be sufficient to
redeem at the redemption price
thereof, plus accrued interest to the
redemption
date,
all
of
the
redeemable Temporary Bonds for
which notice of redemption has been
given. Notice having been mailed in
the manner provided in the preceding paragraph hereof, the Temporary Bonds and portions thereof
called for redemption shall become
due and payable on the redemption
date, and, upon presentation and surrender thereof at the place or places
specified in that notice, shall be paid
at the redemption price, plus accrued
interest to the redemption date. If
moneys for the redemption of all of
the Temporary Bonds and portions
thereof to be redeemed, together
with accrued interest thereon to the
redemption date, are held by the
Registrar on the redemption date, so
as to be available therefor on that
date and, if notice of redemption has
been deposited in the mail as aforesaid,
then from
and
after
the
redemption date those Bonds and
portions thereof called for redemption shall cease to bear interest and
no longer shall be considered to be
outstanding. If those moneys shall
not be so available on the redemption date, or that notice shall not
have been deposited in the mail as
aforesaid, those Temporary Bonds
and portions thereof shall continue
to bear interest, until they are paid,
at the same rate as they would have
borne had they not been called for
redemption. All moneys held by the
Registrar for the redemption of particular Temporary Bonds shall be
held in trust for the account of the
registered owners thereof and shall
be paid to them, respectively, upon
presentation and surrender of those
Temporary Bonds.
Section 5. Registrar. The Director
of Finance shall designate a bank
or trust company to act as the
authenticating
agent,
registrar,
transfer agent, and paying agent for
the Temporary Bonds after determining that the payment at that
bank or trust company will not
endanger the funds or securities of
the City and that proper procedures
and safeguards are available for
that purpose (the “Registrar”). The
Director of Finance shall sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, a registrar agreement or
agreements between the City and
the Registrar (the “Registrar Agreement”) in a form consistent with
this Ordinance and as approved by
the Director of Law. In the event
that a trust agreement secures the
Temporary Bonds, as provided in
Section 10, the Registrar Agreement
may be incorporated in such trust
agreement. The Director of Finance
shall provide for the payment of the

2191

37
services rendered and for reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the Registrar Agreement
from the proceeds of the Temporary
Bonds to the extent available and
then from other money lawfully
available and appropriated or to be
appropriated for that purpose.
The Temporary Bonds shall be
issued only as fully registered Temporary Bonds. Principal on the Temporary Bonds shall be payable when
due upon presentation and surrender
of the Temporary Bonds at the designated office of the Registrar designated in the Registrar Agreement.
Interest on each Temporary Bond
shall be paid on each interest payment date by check or draft mailed
to the person in whose name the
Temporary Bond was registered,
and to that person’s address appearing on the Register (defined below
in this Section) at the close of business on the 15th day of the calendar month next preceding that interest payment date. The City will
cause the Registrar to maintain and
keep all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange,
and transfer of Temporary Bonds as
provided in this Section (the “Register”) so long as any of the Temporary Bonds remain outstanding.
Subject to the provisions of this Section, the person in whose name a
Temporary Bond is registered on the
Register shall be regarded as the
absolute owner of that Temporary
Bond for all purposes of the Proceedings. Payment of or on account
of the debt charges on any Temporary Bond shall be made only to or
upon the order of that person; neither the City nor the Registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be
changed as provided in this Section.
All such payments shall be valid
and effectual to satisfy and discharge the City’s liability upon the
Temporary Bond, including interest,
to the extent of the amount or
amounts so paid.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
and so long as the Temporary Bonds
are issued in a book entry system,
principal of and interest on the Temporary Bonds shall be payable in
the manner provided in any agreement entered into by the Director of
Finance, in the name and on behalf
of the City, in connection with the
book entry system.
Section 6. Transfer and Exchange
of Certain Temporary Bonds. Temporary Bonds may be exchanged for
Temporary Bonds of any authorized
denomination upon presentation and
surrender at the office designated by
the
Registrar,
together
with
a
request for exchange signed by the
registered owner or by a person
legally empowered to do so in a form
satisfactory to the Registrar. A Temporary Bond may be transferred only
on the Register upon presentation
and surrender of the Temporary
Bond at the office designated by the
Registrar together with an assignment signed by the registered owner
or by a person legally empowered to
do so in a form satisfactory to the
Registrar. Upon exchange or transfer, the Registrar shall complete,
authenticate, and deliver a new Temporary Bond or Temporary Bonds, of
any
authorized
denomination
or
authorized denominations requested
by the owner equal in the aggregate
to the unmatured principal amount
of the Temporary Bond surrendered
and bearing interest at the same rate
and maturing on the same date.

38
If manual signatures on behalf of
the City are required, the Registrar
shall undertake the exchange or
transfer of Temporary Bonds only
after the new Temporary Bonds are
signed by the authorized officers of
the City. In all cases of Temporary
Bonds exchanged or transferred, the
City shall sign and the Registrar
shall authenticate and deliver Temporary Bonds in accordance with the
provisions of the Proceedings. The
exchange or transfer shall be without charge to the owner, except that
the City and Registrar may make a
charge sufficient to reimburse them
for any tax or other governmental
charge required to be paid with
respect to the exchange or transfer.
The City or the Registrar may
require that those charges, if any,
be paid before the procedure is
begun for the exchange or transfer.
All Temporary Bonds issued and
authenticated upon any exchange or
transfer shall be valid special obligations of the City, evidencing the
same obligation, and entitled to the
same security and benefit under the
Proceedings,
as
the
Temporary
Bonds
surrendered
upon
that
exchange or transfer. Neither the
City nor the Registrar shall be
required to make any exchange or
transfer of a Temporary Bond during the period beginning at the
opening of business 15 days before
the day of the mailing of a notice
of redemption of Temporary Bonds
and ending at the close of business
on the day of such mailing or to
transfer or exchange any Temporary Bond selected for redemption in
whole or in part.
Section 7. Book Entry. Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this Ordinance, if it is determined
by the Director of Finance to be in
the best interests of and financially
advantageous to the City, the Temporary Bonds may be issued in book
entry form in accordance with the
provisions of this Section. As used
in this Section and this Ordinance:
The Temporary Bonds may be
issued to a Depository for use in a
book entry system and, if and as
long as a book entry system is utilized, (i) the Temporary Bonds may
be issued in the form of a single,
fully registered Temporary Bond
representing each maturity and registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee, as registered
owner, and immobilized in the custody of the Depository; (ii) the book
entry interest owners of Temporary
Bonds in book entry form shall have
no
right
to
receive
Temporary
Bonds in the form of physical securities or certificates; (iii) ownership
of book entry interests in book
entry form shall be shown by book
entry on the system maintained and
operated by the Depository and its
Participants, and transfers of the
ownership of book entry interests
shall be made only by book entry
by the Depository and its Participants;
and
(iv)
the
Temporary
Bonds as such shall not be transferable or exchangeable, except for
transfer to another Depository or to
another nominee of a Depository,
without further action by the City.
If any Depository determines not
to continue to act as a Depository
for the Temporary Bonds for use in
a book entry system, the Director of
Finance may attempt to establish a
securities
depository/book
entry
relationship with another qualified
Depository.
If
the
Director
of
Finance does not or is unable to do

The City Record
so, the Director of Finance, after
making provision for notification of
the book entry interest owners by
the then Depository and any other
arrangements
deemed
necessary,
shall permit withdrawal of the Temporary Bonds from the Depository,
and authenticate and deliver certificates in registered form to the
assigns of the Depository or its
nominee, all at the cost and expense
(including any costs of printing), if
the event is not the result of City
action or inaction, of those persons
requesting such issuance.
The Director of Finance also is
hereby authorized and directed to
the extent necessary or required to
enter into any agreements determined necessary in connection with
the book entry system for the Temporary Bonds, after determining
that the signing thereof will not
endanger the funds or securities of
the City and after the approval of
the form of any such agreement by
the Director of Law.
Section 8. Execution of Temporary
Bonds. Temporary Bonds shall be
signed by the Mayor and the Director of Finance, in the name of the
City and in their official capacities,
provided that either or both of those
signatures may be a facsimile, and
shall bear the seal of the City or a
facsimile thereof; provided that no
Temporary Bond shall be valid or
obligatory for any purpose or shall
be entitled to any security or benefit under the Proceedings unless and
until the certificate of authentication printed on the Temporary Bond
is signed by the Registrar as
authenticating agent, and authentication by the Registrar shall be conclusive evidence that the Temporary
Bond so authenticated has been duly
issued, signed and delivered under,
and is entitled to the security and
benefit of, the Proceedings. The certificate of authentication may be
signed by any authorized officer or
employee of the Registrar or by any
other person acting as an agent of
the Registrar and approved by the
Director of Finance on behalf of the
City. The same person need not sign
the certificate of authentication on
all of the Temporary Bonds.
Pursuant to Section 83 of the
City’s Charter, the Director of Law
shall prepare the Temporary Bonds
and
shall
endorse
thereon
his
approval of the form and correctness
thereof by his manual or facsimile
signature. The Temporary Bonds
shall be issued in the denominations
as requested by the Original Purchaser and approved by the Director
of Finance, in conformity with this
Ordinance.
The
entire
principal
amount may be represented by a single bond certificate and may be
issued as fully registered securities
and in book entry or other uncertificated form if it is determined by
the
Director
of
Finance
that
issuance of fully registered securities in that form will facilitate the
sale and delivery of the Temporary
Bonds. The Temporary Bonds may
be issued in the authorized denominations of either (a) $100,000 each
or in any denomination that is the
sum of (i) $100,000 and (ii) $5,000 or
any integral multiple thereof, and
not exchangeable for other Temporary Bonds in denominations less
than $100,000, or (b) $5,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, as determined by the Director of Finance in
the Certificate of Award to be in the
best interests of the City. The Temporary Bonds shall not have coupons

2192

August 29, 2001
attached, shall be numbered as
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance and shall express upon
their faces the purpose, in summary
terms, for which they are issued and
that they are issued pursuant to this
Ordinance.
Section 9. Sale of Temporary
Bonds. The Temporary Bonds shall
be sold at not less than 97% of par
plus accrued interest at private sale
by the Director of Finance to the
Original Purchaser in accordance
with law and the provisions of this
Ordinance. If, in the reasonable
opinion of the Director of Finance,
an underwriter is incapable of fully
performing its duties or meeting its
obligations in its capacity as Original Purchaser with respect to the
Temporary Bonds, the Director of
Finance is hereby authorized and
directed, in the name of and on
behalf of the City, to take whatever action may be necessary to terminate that underwriter’s standing
as Original Purchaser. The Director
of Finance shall sign the Certificate
of Award referred to in this Ordinance, evidencing that sale to the
Original Purchaser, cause the Temporary Bonds to be prepared, and
have the Temporary Bonds signed
and delivered, together with a true
transcript of proceedings with reference to the issuance of the Temporary Bonds if requested by the
Original Purchaser, to the Original
Purchaser upon payment of the purchase price. The Director of Finance
is authorized to sign and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of the City,
a bond purchase agreement between
the City and the Original Purchaser, or representative thereof (the
“Purchase Agreement”), in a form
consistent with this Ordinance and
as approved by the Director of Law.
The Director of Finance shall provide for the payment of the services
rendered and for reimbursement of
expenses incurred pursuant to the
Purchase Agreement from the proceeds of the Temporary Bonds to the
extent available and then from
other money lawfully available and
appropriated or to be appropriated
for that purpose. The Mayor, the
Director of Finance, the Clerk, the
Director of Law, and other City officials, as appropriate, are each authorized and directed to sign any transcript certificates, financial statements and other documents and
instruments
and
to
take
such
actions as are necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Ordinance.
Section 10. Security for the Temporary Bonds. The Temporary Bonds
shall be special obligations of the
City, and the debt charges on the
Temporary Bonds shall be payable
solely from the Revenues and the
Nontax Revenues. The payment of
debt charges
on
the Temporary
Bonds is secured by a pledge of and
lien on (i) the Revenues and (ii) the
Nontax
Revenues which
are
on
deposit in the Urban Renewal Debt
Retirement Fund created below. The
Temporary Bonds are not and shall
not be secured by an obligation or
pledge of any money raised by taxation. The Temporary Bonds do not
and shall not represent or constitute
a debt or pledge of the faith and
credit or taxing power of the City,
and the owners thereof have and
shall have no right to have taxes
levied by the City for the payment of
debt charges thereon. The Temporary
Bonds shall contain a statement to

August 29, 2001
that effect and to the effect that the
Temporary Bonds are payable solely
from the Revenues and the Nontax
Revenues and are not secured by an
obligation or pledge of any money
raised by taxation.
The City covenants and agrees
that while the Temporary Bonds are
outstanding, it will appropriate and
maintain Nontax Revenues at such
times and in such amounts as will
be sufficient, together with the Revenues and any other funds available
for the purpose, to pay the debt
charges on the Temporary Bonds
and will so restrict other obligations
payable from Nontax Revenues prior
to or on a parity with the Temporary Bonds as will ensure the continuing availability for appropriation of sufficient Nontax Revenues
to pay debt charges when due,
which Nontax Revenues are hereby
selected by the City pursuant to Section 725.05(C) of the Revised Code
as moneys that are not raised by
taxation.
There is hereby created by the
City a separate fund or account designated as the “Urban Renewal Debt
Retirement Fund” (the “Debt Retirement Fund”) into which shall be
deposited (i) the Revenues upon
receipt, and (ii) other Nontax Revenues on or prior to the date debt
charges on the Temporary Bonds
are due, in an amount sufficient to
pay those debt charges. Any Revenues remaining after payment, or
provision for payment, of all debt
charges on the Temporary Bonds
shall be deposited, to the extent not
otherwise pledged or encumbered,
as follows: half in the Housing
Trust Fund (Fund No. 14 SF 027)
and half the Neighborhood Development Investment Fund (Fund No. 10
SF 501).
Nothing herein shall be construed
as requiring the City to use or apply
to the payment of debt charges on
the Temporary Bonds any funds or
revenues from any source other than
Revenues and the Nontax Revenues.
Nothing herein, however, shall be
deemed to prohibit the City, of its
own volition, from using, to the
extent that it is authorized by law
to do so, any other resources for the
fulfillment of any of the terms, conditions or obligations of this Ordinance or of the Temporary Bonds.
The City will, solely from the proceeds of the Temporary Bonds or
from the Revenues or the Nontax
Revenues, pay or cause to be paid
the debt charges on the Temporary
Bonds on the dates, at the places
and in the manner provided herein
and in the Temporary Bonds. For
that purpose, in each year while the
Temporary Bonds are outstanding,
this Council, after providing for the
payment of debt charges payable on
the City’s general obligation securities in that year from sources available for that purpose, will appropriate Nontax Revenues required to
pay, and for the purpose of paying,
the debt charges due in that year on
the Temporary Bonds and any outstanding parity obligations payable
from Nontax Revenues. Further, this
Council will give effect to such
appropriations in all ordinances it
passes thereafter in that year appropriating money for expenditure and
encumbrance and limit the other
appropriations of Nontax Revenues
in that year to the amount available
after deducting the amount required
for the payment of debt charges
payable on the City’s general obligation securities and to pay those

The City Record
debt charges. The City covenants
that, so long as any of the Temporary Bonds are outstanding, it shall
not issue any additional obligations
payable from the Nontax Revenues
on a parity with the Temporary
Bonds and any outstanding parity
obligations payable from Nontax
Revenues, unless, prior to passage
of the ordinance authorizing such
parity obligations, the Director of
Finance shall have certified to this
Council that the Nontax Revenues
during the preceding calendar year,
adjusted to reflect, if necessary,
changes in the rates or charges
resulting in the Nontax Revenues,
aggregate in amount not less than
100% of the highest amount of (a)
debt charges on the Temporary
Bonds and (b) required payments on
such proposed parity obligations
and any outstanding parity obligations due in any succeeding calendar year.
Each
obligation
of
the
City
required to be undertaken pursuant
to this Ordinance and the Temporary Bonds is binding upon the City,
and upon each officer or employee
of the City as may from time to time
have the authority under law to
take any action on behalf of the
City as may be necessary to perform
all or any part of such obligation,
as a duty of the City and of each of
those officers and employees resulting from an office, trust or station
within
the
meaning
of
Section
2731.01 of the Revised Code, providing for enforcement by writ of mandamus.
In the event that the interest on
the Temporary Bonds is to be provided for from Temporary Bond proceeds, or if in the judgment of the
Director of Finance, after consultation with the Financial Advisor, a
debt service reserve to secure the
Temporary Bonds is in the best
interest of and financially advantageous to the City, the City shall
enter into a trust agreement with
the bank or trust company serving
as Registrar for the Temporary
Bonds and providing for the Debt
Fund or a debt service reserve fund,
as applicable, to be held by that
bank or trust company, in its capacity as trustee, and such fund or
funds are hereby authorized. The
Director of Finance shall sign and
deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the City, the trust agreement in
a form consistent with this Ordinance and approved by the Director
of Law. The Mayor and the Director
of Finance and other City officials,
as appropriate, are authorized to
take such actions as are necessary
or appropriate to consummate such
additional security for the Temporary
Bonds.
The
City
hereby
covenants and agrees to appropriate
annually from the Revenues and the
Nontax Revenues into any such
funds amounts sufficient to maintain the balances required by the
trust agreement and to restore any
deficiency therein.
Section 11. Project Fund; Deposit
of Proceeds. The proceeds from the
sale of the Temporary Bonds are
appropriated and shall be used for
the purpose for which the Temporary Bonds are being issued. The
City hereby creates, and orders
maintained as a separate fund or as
a separate account, in the custody
and control of the City, a fund designated the “Erieview Urban Renewal
Project
Fund”
(the
“Project
Fund”). The proceeds from the sale
of the Temporary Bonds (exclusive

2193

39
of amounts to be deposited in the
Debt Retirement Fund, as directed
below) shall be deposited in the Project Fund and are hereby appropriated for and shall be used to pay the
costs of
the Project. Additional
funds, from whatever source, may be
voluntarily deposited in the Project
Fund by the City. The City may
establish separate accounts within
the Project Fund as necessary or
convenient to ascertain the dates,
amounts and sources of deposits. At
such time as disbursements are to be
made from the Project Fund to pay
costs of the Project, the City is
directed to transfer amounts in the
Project Fund to the appropriate fund
or funds of the City from which the
costs of the Project are to be paid.
Any portion of the proceeds of the
Temporary Bonds to be used to pay
interest on the Temporary Bonds or
to make a required deposit to a debt
service reserve fund shall be paid
into the Debt Retirement Fund and
any
debt
service
reserve
fund,
respectively, created pursuant to Section 10. Any premium and accrued
interest received from the sale of the
Temporary Bonds shall be deposited
in the Debt Retirement Fund.
Section 12. Disclosure. If, in the
judgment of the Director of Finance,
after consultation with the Financial
Advisor and the Original Purchaser,
an official statement or other disclosure document is appropriate relating
to the initial offering of the Temporary Bonds, the Director of Finance,
on behalf of the City and in that officer’s official capacity, is authorized
to (i) cooperate with the Original
Purchaser in the preparation of, and
the making of modifications, completions or changes of or supplements
to, such a disclosure document, (ii)
determine, and to certify or otherwise
represent, when the disclosure document is to be deemed final or is final,
(iii) authorize the use and distribution of that disclosure document and
any supplements thereto in connection with the initial offering of the
Temporary Bonds, and (iv) sign certificates, statements or other documents in connection with the finality, accuracy, and completeness of
that disclosure document.
For the benefit of the holders and
beneficial owners from time to time
of the Temporary Bonds, the City
agrees, as the only obligated person
with respect to the Temporary Bonds
under the Rule, to provide or cause
to be provided such financial information and operating data, audited
financial statements and notices, in
such manner, as may be required for
purposes of paragraph (b)(5)(i) of
the Rule. In order to describe and
specify certain terms of the City’s
continuing disclosure agreement for
that purpose, and thereby to implement that agreement, including provisions for enforcement, amendment,
and termination, the Director of
Finance is authorized and directed
to sign and deliver, in the name and
on behalf of the City, and if required
under the Rule, a Continuing Disclosure Certificate or Certificates in
conformance
with
the
reporting
requirements of the Rule. The agreement formed, collectively, by this
paragraph and that Certificate, shall
be the City’s continuing disclosure
agreement for purposes of the Rule,
and its performance shall be subject
to the annual appropriation of any
funds that may be necessary to perform it.
The Director of Finance is further
authorized and directed to establish

40
procedures in order to ensure compliance by the City with its continuing disclosure agreement, including the timely provision of information and notices. Prior to making
any filing in accordance with that
agreement or providing notice of the
occurrence of any other events, the
Director of Finance shall consult
with, as appropriate, the legal counsel and bond or other qualified independent special counsel to the City.
The Director of Finance, acting in
the name and on behalf of the City,
shall be entitled to rely upon any
legal advice provided by any such
counsel in determining whether a
filing should be made.
Section 13. Ratings, Insurance,
and Other Credit Enhancement. If,
in the judgment of the Director of
Finance after consultation with the
Financial Advisor, the filing of an
application for a rating on the Temporary Bonds by one or more nationally recognized rating agencies or a
Credit Support Instrument is in the
best interest of, and financially
advantageous to, the City, the Director of Finance is authorized to prepare and submit those applications,
to provide to each such agency, company or Credit provider such information as may be required for the
purpose. The cost of obtaining each
rating and Credit Support Instrument, except to the extent paid by
the Original Purchaser in accordance with the Purchase Agreement,
shall be paid from the proceeds of
the Temporary Bonds.
Section 14. Interest Rate Swaps,
Hedges and Caps. For the purpose of
achieving the optimal available debt
structure for the Temporary Bonds,
the Director of Finance may, based
on the written advice of the Financial Advisor, enter into one or more
agreements in connection with or
subsequent to the issuance of the
Temporary Bonds for an interest
rate swap, an interest rate cap or
other such arrangement to lower the
effective interest rate on the obligations to the City or to hedge the
exposure of the City against fluctuations in prevailing interest rates,
provided, however, that: (i) the debt
structure that is simulated through
the combination of the Temporary
Bonds with any such agreements
shall comply with the restrictions of
this Ordinance on the terms of and
security for the Temporary Bonds
applied to that structure as though
it consisted solely of Temporary
Bonds; (ii) the counterparty to any
swap agreement and the provider of
any interest rate cap shall have a
rating of at least “A” by either
Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., or
Standard & Poor’s Corporation; (iii)
no such agreement shall purport to
entitle the counterparty to the agreement to payment by the City from
any source other than the sources
which secure the Temporary Bonds
as described in this Ordinance; (iv)
the cost of obtaining any such interest rate cap or other such arrangement shall have been determined by
the Director of Finance, based on the
written advice of the Financial Advisor, to be justified by the corresponding benefit to the City and to
be commercially reasonable based on
then current market conditions. The
notional amount on which any such
agreement is based shall not be subject to the limitations set forth herein on the maximum principal amount
of the Temporary Bonds.
Section 15. Tax Covenants. In the
event that the Temporary Bonds are

The City Record
issued and sold as obligations bearing interest that is excluded from
gross income for federal income tax
purposes, the covenants in this Section 15 shall govern. However, if the
Temporary Bonds are issued and
sold as obligations bearing interest
that is included in gross income for
federal income tax purposes, the
City shall not be bound by the
covenants
of
this
Section
with
respect to the Temporary Bonds.
Subject to the foregoing, the City
covenants that it will use, and will
restrict the use and investment of,
the proceeds of the Temporary
Bonds in such manner and to such
extent as may be necessary so that
(a) the Temporary Bonds will not
(i) constitute private activity bonds,
arbitrage bonds or hedge bonds
under Sections 141, 148 or 149 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the Code) or (ii) be treated other than as bonds to which Section 103(a) of the Code applies, and
(b) the interest on the Temporary
Bonds will not be treated as an item
of tax preference under Section 57
of the Code. The City further
covenants that (a) it will take or
cause to be taken such actions that
may be required of it for the interest on the Temporary Bonds to be
and remain excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes, (b) it will not take or authorize to be taken any actions that
would adversely affect that exclusion, and (c) it, or persons acting
for it, will, among other acts of compliance, (i) apply the proceeds of
the Temporary Bonds to the governmental purpose of the borrowing,
(ii) restrict the yield on investment
property, (iii) make timely and adequate payments to the federal government, (iv) maintain books and
records and make calculations and
reports and (v) refrain from certain
uses of those proceeds, and, as
applicable,
of
property
financed
with such proceeds, all in such manner and to the extent necessary to
assure such exclusion of that interest under the Code.
The Director of Finance, as the
fiscal officer, or any other officer of
the City having responsibility for
issuance of the Temporary Bonds is
hereby authorized (a) to make or
effect any election, selection, designation, choice, consent, approval, or
waiver on behalf of the City with
respect to the Temporary Bonds as
the City is permitted to or required
to make or give under the federal
income tax laws, including, without
limitation thereto, any of the elections
provided
for
in
Section
148(f)(4)(C) of the Code or available under Section 148 of the Code,
for the purpose of assuring, enhancing or protecting favorable tax
treatment or status of the Temporary Bonds or interest thereon or
assisting compliance with requirements for that purpose, reducing the
burden or expense of such compliance, reducing the rebate amount or
payments or penalties, or making
payments of special amounts in lieu
of making computations to determine, or paying, excess earnings as
rebate, or obviating those amounts
or payments, as determined by that
officer, which action shall be in
writing and signed by the officer,
(b) to take any and all other
actions, make or obtain calculations,
make payments, and make or give
reports, covenants and certifications
of and on behalf of the City, as may
be appropriate to assure the exclu-

2194

August 29, 2001
sion of interest from gross income
and the intended tax status of the
Temporary Bonds, and (c) to give
one or more appropriate certificates
of the City, for inclusion in the transcript of proceedings for the Temporary Bonds, setting forth the reasonable expectations of the City
regarding the amount and use of all
the proceeds of the Temporary
Bonds, the facts, circumstances and
estimates on which they are based,
and other facts and circumstances
relevant to the tax treatment of the
interest on and the tax status of the
Temporary Bonds.
Section 16. Purchase of Properties.
The Director of Community Development is authorized to purchase
the Properties, which are more
specifically described in Exhibit A
hereto, by paying to the Escrow
Agent as defined in the Agreements
such funds and executing such documents as may be necessary to
effectuate the repurchase rights of
the City pursuant to the Agreements.
Section 17. Captions, Headings,

Section 18. Interpretation. Any pro visions of the Codified Ordinances
of the City which are inconsistent
with the provisions of this Ordinance shall not apply to the Temporary
Bonds
authorized
herein.
Nothing in this Ordinance is intended to, and no provision hereof shall
be applied in any manner as would,
impair the obligation of contract of
the City with respect to any outstanding bonds, Temporary Bonds,
certificates of indebtedness, other
obligations, trust indentures, trust
agreements, or other agreements or
contracts made or entered into by
the City.

be done or performed by the City or
to have been met precedent to and

Bonds in order to make them legal,
valid, and binding special obligations of the City have been performed and have been met, or will
at the time of delivery of the Temporary Bonds have been performed
and have been met, in regular and
due form as required by law, and
that no limitation of indebtedness or
taxation, either statutory or constitutional,
is
applicable
to
the
issuance of the Temporary Bonds.
Section 20. Compliance with Open

finds and determines that all formal
actions of this Council and any of
its committees concerning and relating to the passage of this Ordinance
were taken in an open meeting of
this Council or committees, and that
all deliberations of this Council and
any of its committees that resulted
in those formal actions were in
meetings open to the public, all in
compliance with the law.

and that the weapon was kept ready
at hand by the actor for defense purposes, while he was engaged in his

actor was not otherwise prohibited
by law from possessing a knife having a blade two and one-half inches

and one-half inches in length or
longer as a tool of trade or pursuit,

longer was kept ready at hand by

(a) of Section 601.99, whoever violates this section is guilty of possessing certain weapons on or about
public places and shall be fined not
