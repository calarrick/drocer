Res. No. 2213-01.
By Councilmen Polensek, Cimperman, Westbrook, Rybka, Cintron,
O’Malley, Sweeney, Britt, White,
Melena, Lewis and Willis.
An emergency resolution stating
Council’s intention to file a motion
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court to oppose
LTV’s proposed cessation of operations, and supporting the workers of
LTV Steel Company in their fight to
keep LTV Steel Company open.
Whereas, LTV Steel Company filed
for bankruptcy protection in December, 2000 and, since that time, financial institutions, representatives of
local, state and federal governments,
union leaders and company representatives have been working cooperatively to secure a viable and stable future for the company; and
Whereas, in a move surprising to
workers and area community leaders, on November 21, 2001, LTV management filed a motion with the
Youngstown bankruptcy court seeking approval to immediately cease
steel making operations in Cleveland, Indiana, Illinois, and to close

2847

11
coke ovens in Warren, Ohio and
Chicago; and
Whereas, if this request of LTV
management is approved by the
bankruptcy
court,
approximately
7,500
people,
including
3,200
in
Cleveland, would lose their jobs; and
Whereas, in addition to the lost
jobs, more than 50,000 LTV retirees
and dependents could lose their
health care and have pension benefits reduced; and
Whereas, this Council vehemently
opposes the proposal of LTV to
cease operations and joins with
local and federal leaders, including
Congressman Dennis Kucinich, in
urging the bankruptcy court to deny
LTV’s motion for closure; and
Whereas, as this Council has experienced, when political, community,
religious and labor leaders joined
together to keep St. Michael Hospital open, we were able to stave off
a closure that we were told even
God could not stop; and
Whereas, the livelihood of thousands of Cleveland families and the
economy of our region will be put
at great peril if LTV is permitted to
close permanently; and
Whereas, it is the intention of this
Council to file a motion on Tuesday,
November 27th in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Youngstown opposing the closure of LTV and requesting the appointment of a trustee to
shepherd LTV through the bankruptcy process so that it may reorganize and remain in operation; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
strongly opposes the cessation of
operations of LTV Steel Company
and intends to file a motion in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court supporting the
position of Congressman Dennis
Kucinich in objecting to LTV’s
rejection of collective bargaining
agreements, termination of retiree
benefit programs, unilateral cessation of negotiations with labor
unions, designation of key assets for
auction and proposed shutdown of
operations without adequate assurances of compliance with environmental standards.
Section
2.
That
this
Council
believes LTV Steel Company can be
saved through the intervention of a
qualified Trustee to manage and

Res. No. 2098-01.
By Councilman Patmon (by departmental request).
An emergency resolution accepting the amounts and rates as determined by the Budget Commission and authorizing the necessary tax levies certifying them to the County Auditor.
Whereas, this Council, in accordance with the provisions of law, has previously adopted a Tax Budget, for the
fiscal year commencing January 1, 2002; and

together with an estimate by the County Auditor of the rate of each tax necessary to be levied by this Council

it shall take effect and be in force

Res. No. 2110-01.
By Councilman Britt.
An emergency resolution withdrawing objection to the renewal of
a C2 and C2X Liquor Permit to 2249
East 105th Street, 1st Fl., and repealing Res. No. 1585-01 objecting to said
renewal.
Whereas, this Council objected to
the renewal of a C2 and C2X Liquor
Permit to 2249 East 105th Street, 1st
Fl., by Res. No. 1585-01 adopted by
Council on August 15,2001; and
Whereas, this Council wishes to
withdraw its objection to the above
renewal and consents to said renewal; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

Res. No. 2111-01.
By Councilman Coats.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio State legislature to review
Chapter 2925 of the Revised Code
and expand the area around a
school in which drug offenses may
be committed to fifteen hundred
feet.
Whereas,
under
Revised
Code
Chapter 2925, a drug offense is “committed in the vicinity of a school” if
the offender commits the offense on
school premises, in a school building, or within one thousand feet of
the
boundaries
of
any
school
premises; and
Whereas, under the Revised Code,
committing a drug offense “within
the vicinity of a school” necessarily
increases
the
penalty
for
such
offense; and
Whereas, drug offenses are committed with increasing regularity
just outside the defined 1000 foot
boundary of school premises, which
allows drug offenders to still traffic
drugs relatively near schools, but to
get a lesser penalty for committing
the offense; and
Whereas, expanding the definition of a drug offense “committed in
the vicinity of a school” to include
offenses committed within fifteen
hundred feet of the boundaries of
any school premises will cause
more drug offenders to be subject
to the enhanced penalty and possibly act as a deterrent to those who
may traffic drugs near our schools,
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio State legislature to review
Chapter 2925 of the Revised Code
and expand the area around a
school in which drug offenses may
be committed to fifteen hundred
feet.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
Governor Bob Taft and the leaders
of the Ohio State legislature.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

An emergency resolution urging
the federal Emergency Steel Loan
Guarantee Board to approve the
request of National City Bank and
Key Bank to guarantee a loan to
LTV Steel Corp.
Whereas, National City Bank and
Key Bank have applied to the federal Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Board seeking federal guarantees to assist in the restructuring of
LTV Steel Corp.; and
Whereas, if granted, the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Board
would guarantee 85% of the principal amount loaned, or $212.5 million
of the $250 million loan; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
Cuyahoga County, the State of Ohio
and an unidentified supplier have
agreed to guarantee 13% of the
loan; and
Whereas, the guaranteed loans
would provide LTV with a critical
element of liquidity and stability
needed during the current economic
downturn and would support the
Company’s development of an operating
cost
structure
competitive
with the lowest cost domestic steel
producers; and
Whereas, without the assistance
of the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Board the fate of LTV Steel
Corp is grim and the plight of its
employees is uncertain; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety of the citizens of the City
of Cleveland; now therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.

By Councilman Coats.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio State legislature to review
Chapter 2925 of the Revised Code
and expand the area around a
school in which increased penalties
are received for committing drug
offenses to fifteen hundred feet.
Whereas,
under
Revised
Code
Chapter 2925, a drug offense is “committed in the vicinity of a school” if
the offender commits the offense on
school premises, in a school building, or within one thousand feet of
the boundaries of any school premises; and
Whereas, under the Revised Code,
committing a drug offense “within
the vicinity of a school” necessarily
increases
the
penalty
for
such
offense; and
Whereas, drug offenses are committed with increasing regularity
just outside the defined 1000 foot
boundary of school premises, which
allows drug offenders to still traffic
drugs relatively near schools, but to
get a lesser penalty for committing
the offense; and
Whereas, expanding the definition
of a drug offense “committed in the
vicinity of a school” to include
offenses committed within fifteen
hundred feet of the boundaries of
any school premises will cause more
drug offenders to be subject to the
enhanced penalty and possibly act
as a deterrent to those who may
traffic drugs near our schools; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio State legislature to review
Chapter 2925 of the Revised Code
and expand the area around a
school in which increased penalties
are received for committing drug
offenses to fifteen hundred feet.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit

Governor Bob Taft and the leaders
of the Ohio State legislature.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
