(l)
Nonconforming
Billboards.
Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 350.19, a legal nonconforming billboard may be replaced or
may be reconstructed to an extent
greater than otherwise permitted if
the City Planning Commission determines that such replacement or
reconstruction will satisfy the following conditions:
(1) Site and Design Improve ments. The site of the new or reconstructed billboard shall be landscaped
and
otherwise
improved,
through use of an ornamental base
or frame, a streamlined support
structure, or similar features effective in improving the appearance of
the site. At a minimum, evergreen
shrubs, at least three (3) feet in
height at the time of planting and
four (4) feet in height after two (2)
growing seasons, shall be planted at
maximum intervals of four (4) feet
along any side of the base of the
billboard oriented toward a public
street. Such planting shall extend at
least the full width of the billboard
panel. In addition, all portions of the
parcel(s) of land on which the billboard site is located shall be planted with grass or other suitable vegetative ground cover between the
billboard and all public streets abutting the parcel(s).
(2) Degree of Nonconformity. The
new or reconstructed billboard shall
be no greater in size, height, number of panels, or any panel dimension than is the existing billboard,
nor shall the new or reconstructed
billboard be less conforming to any
zoning regulation than is the existing billboard.
(3) Location. The new or reconstructed billboard shall be placed in
precisely the same location as the
existing billboard unless the City
Planning
Commission
determines
that a different location on the same
parcel of land would be more effective in meeting the intent of the
sign regulations, as stated in Section 350.01.
(4) Sign Type. With respect to the
“sign types” defined in division (f)
of Section 350.03, the new or reconstructed billboard shall be the same
type as the existing billboard unless
the
City
Planning
Commission
determines that a different sign
type would be more compatible with
the subject property or nearby properties.
(5) Changeable Copy. The new or
reconstructed billboard may incorporate automatic changeable copy
only if such copy is limited to a single billboard panel or two back-toback billboard panels and only if
each such panel replaces two or
more billboard panels on a single
parcel of property or two or more
billboard panels on adjacent properties.
The
replacement
billboard
panel shall not be larger than any
of the billboard panels it is replacing. In the case of a sign utilizing
changeable
copy,
each
message
shall remain fixed for at least eight
(8) seconds.
Section 2. That existing Section
350.10 of the Codified Ordinances of

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 401-01.
By Councilmen Melena, Cintron
and Sweeney.
An emergency resolution strongly
urging the Cleveland Board of Education and Barbara Byrd-Bennett to
immediately help to resolve the service needs and issues of Xavier
Peguero so that he may be considered
for
a
full
scholarship
to
Hawken School.
Whereas, Xavier Peguero is a
visually impaired student at Carl F.
Shuler Middle School in Cleveland;
and
Whereas, in October, 2000, Xavier
was recommended by a counselor at
Shuler Middle School to take the test
for the Leitch Scholarship; and
Whereas, the Leitch Scholarship
enables four schools (Hathaway
Brown School, Hawken School, Laurel School and University School) to
expand their regular programs of
financial aid through the addition of
a limited number of scholarships to
residents of Cleveland and East
Cleveland entering grade 9 or 10
and who require financial assistance of at least one-half tuition;
and
Whereas,
in
January,
2001,
Hawken School informed Shuler
Middle School that it is considering
offering Xavier a full scholarship,
but that more information was necessary as to Xavier’s special needs;
and
Whereas, Xavier’s needs include
transportation, mobility orientation
and Braille services; and
Whereas, the Sight Center of
Greater Cleveland has generously
offered
to
provide
Xavier
with
Braille services and mobility orientation training; and
Whereas, the Cleveland School district has apparently determined that
it will not provide any services to
Xavier at Hawken School; and
Whereas, other service needs of
Xavier must be resolved before
Hawken School is willing to provide
Xavier the scholarship, however,
Cleveland School district is refusing
to help in any way to resolve these
issues; and
Whereas, it is unconscionable that
the Cleveland Board of Education
and
Barbara
Byrd-Bennett
have
failed to comply with the contingency on the scholarship offered to
Xavier, thus abolishing this welldeserving student the chance to
receive a high-quality education at
a renowned Cleveland area high
school
despite
being
visually
impaired; and
Whereas, Hawken School has set
a deadline of March 15, 2001 to
resolve these issues, or Xavier will
not receive the scholarship; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland hereby strongly
urges the Cleveland Board of Edu-

The City Record
cation and Barbara Byrd-Bennett to
immediately help to resolve the service needs and issues of Xavier
Peguero so that he may be considered
for
a
full
scholarship
to
Hawken School.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution
Barbara Byrd-Bennett and all members of the Cleveland Board of Education.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of

that the apportionment of the U.S.
House of Representatives shall be
based upon a national census; and

every member of our city on a daily

consider people who were missed by
census workers; and
Whereas,
Commerce
Secretary
Evans must decide whether to follow
that recommendation or to permit
the census count to be adjusted; and

counted and, as such, the census
data should be adjusted to reflect
the true population of our city; and
Whereas, in the event that the census figures are not adjusted and the

Council
strongly believes that we must take
all necessary actions to ensure eligibility for federal and other governmental programs. Therefore, in

the
decreased
population
count
results in an adverse impact to the
City of Cleveland by failing to meet

to

in connection therewith and authorizing and approving related matters.

March 14, 2001
Whereas, pursuant to the authority of Section 203 of the Housing and
Community
Development
Amendments of 1978, 12 U.S.C. §1701z-11, as
amended by Section 101(b) of the
Multifamily Housing Property Disposition Reform Act of 1994 (as so
amended, the “Act”) and regulations
promulgated pursuant thereto (the
“Regulations”), the United States
Department of Housing and Urban
Development, acting by and through
the Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development (“HUD”), has determined to dispose of certain real
property, the improvements thereon
and a Housing Assistance Payments
(“HAP”) contract, tenant leases and
other
personal
property
related
thereto, all located in the City of
Cleveland (the “City”) known as
Park Village Apartments (collectively, the “Property”); and
Whereas, pursuant to the Act and
the Regulations, HUD has determined that it is necessary and
appropriate to make available an
up-front grant in an amount presently
estimated
not
to
exceed
$981,836.00 in connection with rehabilitation
and
development
and
other related development of the
Property; and
Whereas, in order to provide the
up-front grant in the most economically
efficient
manner
possible,
HUD wishes to convey title to the
Property to the City pursuant to a
Contract for Sale (the “HUD Contract for Sale”) between HUD and
the City, and to make the up-front
grant available pursuant to an UpFront Grant Agreement (the “Grant
Agreement”) between HUD and the
City, a copy of which is in File No.
304-01-A (the “File”); and
Whereas, Famicos Foundation, or
its designated successors or assigns
(the “Developer”) has offered to purchase the Property from the City
and to redevelop a portion of the
Property into affordable rental housing; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that the acquisition of the Property
from HUD pursuant to the HUD Contract for Sale and the sale of the
Property to the Developer by private
negotiation and the redevelopment
of the Property by the Developer
pursuant
to
a
Redevelopment
Agreement
(the
“Redevelopment
Agreement”) is in the best interest
of the City and is the best means of
accomplishing the necessary redevelopment of the Property in order
to carry out the City’s public purpose of providing safe, decent and
sanitary affordable housing in the
City; and
Whereas, in order to complete the
redevelopment of the Property in
accordance with the Act, the Regulations
and
the
Redevelopment
Agreement, the City intends to loan
the proceeds of the up-front grant to
the Developer pursuant to the Redevelopment
Agreement
and
upon
mutually agreeable terms and conditions as provided in the Redevelopment Agreement; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency ordinance providing for the public peace, property, health and safety in that the
proposed acquisition, sale and redevelopment of the Property will
improve the welfare of the City and
its residents by accomplishing the

The City Record
aforesaid public purpose; now therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. This Council determines
that, in order to carry out the City’s
public purpose of providing safe,
decent and sanitary affordable housing in the City, and notwithstanding
and as an exception to any provision of the Codified Ordinances of

Section 2. That this Council determines that, in order to complete the
redevelopment of the Property, and
notwithstanding and as an exception to any provision of the Codified
Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
the Mayor and the Director of Community Development, or either one
of them, are hereby authorized to
execute and deliver, on behalf of the
City, the Grant Agreement and
accept the up-front grant on behalf
of the City. The grant proceeds are
hereby appropriated for the purposes set forth in the Grant Agreement
and the Redevelopment Agreement.
Section 3. That this Council finds
and determines that, in order to
carry out the City’s public purpose
of providing safe, decent and sanitary affordable housing in the City,
it is necessary and appropriate to
sell the Property to the Developer
and
cause
its
redevelopment
through the rehabilitation, equipping and improvement of the Property to be made by the Developer.
Section 4. That notwithstanding
and as an exception to any provision of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, this Council
finds and determines that disposition of the Property by negotiated
sale is in the City’s best interests;
authorizes the disposition of the
Property by negotiation, subject to
approval by the Board of Control;
and approves the Redevelopment
Agreement and the conveyance of
the Property to the Developer and
the loan of the up-front grant proceeds to the Developer upon the
terms and conditions set forth in the
Redevelopment
Agreement.
This
Council authorizes and directs the

them, to execute and deliver, on
behalf of the City the Redevelopment Agreement, with such changes
or amendments that are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and that

Community
Development
as
not
being substantially adverse to the
City, with signing and delivery of
the Redevelopment Agreement, or
amendments thereto, being conclusive evidence of such approval. This

483

57
Council authorizes and directs the
Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies, the Mayor and the Director of
Community Development, as appropriate to execute and deliver to the
Developer, upon satisfaction of the
applicable conditions precedent set
forth in the Redevelopment Agreement, a quit-claim deed (the “Deed”)
and related assignments, bills of
sale or other agreements conveying
the Property (including the HAP
contract, the leases and the other
personal property related to the
operation and maintenance of the
Project) to the Developer; provided
that Deed shall contain such restrictive covenants, reversionary interests or similar provisions as may, in
the judgment of the Director of
Community
Development,
be
required to ensure the elimination of
blight and deterioration and for the
prevention of recurrence of said conditions, and shall specifically contain a provision against the creation
of advertising signs or billboards
other than permitted identification
signs.
Section 5. That the Mayor, the
Director
of
Community
Development, the Director of Finance, the
Director of Law, the Clerk of Council and other City officials, as appropriate, are authorized to provide
such information and to execute,
certify or furnish such other documents, and do all other things as are
necessary for or incidental to carrying out the conveyance of the Property pursuant to the terms of the
HUD Contract for Sale and the
Redevelopment Agreement.
The
loan of the HUD up-front grant may
be made as one loan in multiple
installments or as multiple loans in
an aggregate amount not to exceed
$981,836.00 and the obligation of the
Developer to repay the loan may be
subordinate to the obligations of the
Developer under any other financing arrangements for the Property
improvements. Notwithstanding and
as an exception to any provision of
any Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, if determined by
the Director of Finance to be advantageous to the financing of the
Property improvements, the City
may evidence all or a portion of the
loan
by
accepting
obligations
exempt from federal income tax
under Section 103 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
and issued for the purpose of funding the Property improvements. The
Mayor, the Director of Community
Development,
the
Director
of
Finance, the Director of Law and
other City officials, as appropriate,
are hereby authorized to accept such
security instruments and execute
and deliver such agreements as may
be necessary to secure repayment of
the loans consistent with the provisions of this Ordinance.
Section 6. That this Council finds
and determines the sale of the Property for the consideration provided
in the Redevelopment Agreement is
satisfactory and proper, and that the

affordable housing units will further the City’s objective of providing additional safe, decent and sanitary affordable housing in the City

complied with and this Ordinance

Ordinance is hereby declared to be
an independent section or part of a
section and, notwithstanding any
other evidence of legislative intent,
it is hereby declared to be the controlling legislative intent that if any
