FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES REFERRED
Ord. No. 355-01.
By Councilmen Lewis and Patmon
(by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting
new Section 125.09 relating to computer assisted research agreements
for the Department of Law.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
hereby supplemented by enacting
new Section 125.09 thereof, to read
as follows:
Section 125.09 Computer Assisted
Research Agreements
The Director of Law is authorized
to enter into subscription, license
and other agreements necessary to
obtain electronic online access to
computer-assisted legal and other
research databases, materials and
services required for the work of the
Department of Law.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Referred to Directors of Finance,
Law; Committees on Legislation,
Finance.
Ord. No. 356-01.
By Councilman Brady.
An emergency ordinance supplementing the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio 1976, by enacting
new Sections 535.22 and 535.23 relating to a sewer and water line protection program.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
provides water and local sewer service to the residents of the City; and
Whereas, the City plants and
maintains trees on the tree lawns of
residential
properties
throughout
the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, the roots of such trees
can cause damage to sewer and
water lines leading to the property;
and
Whereas, many people object to
the City planting trees on the
treelawn for this reason; and
Whereas,
there
is
also
the
increased possibility of water damage to residential properties due to
tree roots obstructing sewer pipes
causing both water and sewage to
back-up
into
the
basements
of
homes, causing flooding and major
property damage; and
Whereas,
the
exterior
damage
caused by such flooding is expensive
for the homeowner to repair; and
Whereas, many residents, especially elderly homeowners on fixed
incomes, may not be able to afford
the cost for repair or replacement of
sewer or water lines that have been
damaged
because
of
tree
root
obstruction; and
Whereas, it is in the interest of
the public health and welfare of the
residents of the City that the City
ensure that sewer lines damaged by
tree roots are repaired and able to

function properly to carry sewage to
the City’s local sewers; and
Whereas, in order to reduce the
cost burden to residential property
owners, a program to cover exterior
property damage caused by tree
roots shall be offered to residents of
the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety;
now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio 1976 are
hereby supplemented by enacting
new
Sections
535.22
and
535.23
thereof, to read respectively as follows:
Section 535.22 Sewer and Water
Line Protection Program Establishment and Coverage
(a) The Department of Utilities,
Division of Water Pollution Control,
shall offer private residential homeowners with homes located within
the municipal boundaries of the City
of Cleveland the opportunity to participate in a sewer and water line
protection program for the repair of
damaged or obstructed water or
sewer lines and the repair of damaged exterior property when such
damage is directly caused by the
roots of trees located on the public
right-of-way between private property and the street, an area commonly known as the tree lawn.
(b) The sewer and water line protection program shall be structured
as follows:
1. Funds from the program shall
be used to pay for costs associated
with
the
repair
of damage
or
obstruction of sewer or water lines
and to pay for exterior property
damage when such damage is a
direct result of tree roots damaging
or obstructing the flow of water or
sewage through sewer or water lines
that are adjacent to the property.
2. The program shall be made
available to all private, residential
homeowners owning homes located
within the municipal boundaries of
Cleveland. The Department of Public Utilities shall inform such homeowners of the program availability
by including information with the
City water bill.
3. Eligible homeowners may participate in the program, at a predetermined rate to be set by ordinance
of Council, which will be charged
quarterly to their water bill. Such
rate shall be computed at intervals
of every two years, with such rate
to be presented by the Department
of Public Utilities in the form of legislation to Cleveland City Council
for its review and passage.
4. The City shall permit qualified
homeowners to enroll in the program at any time during the calendar year. In order to be qualified, a
homeowner must: a) be current in
all water payments; and b) be the
owner of a private residence located within the municipal boundaries
of Cleveland. A homeowner must be
enrolled in the program and must
have contributed the established
amount for a period of at least ninety (90) days before the homeowner
is eligible to claim a benefit for
repair of damage to the sewer or
water line.
5. Following any incident where
water or sewer line obstruction or
damage has occurred or property
damage has occurred as a direct
result of tree root obstruction or

374

March 7, 2001
breakage of sewer or water lines,
the homeowner shall be responsible
for documenting such occurrence
and
contacting
the
Division
of
Water Pollution Control to request
that an inspection be performed.
The Division of Water Pollution
Control will provide a claim form
for the homeowner to fill out and
return.
6. Once the claim form is received
by the Division of Water Pollution
Control, an inspector will be sent to
the property, at a time in which the
homeowner can be present if desired
by the homeowner. The inspector
will make a determination as to the
cause of the damage, which shall be
documented in writing. A copy of
the report shall be provided to the
homeowner. If the Division of Water
Pollution Control determines the
damage or obstruction was caused
by tree roots originating from a tree
located on a tree lawn, and if the
homeowner is a current participant
in the sewer and water line protection program, then the Division of
Water Pollution Control shall take
the necessary steps to correct the
damage or obstruction to the line
and to repair any exterior property
damage without any cost or expense
being charged to the owner.
7. If the City is responsible for
repairing or correcting the damage
done by tree roots originating on a
tree lawn, the following repair work
may be done: a) root removal; b)
trimming the roots around the sewer
or water lines; c) replacing the
water or sewer line that was damaged or obstructed by the tree roots,
d) replacing exterior property damaged by the tree roots, if warranted. Qualified program participants
may receive repairs for damages an
unlimited number of times, if such
repairs are warranted.
(c) In the event that the inspection done by the Division of Water
Pollution Control determines that
the damage was not a direct result
of damage or obstruction of sewer
or water lines from tree roots originating from trees on tree lawns, the
property owner can file a claim with
the Moral Claims Commission in
accordance with Chapter 155 of the
Codified Ordinances.
Section
535.23 Water and Sewer
Line Protection Fund
The Director of Finance shall
establish a water and sewer line protection fund by depositing Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000.00)
from funds appropriated to the Division of Water Pollution Control. The
fees paid by participants in the program shall be deposited into this
fund and shall be used for the sole
purpose of providing repairs as set
forth in Section 535.22. In the event
that the moneys in this fund reach
in excess of Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($500,000.00), then the initial
Two
Hundred
Thousand Dollars
($200,000.00) shall be returned to the
Division of Water Pollution Control.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor, otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from the earliest date allowed by
law.

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS REFERRED
Res. No. 384-01.
By Councilman Lewis.
An emergency resolution requesting the Ohio Consumers Counsel and
the Public Utilities Commission of
Ohio to investigate and review the
tariff agreement between Dominion
East Ohio and the Public Utilities
Commission of Ohio pertaining to
rules and regulations of services
and urging Dominion East Ohio to
keep open its Payment and Billing
Explanation Center in Cleveland in
order to adequately serve City of
Cleveland residents.
Whereas, it is the understanding
of
Cleveland
City
Council
that
Dominion East Ohio is administering all billing for alternative gas
suppliers and therefore creating a
greater need for a Payment and
Billing Explanation Center in the
City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, it is also the understanding of Cleveland City Council
that Dominion East Ohio intends to
close down the Payment and Billing
Explanation Center currently located
in the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, a walk-in Payment and
Billing Explanation Center currently provides customers with the
immediate ability to, among other
things, have questions answered,
schedule investigation and rereads,
and have gas turned on or off; and
Whereas, without a walk-in Payment and Billing Explanation Center, customers will be limited to
unreliable
call-in
centers;
which
often fail to provide proper accessibility and service to consumers; and
Whereas, the closing of Dominion
East Ohio’s Payment and Billing
Explanation Center in Cleveland
would be a blatant attack on consumers and would demonstrate that
Dominion East Ohio is interested
only in competition in a deregulated market; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland requests the Ohio
Consumers Counsel and the Public
Utilities Commission of Ohio to
investigate and review the tariff
agreement between Dominion East
Ohio and the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio pertaining to the
rules and regulations of services
and urging Dominion East Ohio to
keep open its Payment and Billing
Explanation Center in Cleveland in
order to adequately serve City of
Cleveland residents.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution the
Chairman of the Public Utilities
Commission of Ohio, the President

of the Ohio House of Representatives.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of

it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

the Codified Ordinances of the City,
a driver of a vehicle must stop at
least ten feet from any school bus
stopped for the purpose of receiving
or discharging any school child and
may not proceed until the school bus
resumes motion; and
Whereas, too many drivers in the
City fail to observe this law, and
continue
to
move
past
stopped
school buses that are loading or
unloading children; and
Whereas, the safety of our children should be paramount in the
minds of all concerned citizens, drivers, and the City’s safety forces;
and
Whereas, it is incumbent upon the
police officers of the City to enforce
Ohio law and Section 431.38 of the
Codified Ordinances to ensure that
drivers stop for stopped school
buses; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges the Cleveland Police Department to enforce
Section 431.38 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland, 1976

Whereas, Article 1, Section 2 of

Whereas,
Commerce
Secretary
Evans must decide whether to follow
that recommendation or to permit

to the City’s census figures; and

C. Existing Rates. All valid contracts or agreements establishing
rates, charges or billing arrangements
between
customers
and
Grantee (including but not limited
to agreements combining billings
for one or more premises owned or
operated by a customer) in effect
as of the effective date of this ordinance, shall remain in effect until
the expiration of the contract or
agreement as set forth in such contract or agreement (or as may have
been extended by PUCO order),
except as
may
be allowed
or
required by any Court or arbitration panel, or as agreed by Customer and Grantee. All tariff and
contract rates for Steam Service in
effect as of the effective date of
this ordinance, shall, except for

and authorized by the PUCO or in
accordance with Ohio law, remain

D. Rates and Charges. If the
Grantee and any Customer cannot
agree on a contract which sets rates

of Ohio, by Council, or as otherwise
may be provided by law. During the
term of this franchise, Grantee
shall, upon the request of the City
or Council, provide such data and
information as the City reasonably
requires
to
review

the Grantee to appeal to or seek
review of PUCO in connection with

Director of Law of the City.
F. Study of Service During OffPeak Hours. In order to study ways
to promote the use of convention,
hotel and entertainment facilities in
downtown Cleveland in the evening
and weekend hours, and in order to
consider whether the lower cost of
Steam Service during said hours can
be economically justified in connection with separate rate provisions
during such period, Council herein
directs Grantee to provide, no later
than July 1, 2001, a full report to
Council analyzing the feasibility of
instituting reduced rates for offpeak Steam Service usage and the
costs of providing Steam Service
during off-peak hours.
G. Quality of Service. The Grantee
shall at all times provide safe, adequate and reliable service to its customers and shall, except as may otherwise be permitted by law, provide
same without discrimination. In so

such service and to ensure the efficient and safe operation of the
Steam System. Grantee shall maintain the Steam System so as to avoid
substantial
leakage,
and
shall
promptly repair material leaks in
the Steam System. Grantee shall
also promptly repair any pavement,
tree law, curb or other portion of the
street or public ground which is
damaged by Grantee or due to
defects in or leaks in or emanating
from the Steam System. If there is
any dispute between Grantee and a
Customer as to whether the Grantee
or Customer is responsible to repair
damage in the streets or public
grounds caused by Grantee or due
to defects or leaks in the Steam System, Grantee shall promptly make
any necessary repairs pending resolution of such dispute. The cost of
such repairs may be part of any
such resolution, and may be charged
to the customer if it is determined
that the repairs were the responsibility of the customer. The Grantee
acknowledges its obligation to operate and maintain the Steam System

so that it is not in such condition as
to be a hazard to the health, safety
or
welfare
of
the
public,

to reasonably require the Grantee to
make necessary repairs or improvements
to
abate
said
condition.
Grantee shall promptly comply with
an order of the Director of the
appropriate department of the City
having custody and control of the
particular property or the responsibility to ensure the health, safety or
welfare of the public in the particular situation to make any such
repairs or improvements.

to meet the goals of the City in
effect on the effective date of this
ordinance with respect to minority
enterprise participation and female

civil action against violators of the
ban, creates a civil penalty for violators of the ban, and requires that

and
Whereas, Senate Bill 11 would
help
Ohio’s
steel
industry
and
enhance its competitive position for
future growth; and

peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,

Res. No. 339-01.
By
Councilmen
Willis,
Brady,
Melena, Cintron and Jones.
An emergency resolution urging
the PUCO to audit Dominion East
Ohio and other gas companies and
to hold public hearings in Cleveland;
and urging Governor Taft to extend
the moratorium on utility shut offs.
Whereas, Dominion East Ohio Gas
Company has increased its rates to
such an extent that the price of natural gas places a tremendous burden on consumers in Cleveland who
are facing the highest natural gas
costs ever; and
Whereas, Dominion East Ohio’s
Gas Cost Recovery (GCR) rate increases have included large increases in the transportation charges

30
assessed on consumers, and such
increases have not been justified or
explained fully; and
Whereas, the Gas Choice Program
which began in Cleveland on October 1, 2000, at the start of the heating season when rates were already
increasing and choices were decreasing, has only provided rate
relief to a small number of consumers in Cleveland; and
Whereas, the natural gas distribution companies in the State have
publicly stated their opposition to
expanded choice or aggregation programs which would enable many
more consumers to take advantage
of choice, unless the companies are
allowed rate recovery of so-called
“stranded costs;” and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
held a hearing on the gas crisis and
heard from many consumers and
their representatives that the increases are unfair to consumers,
that the PUCO and State of Ohio
should investigate the causes and
take action to lower rates, and that
the Choice Program is beset with
unreasonable rules that exclude too
many consumers from being able to
participate, that the Program was
poorly promoted and that consumers
have had too few options for participation; and
Whereas, Ohio law declares (Section 4929.02 Ohio Revised Code) that
it is the policy of the State of Ohio
to “promote the availability to consumers of adequate, reliable and
reasonably priced natural gas services and goods,” and to give “consumers effective choices over the
selection of ... supplies and suppliers” of natural gas;” and
Whereas, the Ohio Office of the
Consumers
Counsel
(“OCC”)
has
filed an action at the PUCO entitled
a “Petition to Investigate the State
of Ohio’s Natural Gas Industry,” asking the Commission to investigate
the gas companies in the State
(Case No. 01-0152-GA-UNC); now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Public Utilities Commission of
Ohio (PUCO) to immediately commence an audit of Dominion East
Ohio and the other gas companies in
the State, as requested by the OCC
in Case No. 01-0152-GA-UNC, entitled
a “Petition to Investigate the State
of Ohio’s Natural Gas Industry;” and
that as part of this audit the PUCO
should immediately investigate all
of the following:
1. What alternatives are and
should be made available for consumers who may not be eligible for
low income assistance programs but
still cannot pay their bills, including extending the moratorium on
shutoffs;
2. The cause of rising natural gas
prices and the cause of the rising
transportation charges;
3. What the State of Ohio can do
to prevent rising natural gas costs
in the future;
4. The appropriateness of natural
gas rates currently being charged to
customers, and the appropriateness
of the charges for gas transportation being charged to both full service customers and Gas Choice customers by Dominion East Ohio and
the other natural gas distribution
companies in the State;
5. The appropriate management of
the gas purchasing, transportation

The City Record
and procurement policies of Ohio’s
four largest natural gas distribution
companies;
6. The extent to which natural gas
distribution
companies
have
not
been recovering through the Gas
Cost Recovery (GCR) rate, or otherwise, any costs, including the cost
of transportation reserved for customers who switch to alternative
gas suppliers (which the distribution
companies
claim
may
be
“stranded” due to gas choice and/or
aggregation), and the extent to
which such “stranded costs” may
exist now, or would occur in the
future if aggregation is expanded;
and
7. The current state of Ohio’s natural
gas
choice
programs
and
options to improve the existing programs and the promotion of such
programs, including modification of
the rules applying to applicants and
participants; and
8. How meaningful natural gas
choice options can help consumers
better manage their gas costs in the
future.
Section 2. That the PUCO hold
public hearings in Cleveland and
other cities throughout the State, at
which the distribution companies
should
be
required
to
present
responses and answer questions on
these issues; and
Section 3. That, as an act of compassion for those citizens hardest
hit by high utility bills, Governor
Taft is strongly encouraged to
extend a moratorium on utility shut
offs.
Section 4. That this resolution
shall be transmitted by the Clerk of
Council and filed with the Public
Utilities Commission of Ohio in Case
No. 01-0152-GA-UNC and transmitted
to Governor Taft.
Section 5. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor.

Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
through the Department of Port Control, owns and operates Cleveland
Hopkins International and Burke
Lakefront Airports, as set forth in

City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, Cleveland Hopkins International Airport was founded in 1925
as the first municipally owned airport in the United States, and
together with Burke Lakefront Airport, a general aviation reliever airport, serves as the primary airport
system for Northeast Ohio; and
Whereas, Cleveland Hopkins International Airport is a valuable asset
to the citizens of the City of Cleveland, generating hundreds of millions of dollars annually to the

400

March 7, 2001
area’s economy and serving over 13
million passengers in 1999; and
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland recognizes the importance of the continued growth and
development of the Airport to the
economic vitality of Northeast Ohio;
and
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland recognizes the impacts
of the operations of the Airport,
both positive and negative, on our
suburban neighbors and encourages
their ongoing participation in dialogue about the manner in which to
utilize, expand and maximize the
benefits of the Airport; and
Whereas, this Council, as elected
officials of the City of Cleveland,
are mindful that they are charged
with safeguarding this valuable
asset of the City and that to relinquish this responsibility would not
serve the best interests of the citizens of Cleveland; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore
