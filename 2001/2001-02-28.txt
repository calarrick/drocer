Park Village Apartments, accepting
a grant from the United States
Department of Housing and Urban
Development in connection with the
redevelopment
of
that
property,
authorizing agreements with the
United States Secretary of Housing
and Urban Development and with
Famicos Foundation, or its designee,
in connection therewith and authorizing and approving related matters.
Whereas, pursuant to the authority of Section 203 of the Housing
and
Community
Development
Amendments
of
1978,
12
U.S.C.
§1701z-11, as amended by Section
101(b) of the Multifamily Housing
Property Disposition Reform Act of
1994 (as so amended, the “Act”) and
regulations promulgated pursuant
thereto
(the
“Regulations”),
the
United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, acting
by and through the Secretary of
Housing and Urban Development
(“HUD”), has determined to dispose
of
certain
real
property,
the
improvements thereon and a Housing Assistance Payments (“HAP”)
contract, tenant leases and other
personal property related thereto,
all located in the City of Cleveland
(the “City”) known as Park Village
Apartments (collectively, the “Property”); and
Whereas, pursuant to the Act and
the Regulations, HUD has determined that it is necessary and
appropriate to make available an
up-front grant in an amount presently
estimated
not
to
exceed
$981,836.00 in connection with rehabilitation
and
development
and
other related development of the
Property; and
Whereas, in order to provide the
up-front grant in the most economically
efficient
manner
possible,
HUD wishes to convey title to the
Property to the City pursuant to a
Contract for Sale (the “HUD Contract for Sale”) between HUD and
the City, and to make the up-front
grant available pursuant to an UpFront Grant Agreement (the “Grant
Agreement”) between HUD and the

Whereas, Famicos Foundation, or
its designated successors or assigns
(the “Developer”) has offered to purchase the Property from the City
and to redevelop a portion of the
Property
into
affordable
rental
housing; and
Whereas, this Council believes
that the acquisition of the Property

February 28, 2001
from HUD pursuant to the HUD Contract for Sale and the sale of the
Property to the Developer by private
negotiation and the redevelopment
of the Property by the Developer
pursuant to a Redevelopment Agreement (the “Redevelopment Agreement”) is in the best interest of the
City and is the best means of accomplishing the necessary redevelopment of the Property in order to
carry out the City’s public purpose
of providing safe, decent and sanitary affordable housing in the City;
and
Whereas, in order to complete the
redevelopment of the Property in
accordance with the Act, the Regulations
and
the
Redevelopment
Agreement, the City intends to loan
the proceeds of the up-front grant to
the Developer pursuant to the Redevelopment
Agreement
and
upon
mutually agreeable terms and conditions as provided in the Redevelopment Agreement; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency ordinance providing for the public peace, property, health and safety in that the proposed acquisition, sale and redevelopment of the Property will improve
the welfare of the City and its residents by accomplishing the aforesaid public purpose; now therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. This Council determines
that, in order to carry out the City’s
public purpose of providing safe,
decent and sanitary affordable housing in the City, and notwithstanding
and as an exception to any provision of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies
and the Director of Community
Development, as appropriate, are
hereby authorized to execute and
deliver, on behalf of the City, the

the Mayor and the Director of Community Development, or either one
of them, are hereby authorized to
execute and deliver, on behalf of the
City, the Grant Agreement and
accept the up-front grant on behalf
of the City. The grant proceeds are
hereby appropriated for the purposes set forth in the Grant Agreement
and the Redevelopment Agreement.
Section 3. That this Council finds
and determines that, in order to
carry out the City’s public purpose
of providing safe, decent and sanitary affordable housing in the City,
it is necessary and appropriate to
sell the Property to the Developer
and
cause
its
redevelopment
through the rehabilitation, equipping and improvement of the Property to be made by the Developer.
Section 4. That notwithstanding
and as an exception to any provision of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, this Council

The City Record
finds and determines that disposition of the Property by negotiated
sale is in the City’s best interests;
authorizes the disposition of the
Property by negotiation, subject to
approval by the Board of Control;
and approves the Redevelopment
Agreement and the conveyance of
the Property to the Developer and
the loan of the up-front grant proceeds to the Developer upon the
terms and conditions set forth in the
Redevelopment
Agreement.
This
Council authorizes and directs the
Mayor and the Director of Community Development, or either one of
them, to execute and deliver, on
behalf of the City the Redevelopment Agreement, with such changes
or amendments that are not inconsistent with this Ordinance and that
are approved by the Director of
Community
Development
as
not
being substantially adverse to the
City, with signing and delivery of
the Redevelopment Agreement, or
amendments thereto, being conclusive evidence of such approval. This
Council authorizes and directs the
Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies, the Mayor and the Director of
Community Development, as appropriate to execute and deliver to the
Developer, upon satisfaction of the
applicable conditions precedent set
forth in the Redevelopment Agreement, a quit-claim deed (the “Deed”)
and related assignments, bills of
sale or other agreements conveying
the Property (including the HAP
contract, the leases and the other
personal property related to the
operation and maintenance of the
Project) to the Developer; provided
that Deed shall contain such restrictive covenants, reversionary interests or similar provisions as may, in
the judgment of the Director of
Community
Development,
be
required to ensure the elimination of
blight and deterioration and for the
prevention of recurrence of said conditions, and shall specifically contain a provision against the creation
of advertising signs or billboards
other than permitted identification
signs.
Section 5. That the Mayor, the
Director
of
Community
Development, the Director of Finance, the
Director of Law, the Clerk of Council and other City officials, as appropriate, are authorized to provide
such information and to execute,
certify or furnish such other documents, and do all other things as are
necessary for or incidental to carrying out the conveyance of the Property pursuant to the terms of the
HUD Contract for Sale and the
Redevelopment Agreement.
The
loan of the HUD up-front grant may
be made as one loan in multiple
installments or as multiple loans in
an aggregate amount not to exceed
$981,836.00 and the obligation of the
Developer to repay the loan may be
subordinate to the obligations of the
Developer under any other financing arrangements for the Property
improvements. Notwithstanding and
as an exception to any provision of
any Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, if determined by
the Director of Finance to be advantageous to the financing of the
Property improvements, the City
may evidence all or a portion of the
loan
by
accepting
obligations
exempt from federal income tax
under Section 103 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
and issued for the purpose of funding
the
Property
improvements.

An emergency resolution urging
the PUCO to audit Dominion East
Ohio and other gas companies and
to hold public hearings in Cleveland;
and urging Governor Taft to extend
the moratorium on utility shut offs.
Whereas, Dominion East Ohio Gas
Company has increased its rates to
such an extent that the price of natural gas places a tremendous burden on consumers in Cleveland who
are facing the highest natural gas
costs ever; and
Whereas, Dominion East Ohio’s
Gas Cost Recovery (GCR) rate increases have included large increases in the transportation charges
assessed on consumers, and such
increases have not been justified or
explained fully; and
Whereas, the Gas Choice Program
which began in Cleveland on October 1, 2000, at the start of the heating season when rates were already
increasing and choices were decreasing, has only provided rate
relief to a small number of consumers in Cleveland; and
Whereas, the natural gas distribution companies in the State have
publicly stated their opposition to
expanded choice or aggregation programs which would enable many
more consumers to take advantage
of choice, unless the companies are
allowed rate recovery of so-called
“stranded costs;” and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
held a hearing on the gas crisis and
heard from many consumers and
their representatives that the increases are unfair to consumers,
that the PUCO and State of Ohio
should investigate the causes and
take action to lower rates, and that
the Choice Program is beset with
unreasonable rules that exclude too
many consumers from being able to
participate, that the Program was
poorly promoted and that consumers
have had too few options for participation; and
Whereas, Ohio law declares (Section 4929.02 Ohio Revised Code) that
it is the policy of the State of Ohio
to “promote the availability to con-

338

February 28, 2001
sumers of adequate, reliable and
reasonably priced natural gas services and goods,” and to give “consumers effective choices over the
selection of ... supplies and suppliers” of natural gas;” and
Whereas, the Ohio Office of the
Consumers
Counsel
(“OCC”)
has
filed an action at the PUCO entitled
a “Petition to Investigate the State
of Ohio’s Natural Gas Industry,” asking the Commission to investigate
the gas companies in the State
(Case No. 01-0152-GA-UNC); now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Public Utilities Commission of
Ohio (PUCO) to immediately commence an audit of Dominion East
Ohio and the other gas companies in
the State, as requested by the OCC
in Case No. 01-0152-GA-UNC, entitled
a “Petition to Investigate the State
of Ohio’s Natural Gas Industry;” and
that as part of this audit the PUCO
should immediately investigate all
of the following:
1. What alternatives are and
should be made available for consumers who may not be eligible for
low income assistance programs but
still cannot pay their bills, including extending the moratorium on
shutoffs;
2. The cause of rising natural gas
prices and the cause of the rising
transportation charges;
3. What the State of Ohio can do
to prevent rising natural gas costs
in the future;
4. The appropriateness of natural
gas rates currently being charged to
customers, and the appropriateness
of the charges for gas transportation being charged to both full service customers and Gas Choice customers by Dominion East Ohio and
the other natural gas distribution
companies in the State;
5. The appropriate management of
the gas purchasing, transportation
and procurement policies of Ohio’s
four largest natural gas distribution
companies;
6. The extent to which natural gas
distribution
companies
have
not
been recovering through the Gas
Cost Recovery (GCR) rate, or otherwise, any costs, including the cost
of transportation reserved for customers who switch to alternative
gas suppliers (which the distribution
companies
claim
may
be
“stranded” due to gas choice and/or
aggregation), and the extent to
which such “stranded costs” may
exist now, or would occur in the
future if aggregation is expanded;
and
7. The current state of Ohio’s natural
gas
choice
programs
and
options to improve the existing programs and the promotion of such
programs, including modification of
the rules applying to applicants and
participants; and
8. How meaningful natural gas
choice options can help consumers
better manage their gas costs in the
future.
Section 2. That the PUCO hold
public hearings in Cleveland and
other cities throughout the State, at
which the distribution companies
should
be
required
to
present
responses and answer questions on
these issues; and
Section 3. That, as an act of compassion for those citizens hardest
hit by high utility bills, Governor

February 28, 2001
Taft is strongly encouraged to
extend a moratorium on utility shut
offs.
Section 4. That this resolution
shall be transmitted by the Clerk of
Council and filed with the Public
Utilities Commission of Ohio in Case
No. 01-0152-GA-UNC and transmitted
to Governor Taft.
Section 5. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor.

An emergency resolution affirming that the ownership and governance structure of Cleveland Hopkins and Burke Lakefront Airports
should remain within the control of
the City of Cleveland.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
through the Department of Port Control, owns and operates Cleveland
Hopkins International and Burke
Lakefront Airports, as set forth in
Section 768 of the Charter of the
City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, Cleveland Hopkins International Airport was founded in 1925
as the first municipally owned airport in the United States, and
together with Burke Lakefront Airport, a general aviation reliever airport, serves as the primary airport
system for Northeast Ohio; and
Whereas, Cleveland Hopkins International Airport is a valuable asset
to the citizens of the City of Cleveland, generating hundreds of millions of dollars annually to the
area’s economy and serving over 13
million passengers in 1999; and
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland recognizes the importance of the continued growth and
development of the Airport to the
economic vitality of Northeast Ohio;
and
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland recognizes the impacts
of the operations of the Airport,
both positive and negative, on our
suburban neighbors and encourages
their ongoing participation in dialogue about the manner in which to
utilize, expand and maximize the
benefits of the Airport; and
Whereas, this Council, as elected
officials of the City of Cleveland,
are mindful that they are charged
with safeguarding this valuable
asset of the City and that to relinquish this responsibility would not
serve the best interests of the citizens of Cleveland; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland recognizes and
acknowledges the importance of
Cleveland Hopkins and Burke Lakefront Airports and affirms that the
ownership and governance structure

The City Record
of the airports should remain within the control of the City of Cleveland.

painted, shall be light gray or offwhite in order to blend in with the
sky and clouds, unless other colors
are required by federal regulations
or the provisions of Chapter 633 of
these Codified Ordinances or unless
another color is approved by the
City Planning Commission as being
more
effective
in
a
particular
instance. The City Planning Commission shall work with applicants
to identify any other design techniques that can be used in reducing
the visual prominence of telecommunication towers.
(d) Signs. No signs shall be located on or around a telecommunications
tower except for necessary warning
signs located at or near ground level.
(e)

the subject property, but such antenna or antenna structure shall not
exceed the height limit by more
than twenty (20) feet.
(c) Design. A telecommunications
antenna structure shall be designed
and placed so as to blend in with
