Section 3103.09 Unsafe Structures;
Violation
and
Remedial
Notices;
Cost Recovery
(a) Legislative Findings.
Council of the City of Cleveland
finds that:
(1) Structures which are vacant
and open to entry at doors, windows
or other points accessible to the general public:
A. Attract children to enter;
B. Become harborage for vermin;
C. Serve as temporary abode for
derelicts, vagrants and criminals;
and
D. Are likely to be damaged by
vandals or set ablaze by arsonists.
(2) Unkept grounds surrounding
such vacant, open structures invite
the dumping of garbage and rubbish
thereupon;
(3) Thousands of structures in
this City are made of wood-frame
construction which is more flammable than other building types;
(4) Thousands of structures in
this City are situated on narrow lots
and in close proximity to one another, thereby increasing the risk of

2894

December 5, 2001
conflagration and spread of insect
and rodent infestation;
(5) Population loss and economic
decline experienced by the City in
recent years has caused the incidence of vacant, open structures to
increase significantly;
(6) Such vacant, open structures
often become dilapidated because
they are not repaired by the owners
or persons in control of said structures;
(7) Structures that are vacant and
open to entry depress the market
value of surrounding properties;
(8) The existence of certain hazardous conditions may require a
structure to be vacated; such conditions include but are not limited to:
A. Danger of structural collapse;
B. Inadequate heat or use of dangerous heating mechanism;
C. Danger of fire; and
D. Lack of plumbing in safe working order.
(9) Structures that remain boarded for an extended period of time
contribute
to
blight,
cause
a
decrease in neighboring property
values, create targets for arson, and
lead to the cancellation of homeowners’ insurance for neighboring
property owners.
(b) Declaration of Nuisance.
All buildings or structures which
are injurious to or a menace to the
public health, safety or welfare, or
are structurally unsafe, unsanitary
or not provided with adequate safe
egress, or which constitute a fire
hazard, or which are vacant and
open to public entry, or which are
otherwise dangerous to human life
or injurious to the public, or which
in relation to existing use constitute
a hazard to the public health, safety or welfare by reason of inadequate
maintenance,
dilapidation,
obsolescence or abandonment, are,
severally, for the purposes of this
Building Code, declared to be “unsafe structures”. All such unsafe
structures or conditions are hereby
declared to be public nuisances. The
public nuisance shall be abated by
correction of the violations to the
minimum standards of the Codified
Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
applicable City rules and regulations, the Ohio Revised Code, and
Ohio Administrative Code including
the Ohio Building Code, or by demolition.
(c) Effective Boarding Pending
Rehabilitation
(1) Permits:
Pending the correction of the violations to the minimum standards of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, applicable City
rules and regulations, the Ohio
Revised Code, and the Ohio Administrative Code, including the Ohio
Building Code, the owner of a structure
may
secure
the
structure
through effective boarding. In order
to effectively board the structure,
the owner of the structure shall
apply, within seven (7) days of
receiving a notice of violation, to
the Division of Building and Housing for a permit to board. The Division of Building and Housing shall
review the condition of the structure, determine if it can be effectively boarded, and grant or deny
the owner’s permit to board, setting
forth special requirements, if any,
necessary for compliance with minimum standards for effective boarding. The owner shall effectively
board the structure within seven (7)
days of the issuance of a boarding
permit, or within such other time

December 5, 2001
limit that the Commissioner deems
appropriate. Structures which are
boarded without first obtaining a
boarding permit shall continue to be
considered public nuisances subject
to demolition. Within thirty (30)
days of the issuance of a permit to
board, the owner of the structure
shall apply for a rehabilitation permit pursuant to Section 3105.06 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976. The Commissioner
may grant an extension of time for
acquiring a rehabilitation permit
upon the owner’s written request
and for good cause shown. Failure
of the owner to obtain a rehabilitation permit subsequent to effective
boarding will result in the structure
being deemed a public nuisance, and
scheduled for demolition.
(2) Materials:
The effective boarding of a structure shall include, but not be limited to, doors, windows, or other areas
of the structure open to ingress and
egress and to weather elements at
any and all levels of the structure.
Such openings shall be secured by
plywood, not less than one-half inch
(1/2") thick, or other material of
equal strength, cut and fit into the
openings. Openings in excess of
forty-eight inches (48") wide shall
be framed with two inch by four
inch (2" x 4") lumber and plywood,
or
equivalent
material
fastened
twenty-four inches (24") on center
onto frame. The plywood or equivalent material shall be fastened into
the openings by screw type nails or
lag screws.
(3) Maintenance:
Upon
effectively
boarding
the
structure, the owner shall monitor
and maintain the structure and its
surrounding premises in a safe, sanitary and secured condition. Any
portion of the exterior structure
which is deemed to be potentially
hazardous due to deteriorated conditions,
or
to
be
structurally
unsound shall be removed or treated in such a manner so as to eliminate
the
hazard.
The
exterior
premises shall be maintained free of
high weeds, debris, junk vehicles,
and conditions that may provide
harborage for rodents. Failure of
the owner to properly maintain the
building in the above condition, will
result in the structure being deemed
a public nuisance, and scheduled for
demolition.
(4) Rehabilitation;
Rehabilitation of the structure
shall commence within ninety (90)
days of receiving a rehabilitation
permit pursuant to Section 3105.06 of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976. If rehabilitation of
the effectively boarded structure
does not commence within this time
period, or if the rehabilitation permit is otherwise invalidated or
revoked,
then
the
Commissioner
may declare that the nuisance has
not been abated and schedule the
structure for demolition.
(d) Examination and Condemna tion.
(1) The Commissioner is authorized to examine or cause to be
examined every building or other
structure reported to be unsafe or
damaged or injurious to or a menace to the public, and shall make a
written record of such examination.
(2) The Commissioner may designate as a public nuisance those particular
structures
or
conditions
found to be unsafe pursuant to subsection (b) hereof.

The City Record
(3) The Commissioner may also
declare that a nuisance structure
which, due to its advanced state of
dilapidation, substantial fire damage or structural infirmity, is an
immediate hazard to human life or
health, may only be abated by immediate repair and rehabilitation to the
minimum standards of the Codified
Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
applicable City rules and regulations, the Ohio Revised Code, and
Ohio Administrative Code including
the Ohio Building Code, or by demolition.
(4) Whenever the Commissioner
finds a vacant structure open to
entry at doors, windows or other
points accessible to the general public, he may cause the structure to be
secured at those points of entry. The
Commissioner shall be authorized at
any time to enter upon the premises to secure the structure in order
to lessen the severity of the public
nuisance. In securing such structure, the Commissioner may call
upon any department, division or
bureau of the City for whatever
assistance may be necessary, or
may, by private contract, secure
such structure. Such securing shall
not be deemed to constitute “effective boarding” pursuant to subsection (b) hereof, and it does not
abate the nuisance condition of an
unsafe structure, as declared pursuant to subsection (d)(2) hereof,
unless so declared in writing by the
Commissioner.
Subsequent
notice,
issued pursuant to subsection (e)(1)
below, shall include the fact that
the Commissioner has found it necessary to take appropriate action to
secure the structure.
(e) Notice of Violation
(1) Whenever the Commissioner
finds a building, structure or portion
thereof to be unsafe and determines
it to be a public nuisance, he shall
forward by certified mail to the
owner, agent or person in control of
such building, structure or portion
thereof and to any mortgagee of
record a written notice of violation
stating the defects thereof. Such
notice of violation shall require the
owner within a stated time to abate
the nuisance condition of such structure by correction of the violations
and defects to the minimum standards of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, applicable
City rules and regulations, the Ohio
Revised Code, and Ohio Administrative Code including the Ohio Building Code, or by demolition and
removal of the building, structure,
or portion thereof. The notice also
shall state that if the nuisance is
not abated within the required time
that the Commissioner may take
appropriate action to take repair or
maintenance measures to abate the
public nuisance and that the owner,
agent or person in control shall be
responsible for the cost of the repair
or maintenance measures.
(2) If the person to whom such
notice and order is addressed is not
found after a reasonable and diligent search, then such notice and
order shall be sent by certified mail
to his tax mailing address, if available, as indicated on the County tax
duplicate, and a copy of such notice
shall be posted in a conspicuous
place on the premises to which it
relates. Such mailing and posting
shall be deemed legal service of
such notice.
(3) An owner or agent or person
in control of such structure or building, a mortgagee of record, or a lien

2895

11
holder of record who has received a
notice of violation or a notice to
make corrections to the minimum
standards of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976,
applicable City rules and regulations, the Ohio Revised Code, and
Ohio Administrative Code including
the Ohio Building Code, or to demolish and remove, as provided for in
this section, shall inform prospective purchasers, vendees, grantees,
assignees, lessees, or land contractees thereof of such notice of
violation or the notice to make corrections, or to demolish and remove.
No person shall transfer to a vendee,
grantee, assignee, lessee, land contractee or any other transferee any
interest in a building, structure or
portion thereof after receiving a
notice of violation to make corrections, or to demolish and remove the
same, without first providing the
transferee with a copy of such
notice.
(4) A. No person, agent, firm or
corporation shall sell, by land contract or otherwise, any interest in
any structure or building without
furnishing the buyer, prior to the
sale a copy of any outstanding
notice or order from the City, including any notice of violation or any
outstanding notice to make corrections to the minimum standards of
the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio 1976, applicable City rules
and regulations, the Ohio Revised
Code including the Ohio Building
Code, or any outstanding notice to
demolish and remove.
No buyer or grantee, by land contract or otherwise, shall obtain any
interest in any structure or building
without obtaining from the seller,
prior
to
sale,
the
documents
described above.
B. No person, agent, firm or corporation acting in the capacity of an
escrow agent in any real estate
transaction involving the sale of a
structure or building situated in the
City,
shall
disburse
any
funds
unless the provisions of this division
have been met.
C. Any buyer or grantee, by land
contract or otherwise, of a structure
or building, shall begin at the date
of transfer to comply with any
notice or order obtained or to be
obtained pursuant to this division
and, within ten days of the date of
transfer, shall notify the Commissioner, in writing, of the actions
that will be taken to comply. The
Commissioner may then establish a
reasonable time to comply.
(f) Vacating Buildings and Pro hibiting Use.
The
Commissioner
may
also
require in the notice issued pursuant
to division (e)(1) hereof that the
building, structure or portion thereof be vacated and not reoccupied or
used until the specified repairs and
improvements
are
completed,
inspected, and approved by the Commissioner. The Commissioner may
cause to be posted at each entrance
to such building or structure a
notice as follows: “THIS STRUCTURE IS IN A DANGEROUS CONDITION
AND
HAS
BEEN
CONDEMNED AND ITS USE HAS BEEN
PROHIBITED BY THE COMMISSIONER OF BUILDING AND HOUSING.” Such notice shall remain posted until the required corrections are
made or demolition is completed. No
person shall remove such notice
without written permission of the
Commissioner, nor shall any person
use or enter the building or struc-

12
ture except for the purpose of making the required corrections or
demolishing or effectively boarding
the building or structure, or securing the structure pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) hereof.
(g) Right to Appeal.
The owner, agent or person in control shall have a right to appeal
from the notice and decision of the
Commissioner as provided in this
section and appear before the Board
of Building Standards and Building
Appeals at a specified time and
place to show cause why he should
not comply with such notice. Any
notice served by the Commissioner
shall automatically become a final
order if a written notice of appeal
before the Board is not filed in the
office of the Board within the time
set forth in such notice from the
Commissioner. In the absence of an
appeal, all actions taken pursuant
thereto shall constitute a valid exercise of the police powers of the City
of Cleveland.
(h) Noncompliance with Notice.
In case the owner, agent or person in control fails, neglects or
refuses to comply with the notice to
repair or rehabilitate, or to demolish
and remove a public nuisance or
unsafe building, structure or portion
thereof, the Commissioner may take
appropriate action to demolish and
remove an unsafe structure, or may
advise the Director of Law of the
facts in the case, who, in turn, may
institute appropriate action in the
court to cause correction of the violations and defects, or demolition
and removal, or effective boarding
of such building or structure pending rehabilitation. The securing of
rehabilitation
permits
for
such
building or structure shall not in
and of itself bar the Commissioner
from taking action to abate the nuisance. The Commissioner may, with
respect to any condemned structure,
also take appropriate action to
effectively board such structure, or
to secure it pursuant to paragraph
(d)(4) hereof. The Commissioner
shall specifically state in writing
his findings with respect to such
structure,
and
shall
determine
whether to secure or to effectively
board, based upon factors which
may include the following: the distance of the structure from neighboring structures, the type of structure, the extent to which the structure is secured, the likelihood of
vandalism or arson, the extent of
the deterioration, the economic likelihood of eventual rehabilitation of
the structure, or cost of securing or
effectively boarding the structure.
In case the owner, agent or person in control fails, neglects or
refuses to comply with the notice to
repair or rehabilitate, or to demolish and remove a public nuisance
or unsafe building, structure or portion thereof, the Commissioner may
take appropriate action to take
repair or maintenance measures to
abate the public nuisance. The
Commissioner
shall
specifically
state in writing the findings with
respect to the structure, and shall
determine
whether
to
perform
repair or maintenance upon factors
which may include the following:
the distance of the structure from
neighboring structures, the type of
structure, the extent of deterioration, the likelihood of vandalism or
arson, the economic likelihood of
eventual complete rehabilitation of
the structure, the cost of repair or
maintenance.

The City Record
Except as provided in subsection

conference in support of measures to
save LTV Steel Company and to
respond to the crisis facing the U.S.

Cleveland, 7,500 jobs will be impacted in Ohio, Illinois and Indiana, and
50,000 retirees face losing health

Whereas, LTV’S closure would
have a devastating impact on the
economy of Northeast Ohio and the
State of Ohio since LTV’s estimated
total impact on Ohio’s gross state
product is $2 billion; and
Whereas, in this time of economic
uncertainty and international unrest, the loss of the capability to
produce steel domestically could
pose a threat to national security
and economic vitality; and
Whereas, America’s crumbling infrastructure needs to be rebuilt and
such rebuilding should be done with
domestically produced steel; and

20
Whereas, there are certain measures that members of the National

the City of Cleveland, LTV Steel and
Northeast Ohio in saving LTV Steel
and to address the crisis facing the

requests the National League of
Cities to adopt a resolution at the

2109 Tate Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio

constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department

By Councilmen Polensek and Cimperman.
An emergency resolution urging
the federal Emergency Steel Loan
Guarantee Board to approve the
request of National City Bank and
Key Bank to guarantee a loan to
LTV Steel Corp.
Whereas, National City Bank and
Key Bank have applied to the federal Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Board seeking federal guarantees to assist in the restructuring of
LTV Steel Corp.; and
Whereas, if granted, the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Board
would guarantee 85% of the principal amount loaned, or $212.5 million
of the $250 million loan; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland,
Cuyahoga County, the State of Ohio
and an unidentified supplier have
agreed to guarantee 13% of the
loan; and
Whereas, the guaranteed loans would
provide LTV with a critical element
of liquidity and stability needed during the current economic downturn
and would support the Company’s
development of an operating cost
structure competitive with the lowest
cost domestic steel producers; and
Whereas, without the assistance
of the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Board the fate of LTV Steel
Corp is grim and the plight of its
employees is uncertain; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation

The City Record
of the public peace, property, health
or safety of the citizens of the City
of Cleveland; now therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
strongly urges the Emergency Steel
Guarantee Board to act favorably
and expeditiously to grant emergency loan assistance to LTV Steel

By Councilman Willis.
An emergency resolution withdrawing objection to the renewal of
a C1 and C2 Liquor Permit to 11625
Superior Avenue, and repealing Res.
No. 1653-01 objecting to said renewal.
Whereas, this Council objected to
the renewal of a C1 and C2 Liquor
Permit to 11625 Superior Avenue by
Res. No. 1653-01 adopted by Council
on August 15, 2001; and
Whereas, this Council wishes to
withdraw its objection to the above
renewal and consents to said renewal; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That objection to the
renewal of a C1 and C2 Liquor Permit to 11625 Superior Avenue, be and
the same is hereby withdrawn and
Res. No. 1653-01, containing said
objection, be and the same is hereby repealed and that this Council

Res. No. 2181-01.
By Councilman Coats.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio State legislature to review
Chapter 2925 of the Revised Code
and expand the area around a
school in which increased penalties
are received for committing drug
offenses to fifteen hundred feet.
Whereas,
under
Revised
Code
Chapter 2925, a drug offense is “committed in the vicinity of a school” if
the offender commits the offense on
school premises, in a school building, or within one thousand feet of
the boundaries of any school premises; and

2917

33
Whereas, under the Revised Code,
committing a drug offense “within
the vicinity of a school” necessarily
increases
the
penalty
for
such
offense; and
Whereas, drug offenses are committed with increasing regularity
just outside the defined 1000 foot
boundary of school premises, which
allows drug offenders to still traffic
drugs relatively near schools, but to
get a lesser penalty for committing
the offense; and
Whereas, expanding the definition
of a drug offense “committed in the
vicinity of a school” to include
offenses committed within fifteen
hundred feet of the boundaries of
any school premises will cause more
drug offenders to be subject to the
enhanced penalty and possibly act
as a deterrent to those who may
traffic drugs near our schools; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio State legislature to review
Chapter 2925 of the Revised Code
and expand the area around a
school in which increased penalties
are received for committing drug
offenses to fifteen hundred feet.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
Governor Bob Taft and the leaders
of the Ohio State legislature.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

An emergency resolution stating
Council’s intention to file a motion
in U.S. Bankruptcy Court to oppose
LTV’s proposed cessation of operations, and supporting the workers of
LTV Steel Company in their fight to
keep LTV Steel Company open.
Whereas,
LTV
Steel
Company
filed for bankruptcy protection in
December, 2000 and, since that time,
financial
institutions,
representatives of local, state and federal gov-

December 5, 2001
ernments, union leaders and company representatives have been working cooperatively to secure a viable
and stable future for the company;
and
Whereas, in a move surprising to
workers and area community leaders, on November 21, 2001, LTV
management filed a motion with the
Youngstown bankruptcy court seeking approval to immediately cease
steel making operations in Cleveland, Indiana, Illinois, and to close
coke ovens in Warren, Ohio and
Chicago; and
Whereas, if this request of LTV
management is approved by the
bankruptcy
court,
approximately
7,500
people,
including
3,200
in
Cleveland, would lose their jobs; and
Whereas, in addition to the lost
jobs, more than 50,000 LTV retirees
and dependents could lose their
health care and have pension benefits reduced; and
Whereas, this Council vehemently
opposes the proposal of LTV to
cease operations and joins with
local and federal leaders, including
Congressman Dennis Kucinich, in
urging the bankruptcy court to deny
LTV’s motion for closure; and
Whereas, as this Council has experienced, when political, community,
religious and labor leaders joined
together to keep St. Michael Hospital open, we were able to stave off
a closure that we were told even
God could not stop; and
Whereas, the livelihood of thousands of Cleveland families and the
economy of our region will be put
at great peril if LTV is permitted to
close permanently; and
Whereas, it is the intention of
this Council to file a motion on
Tuesday, November 27th in the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Youngstown
opposing the closure of LTV and
requesting the appointment of a
trustee to shepherd LTV through
the bankruptcy process so that it
may reorganize and remain in operation; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
strongly opposes the cessation of
operations of LTV Steel Company
and intends to file a motion in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court supporting the
position of Congressman Dennis
Kucinich in objecting to LTV’s
rejection of collective bargaining
agreements, termination of retiree
benefit programs, unilateral cessation of negotiations with labor
unions, designation of key assets for
auction and proposed shutdown of
operations without adequate assurances of compliance with environmental standards.
Section
2.
That
this
Council
believes LTV Steel Company can be
saved through the intervention of a
qualified Trustee to manage and
oversee the affairs of LTV and this
Council will urge the bankruptcy
court to appoint such a Trustee to
help save the company and the jobs
of thousands of workers, and to prevent a devastating impact to the
Cleveland economy.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of

The City Record
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period

An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting
new Section 451.241 relating to prohibiting the parking of vehicles on
vacant lots.
Whereas, vacant lots in the City
often are used as unlicensed parking lots without proper surfacing,
drainage, landscaping or routes of
ingress and egress; and
Whereas, vacant lots in the City
often become littered with abandoned, junk, and unsightly vehicles;
and
Whereas, the parking of vehicles
on vacant lots makes it more difficult for owners of such lots and the
City to prevent and abate nuisances
such as high grass, noxious weeds,
refuse, and stagnant surface water,
which often occur on vacant lots, as
required by Chapter 209 of the City’s
Codified Ordinances; and
Whereas, the City has a licensing
program for commercial parking
lots, in Chapter 457 of the City’s
Codified Ordinances, a program to
alleviate on-street parking congestion on residential streets, in Chapter 461 of the City’s Codified Ordinances, and zoning regulations permitting off-street parking on vacant

parking
in
other

(Chapter 349); and
Whereas,
police

but there is no express prohibition
on parking on vacant lots, and no
express authorization for the City

Board of Zoning Appeals pursuant
to Section 337.14 of the Codified
Ordinances or if the lot meets all of
the requirements of Chapters 337,
339 and 349 of the Zoning Code of
the City.
(d) No permit shall be issued for
a temporary parking use until the
