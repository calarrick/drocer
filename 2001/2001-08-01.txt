Res. No. 316-01.
By Mayor White.
An emergency resolution supporting the H.E.L.P. Program and urging Governor Taft and Ohio Treasurer Joseph T. Deters to adopt and
implement the Ohio Housing Rehabilitation Linked Deposit Program
which would enable Ohio citizens to
receive low interest home improvement loans.
Whereas, the Mayor of the City of
Cleveland and this Council are committed to supporting programs that
assist residents in rehabilitating
their homes and is committed to
improving the housing stock of the
City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, Cuyahoga County Treasurer James Rokakis created and
established the Home Enhancement
Loan Program (“H.E.L.P.”) in Cuyahoga County; and
Whereas, the H.E.L.P. Program
allows homeowners in Cleveland
and other Cuyahoga County communities to borrow money to repair or
remodel their homes or rental property at interest rates three percentage points less than the lowest rate
normally offered by a participating
bank; and
Whereas, these low interest home
improvement loans may be used for
code violation compliance and property upgrades, including maintenance repairs, remodeling improvements and landscaping improvements; and
Whereas, as of December 5, 2000,
participation in the H.E.L.P. Program has resulted in the issuance of
five hundred and sixty low interest
loans to City of Cleveland residents
with a total loan amount exceeding
five million dollars; and
Whereas, the H.E.L.P. Program
has been and continues to be an
excellent resource for City of Cleveland residents and is assisting in
improving the value and quality of
housing available within the City;
and
Whereas, Cuyahoga County Treasurer James Rokakis is encouraging
the State of Ohio to adopt and implement the Ohio Housing Rehabilitation Linked Deposit Program which
would operate in a manner similar
to Cuyahoga County’s H.E.L.P. Program and, therefore, provide additional low interest loans to citizens
of the City of Cleveland who are
interested in rehabilitating their
homes; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that the adoption and
implementation of the Ohio Housing
Rehabilitation Linked Deposit Program will improve the housing
stock of Cleveland and attract new
homeowners to the City of Cleveland; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

City of Cleveland and this Council

The City Record
Res. No. 1421-01.
By Councilman Gordon.
An emergency resolution urging
that the Ohio General Assembly and
Governor Taft support and adopt
legislation requiring that Medicaid
health care insurance providers in
Ohio accept and pay patient billings
from out of network providers located
at
municipally-owned
and/or
operated neighborhood health clinics.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
owns and/or operates a number of
neighborhood outpatient health clinics; and
Whereas, the City’s neighborhood
outpatient health clinics provide
convenient facilities for health services to the general public without
discrimination by reason of race,
creed, color or national origin; and
Whereas, this Council wants to
ensure that high quality health care
services are conveniently and efficiently accessible to all citizens of
the City of Cleveland regardless of
their social or economic circumstances, and to encourage the citizens of the City to seek health care
when needed by providing neighborhood-based clinics for outpatient
primary care; and
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland is concerned that current Ohio law and regulations discourage
patients
from
seeking
health care at convenient neighborhood health care clinics and make
it difficult for municipally-owned
neighborhood clinics to serve all
those who come into their facilities
due to the existence of separate private Medicaid insurance providers
in the State with which health care
providers at such clinics must independently contract for coverage and
patients must independently choose
for their health care insurance coverage; now therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio General Assembly and
Governor Taft to support and adopt
legislation that authorizes health
care service providers at municipally-owned neighborhood health care
clinics to accept all patients for care
who are on Medicaid health care
insurance
plans,
regardless
of
whether or not the provider is within the network of a patient’s Medicaid insurance plan, and authorizing such “out-of-plan” health care
providers
to
bill
and
be
paid
through
any
patient’s
Medicaid
insurer.
Section 2. That this Council urges
the Ohio General Assembly and
Governor Taft to support and adopt
legislation that requires Medicaid
health care insurers contracting
with the State of Ohio not to disapprove for payment the bills for
health care services at municipallyowned neighborhood health care
facilities solely on the basis that the
provider of such health care is outside the Medicaid insurer’s network
of providers.
Section 3. That upon approval, the
Clerk of City Council is hereby
directed to deliver a copy of this
Resolution to Governor Taft, the
Mayor,
the
Director
of
Public
Health, the Commissioner of Health,
and to the Ohio State Representatives and Senators representing the
citizens of Cleveland in the Ohio
General Assembly.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives

1826

August 1, 2001
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force

or threatening to bring an action for
possession of the tenant’s premises,
terminating or threatening to terminate the tenant’s rental agreement,
or refusing to renew the tenant’s

The City Record

safety;
(2) The tenant has complained to

possession of the premises if:

safety code that the tenant complained of was primarily caused by
any act or lack of reasonable care
by the tenant, or by any other person in the tenant’s household, or by
anyone on the premises with the
consent of the tenant;
(3) Compliance with the applicable building, housing, health, or
safety code would require alteration,
remodeling, or demolition of the

deprive the tenant of the use of the

Safety Director with a written statement of the landlord’s name and
address, for the purpose of receiving
documents that, under this Section,
the Safety Director is required to
serve on the landlord. If the landlord fails to provide the office of the
Safety Director with that information in a timely manner, the Safety
Director
shall
make
reasonable
efforts to identify an appropriate
name and address for the landlord
and, based on those efforts, shall
determine the name and address to
be used for such service.
(e) Within ten days after the filing of the petition with the office of
the
Safety
Director,
the
Safety
Director
shall
make
an
initial
assessment,
in
writing,
as
to
whether a security audit of the multifamily structure or development is
appropriate and shall serve the tenants and the landlord with a copy
of the initial assessment.
(1) In the initial assessment, the
Safety Director shall find that a
security audit of the multifamily
structure or development is appropriate if the requirements in this
Section for filing a petition are met
and one or more of the following criteria are met: (i) during the thirty
day period preceding the filing of
the petition, the City of Cleveland
Police Department has received fifteen or more service calls concerning the multifamily structure or
development; (ii) within ten days
after the filing of the petition, the
City of Cleveland Councilmember of
the ward in which the multifamily
structure or development is located
advises the Safety Director, in writing, that a security audit of the multifamily structure or development is
appropriate; or (iii) there is any
other reasonable basis for concluding that, if a security audit is conducted, there is a reasonable possibility that the Safety Director will
specify additional security measures
that the landlord will be obligated
to implement in the common areas
of the multifamily structure or
development.
(2) In determining whether any
such reasonable basis exists, the
Safety
Director
shall
consider,
among other things, the statement
of reasons (if any) in the petition
that requested the security audit,
the number and type of service calls
that the City of Cleveland Police
Department has received concerning
the multifamily structure or development, and the Safety Director’s
preliminary inspection of the common areas of the multifamily structure or development.
(3) The Safety Director shall

The City Record
serve the tenants and the landlord
with a copy of the initial assessment by delivering or mailing it to
their respective addresses.
(f) If the Safety Director determines in an initial assessment that
a security audit of the multifamily
structure or development is not
appropriate,
the
Safety
Director
shall not conduct a security audit of
the multifamily structure or development.
(g) If the Safety Director determines in an initial assessment that
a security audit of the multifamily
structure or development is appropriate, within thirty days after the
Safety Director serves the tenants
and the landlord with the initial
assessment,
the
Safety
Director
shall complete the security audit
and shall serve the tenants and the
landlord with a copy of the written
report of the security audit. The
Safety Director shall serve the tenants and the landlord with a copy
of the written report of the security
audit by delivering or mailing it to
their respective addresses.
(h) If the Safety Director determines in a security audit that the
landlord is obligated to implement
additional security measures in the
common areas of the multifamily
structure or development, the landlord is obligated to implement those
security measures within the reasonable time period(s) specified in
the security audit.
(i)
The
landlord’s
obligation
under this Section and the security
audit to implement the security measures specified in the security audit,
within the reasonable time period(s)
specified in the security audit, is an
implied term of any rental agreement for any dwelling unit in the
multifamily structure or development. If the landlord breaches that
implied term of a rental agreement,
it constitutes a breach of an obligation imposed upon the landlord by
the rental agreement, for the purposes of Section 5321.07(A) of the
Ohio Revised Code.
(j) The tenants of a multifamily
structure or development may not
file a petition pursuant to this Section if, relative to the same multifamily structure or development, a
petition has been filed and served
properly pursuant to this Section
within the preceding 12 months.
(k) If the landlord requests the
Safety Director to inspect the multifamily structure or development to
determine whether the landlord has
implemented the landlord’s obligations under the security audit, within thirty days of the request, the
Safety Director shall make that
determination, in writing, and shall
serve the tenants and the landlord
with a copy of that determination.
The Safety Director shall serve the
tenants and the landlord with a
copy of that determination by delivering or mailing it to their respective addresses.

Browns Stadium and all expenses to
be paid by the City of Cleveland for
the operation or maintenance of

An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting
new Section 343.23 thereof, relating
to pedestrian retail overlay district.
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore

hereby supplemented by enacting
new Section 343.23 thereof to read as
follows:
Section 343.23 Pedestrian Retail
Overlay (PRO) District
(a)
Purpose.
The
Pedestrian
Retail Overlay (PRO) District is
established to maintain the economic viability of older neighborhood
shopping districts by preserving the
pedestrian-oriented
character
of
those districts and to protect public
safety
by
minimizing
conflicts
between vehicles and pedestrians in
neighborhood shopping districts.
(b) Mapping. The PRO District is
an overlay district which shall be
mapped only in an area where at
least seventy five (75%) of the
underlying zoning is either Local
Retail or General Retail. In every
PRO District, any street frontage to
be considered a “Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage,” as defined herein,
shall be so marked on the Zoning
Map, with either one or both sides
of a street designated as such.
(c) Applicability. The PRO District regulations shall apply only in
those portions of a PRO District in
which the underlying zoning is
either
Local
Retail
or
General
Retail. In the relevant portions of a
PRO District, the regulations of the
underlying zoning district shall govern except where in conflict with
the regulations of the PRO District,
in which case the regulations of the
PRO District shall govern.
(d) Definitions. As used in this
section, the following terms shall be
defined as stated below.
(1)
“Pedestrian
Retail
Street
Frontage” means that side or sides
of a public street frontage where
pedestrian-oriented retail shopping

activity exists or is expected to
exist and such street frontage is
specifically designated on the Zoning Map.
(2)
“Pedestrian
Retail
Space”
means that portion of a building or
property located at or closest to the
level of the public sidewalk and
within forty (40) feet of a Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage.
(3) “ Open Sales Lot” means a property or portion thereof used for the
sale of merchandise stored in outdoor, unenclosed locations.
(4) “Institutional Use” means, for
purposes of this section, a school,
day care center, place of worship,
place of assembly, hospital, nursing
home, residential treatment facility,
or similar use.
(5) “Non-Retail Office” means an
office use whose primary activity
does not involve service to customers or clients on the premises.
(e) Use Regulations. All uses permitted in the underlying retail zoning district shall be permitted in the
PRO District, except that the use of
Pedestrian Retail Spaces, as defined
herein, shall be further limited as
follows.
(1) Prohibited Uses. For Pedestrian Retail Spaces, as defined herein,
the following uses shall be prohibited:
A. open sales lots, as defined herein;
B. filling and service stations;
C. car washes;
D. lanes serving a drive-through
facility.
(2) Conditional Uses. For Pedestrian Retail Spaces, as defined herein,
the following uses shall be permitted
as Conditional Uses, as approved by
the City Planning Commission in
accordance with the approval criteria provided in this section:
A. off-street parking or loading
areas;
B. driveways extending across a
public sidewalk;
C. residential, institutional and
non-retail office uses, as defined
herein,
except
that
ground-floor
entrances and lobbies serving such
uses located on upper floors or in a
basement level shall be permitted
without the requirement for conditional approval;
D. any building-enclosed use that
does not have a public pedestrian
entrance from the Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage;
E. any use with more than forty
(40) feet of frontage along the
Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage;
F. a building with an interior side
yard more than four (4) feet in
width and located within forty (40)
feet of a Pedestrian Retail Frontage.
(f) Criteria for Conditional Uses.
The
City
Planning
Commission
shall approve a Conditional Use
application if it determines that the
application meets the following criteria.
(1) In the case of a proposed residential, institutional or non-retail
office use, one or more of the following conditions apply.
A. The subject building space was
designed specifically for the type of
use proposed and, as such, occupancy by an allowed use is an unreasonable expectation.
B. Denial of the application for
occupancy by a conditional use
would result in a long-term vacancy
of the subject property, as demonstrated by the applicant.
C. It has been determined that the
proposed use is needed in the immediate area and that suitable alternative locations are unavailable.

August 1, 2001
(2) In the case of a proposed offstreet parking or loading area or
driveway, one or both of the following conditions apply.
A. The size, shape or layout of the
subject property does not permit
placement of the parking, loading or
driveway in a more suitable location.
B. It has been demonstrated by
the applicant that placement of the
parking, loading or driveway in an
allowed location would jeopardize
the continued occupancy of the subject property by uses suited to the
PRO District.
(3) In the case of a buildingenclosed use that does not have an
entrance from the Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage, one or both of the
following conditions apply.
A. The proposed use will occupy
an existing building that lacks such
pedestrian entrance, and the addition of a conforming pedestrian
entrance is made infeasible by the
configuration of the interior space or
other factors related to the design
and placement of the building.
B. Placement of the pedestrian
entrance in a location other than on
the Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage will result in more suitable
pedestrian access.
(4) In the case of a proposed use
with more than forty (40) feet of
frontage along the Pedestrian Retail
Street Frontage, the subject space
was designed for use at such size
and the proposed use, in the determination of the City Planning Commission,
will
not
have
adverse
impacts on the functioning of nearby pedestrian-oriented retail uses.
(5) In the case of an interior side
yard more than four (4) feet in
width and located within forty (40)
feet
of
a
Pedestrian
Retail
Frontage, the subject building will
be occupied by residential units
which require the greater side yard
area to allow for desirable levels of
light and air.
(g) Maximum Setbacks. Notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
the
underlying zoning district, properties in PRO Districts shall conform
to the following regulations with
respect to maximum setbacks.
(1) Front Street Yard. No main
building on a lot abutting a Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage shall be
set back more than five (5) feet
from the Pedestrian Retail Street
Frontage unless the City Planning
Commission has approved establishment of a surface parking lot in
such location as a Conditional Use.
Such building features as entrances
and display windows may be set
back up to an additional five (5)
feet as long as these features occupy no more than fifty percent (50%)
of the a building’s total frontage.
These setback regulations shall not
apply to portions of buildings above
the first-story level.
(2) Interior Side Yard. No portion
of an interior side yard located within forty (40) feet of a Pedestrian
Retail Street Frontage shall exceed
four (4) feet in width on the ground
floor level, unless the City Planning
Commission has approved a driveway or a residential side yard in
such location as a Conditional Use.
(3) Exceptions for Outdoor Cafes.
A building may be set back a maximum of fifteen (15) feet from the
Pedestrian Retail Street Frontage in
order to accommodate a permanent
outdoor café. If use of such café is
discontinued for a period of two (2)
years or more, the setback area
shall be landscaped or otherwise

The City Record
improved in accordance with a plan
approved by the City Planning Commission.
(h) Window Areas. For any nonresidential building or storefront
facing a Pedestrian Retail Street
Frontage, not less than sixty percent (60%) of the front facade
between 2.5 and 7.5 feet in height
shall be composed of transparent
windows or doors. In addition, not
more
than
twenty-five
percent
(25%) of such window or door area
on a building or storefront shall be
covered with permanent signs.
(i) Parking. In recognition of the
expected greater use of public transit, bicycles and walking by customers and employees traveling to
PRO Districts, the minimum number
of
parking
spaces
otherwise
required by the Zoning Code shall
be reduced by thirty-three percent
(33%) for retail business uses in
such districts. The Board of Zoning
Appeals may further reduce parking
requirements where it has been
demonstrated that additional parking is available in common or
shared parking facilities or in onstreet parking areas located within
a reasonable walking distance of
the use, given the nature of the use
and the district. The Board shall
also consider such factors as the
number of bicycle racks available in
proximity to a use. In making its
determination, the Board shall be
guided by an up-to-date analysis of
parking supply and demand and
other relevant factors submitted by
or on behalf of the applicant. The
City Planning Commission shall
maintain a file of all such parking
analyses submitted for properties in
each PRO District.
(j) Variances. The Board of Zoning Appeals may grant variances to
requirements of this section in accordance with the applicable criteria
stated in Chapter 329 of this code.
(k) Appeals. Appeals from the
decision of the City Planning Commission to approve or disapprove
Conditional
Uses
in
Pedestrian
Retail Spaces shall be made to the
Board of Zoning Appeals.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

allowed by law.

Rainbow Terrace Apartments (collectively, the “Property”); and
Whereas, pursuant to the Act and
the Regulations, HUD has determined that it is necessary and
appropriate to make available an
up-front grant in an amount presently
estimated
not
to
exceed
$11,302,962.00
in
connection
with
rehabilitation and development and
other related development of the

Whereas, in order to provide the

efficient
manner
possible,
HUD wishes to convey title to the

Contract for Sale (the “HUD Contract for Sale”) between HUD and
the City, and to make the up-front
grant available pursuant to an UpFront Grant Agreement (the “Grant
Agreement”) between HUD and the

(the
HUDowned property and the City-owned

from the City and to redevelop a
portion of the Redevelopment Property into affordable rental housing;
and
Whereas, this Council believes
that the acquisition of the Property
from HUD pursuant to the HUD Contract for Sale and the sale of the
Redevelopment
Property
to
the

August 1, 2001
Developer by private negotiation
and the redevelopment of the Redevelopment Property by the Developer pursuant to a Redevelopment
Agreement
(the
“Redevelopment
Agreement”) is in the best interest
of the City and is the best means of
accomplishing the necessary redevelopment of the Redevelopment
Property in order to carry out the
City’s public purpose of providing
safe, decent and sanitary affordable
housing in the City; and
Whereas, in order to complete the
redevelopment of the Redevelopment Property in accordance with
the Act, the Regulations and the
Redevelopment
Agreement,
the
City intends to loan the proceeds of
the up-front grant to the Developer
pursuant
to
the
Redevelopment
Agreement
and
upon
mutually
agreeable terms and conditions as
provided
in
the
Redevelopment
Agreement; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency ordinance providing for the public peace, property, health and safety in that the proposed acquisition, sale and redevelopment of the Redevelopment Property will improve the welfare of the
City and its residents by accomplishing the aforesaid public purpose; now therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. This Council determines
that, in order to carry out the City’s
public purpose of providing safe,
decent

(including
the
HAP contract, the leases and the
other personal property related to
the operation and maintenance of
the Project) to the Developer; provided that Deed shall contain such
restrictive covenants, reversionary
interests or similar provisions as
may, in the judgment of the Director of Community Development, be

of advertising signs or billboards

signs.

and the Redevelopment Agreement.
The loan of the HUD up-front grant
may be made as one loan in multiple installments or as multiple loans
in an aggregate amount not to
exceed $11,302,962.00 and the obligation of the Developer to repay the
loan may be subordinate to the
obligations of the Developer under
any other financing arrangements
for the Property improvements. Notwithstanding and as an exception to
any provision of any Codified Ordi-

1863

51
nances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, if
determined
by
the
Director
of
Finance to be advantageous to the
financing of the Property improvements, the City may evidence all or
a portion of the loan by accepting

such section or part of a section or
