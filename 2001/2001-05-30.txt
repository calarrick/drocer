grade levels and resolving to seek
legislative authority to permit every

immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

An emergency resolution declaring this Council’s support for the
Civilian Conservation Corps and further declaring this Council’s intention to assist the Civilian Conservation Corps in restoring funding so
that the program may continue in
Cleveland.
Whereas, over the past twenty
years, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) has provided
employment and training to over
18,000 young men and women in
Ohio, many of whom have been from
the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, unemployed, often disenfranchised
Cleveland
residents
have had the opportunity to gain
valuable
life
skills,
marketable
work skills and advance their educational levels while working and
learning in the
Cleveland CCC
Camp and in CCC residential camps
in Sandusky and Vinton counties;
and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has made a substantial investment
in youth and young adults from the
City by providing land at Kirtland
Park for the construction of a new
building to house the Cleveland CCC
Camp; and
Whereas, the effectiveness of the
CCC program was recognized in September, 2000 when CCC was honored
by the U.S. Department of Labor as
one of ten model youth employment
and training programs in the nation;
and
Whereas, the governor of the
State of Ohio has proposed to eliminate the CCC program; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby declares its support for the Civilian Conservation Corps and its

Res. No. 315-01.
By Mayor White.
An emergency resolution supporting the introduction and passage of
legislation to provide tax benefits to
qualifying public utilities, corporations and entities who contribute to
certified
neighborhood
assistance
projects.
Whereas, the Mayor of the City of
Cleveland and Cleveland City Council are committed to neighborhood
revitalization and encourage public
and private partnerships that, with
the assistance of non-profit organizations, re-build City neighborhoods;
and
Whereas, State Senator Jeffrey
Armbruster has indicated that he
intends to introduce legislation that
would offer a tax benefit to qualifying public utilities, corporations
and entities that contribute to a certified neighborhood assistance project; and
Whereas, this legislation would
define certified neighborhood assistance projects as affordable housing
projects, community economic development projects, and community service projects operated by nonprofit
corporations; and
Whereas, affordable housing projects would assist in the construction and rehabilitation of affordable
housing; and
Whereas,
community
economic
development projects would assist
in the development of child care
facilities, brownfield redevelopment,
storefront development, industrial
development and commercial development; and
Whereas, community service projects would assist in the provision of
community services to residents of
distressed areas or to low-income families and such services may include
literacy initiatives, high school equivalence diploma classes, individual
development
account
workshops,
homeless services, job training, neighborhood planning, housing counseling, emergency housing assistance,
and crime prevention; and
Whereas,
these
neighborhood
assistance projects will assist in the
rehabilitation of City of Cleveland
neighborhoods and provide services
that are vitally important to many
Cleveland residents; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that the Mayor of the
City of Cleveland and the Cleveland
City Council believe that the neighborhood assistance legislation proposed by State Senator Jeffrey Armbruster
will
increase
corporate
involvement in the redevelopment of
the City of Cleveland and thereby
improve the quality of life in the
City’s neighborhoods, now, therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Mayor of the
City of Cleveland and this Council
support the introduction and passage of legislation to provide tax
benefits to qualifying public utilities, corporations and entities who
contribute to certified neighborhood
assistance projects.

already saturated with other liquor

substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and

of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.

By Councilman Jones.
An emergency resolution to urge
the Congress of the United States,
and particularly the Greater Cleveland delegation, to act quickly to
uphold the democratic vote of the
D.C. City Council to maintain the
D.C. General Hospital as a public
hospital.
Whereas, the City Council of the
District of Columbia, voted unanimously on April 12, 2001, to maintain the D.C. General Hospital as a
public hospital, and to reject proposals to privatize the city’s health
care services; and
Whereas, D.C. General Hospital is
noted for providing life-saving services to the city’s poor, and stands
as a symbol of the struggles and
commitment of America’s urban hospitals to providing health care services to under-served minority communities, and to the under-and-uninsured; and
Whereas, the democratic decision
of the D.C. City Council, supported
by many prominent medical organizations, has been overturned by
actions of the D.C. Financial Control
Board, an entity created by the U.S.
Congress; and
Whereas, serious allegations have
been made, charging that the clos-

14
ing of D.C. Hospital is part of a real
estate development plan, designed
to pressure the poor, largely African
American residents of southeast D.C.
out of the city; and
Whereas, the saving of D.C. General Hospital is a national issue
touching on the General Welfare of
all the people, since the way a
nation treats its disadvantaged citizens, especially in its capital, is a
significant
reflection
on
that
nation’s character and morality, and
the power “to exercise exclusive
Legislation in all Cases whatsoever”
over the District of Columbia, is
given by the U.S. Constitution to the
Congress as a whole; now, therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council memorializes the Congress of the United
States,
particularly
the
Greater
Cleveland delegation, to act quickly
to uphold the democratic vote of the
D.C. City Council.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she is hereby directed to
