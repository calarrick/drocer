An emergency resolution urging
the Policy Committee of the National League of Cities to adopt a resolution at its 2001 Congress of Cities
conference in support of measures to
save LTV Steel Company and to
respond to the crisis facing the U.S.
steel industry.

The City Record
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland is deeply concerned
about the proposed closure of LTV
Steel Company and its impact on our
citizens, our economy and the ability of domestic steel production to
continue in the United States; and
Whereas,
representatives
of
labor, business, government and
community and religious leaders
have joined together in an attempt
to keep LTV Steel open and producing steel; and
Whereas, if LTV is forced to cease
operations, 3,200 jobs will be lost in
Cleveland, 7,500 jobs will be impacted in Ohio, Illinois and Indiana, and
50,000 retirees face losing health
and pension benefits; and
Whereas, LTV’S closure would
have a devastating impact on the
economy of Northeast Ohio and the
State of Ohio since LTV’s estimated
total impact on Ohio’s gross state
product is $2 billion; and
Whereas, in this time of economic
uncertainty and international unrest, the loss of the capability to
produce steel domestically could
pose a threat to national security
and economic vitality; and
Whereas, America’s crumbling infrastructure needs to be rebuilt and
such rebuilding should be done with
domestically produced steel; and
Whereas, there are certain measures that members of the National
League of Cities can take to assist
the City of Cleveland, LTV Steel and
Northeast Ohio in saving LTV Steel
and to address the crisis facing the
U.S. steel industry; and
Whereas, this Council respectfully
requests the National League of
Cities to adopt a resolution at the
2001 Congress of Cities conference
supporting LTV and the domestic
steel industry; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
respectfully
requests
that
the
National League of Cities adopt a
resolution at the 2001 Congress of
Cities conference supporting LTV
and the domestic steel industry and
requesting the following:
1. Urging the immediate passage
of H.B. 808, the Steel Revitalization
Act of 2001, currently pending in
Congress that would provide certain
safeguards for the domestic steel
industry; and
2. Urging President George W.
Bush to immediately initiate action
under Section 201 of the Trade Act
of 1974 to use all appropriate remedies to immediately limit the saturation of the U.S. domestic steel
industry by placing a moratorium on
foreign-made steel, or alternatively,
limiting illegally traded foreignmade
steel
to
levels
existing
between June 1994 and June 1997;
and
3. Urging the modification of the
Steel Guarantee Program to assist
steel makers in gaining access to
resources
for
reinvestment
and
restructuring and to increase available funding and guarantee limits.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it

W. 105th St., Unit A.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Director of Liquor Control of an application for the transfer of ownership of a C2 and C2X
Liquor Permit from Permit No.
40873760010, Edmon M. Husary, DBA
Almirea Beverage, 3312 W. 105th St.,

5339513, Lucky Mart Stop Inc., DBA
Almira Beverage, 3312 W. 105th St.,
Unit A, Cleveland, Ohio 44111; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement

12
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
