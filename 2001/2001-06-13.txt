thereby serving 15% of Ohio’s population; and
Whereas, the Cleveland Public
Library is a regional library for the
blind and physically handicapped,
serving approximately 19,000 library
customers with special challenges in
55 counties in Northern Ohio; and

Government Support Fund to the
State Library, negatively impacting
the Cleveland Public Library by
$728,000; and
Whereas, the proposed budget
reduces funding for the regional
library for the blind and physically
handicapped, negatively impacting
the Cleveland Public Library by an
additional $186,000; and
Whereas, the proposed state budget freezes the Library and Local
Government Support Fund, with the
total negative impact on the Cleveland Public Library estimated to be
$4,193,000 over a 2 year period; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,

The City Record
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted June 4, 2001.
Awaiting the approval or disapproval of the Mayor.
Res. No. 1101-01.
By Councilmen Lewis and Jones.
An emergency resolution opposing
the proposed Elective Alternative
Regulation Plan (“EARP”) rules
proposed by the PUCO, requesting
the PUCO to hold an additional public hearing at Cleveland City Hall
in the evening, and encouraging the
public to attend the public hearing
on June 22nd.
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland is concerned that the
Staff of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (“PUCO”) has proposed
new
rules
allowing
SBC
Ameritech and other local exchange
companies in Ohio to elect an “off
the shelf” alternative regulation
plan that will allow such companies
to double the rates for some services
like second and third phone lines
and basic Caller ID, and will allow
unlimited increases in rates for
packages of services that include
basic local telephone service, and
many other services that residential
consumers use everyday in their
homes, such as Call Waiting and
Call Forwarding, among many others, and that such increase would be
allowed without adequate notice to
consumers
or
any
oversight
or
approval by the PUCO; and
Whereas, the Council is concerned
that the PUCO is proposing to deregulate the prices of many phone services, and to allow Ameritech and
other phone companies to earn
excess profits without any controls,
even though there is no competition
in the residential telephone market
place, and no real choice for consumers; and
Whereas, this Council is deeply
concerned and disturbed that the
Chairman of the PUCO has stated
that telephone rates for every service except for a single basic service line in the home should be
allowed to increase as high as the
companies
want
to
raise
them,
because they are not essential services, and consumers can simply
choose not to buy these services,
despite the lack of any competitor
offering such services to consumers;
and
Whereas, the proposed elective
Alternative Regulation Plan rules
would allow SBC Ameritech to abandon its existing PUCO-approved, and
heavily negotiated Alternative Regulation Plan, which does not expire
until 2003, and to choose the new
“off the shelf” Elective Alternative
Regulation Plan (“EARP”), which
could
throw
thousands
of
low
income customers off of their lifeline discount program, and could
otherwise
diminish
or
eliminate
many other commitments Ameritech
has made to the PUCO and consumers; and
Whereas, the proposed new rules
are unlawful and unnecessary, and
would harm rather than help consumers; and

1280

June 13, 2001
Whereas,
the
PUCO
just
announced local public hearings,
including one hearing in Cleveland
in the afternoon, at the Lausche
State Office Tower, 2nd Floor Auditorium, 615 Superior Avenue, in
downtown Cleveland, at 2:00 p.m. on
Friday, June 22nd, and they will
provide an opportunity for the public to make their concerns about the
PUCO’s proposal known to the PUCO
Commissioners; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes the approval by the PUCO of the
proposed Elective Alternative Regulation Plan (“EARP”) Rules in Case
Nos. 00-1532-TP-COI, 99-563-TP-COI,
and 99-998-TP-COI, and urges the
PUCO to withdraw or disapprove the
rules, and instead to initiate a proceeding to determine the best way
to bring about real competition in
the provision of local phone service,
while fully protecting residential
consumers from higher prices for
services, before any further deregulation of rates and services is permitted.
Section
2.
That
this
Council
believes
that
a
public
hearing
should also be held in the evening
in Cleveland, to accommodate more
Cleveland-area citizens who cannot
attend a hearing during the work
day, and would welcome the PUCO
to hold such an evening hearing at
Cleveland City Hall in Council
Chambers, the site for numerous
PUCO public hearings in the past.
Section 3. That this Council urges
the citizens of Cleveland to attend
the public hearing in Cleveland to
voice their concerns about the proposed rules and their opposition to
allowing the phone company to
increase their rates without oversight or approval by the PUCO and
without any input from consumers.
Section 4. That upon approval, the
Clerk of City Council is hereby
directed to deliver a copy of this
Resolution to the Mayor, to the
City’s Law Director, and to the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio
(“PUCO”), to be filed on the public
record in Case Nos. 00-1532-TP-COI,
99-563-TP-COI, and 99-998-TP-COI.
Section 5. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Whereas, the commission was created to serve the African-American

Whereas, this Council of the City

Males
(CAAM)

hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives

it shall take effect and be in force

evaluate and improve voting procedures; encouraging the Board of
Elections to include a voter education component in any reforms to
the voting process; and urging federal, state and local legislatures to
assist in financing improved voting
technology.
Whereas, it is imperative in a
democracy that there be unqualified
confidence in election procedures
and voting systems; and
Whereas, it is also imperative that
the process of exercising one’s constitutionally protected right to vote
be as problem-free and voter-friendly as possible to effect an outcome
which is accurate and untainted;

Whereas, through passage of various resolutions, this Council has
expressed interest in ensuring the
integrity of the voting process by
urging the General Assembly of the
State of Ohio to abolish the “five

The City Record
minute rule” which prohibits voters
from occupying a voting machine
for more than five minutes when
other voters are waiting to occupy
them, urging the prohibition of the
use of “butterfly” ballots in the State
of Ohio, and urging a state-wide
comprehensive voter education program; and
Whereas, this Council commends
the actions of the Cuyahoga County
Board of Elections in its desire to
improve
the
voting
process
by
replacing the current punch card

Board of Elections is successful in
its mission to implement electronic
voting
technology
in
Cuyahoga
County, that a comprehensive voter
education program be implemented

and
Whereas, this Council encourages

to assist the Board of Elections in
this undertaking, which is estimated to cost approximately $20 million;
