the affirmative vote of two-thirds of

Whereas, pursuant to Ordinance
No. 948-95, passed June 19, 1995, this
Council designated an area which is

and
described in File No. 948-95-A, as the

Revised Code; and
Whereas, Quark Biotech, Incorporated (the “Enterprise”) has proposed to make building improvements and to purchase machinery,
equipment, furniture and fixtures

Whereas, the Enterprise has certified to the City that, but for abatement of personal property and real
estate taxes the Enterprise would be
at a competitive disadvantage by
operating at this location; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure in that

City Council.
Section 4. That the Director of
Economic Development is hereby
authorized to charge and accept
fees in an amount not to exceed the
maximum allowable under Chapter
5709 of the Revised Code and such
funds are hereby appropriated for
the purposes set forth in Chapter
5709 of the Revised Code. Such fees
shall be deposited to and expended
from Fund No. 17 SF 305, Loan Fees
Fund.
Section 5. That the Director of
Law shall prepare and approve said
agreement and that said agreement
shall contain such terms and provisions as he deems necessary to protect the City’s interest.
Section 6. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it

D.C. City Council to maintain the
D.C. General Hospital as a public
hospital.
Whereas, the City Council of the
District of Columbia, voted unanimously on April 12, 2001, to maintain the D.C. General Hospital as a
public hospital, and to reject proposals to privatize the city’s health
care services; and
Whereas, D.C. General Hospital is
noted for providing life-saving services to the city’s poor, and stands
as a symbol of the struggles and
commitment
of
America’s
urban
hospitals to providing health care
services to under-served minority
communities, and to the under-anduninsured; and
Whereas, the democratic decision
of the D.C. City Council, supported
by many prominent medical organizations, has been overturned by
actions of the D.C. Financial Control
Board, an entity created by the U.S.
Congress; and
Whereas, serious allegations have
been made, charging that the closing of D.C. Hospital is part of a real
estate development plan, designed
to pressure the poor, largely African
American residents of southeast D.C.
out of the city; and
Whereas, the saving of D.C. General Hospital is a national issue
touching on the General Welfare of
all the people, since the way a
nation treats its disadvantaged citizens, especially in its capital, is a
significant
reflection
on
that
nation’s character and morality,
and the power “to exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever” over the District of Columbia, is given by the U.S. Constitution to the Congress as a whole;
now, therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council memorializes the Congress of the United
States,
particularly
the
Greater
Cleveland delegation, to act quickly
to uphold the democratic vote of the
D.C. City Council.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she is hereby directed to
transmit two certified copies of
this resolution to the U.S. Congress,
and the Greater Cleveland delegation.

By Mayor White.
An emergency resolution supporting the efforts of the Cleveland
Restoration Society, the Downtown
Cleveland Partnership, and Downtown Ohio, Inc. in preparing a proposal, for submission to members of
the Ohio State Legislature, to provide a historic property rehabilitation tax credit for the renovation
and maintenance of historic property.
Whereas, the Mayor of the City of
Cleveland and this Council support
legislative initiatives that provide a
tax inventive to taxpayers who contribute to the preservation of historic buildings by rehabilitating
such buildings; and
Whereas, federal law establishes
a tax credit for the rehabilitation of
certified historic structures; and
Whereas, Ohio law currently does
not offer a tax credit for the rehabilitation of historic property; and
Whereas, the Cleveland Restoration Society, the Downtown Cleveland Partnership and Downtown
Ohio, Inc. are preparing a proposal,
for submission to members of the
Ohio State Legislature, to grant a
historic property rehabilitation tax
credit for the renovation and maintenance of historic property; and
Whereas, the Ohio State Legislature’s adoption of such proposal
would assist Cleveland taxpayers in
rehabilitating, preserving and main-

The City Record
taining historic structures throughout the City; and
Whereas, the National Register of
Historic Places includes approximately one hundred and ninety historic structures in the City of Cleveland and the preservation of these
structures is vitally important to the
City’s efforts to preserve the unique
character of Cleveland’s neighborhoods and Central Business District;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that a State of Ohio tax
credit for the renovation and maintenance of historic property will
assist the City of Cleveland in promoting the renovation and preservation of historic structures within
the City; now, therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Mayor of the
City of Cleveland and this Council
support the efforts of the Cleveland
Restoration Society, the Downtown
Cleveland Partnership, and Downtown Ohio, Inc. in preparing a proposal, for submission to members of
the Ohio State Legislature, to provide a historic property rehabilitation tax credit for the renovation
and maintenance of historic property.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to furnish a

requested to furnish a copy of this
resolution to Director James Manuel
of the State of Ohio Office of Urban
Development within the Department
of Development.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period

Res. No. 861-01.
By Councilman Polensek.
An emergency resolution supporting H.R. 1564, creating and funding
the Federal Bank for Infrastructure
Modernization for purposes of funding state and local infrastructure
projects.
Whereas,
Congressmen
Dennis
Kucinich and Steven LaTourette
joined in a recent bipartisan effort
to introduce H.R. 1564 in the United
States House of Representatives
that would create and fund a program to provide zero-interest loans
to finance state and local infrastructure projects in the amount of
approximately $500 billion over the
course of 10 years; and
Whereas, this program would create and fund the Federal Bank for
Infrastructure Modernization from
a portion of securities currently
held by the Federal Reserve and
would permit cities to use the
funds to improve schools, roadways

1019

45
and bridges, water systems and
other infrastructure improvements;
and
Whereas, the American Society for
Civil Engineers estimates the United States needs $1.3 trillion in infrastructure improvements over the
next five years; and
Whereas, the program advocated
by Congressmen Kucinich and LaTourette would enable cities to
effectuate certain needed infrastructure improvements, including the
provision that 20% of loan funds
must be spent on school improvements; and
Whereas, H.R. 1564 would require
the use of domestic steel, thereby
benefiting the economy as well as
the domestic steel industry since
most infrastructure projects require
the use of steel; and
Whereas, this Council urges Congress to pass H.R. 1564; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland supports the passage of H.R. 1564, creating and funding the Federal Bank for Infrastructure
Modernization
for
purposes of funding state and local
infrastructure projects.
Section 2. That the Clerk is hereby requested to transmit a copy of
this resolution to President George
W. Bush, Speaker of the House of
Representatives Dennis Hastert, U.S.
Representatives Dennis J. Kucinich
and Steven C. LaTourette.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Res. No. 863-01.
By Councilman White.
An
emergency
resolution
expressing concern about the cost of
home and automobile insurance
premiums that residents of Cleveland must pay and stating Council’s intention to hold hearings to
determine ways in which such
rates can be lowered.
Whereas, residents of Cleveland
are often subjected to higher costs
to secure home and automobile
insurance than residents living in
surrounding suburban communities;
and
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland is deeply concerned
that our residents are being subjected unfairly to these increased
costs; and
Whereas, it is the intention of this
Council to research and hold hearings on the issue of increased insurance costs for our residents and to
seek the assistance of Director of
Insurance for the State of Ohio, Lee
Covington, to determine methods for
lowering insurance rates for residents of Cleveland; and

46
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland is concerned about
the high premiums that residents of
Cleveland must pay to secure home
and automobile insurance in comparison to our suburban neighbors
and intends to hold hearings to
determine ways in which such rates
can be lowered.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to transmit
a copy of this resolution to Lee Covington, Director of Insurance for the
State of Ohio.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives

Res. No. 864-01.
By Councilman Willis.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio General Assembly and the
Ohio Secretary of State to conduct a
comprehensive study of election procedures and election-related issues
in the State of Ohio and urging the
Ohio General Assembly to enact a
comprehensive package of voting
reforms, including a voter education
program.
Whereas, it is imperative in a
democracy that there be unqualified
confidence in election procedures
and voting systems; and
Whereas, it is also imperative that
the process of exercising one’s constitutionally protected right of the
franchise be as problem-free and
voter-friendly as humanly possible
to effect an outcome which is accurate and untainted; and
Whereas, in the last presidential
election in the State of Ohio, and
throughout many other states, thousands of ballots were not counted due
to overvotes by confused voters; and
Whereas, this Council has previously, in Resolution No. 2125-2000,
adopted March 19, 2001, urged the
General Assembly of the State of
Ohio to abolish the “five minute
rule” as set forth in Ohio Revised
Code section 3503.23 which prohibits
voters from occupying a voting compartment or voting machine for
more than five minutes when other
voters are waiting to occupy them;
and
Whereas, Resolution No. 2125-2000
also urged the state legislators and
the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections to prohibit the use of “butterfly” ballots in the State of Ohio; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland urges the Ohio

The City Record
General Assembly and the Ohio Secretary of State to conduct a comprehensive study of election procedures, voting systems and electionrelated issues in the State of Ohio
which impact on the fairness and/or
accuracy of the vote; and that the
Ohio General Assembly enact a comprehensive
package
of
voting
reforms needed to correct problems
identified in the existing patchwork
of election procedures.
Section 2. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland urges the Ohio
General Assembly and the Ohio Secretary
of
State
to
institute
a
statewide voter education program
to address and remedy issues identified in the election study requested by the aforementioned Section 1.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to transmit
a copy of this resolution to the
Cuyahoga County delegation to the
Ohio General Assembly, Ohio Secretary of State Kenneth Blackwell,
and Governor Robert Taft.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
