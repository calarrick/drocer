FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES REFERRED
Ord. No. 536-01.
By Councilman Brady.
An emergency ordinance to enact
new
Sections
603A.01
through
603A.18 and Section 603A.99 of the
Codified Ordinances of Cleveland,
Ohio, 1976, to define “exotic animal,”
to prohibit the keeping of an exotic
animal unless its owner obtains a
personal possession permit, to promote the safe handling of exotic animals, and to enact regulations and
prohibitions pertaining to exotic animals.
Whereas, exotic animals are by
their very nature wild and potentially dangerous; and
Whereas, for the reasons set forth
in Section 603A.01 hereof, there are
rational and compelling governmental purposes in regulating exotic animals; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
hereby supplemented by enacting
new
Sections
603A.01
through
603A.18 and 603A.99 thereof to read,
respectively, as follows:
Chapter 603A
EXOTIC ANIMALS
Section 603A.01 Findings
It is hereby found that the animals listed in Section 603A.02, “Exotic Animal Defined”, are by their
very nature wild and potentially
dangerous. They do not adapt well
to a captive environment. Exotic
animals are generally unsuitable as
household pets. Exotic animals are
often acquired without the owner
being fully cognizant of the animal’s potential for dangerousness,
or of its proper and humane care. It
is further found that exotic animals
have sometimes escaped in residential neighborhoods and constituted a
threat to the safety, health and welfare of the general public. In consideration of the interests of exotic
animal owners, the community at
large, and the animals themselves,
it is hereby found that exotic animals, where permitted, should be
regulated. In view of these interests,
it is further found that persons that
currently own exotic animals should
be permitted to obtain personal possession permits for the animals if
they are in compliance with the
requirements of this chapter, but
that no exotic animals other than
those already lawfully kept in the
City should be permitted.
Documents that this Council considered in the adoption of this legislation are contained in File No.
536-01-A are hereby made a part of
the legislative record of this ordinance.

Whereas, the members of the safety forces serving the residents and
businesses of the City of Cleveland
are regularly required to place
themselves in harms’ way in the performance of their official duties; and
Whereas, the dangers encountered
by Cleveland safety force personnel
frequently take a high toll on safety force members and their families;
and
Whereas, this Council finds that
members of the safety forces of the
City face hazards greater that those
faced by safety forces in other cities
in the State of Ohio and in many
cities throughout the United States;
and
Whereas, this Council finds that
the safety forces of the City are
highly skilled, face extreme physical
dangers, including threats of assault
and murder, and must contend with
stringent
regulations
concerning
behavior at work or otherwise; and
Whereas, this Council finds Cleveland’s safety forces are not competitively paid in comparison to other
large cities in the State of Ohio, or
in comparison to most of Cleveland’s
suburban neighbors; and
Whereas,
this
Council
further
finds that the City’s safety forces
bargaining units deserve external
comparative bargaining standards,
specifically with respect to wages

benefits in other comparable cities;

Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland supports hard
work and dedication of the members
of Cleveland’s safety forces and
believes that such personnel should

Whereas, through the recent testimony of Judges Timothy McGinty
and Larry Jones at the March 21,
2001, Committee on Public Safety,
This Council became aware of the
“straight release” program currently
utilized in the City of Cleveland
that allows criminals to be returned
to the streets without performing
background checks; and
Whereas, the straight release program
has
enabled
criminals
to
repeatedly perpetrate crimes, including murder; and
Whereas, this Council finds the
straight release program to be a
poorly thought-out, quick fix to the
overcrowded jail conditions, with little consideration being afforded the
law-abiding citizens of our city that
deserve and are entitled to protection from these criminals; and
Whereas, this Council vehemently
urges the Mayor and Director of
Public Safety to cease the straight
release program immediately, to
permit police overtime when necessary to protect the safety of our citizens and neighborhoods, to hire
additional police officers and prosecutors, and to work with Council
and representatives of the county to
plan a new, centralized jail facility;
and
Whereas, the Committee on Public
Safety intends to convene additional hearings on the issue of the
Administration
permitting
repeat
offenders to be returned to our
neighborhoods; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland vehemently urges
the Mayor and Director of Public
Safety to cease the straight release
program
immediately,
to permit
police overtime when necessary to

and that the Committee on Public
Safety intends to convene additional hearings on the issue of the
Administration
permitting
repeat
offenders to be returned to our
neighborhoods.

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 2125-2000.
By Councilman Willis.
An emergency resolution urging
the General Assembly of the State
of Ohio to abolish the “five minute
rule” set forth in state election law,
R.C. Section 3505.23, and further urging the Cuyahoga County Board of
Elections and the General Assembly
of the State of Ohio to prohibit the
use of “butterfly” ballots in Cuyahoga County.
Whereas, the most recent national
election has caused voter confusion
and public criticism of certain election laws in states across the country; and
Whereas,
Ohio’s
election
laws
mandate that no voter shall be
allowed to occupy a voting compartment or voting machine more

March 28, 2001
than five (5) minutes when all the
voting compartments or machines
are in use and voters are waiting to
occupy them; and
Whereas, the use of “butterfly”
ballots in Cuyahoga County in this
past election, as in other parts of
the state and the country, caused
confusion and questions about voting procedures; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes
an emergency measure for the immediate preservation of public peace,
property, health or safety, in that it
is imperative to make the voting
process as precise as possible and
allow voters ample time to read and
mark their ballots now, therefore,

An emergency ordinance to supplement the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, by enacting
new Section 185.022 thereof, relating
to use of domestic steel.

602

March 28, 2001
Whereas, domestic steel companies, including steel companies located in the Cleveland area, are encountering financial difficulties; and
Whereas, this Council has determined that it is in the public interest for the City of Cleveland to use
domestic steel in public improvement projects; and
Whereas, providing a system of
preference for bid specifications for
public improvement projects which
incorporate the use of domestic steel
will promote and encourage the
growth of domestic steel companies,
including companies located in the
Cleveland area, will increase local
steel job opportunities, and will benefit the local economy; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, are
hereby supplemented by enacting
new Section 185.022 thereof, to read
as follows:
Section 185.022 Use of Domestic
Steel
(a) For purposes of this section
“domestic steel” shall mean steel (i)
made from materials found in the
United States and (ii) fabricated in
the United States.
(b) All bid specifications for public improvements shall request the
bidder to determine whether he or
she is able to submit a bid using
domestic steel. If both of the following apply, the bidder shall submit an alternate bid using the maximum amount of domestic steel possible in light of the technology in
existence at the time the bid is submitted:
(1) the public improvement which
incorporates domestic steel is of
equal or superior quality to that of
a like public improvement which
incorporates imported or foreignmade steel; and
(2) the public improvement may
be constructed at a cost which is not
more than five percent (5%) greater
than the cost of an improvement
which is constructed of only imported or foreign-made steel. Even if
divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this
section do not apply, the bidder
may, at his or her option, submit an
alternate bid using domestic steel.
(c) In evaluating bids for a public improvement, the Commissioner
of Purchases and Supplies shall give
preference to a public improvement
bid which incorporates domestic
steel, provided that the City official
who oversees construction of the
improvement determines that the
quality of such improvement is
equal or superior to that of a like
improvement which is bid using
only imported or foreign-made steel,
and provided further that the
price bid for the public improvement which incorporates domestic
steel does not exceed by more than
five percent (5%) the lowest price
bid for the improvement which is
constructed only of imported or
foreign-made steel. The Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies
shall promulgate regulations for the
application of the preference. Said
regulations shall be published in the
City Record and shall include a
requirement that the Commissioner
take into consideration the total percentage of domestic steel used in
the improvement.
