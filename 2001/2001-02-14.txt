the
Director
of

Safety,
through the Division of Fire, to
fully staff and operate the fire safety boat.
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland is charged with representing the interests of the citizens
of the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, the safety and wellbeing of the citizens is of paramount
importance to this Council; and
Whereas, through the 2000 budget,
Council allocated general funds for
the maintenance and operation of a
fire boat; and
Whereas,
the
Administration
pledged that the fire boat would be
fully staffed and operational; however, such pledge was broken and the
fire boat has not been staffed; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That notwithstanding
any provisions of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976 to the
contrary, the Director of Public Safety, through the Division of Fire,
shall staff, operate and cause the fire
boat to be maintained with a minimum of four firefighters on regular
duty per company per twenty-four
hour day for each day of the year.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Sections 603.091, 603.032 and 603.072

Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of

(5) Detain livestock in railroad

214

February 14, 2001

may
be
detained in any cars or compartments without food, water, and

former owner. The balance of the
proceeds from the sale, if any, shall
be paid to the former owner of the
animal.

Res. No. 231-01.
By Councilman Brady.
An emergency resolution strongly
urging the administration to seek to
provide affordable health care benefits to school crossing guards during upcoming contract negotiations
with health care insurance providers.
Whereas, school crossing guards
benefit the citizens of the City by
ensuring the safety of its school

crossing guard prohibits a person
from holding down a full-time job;
and
Whereas, school crossing guards
working for the City are not provided affordable health care benefits, as are other City employees;
and
Whereas, the salaries of school
crossing guards are extremely low,
thereby increasing the need for
affordable health care benefits; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

6416010, Nisreen Nenra Inc., DBA

substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and

Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland urges all utility companies to compile a list of entities
affiliated with or authorized by the
respective utility company to accept
payment for services; and
Whereas, the utility companies
should publish such lists in the local
newspapers,
through
local
news
media and in the public libraries as
a protection for our citizens against
unscrupulous entities; and
Whereas, our citizens should consult such lists and make payment
only to utility-authorized entities;
and
Whereas, in the event that payment is made to an unauthorized
entity and such payment for utility
service is not processed timely to
the utility company, citizens should
immediately notify the utility company and the police department that
a fraud has occurred; and

immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,

unauthorized entity and such payment for utility service is not
processed timely to the utility company, citizens should immediately
notify the utility company and the

occurred.

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 184-01.
By Councilman Cimperman.
An emergency resolution objecting to the transfer of ownership of
a D5 Liquor Permit to 3146 West
14th Street.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Director of Liquor Control of an application for the transfer of ownership of a D5 Liquor Permit to 3146 West 14th Street from

6548676, 14th Street Café Inc., 3146
West 14th Street, Cleveland, Ohio
44113; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor

Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local

Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health

permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department
of Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Director of
Liquor Control within 30 days of
notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby record its objection to the transfer of ownership of a D5 Liquor Permit to 3146 West 14th Street from

Cleveland, Ohio 44113 to Permit No.
6548676, 14th Street Café Inc., 3146
West 14th Street, Cleveland, Ohio
44113 and requests the Director of
Liquor Control to set a hearing for
said application in accordance with
provisions of Section 4303.26 of the

resolution, together with two copies
of a letter of objection and two

hearing be held in Cleveland, Cuyahoga County.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,

parents and students should encourage and foster such involvement;
and
Whereas, this Council has been
made aware that the Senate Athletic
League, of which many Cleveland
schools, such as Glenville, John Hay

were
required has been changed; and

should review this issue and return
to night basketball games; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

times the permit holder shall maintain a performance bond sufficient
to cover the demolition and removal
of the telecommunications facility.
Such bond shall be sufficient to
guarantee full and faithful performance of the requirements of this
chapter and shall be satisfactory to
the Commissioner of Building and
Housing and the Director of Law.
On each biennial anniversary of the
issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy
for
a
telecommunications
tower, or not more than ninety (90)
days prior to that date, the permit
holder shall provide to the Commissioner of Building and Housing
proof that the performance bond
requirements of this section are met.
