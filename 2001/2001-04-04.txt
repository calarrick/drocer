Res. No. 574-01.
By Councilmen Polensek and Cimperman.
An emergency resolution supporting the hard work and dedication of
the Cleveland safety forces and
encouraging the use of external,
like work force employment factors
when determining base compensation and increases in salary and/or
other benefits.
Whereas, the members of the
safety forces serving the residents
and businesses of the City of Cleveland are regularly required to place
themselves in harms’ way in the
performance of their official duties;
and
Whereas, the dangers encountered
by Cleveland safety force personnel
frequently take a high toll on safety force members and their families;
and
Whereas, this Council finds that
members of the safety forces of the
City face hazards greater that those
faced by safety forces in other cities
in the State of Ohio and in many
cities throughout the United States;
and
Whereas, this Council finds that
the safety forces of the City are
highly skilled, face extreme physical
dangers, including threats of assault
and murder, and must contend with
stringent
regulations
concerning
behavior at work or otherwise; and
Whereas, this Council finds Cleveland’s safety forces are not competitively paid in comparison to other
large cities in the State of Ohio, or
in comparison to most of Cleveland’s
suburban neighbors; and
Whereas,
this
Council
further
finds that the City’s safety forces
bargaining units deserve external
comparative bargaining standards,
specifically with respect to wages

April 4, 2001
and increases in salary and/or other
benefits in other comparable cities;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland supports hard
work and dedication of the members
of Cleveland’s safety forces and
believes that such personnel should
be remunerated fairly and, provided
there
are
sufficient
financial
resources, that consideration should
be given to paying them in a like
manner to similar or identical safety force members in other comparable cities in Ohio and throughout
the country when determining the
base compensation and increases in
salary and/or other benefits paid to
such employees.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period

Res. No. 575-01.
By Councilmen Polensek and Cimperman.
An emergency resolution urging
the Mayor and Director of Public
Safety to cease the straight release
program
immediately,
to
permit
police overtime when necessary to
protect the safety of our citizens
and neighborhoods, to hire additional police officers and prosecutors, and to work with Council and
representatives of the county to
plan a new, centralized jail facility.
Whereas, through the recent testimony of Judges Timothy McGinty
and Larry Jones at the March 21,
2001, Committee on Public Safety,
This Council became aware of the
“straight release” program currently
utilized in the City of Cleveland
that allows criminals to be returned
to the streets without performing
background checks; and
Whereas, the straight release program
has
enabled
criminals
to
repeatedly perpetrate crimes, including murder; and
Whereas, this Council finds the
straight release program to be a
poorly thought-out, quick fix to the
overcrowded jail conditions, with little consideration being afforded the
law-abiding citizens of our city that
deserve and are entitled to protection from these criminals; and
Whereas, this Council vehemently
urges the Mayor and Director of
Public Safety to cease the straight
release program immediately, to
permit police overtime when necessary to protect the safety of our citizens and neighborhoods, to hire
additional police officers and prosecutors, and to work with Council
and representatives of the county to
plan a new, centralized jail facility;
and
Whereas, the Committee on Public
Safety intends to convene additional hearings on the issue of the

The City Record
Administration
permitting
repeat
offenders to be returned to our
neighborhoods; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland vehemently urges
the Mayor and Director of Public
Safety to cease the straight release
program
immediately,
to
permit
police overtime when necessary to
protect the safety of our citizens
and neighborhoods, to hire additional police officers and prosecutors, and to work with Council and
representatives of the county to
plan a new, centralized jail facility;
and that the Committee on Public
Safety intends to convene additional hearings on the issue of the
Administration
permitting repeat
offenders to be returned to our
neighborhoods.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives

all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it

hereby supplemented by enacting
new Section 337.081 to read as follows:
Section 337.081 Downtown Residential (DR) District
(a) Purpose. A Downtown Residential (DR) District is established
to reserve suitably-located sites for
development or retention of residential uses, supplemented by compatible retail or office uses, within
the downtown area of the City of
Cleveland. Reservation of such sites
for residential use is intended to
strengthen
the
economy of the
City’s central business district by
supplementing
the
demand
for
retail and entertainment uses, particularly during evening and weekend hours. Establishment of a downtown residential zoning district is
also intended to protect residential
uses in the downtown area from
detrimental effects of incompatible
uses.

667

41
(b) Definition of Residential Use.
For purposes of this section, the
term “residential use” shall refer to
dwelling units, hotel rooms, dormitory rooms, live/work space, and all
hallways and other common areas
serving such units or rooms.
(c) Permitted Uses. In a Downtown Residential (DR) District, permitted uses shall be limited to the
following, provided that at least
fifty-one percent (51%) of all floor
area devoted to main uses in each
main building or complex of main
and accessory buildings shall be in
residential use, as defined in division (b) of this section:

offices,
(3) restaurants, taverns and other
eating establishments,

(6) banks and other financial service establishments, copying and
printing services, employment agencies, and other business service
establishments, except as prohibited
in division (d) of this section,
(7) museums, libraries, galleries,

purposes,
(8) parking and other accessory

(9) uses similar to those permitted with respect to the type of goods
sold, the type of services offered,

listed as permitted nor determined
to be a similar use are prohibited.
In addition, the following uses are
specifically prohibited in Downtown
Residential (DR) Districts:
(1) uses permitted only in an
Industrial District,

exterior signs are displayed,
(3) adult entertainment uses, as
defined in Section 347.07 of this
Code,
(4) animal kennels and establishments in which animal slaughtering
is conducted.

an accessory use but shall be limited to a maximum of two (2) parking spaces per dwelling unit plus

spaces that would be required for
any non-residential floor area, if
such property were subject to the
parking requirements of this zoning
code.

building shall be devoted exclusively to retail, office, or other permitted non-residential main uses. Such
uses shall be located only in build-

42
ings which are devoted principally
to residential use or to garages providing parking for the residential
uses.
(g) Exceptions to Yard Regula tions. Requirements for interior side
yards and rear yards may be waived
by the Board of Zoning Appeals in
Downtown Residential (DR) Districts if the Board determines that
one of the following factors applies:
(1) the subject property owner
has obtained a legal interest from
an adjoining property owner to provide yard areas which are equivalent to those required — such legal
interest to be properly recorded, to
be of appropriate duration and to be
filed with the Division of Building
and Housing prior to issuance of a
Building Permit;
(2) no windows for residential
uses are located in any side of the
building where the required yard
area is not provided; or
(3) development of a structure on
an adjoining property, so as to block
adequate light and air to windows

of Section 355.04 regarding “minimum lot area per dwelling unit” and
the ratio of “maximum gross floor
area to lot area” shall not apply in
Downtown Residential (DR) Districts.
(i) Nonconforming Uses and Build ings. Legally established nonconforming uses located in a Downtown
Residential (DR) District may be
continued in accordance with the
regulations of Chapter 359 of the
Zoning Code. In addition, within a
DR District, any building which
does not meet the minimum requirement for proportion of floor area in
residential use shall be governed by
the
following
regulations
with
regard to changes in use:
(1) Any existing non-residential
use may be replaced by any use permitted in the DR District, without
action by the Board of Zoning
Appeals.

immediate prior use was non-residential may be occupied by any use
permitted in the DR District, without action by the Board of Zoning
Appeals.
