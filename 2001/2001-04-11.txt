within the City to realize lower natural gas rates from the collective
purchasing of natural gas services;
and
Whereas, pursuant to the authority conferred by R.C. Section 4929.26,
the City of Cleveland desires to submit an ordinance to the Board of
Elections to submit to the electors

the aforesaid proposal shall read as

enter into service agreements to
facilitate for those loads the sale
and purchase of natural gas, such
aggregation to occur automatically
except where any person elects to
opt out?

ous and lengthy diversions from
emergency rooms taking place at
hospitals across Cuyahoga County;
and
Whereas, in Cuyahoga County it
is not unusual for hospitals to shut
out emergency vehicles for days at
a time; and
Whereas, it is essential that county dispatchers keep the necessary
data in order for the state and the
county to determine the magnitude
of the situation; and
Whereas, it is necessary to better
coordinate emergency transport policies so that all hospitals follow uniform rules and policies; and
Whereas, such uniform policies
should encourage hospitals to better
manage resources in order to avoid
shut downs and to set time limits
for shut downs when closings cannot be averted; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
