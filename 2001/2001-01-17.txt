An emergency resolution urging
the United States Congress to support U.S. steel manufacturers by
invoking the federal Defense Production Act as a way to protect and
save U.S. Steel manufacturers from
demise.
Whereas, the recent filing by LTV
Corp. for Chapter 11 bankruptcy has
brought home to northeast Ohio the
plight of integrated steel manufacturers across the country; and
Whereas, it is vitally important to
the citizens of the City of Cleveland,
to the City’s economy and to steelworkers’ livelihoods to help LTV
Corp. maintain a viable presence
here in Cleveland as an integrated
steel producer; and
Whereas, the closing of LTV Corp.
would have a grave negative impact
on both this City and the State of
Ohio, and
Whereas, it is incumbent upon
local, state and federal governmental bodies to seek ways in which to
save LTV Corp. as well as preserve
the viability of other U.S. steel manufacturers; and
Whereas, the federal Defense Production Act requires, among other
things, that, in case of national crisis, the United States must have the
military industrial base to produce
its own weapons; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby urges the United States Congress
to support U.S. steel manufacturers
by invoking the federal Defense
Production Act as a way to protect
and save U.S. steel manufacturers
from demise.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
the offices of President-elect George
W.
Bush,
the
Senate

Leader, the Speaker of the House,
Senators DeWine and Voinovich,
and Representatives Oxley, Regula,

hereby declared to be an emergency

measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Patmon, Reed, Sweeney, Westbrook,
White and Willis.
An emergency resolution urging
the Mayor and his administration to
enforce certain laws under the
City’s housing code that would help
to prevent the practice of property
“flipping”.
Whereas, in recent months, Cleveland has been plagued by a resurgence in the purchase and rapid
resale of residential property at
huge mark-ups, a practice known as
property “flipping”; and
Whereas, the property “flipping”
phenomenon is characterized by
questionable
pre-sale
appraisals,
sometimes falsified property transfer records and “straw-man” borrowers; and
Whereas, property “flipping” has
squeezed tens of millions of dollars
of potential value out of Cleveland’s
old and often deteriorating housing
stock, allowing the middle-man to
reap huge profits, while little or no
improvements are being made to the
properties; and
Whereas, the City’s Codified Ordinances currently contain certain provisions that, if enforced, would help
to prevent the practice known as
property “flipping”; and
Whereas, Sections 367.04 and 367.12
of the Codified Ordinances of the City
of Cleveland, 1976, obligate the seller
to provide and the buyer to obtain
copies of violation notices; and
Whereas, these sections further
require the escrow agent to obtain
a receipt for the notice of violation
before the property is transferred;
and
Whereas, it is the knowledge and
belief of the Housing Court that the
above mentioned provisions are not
used in filing citations with the
court; and
Whereas, Section 367.04 of the
Codified Ordinances further provide
that the mortgagee of the property
receive a written notice of violations, and
Whereas, it is the knowledge and
belief of the Housing Court and City
Council that said notices of violation are not sent consistently to the
mortgagee as required by the Codified Ordinances; and
Whereas,
enforcement
of
the
above-mentioned Codified Ordinance
provisions would help to reduce or
even prevent the practice of property “flipping” in Cleveland; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

Section 1. That the Mayor and his
administration are hereby urged to
enforce Sections 367.04 and 367.12 of
the Codified Ordinances of the City
of Cleveland in order to help prevent the practice of property “flipping”.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

An emergency resolution urging
the President-elect and Congress to
review international trade laws to
determine methods by which the
United States can easily ship domestic steel to U.S. companies located
on foreign soil.
Whereas, the recent filing by
LTV Corp. for Chapter 11 bankruptcy has brought home to northeast Ohio the plight of integrated
steel
manufacturers
across
the
country; and
Whereas, domestic steel companies are struggling for survival in
a tight domestic steel market; and
Whereas, U.S companies manufacture certain goods made of steel
at plants located on foreign soil
and;
Whereas,
certain
international
trade laws prevent the simple shipment of U.S.-produced steel to those
U.S. manufacturers located overseas;
and
Whereas, it is incumbent upon
the federal government to review
international trade laws to ensure
fair steel trade in the United States;
and
Whereas, it is incumbent upon federal legislators to seek ways in
which to prevent further financial
difficulties upon U.S. steel manufacturers; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges the President-elect and Congress to review
international trade laws to determine
methods by which the United States
can easily ship domestic steel to U.S.
companies located on foreign soil.

An emergency resolution urging
the President-elect and Congress to
seek ways in which to ban the use
of foreign steel by U.S. companies.
Whereas, the recent filing by LTV
Corp. for Chapter 11 bankruptcy has
brought home to northeast Ohio the
plight of integrated steel manufacturers across the country; and
Whereas, LTV Corp. filed for
bankruptcy partly because of overseas competition which has driven
steel prices to a 20-year low; and
Whereas, LTV Corp. and other
United States steel manufacturers
cannot compete against overseas
companies that dump steel in the
United States at prices below production costs or below home market
prices; and
Whereas, in October, 2000, Congress passed the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act which
redirects the duties imposed on foreign producers of steel to eligible
U.S. companies injured by the dumping of foreign steel; and
Whereas, this federal law may not
be strong enough to prevent the continued financial difficulties to, and
perhaps even the demise of, LTV
Corp. and other U.S. steel manufacturers; and
Whereas, it is incumbent upon federal legislators to seek ways in
which to save the integrated steel
industry in the United States; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges the President-elect and Congress to seek
ways in which to ban the use of
foreign steel by U.S. companies.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to

An emergency resolution opposing
the proposed rate increase in natural gas sought by Dominion East
Ohio; urging the PUCO to hold a
local hearing on the proposed rate
increase; and urging the PUCO to
reject such proposal.
Whereas, on December 29, 2000,
Dominion East Ohio filed a petition
with the Public Utilities Commission
of Ohio (PUCO) seeking to increase
its rate from $7.17 to $8.70 per thousand cubic feet beginning February
1, 2001; and
Whereas, this is the fifth increase
in for Dominion East Ohio since last
year; and
Whereas, according to figures
recently published by The Plain
Dealer, the average Dominion East
Ohio customer already pays $70
more per month to heat their home
than they were paying one year ago,
and with the proposed rate increase,
the increase per month would be
$97; and
Whereas, such outrageous rate
increases impose an extreme financial hardship on many of our residents and most severely impacts
those citizens on a fixed income;
and
Whereas, the extreme increase
may cause many residents to choose
between heating their homes and
purchasing necessities, such as food
and prescription drugs; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
believes that forcing citizens to
make such choices is reprehensible,
and as such, is adamantly opposed
to the rate increase proposed by
Dominion East Ohio;
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
urges the PUCO to hold public hearings, both in Columbus and in Cleveland,
to
consider
the
negative
impact on residents prior to acting
on the proposed rate increase; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
strenuously urges the PUCO to disallow the proposed rate increase by
Dominion East Ohio; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland strenuously opposes the proposed rate increase
sought by Dominion East Ohio.
Section 2. That this Council urges
the Public Utilities Commission of
Ohio to hold public hearings in
Columbus and Cleveland concerning
the proposed rate increase and to
reject such proposal due to the
severe financial hardship that such
increase imposes on the residents of
the City of Cleveland.

Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Res. No. 34-01.
By Councilmen Brady, Polensek,
O’Malley, Westbrook, Jones, White,
Reed,
Johnson,
Jackson,
Britt,
Lewis,
Patmon,
Willis,
Coats,
Rybka, Cimperman, Cintron, Gordon,

An emergency resolution urging
the PUCO to suspend the proposed
rate increase by Dominion East
Ohio; urging the PUCO to conduct
an audit of Dominion’s gas purchases; and urging Governor Taft,
the PUCO and Dominion East Ohio
to begin a comprehensive campaign
to promote the Gas Choice Program.
Whereas, Dominion East Ohio Gas
Co. has announced that it will
increase its rates more than 20%,
effective at the end of January,
2001, by increasing its Gas Cost
Recovery (GCR) rate from $7.18 per
thousand cubic feet (mcf) of gas
used to $8.70 per mcf; and
Whereas, this large rate increase,
on top of other recent increases, will
place a tremendous burden on consumers in Cleveland, who are facing
the highest natural gas costs ever,
and combining these astronomical
rates with the colder than normal
winter that Cleveland consumers are
experiencing means that everyone,
rich and poor, will feel the sting of
this rate increase; and
Whereas, the Gas Choice Program
which began in Cleveland on October 1, 2000, at the start of the heating season when rates were already
increasing
and
choices
were
decreasing, has been only of limited
success in providing rate relief to
consumers in Cleveland; and
Whereas, the Gas Choice Program
in the Dominion East Ohio territory
was instituted without any of the
large scale and well financed education
and
promotion
campaign
financed by the utilities that is
occurring with the inauguration of
electric choice in Ohio, and an insufficient effort has been made by the
State of Ohio, PUCO, OCC and
Dominion East Ohio to encourage
additional providers of gas and to
make such choices accessible to the
public; and
Whereas, Ohio law declares (Section 4929.02 Ohio Revised Code) that
it is the policy of the State of Ohio
to “promote the availability to consumers of adequate, reliable and
reasonably priced natural gas services and goods,” and to give “consumers effective choices over the
selection of ... supplies and suppliers of natural gas;” now therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Public Utilities Commission of
Ohio (PUCO) to order a suspension
or postponement of the rate increase
and/or of its effective date, pursuant
to Section 4901:1-14-06 Ohio Adminis-

January 17, 2001
trative Code (OAC), and/or that the
PUCO and Office of Consumers Counsel (OCC) enter an agreement with
Dominion East Ohio to allow future
recovery, under just and reasonable
conditions, of the rate increase, so
that it need not go into effect with
this heating season, but will be postponed to a future date when competition is more established and effective choices are practically available
to all consumers; and
Section 2. That this Council urges
the PUCO to conduct an audit of
East Ohio’s gas purchases, pursuant
to Section 4901:1-14-07(B) OAC, including in said audit an investigation of the financial and management practices and performance of
Dominion East Ohio, whether East
Ohio’s gas procurement policies and
practices are reasonable and prudent, and whether its long term
strategic supply plan is reasonable;
and
Section 3. That this Council urges
the PUCO to hold a public hearing
in Cleveland in the month of January 2001, which will assist the PUCO
in determining whether to conduct a
larger investigation and audit, and
the full scope of such an audit, and
the hearing should be held for the
purpose of having East Ohio, the
State, the PUCO and the OCC explain
why gas costs are increasing so
much, what can be done to reverse
the trend, what the prospects are for
reduced prices and for additional
choices of alternative suppliers, and
what changes in the law and rules
will be considered to prevent this
from happening in the future; and
Section 4. That this Council urges
Governor Taft, the PUCO, OCC and
Dominion East Ohio to immediately
begin a comprehensive campaign to
promote the Gas Choice Program, in
order to find additional suppliers
and to advertise to and educate consumers about gas choice alternatives that are still available this
winter, and that may become available in the future, taking care to
ensure consumers are not pushed
into long term contracts that prevent them from shopping for less
costly gas that may become available after the heating season; and
Section 5. That this resolution
shall be transmitted by the Clerk of
Council to Governor Taft, to each of
the Commissioners of the PUCO, to
the Consumers Counsel, and to
Dominion East Ohio Gas Co.
Section 6. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
