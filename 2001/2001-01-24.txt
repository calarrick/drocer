(d) The willful falsification of
statements or the certification of
payroll data may subject the contractor or subcontractor or employee
to prosecution.
(e) Any retainage to cover contract performance that may become

the provisions of this chapter who

Res. No. 105-01.
By Councilman Jones.
An emergency resolution strongly
urging the Democratic members of
the United States Senate to oppose
the confirmation of John Ashcroft as
U.S. Attorney General.
Whereas, President George W.
Bush’s nominee for U.S. Attorney
General, John Ashcroft, has refused
to disassociate himself from the
Southern Partisan Magazine, a journal which supports ideology of the
old southern confederacy; and
Whereas, the recent hearings in
the Senate Judiciary
Committee
showed that Mr. Ashcroft engaged
in vituperative personal attacks on
the nomination of African-American
Missouri Supreme Court Judge Ronnie White to the federal bench,
which was successfully opposed;
and
Whereas,
the
sanctity
of
our
democratic system was already compromised by the actions of the United States Supreme Court in selecting
George W. Bush as President, and
the Constitutional rights of all citizens would be further threatened by
having someone like John Ashcroft
as Attorney General, with the power
and authority to deploy the FBI and
an army of prosecutors; and
Whereas, the Bush administration
representing a minority of the voters and facing a divided Congress,
wishes for the confirmation of an
individual to U.S. Attorney General,
who has in the past stated his opposition to affirmative action, gun control, desegregation orders, and gay
rights; and
Whereas, such a confirmation of
John Ashcroft as U.S. Attorney General could result in the Attorney
General’s
Office
promoting
and
enforcing policies that could prove
very harmful to an American citizenry that is racially, culturally,
and religiously diverse; now, therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland strongly urges the
Democratic members of the United
States Senate to oppose the confirmation of John Ashcroft as U.S.
Attorney General.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby is directed to
transmit a certified copy of this resolution to Senator Edward Kennedy
and all other Democratic members
of the Senate Judiciary Committee
on Tuesday, January 23, 2001, since
a Committee vote on the Ashcroft
nomination is scheduled for January
24, 2001.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force

Res. No. 106-01.
By Councilman Polensek.
An emergency resolution urging
the
Greater
Cleveland
Regional
Transit Authority to implement a
recycling collection program using
new public recycling bins at its area
bus shelters.
Whereas, trash and broken bottles
at various bus shelters owned by the
Greater Cleveland Regional Transit
Authority (RTA) are unsightly and
send a message to citizens that
those responsible for the property
cannot or will not control the problem; and
Whereas, recycling containers in
various cities throughout Canada,
such as Toronto, Ontario, have become an increasingly popular way
of cutting down on litter; and
Whereas,
several
American
cities, such as Pittsburgh, Atlantic
City,
San
Francisco
and
New
Orleans, have expressed interest in
implementing a recycling program
using the new public recycling
bins; and
Whereas, these recycling containers are large, compartmentalized
bins designed to collect waste and
litter, recyclable paper and recyclable containers such as plastic,
glass and aluminum; and
Whereas, use of these containers
by RTA would cut down on litter,
popularize recycling in the city, and
beautify the areas surrounding bus
shelters on city streets and in neighborhoods; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges the Greater
Cleveland Regional Transit Authority to implement a recycling collection program using new public
recycling bins at its area bus shelters.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
Joseph Calabrese, CEO and General
Manager, Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,

certification status.
