West 14th Street, Cleveland, Ohio
44113; and
Whereas, the granting of this

Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body

Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Department

and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
____________
Res. No. 146-01.
By Councilmen Cimperman and
Reed.
An emergency resolution opposing
the plan recently announced by Governor Taft to expand the state-wide
lottery in order to generate additional funding for schools and urging the Governor to find another
source of funds for improvements to
our school system.
Whereas, this Council of the City
of Cleveland is cognizant of the
deplorable conditions of our city’s
school buildings and the poor academic results of many of our Cleveland school students; and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
the need for additional funding for
our school system to remedy building deficiencies and to improve the
quality of education received by our
school children; and
Whereas, Governor Taft has announced a budget plan to bolster
funding for schools premised on the
idea that Ohio will join Powerball
or another multistate lottery by
March 31, 2002; and
Whereas, such a budget is speculative and requires the approval of
the state legislature to permit the
expansion of the lottery; and
Whereas, this Council has been
and continues to be opposed to the
expansion and marketing of the lottery to poor and low-income residents of our neighborhoods since the
residents participating in the lottery
do not receive a proportionate share
of the revenues derived from the lottery; and
Whereas, while Governor Taft is
well-intentioned in his desire to
increase funding for Ohio schools,
the manner in which he proposes to
fund those initiatives is speculative
and serves to undermine the poor
and low-income neighborhoods; and
Whereas, this Council opposes the
Governor Taft’s plan to fund schools
through the expansion of the lottery
and urges the Governor to develop
a more realistic and less onerous
plan to provide additional funding
for our school students; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council of the
City of Cleveland is opposed to the
plan recently announced by Governor Taft to expand the state-wide
lottery in order to generate additional funding for schools throughout Ohio and urges, the Governor to
reevaluate his plan to find another
source of funds for improvements to
our school system.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council
is hereby requested to furnish a copy
of this resolution to Governor Taft
and to Barbara Byrd-Bennett, CEO of
the Cleveland Municipal Schools.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force

Res. No. 147-01.
By Councilmen White and Jones.
An emergency resolution urging
the Mayor to increase the number of
Police Officers assigned to the Fourth
Police District in order to enhance the
public safety of neighborhood residents and to reduce the incidence of
illegal narcotic sales that is taking
place within the community.
Whereas, over the past several
years there have been an increasing
number of police officers being
assigned to the various Cleveland
Police Districts as a result of the
Fresh Start, and other law enforcement programs in order to decrease
the incidences and occurrences of
crimes and the sale of illegal narcotics; and
Whereas, drug activity is often
the gateway to other criminal activity and social disruption, that exposes neighborhood residents, young
adults, children, and visitors to an
environment, which is considered to
be very unhealthy to Cleveland’s
neighborhoods; and
Whereas, the Fourth Police District
historically has the most incidences
of crimes occurring within its boundaries such as illegal narcotic sales,
which has raised concerns among the
residents about the quality of public
safety in their neighborhoods; and
Whereas, by increasing the number of police officers to patrol the
neighborhoods in Cleveland’s Fourth
District, neighborhood residents will
feel safer about their neighborhood,
and overall quality of life; and
Whereas, an increase in the number of police officers patrolling the
Fourth Police District will greatly
contribute to a significant decrease
in the incidence of crimes that are
occurring within this community; and
Whereas, by improving the overall public safety for the residents
residing in the Fourth Police District a sense of well being and an
improved quality of life will be
achieved as a result of keeping the
community safe from drugs and
crime; now, therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Mayor of the City
of Cleveland be strongly urged to
hire and assign more police officers
to the Fourth Police District in
order to reduce the incidences of
crime and to decrease the sale of
illegal narcotics.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she hereby is directed to
transmit a certified copy of this resolution to Michael R. White, Mayor
of the City of Cleveland.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

Zoning Appeals in accordance with
the provisions of Section 354.14
regarding special exceptions.

(c) Design. A telecommunications
antenna structure shall be designed

The City Record
and placed so as to blend in with
the appearance of the structure to
which it is attached or to be otherwise screened or obscured from
view from public streets and adjoining properties to the maximum
extent possible. Such design shall be
as approved by the City Planning
Commission, where installation of
the antenna is subject to the Commission’s approval.
(d) Accessory Equipment. Equipment that is accessory to a telecommunications antenna shall be located within the subject building or
structure or shall be placed so as
not to be visible from adjoining public streets, unless the City Planning

any ground-mounted telecommunications tower shall be completely

determines that another location
would be more effective and may
waive the requirement for any particular location where it determines
that the landscaping would not be
visible from adjacent parcels or public streets or, otherwise, by members
of the general public.
(c)

Requirement.
The landscape strip required in division (b) of this section shall be a
minimum of ten (10) feet in width

Occupancy
for
a
telecommunications tower, or not
more than ninety (90) days prior to

times the permit holder shall maintain a performance bond sufficient
to cover the demolition and removal
of the telecommunications facility.
Such bond shall be sufficient to
guarantee full and faithful performance of the requirements of this
chapter and shall be satisfactory to
the Commissioner of Building and
Housing and the Director of Law.
On each biennial anniversary of the
issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy
for
a
telecommunications
tower, or not more than ninety (90)
days prior to that date, the permit
holder shall provide to the Commissioner of Building and Housing
proof that the performance bond
requirements of this section are met.

this fact to the Commissioner of
Building and Housing.

the facility shall be deemed abandoned. Within ninety (90) days of
abandonment, the permit holder or
other responsible party shall remove
the abandoned tower, antenna, and
any accessory structures, and shall
restore the site to an attractive landscaped condition. If such actions are
not taken, the City may cause the
