By Councilman Coats.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio State legislature to review
Chapter 2925 of the Revised Code
and expand the area around a
school in which drug offenses may
be committed to fifteen hundred
feet.
Whereas,
under
Revised
Code
Chapter 2925, a drug offense is “committed in the vicinity of a school” if
the offender commits the offense on
school premises, in a school building, or within one thousand feet of
the
boundaries
of
any
school
premises; and
Whereas, under the Revised Code,
committing a drug offense “within
the vicinity of a school” necessarily
increases
the
penalty
for
such
offense; and
Whereas, drug offenses are committed with increasing regularity
just outside the defined 1000 foot
boundary of school premises, which
allows drug offenders to still traffic
drugs relatively near schools, but to
get a lesser penalty for committing
the offense; and
Whereas, expanding the definition of a drug offense “committed in
the vicinity of a school” to include
offenses committed within fifteen
hundred feet of the boundaries of
any school premises will cause
more drug offenders to be subject
to the enhanced penalty and possibly act as a deterrent to those who
may traffic drugs near our schools,
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio State legislature to review
Chapter 2925 of the Revised Code
and expand the area around a
school in which drug offenses may
be committed to fifteen hundred
feet.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
Governor Bob Taft and the leaders
of the Ohio State legislature.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES

Res. No. 2051-01.
By Counciman Cimperman.
An emergency resolution supporting Governor Taft in his opposition
to making health boards obtain city
council approval before banning
smoking in public places and further supporting the governor’s compromise which gives Ohio’s Health
District
Advisory
Councils
the
option of overriding any smoking
ban passed by the local health
boards.
Whereas, state representatives are
threatening to pass a bill which
would cause local health boards to
win approval of the local city council where said health boards recommend elimination of smoking in
restaurants or other public places;
and
Whereas,
such
a
bill
would
make it harder for local health
boards to ban smoking in public
places; and
Whereas, gaining the approval of
local city councils is extremely difficult if not impossible; and
Whereas,
Governor
Taft
has
threatened to veto the bill, but state
representatives want to override
any veto; and
Whereas, Governor Taft has proposed a compromise wherein Ohio’s
Health District Advisory Councils
may override any smoking ban
passed by local health boards; and
Whereas,
such
a
compromise
makes
the
health
boards
more
accountable in that the Health District Advisory Councils would help
determine impact on restaurants,
bars
and
other
establishments
before allowing smoking bans; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports Governor Taft in his opposition to making health boards obtain
city council approval before banning
smoking in public places and further supports the governor’s compromise which gives Ohio’s Health
District
Advisory
Councils
the
option of overriding any smoking
ban passed by the local health
boards.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to transmit
certified copies of this resolution to
Governor Bob Taft and the leaders
of the Ohio House of Representatives.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted October 29, 2001.
Effective November 8, 2001, without the signature of the Mayor.

Res. No. 2052-01.
By Councilman Coats.
An emergency resolution withdrawing objection to the renewal of
a C2 and C2X Liquor Permit to 17801
Euclid Avenue, and repealing Res.
No.
1529-2000
objecting
to
said
renewal.
Whereas, this Council objected to
the renewal of a C2 and C2X Liquor
Permit to 17801 Euclid Avenue by
Res. No. 1529-2000 adopted by Council on August 28, 2000; and

to
set
conditions
of
employment for municipal employees; and
Whereas, further, this bill overturns the decisions of local governments, local voters and local unions
