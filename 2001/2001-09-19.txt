FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 1790-01.
By Councilmen Polensek, Dolan,
Patmon, Sweeney, Rybka, Brady and
Jones.
An emergency resolution urging
the President and members of Congress to support legislation that will
provide immediate federal funding
relief for commercial airlines.
Whereas, the monumental loss of
revenue and increases in costs associated with the tragic events of September 11, 2001 have placed the
entire commercial aviation industry
in severe financial peril, with a loss
of over $1 billion in the three day
period in which the carriers were
grounded; and
Whereas, a 50% reduction in revenue is anticipated over the next
three months; this reduction in revenue is anticipated to amount to $17
billion by the end of the year; and
Whereas, the commercial airline
industry is projecting that initial
employee
layoff’s
could
exceed
100,000 jobs; and
Whereas, as a hub to Continental
Airlines, Cleveland is deeply concerned about the severe negative
impact
that
the
schedule
and
employee reductions may have on
Cleveland’s economy and that of the
Northeast Ohio region; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Council
joins with Gordon Bethune, Continental chairman and chief executive
officer, in calling on the President
and members of Congress to take
immediate action to restore stability to the airline industry and urges
the federal government to take all
necessary steps to assist the airlines
in this difficult time, now, therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

September 19, 2001
Section 1. That this Council is

stability of the commercial airline
industry and urges the President and
members of Congress to support legislation that will provide immediate

An
emergency
resolution
condemning last Tuesday’s terrorist
attacks on the United States of
America, supporting the President
of the United States in the response
to such terrorist activities, commending City employees, especially
fire fighters and police officers, for
all their hard work of last week,
condemning the damage done to the
Islamic Center in Parma and urging
calm and tolerance from all Americans during this time of trouble.
Whereas, on September 11, 2001,
this nation experienced a tragedy of
such magnitude the likes of which
we have never seen before; and
Whereas, the President of the
United States and the leaders of this
nation must have the support of all
Americans in the pursuit of those
who are responsible for the attacks
of last Tuesday, and of the eradication of terrorism in this country; and
Whereas, City employees, especially the fire fighters and police
officers, worked very hard last
week to help alleviate fears in the
City and to ensure the safety of
Cleveland’s citizens; and
Whereas, the damage done to the
Islamic Center in Parma was apparently a result of ignorance of the
Islamic religion and anger about the
tragic events of last week; and
Whereas, in these troubled times,
there is no room for intolerance or
bigotry and we as Americans must
respect all peoples of different
nationalities and religions; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby condemns last Tuesday’s terrorist attacks on the United States of
America, supports the President of
the United States in the response to
such terrorist activities, commends

Res. No. 1771-01.
By Councilmen Westbrook and
Cimperman.
An emergency resolution declaring September 14, 2001 “Literacy
Day” in the City of Cleveland and
commending literacy organizations
throughout the city for their ongoing efforts to create a community of
readers.
Whereas, the ability to read is recognized as one of the primary building blocks of a happy and successful life; and a love of reading can
enrich one’s life by providing the
mind with countless new vistas and
ideas; and
Whereas, the month of September
has been designated National Literacy Month, providing an opportunity for all concerned citizens to
reflect on the state of literacy in the
City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, the Plain Dealer recently
reported that 66% of Cleveland fourth
graders and 40% of fourth graders
statewide would have been held back
this year if they had been forced to
meet the state’s “reading guarantee,”
and in Cuyahoga County alone, 18 out
of 31 school districts showed a
decline in reading scores; and

September 19, 2001
Whereas, this problem is complicated by the lack of literacy skills
reflected
among
Cleveland
residents; for example, 41% of adults in
Cleveland do not have a high school
diploma, and only one in three
ninth-graders graduate; and
Whereas,
low
literacy
rates
impact crime rates, with 85% of all
juvenile offenders exhibiting reading deficiencies; and
Whereas, the above challenges
can be met only through a concerted and focused effort within the
Greater Cleveland community, as
demonstrated
by
the
Cleveland
Reads coalition of literacy organizations, with programs at over 200
sites throughout the city; and
Whereas, such coalitions unite
local
efforts,
and
by
working
beyond the boundaries of any one
institution, strengthen and enhance
direct literacy services through the
provision of research and development, advocacy, and network building; now, therefore,
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland recognizes September 14, 2001 as “Literacy Day” in
the City of Cleveland, and commends Cleveland Reads and its
member
organizations
for
their
ongoing work to improve the quality of life by promoting literacy
efforts and community involvement.
Section
2.
That
this
Council
encourages the residents of the City
to contribute their time, resources
and expertise to the literacy efforts
within their own neighborhoods and
communities.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted September 10, 2001.
Awaiting the approval or disapproval of the Mayor.

Res. No. 1772-01.
By Councilmen Westbrook, Sweeney, Brady and Dolan.
An emergency resolution urging the
Administration to seek federal disaster emergency relief funds through
FEMA for damages incurred by the
August 31, 2001 “100 year storm.”
Whereas, on Friday, August 31,
2001, areas of the City of Cleveland
experienced a “100 year storm,”
wherein at least 3 to 4 inches of rain
fell within an hour, overwhelming
the sewer system; and
Whereas, the 100 year storm lead
to widespread flooding and property
and road damage throughout several neighborhoods in the City, predominately on the west side; and
Whereas, residents need assistance in repairing their homes and
replacing damaged items; and
Whereas, the Administration is
urged to seek federal disaster emergency relief funds through the Federal
Emergency
Management
Agency (FEMA) to compensate residents for the losses that they sustained during the flood; and
