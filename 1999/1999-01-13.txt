placed,
and
maintained
directly
adjacent to and flush against that
side of a public bus shelter which
is perpendicular to the curb edge of
the roadway and furthest forward in
the direction of traffic on the street
(the “downstream side”); provided,
however, that if more than one
owner desires to install a device at
any one public bus shelter, only multiple-dispensing-device
modular
units may be installed, placed, and
maintained at such location. No modular unit shall be installed unless
and until the City Planning Commission has approved the design
thereof. Where more than one newspaper dispensing device is located
in the vicinity of the downstream
side of a public bus shelter as of
January 1, 1991, said devices may be
moved adjacent to the downstream
side of the shelter until such time
as the City Planning Commission
approves the design of a modular
unit
for
that
location.
Owners
installing modular units shall be
responsible for their maintenance
and shall purchase such units on
terms and conditions upon which
said owners mutually agree. Newspaper dispensing devices or modular
units
installed
and
maintained
directly adjacent to the downstream
side of public bus shelters may be
placed so that the front of the
device is perpendicular to or at an
angle to the roadway; so long as
such device or modular unit is
placed adjacent to the downstream
side of the shelter.
(2) If a bus company presents to
the City Planning Commission a bus
shelter design which incorporates
newspaper dispensing devices or a
modular frame therefor into the bus
shelter, and if the City Planning
Commission approves said design,
the following shall not apply to any
newspaper dispensing device which
is incorporated into any such bus
shelter or inserted into any such
modular frame, provided that the
bus shelter is installed pursuant to
a permit duly issued by the City:
A. the weight requirements contained in division (d)(2) of Section
680.03;
B. the distance requirements contained
in
divisions
(a)(2)B.,
(a)(6)B., and (a)(12) of this section;
and

C. the design requirements contained in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2),
and (c)(7) of this section.
(g) Subject to the provisions of
the following sentences in this division and notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in divisions (a)(2)A. or (a)(2)B. of this
section, if a newspaper dispensing
devices is in place on a concrete
pad at a public bus stop or public
bus shelter in a One-, Two-, or
Multi-Family District as of January
1, 1991, and if said device would
otherwise
not
be
permitted
to
remain at such location because the
concrete pad is of insufficient size
to accommodate the placement of
such device in accordance with the
provisions of divisions (a)(2)A. or
(a)(2)B. of this section, said device
may remain at the location it occupied as of January 1, 1991 until
such time as the concrete pad
underlying such public stop or public bus shelter is extended by the
bus company and the pad is of sufficient size to accommodate the
placement of such
device. Any
newspaper dispensing device that
is permitted to remain at a public
bus stop or public bus shelter as a
result of the provisions of this division shall be removed by its owner
if a public bus company installs a
shelter on the concrete pad underlying a public bus stop or enlarges
an existing shelter unless:
(1) the bus company enlarges the
concrete pad underlying the public
bus stop or bus shelter sufficiently
to accommodate placement of the
device in accordance with division
(a)(2)A. or (a)(2)B. of this section;
or
(2) the owner of the device
extends the bus company’s concrete
pad sufficiently to accommodate
placement of the device in accordance with division (a)(2)A. or
(a)(2)B. of this section. In the event
that the owner installs such an
extension:
A. the owner shall be responsible
for maintaining the extension of the
concrete pad; and
B. if the owner removes the
device, the owner shall promptly:
1. remove the extension of the concrete pad and restore the property
underlying said extension to its condition prior to the installation of the
extension; or
2. transfer its interest in the
extension of the concrete pad to
another owner on terms and conditions upon which the two owners
mutually agree; or
3. transfer its interest in the
extension of the concrete pad to the
public bus company on terms and
conditions upon which the owner
and the public bus company mutually agree;
provided that the Directors of Public Service and City Planning may,
in their sole discretion, permit such
concrete pad to remain in place,
absent a transfer of interest pursuant to paragraph (2)B.2. or (2)B.3.
of this division, upon such terms
and conditions as said directors
mutually agree.
(h) Subject to the provisions of
the following sentences in this division and notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in divisions (a)(6) or (a)(12) of this section, if a newspaper dispensing
device is in place on a concrete pad
at a public bus stop or public bus
shelter outside of the Central Business District as of January 1, 1991,
and if said device would otherwise
not be permitted to remain in the

vicinity because a relocation of
said device in order to comply with
the distance requirements of this
section would result in the placement of said device at a prohibited
location, said device may remain at
the location it occupied as of January 1, 1991. Any newspaper dispensing device that is permitted to
remain at a public bus stop or public bus shelter as a result of the
provisions of this division shall be
removed by its owner if a public
bus company installs a shelter on
the concrete pad underlying a public bus stop or enlarges an existing
shelter unless:
(1) the bus company enlarges the
concrete pad underlying the public
bus stop or bus shelter sufficiently
to accommodate placement of the
device in accordance with division
(a)(2)A. or (a)(2)B. of this section;
or
(2) the owner of the device
extends the bus company’s concrete
pad sufficiently to accommodate
placement of the device in accordance with division (a)(2)A. or
(a)(2)B., of this section. In the
event that the owners installs such
an extension:
A. the owner shall be responsible
for maintaining the extension of the
concrete pad; and
B. if the owner removes the
device, the owner shall promptly:
1. remove the extension of the concrete pad and restore the property
underlying said extension to its condition prior to the installation of the
extension; or
2. transfer its interest in the
extension of the concrete pad to
another owner on terms and conditions upon which the two owners
mutually agree; or
3. transfer its interest in the
extension of the concrete pad to the
public bus company on terms and
conditions upon which the owners
and the public bus company mutually agree;
provided that the Directors of Public Service and City Planning may,
in their sole discretion, permit such
concrete pad to remain in place,
absent a transfer of interest pursuant to paragraph (2)B.2. or (2)B.3.
of this division, upon such terms
and conditions as said directors
mutually agree.
(i) Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in division
(a)(6)A. or (a)(8) of this section,
any newspaper dispensing device
that is in place at a public bus stop
and at least six inches (6") forward of a bus company sign which
is located on a utility pole as of
January 1, 1991, but that would not
be permitted to remain at such
location because of the requirements of division (a)(8) of this section, may remain at such location
until such time as the bus sign is
moved so as to allow sufficient
space for the newspaper dispensing
device to be located forward of the
sign without violating any provision of this section; and, other than
on Euclid Avenue, any newspaper
dispensing device that is in place
more than eight feet (8') back of
a bus company sign at a public bus

Pick-Up,
Assessment, Shelter and Services (P.A.S.S.)
Program is a creative and necessary
component of the continuum of care
services
for
homeless
people
throughout Greater Cleveland; and
Whereas, the P.A.S.S. Program
serves 47 persons at a time, has
accommodated a total of 186 persons, and has had requests for service from 700 different persons; and
Whereas, the P.A.S.S. Program
effectively serves persons who are
homeless; encouraging people on the
street to break chemical addictions,
develop a positive work record; save
money, overcome psychological limitations and strive for self-sufficiency through a system of thoughtful
and successful social services; and
Whereas, the Greater Cleveland
Chapter of the Salvation Army has
been the faithful steward of HUD
Innovative Homeless Demonstration
Program (IHDP) funds by developing
this program to serve some of the
most hard core homeless persons in
the Greater Cleveland community; and
Whereas,
the
City
of
Cleveland/Cuyahoga County Office of
Homeless Services is charged with
developing on-going funds for this
local IHDP program, and in communication with HUD staff determined the Supportive Housing Program (SHP) funds were most appropriate to seek for help; and
Whereas,
the
City
of
Cleveland/Cuyahoga County Office of
Homeless Services and HUD staff
discussed during the application
period that the P.A.S.S. Program
was not a new program, nor previously funded by Supporting Housing
Program funds and together decided to apply for “renewal” funding
within the SHP; and
Whereas, the Secretary of the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban
Development identified in a letter to
the City of Cleveland dated May
28th, 1998 that the Supporting Housing Program is a potential source of
funds specifically for the continuation of the P.A.S.S. Program and further enclosed the Notice of Funding
Availability (NOFA) to assist the
City to apply for funds in this
regard; and
Whereas,
the
City
of
Cleveland/Cuyahoga County Office
of Homeless Services consequently
applied
for
Supportive
Housing
Funds for the P.A.S.S. Program; and
Whereas, a HUD rule forbids
applicants for funds to communicate
with HUD staff after an application
is submitted for review and before
it is approved or denied by HUD
even to discuss complex application
circumstances such as these; and
Whereas, on December 23rd, 1998
HUD announced the awards for Supportive
Housing
Program
funds
which did NOT include funds for the
P.A.S.S. program because it had not
previously received SHP funds; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland.
Section 1. That the Cleveland City
Council hereby strongly encourages
the Secretary of the U.S. Departm e n t
of Housing and Urban Dev elopment to reconsider and support the
application of the Pick-Up, Assessment, Shelter and Services (P.A.S.S.)
Program application for Supportive
Housing funds submitted by the
City of Cleveland/Cuyahoga County
Office of Homeless Services; and

Section 2. That the Clerk of Cleveland City Council is hereby requested to transmit a copy of this resolution to Mr. Andrew Cuomo, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; U.S.
