By Councilmen Gordon, Jackson,
Robinson and Johnson (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Economic
Development to enter into an Enterprise Zone Agreement with National Boiler Works, Inc. to provide for
a ten year abatement for certain
tangible personal property and real
estate taxes as an incentive to
expand its facility to acquire land,
construct an office and warehouse
facility, and to acquire machinery
and equipment at 4560 Industrial

Whereas, pursuant to Ordinance
No. 948-95, passed June 19, 1995, this
Council designated an area which is

described in File No. 948-95-A, as the
Cleveland

Whereas, in August, 1995, the
Director of Development of the State

contains the characteristics set forth
in Section 5709.61(A) of the Revised

Whereas, National Boiler Works,
Inc. (the “Enterprise”) has proposed
to expand its facility to acquire
land, construct an office and warehouse
facility,
and
to
acquire
machinery and equipment at 4560
Industrial Parkway located in the
Cleveland Area Enterprise Zone;
and
Whereas, the Enterprise has certified to the City that, but for abatement of personal property and real
estate taxes the Enterprise would be
at a competitive disadvantage by
operating at this location; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure in that
the same provides for the immediate
preservation of the public peace,
safety, property, and welfare and
for the further reason that its enactment is a necessary prerequisite to
providing immediate assistance to
create and preserve job opportunities and advance and promote commercial and economic development

or such jobs will be lost; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby
approves

National Boiler Works, Inc. for
enterprise zone incentives on the
basis that National Boiler Works,
Inc. is qualified by financial responsibility and business experience to

Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Director of
Economic Development is authorized to enter into an Enterprise

with
National
Boiler Works, Inc. to provide for a
ten (10) year abatement for certain
tangible personal property and real

said abatement shall be subject to
annual review of the Tax Incentive

Section 3. That the terms of said

the Executive Summary contained

entity, without the prior legislative
authorization by Cleveland City Council.
Section 4. That the Director of
Economic Development is hereby
authorized to charge and accept fees
in an amount not to exceed the maximum allowable under Chapter 5709
of the Revised Code and such funds
are hereby appropriated for the purposes set forth in Chapter 5709 of
the Revised Code. Such fees shall be
deposited to and expended from

Section 5. That the Director of
Law shall prepare and approve said
agreement and that said agreement
shall contain such terms and provisions as he deems necessary to protect the City’s interest.
Section 6. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives

By Councilman Johnson (by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the City of Cleveland to implement a plan to allow City employees and elected officials to purchase
additional service credit from the
Public Employees Retirement System, tax-deferred by payroll deduction.
Whereas, Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) Code Section 414(h)(2)
permits employer “pick-up” of the
employee contributions to a retirement plan, thereby resulting in tax
deferral of such contributions; and
Whereas,
pursuant
to
Revised
Code Chapter 145, members of the
Public Employee’s Retirement System of Ohio (“PERS”) may be
allowed to (1) redeposit contributions previously withdrawn, plus
interest, and/or (2) purchase additional forms of permissive service
credit; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
has no current plan authorizing the
purchase of additional service credit from PERS on a pre-tax basis; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That effective ________,
City employees and elected officials
who are eligible under IRS Code
Section 414(h)(2) and Revised Code
Chapter 145 may purchase addition-

al service credit tax deferred and
the City shall withhold the authorized service credit deduction from
the gross pay of each person who
elects to purchase additional service
credit and pay the deduction to
PERS. A person electing this pick
up deduction shall not have the
option of choosing to receive the
payroll deduction directly instead of
having this deduction picked up by
the City and paid to PERS. Members
who have elected to participate in
this plan cannot increase, decrease
or terminate the amount of the pick
up deduction.
Section 2. That the Director of
Finance is hereby authorized to
take all necessary procedural and
administrative action to implement
the provisions of this ordinance to
effect the pick up of the payroll
deduction for the purchase of additional service credit to PERS, including entering into irrevocable
salary reduction agreements with
eligible employees and elected officials. The form of such agreement

RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 152-99.
By Councilmen Willis and Cintron.
An emergency resolution urging
the Regional Transit Authority to
continue usage of buses fueled by
compressed natural gas and to conduct further studies prior to purchasing diesel powered vehicles.
Whereas, the Regional Transit
Authority (RTA) buses provide service to thousands of passengers in
and around the City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, in a progressive effort
to ensure a cleaner environment,
RTA became a leader in the transit
industry by purchasing and using
buses powered by natural gas, as
opposed to diesel buses; and
Whereas, diesel powered buses
release a greater number of carcinogenic particulates than buses
powered by CNG; and
Whereas, RTA currently has 166
buses, or 22 percent of its fleet,
which are powered by compressed
natural gas (CNG); and
Whereas, RTA is considering the
suspension of purchase and use of
CNG powered buses in favor of
increased use of diesel buses; and
Whereas, discontinuance of buses
fueled by CNG would adversely
impact the air quality of the City of
Cleveland
and
could
negatively
impair the health of the residents of
our neighborhoods; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges RTA to continue its progressive efforts to purchase and utilize buses powered by
compressed natural gas and requests that RTA be mindful of the
impact that diesel fuel has on the
environment and health of the residents of the City of Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland requests that RTA
conduct further studies of the costs
and benefits of use of buses fueled
by compressed natural gas before
purchasing additional diesel powered buses.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is requested to transmit a copy
of this Resolution to Ronald Tober,
President of the Regional Transit
Authority and U.S. Congress Representatives Kucinich and Jones.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of

all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it

in Cleveland and Northeast Ohio; and
Whereas, food that would otherwise be wasted is provided to hungry men, women and children; and
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland strongly encourages

Foods and Stop-N-Shop Supermarkets, to continue this humanitarian
policy; now, therefore,
