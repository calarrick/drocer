At the end of the term, Lessee may
request to extend the term of Bay

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 340-99.
By Councilman Coats.
An emergency resolution urging
HUD to demolish the Belvoir-Cliffs
apartment building and to grant
title to the property to the City of
Cleveland for compatible neighborhood development.
Whereas, the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) owns the Belvoir-Cliffs, a 160
unit apartment building, located at
the intersection of Belvoir Blvd. and
Cliffview Road in the Euclid Park
community of the City of Cleveland;
and
Whereas, HUD was forced to
assume ownership and control of the
building because its previous owner
let the property fall into severe disrepair, as evidenced by numerous
significant code violations and its
very low occupancy rate; and

Whereas, Belvoir-Cliffs has become a haven for illegal drug activities and prostitution, presenting a
profound safety risk to the surrounding neighborhood; and
Whereas, the configuration of
the buildings lacks recreational
and structural amenities and presents a barracks-like appearance,
detracting
from
the
aesthetic
appearance of the neighborhood
and making it markedly different
from the surrounding ranch-style
houses; and
Whereas, the citizens of the community, in the interest of safety and
well-being
of
the
neighborhood,
have expressed their desire to have
the facility demolished, as opposed
to HUD performing a cosmetic alteration of the apartment building;
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges HUD to act
in the best interest of the residents
of the City of Cleveland and to
demolish the Belvoir-Cliffs apartment building, as it unsafe and
undesirable for low income housing.
Section 2. That, upon demolition of
Belvoir-Cliffs, HUD grant title to the
property to the City of Cleveland so
that it may be developed in a use
that is compatible with and meets
the needs of the surrounding community.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to transmit
a copy of this Resolution to Andrew
Cuomo, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; Mayor Michael White; and
Linda Hudecek, Director of Community Development.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted March 1, 1999.
Awaiting the approval or disapproval of the Mayor.
Res. No. 382-99.
By Councilman Cintron.
An emergency resolution opposing
H.B. 94, pending before the Ohio legislature, requiring use of the English language for all official actions
of state agencies and political subdivisions.
Whereas, the United States was
founded on the principal of respecting and accepting diversity, both
religious and ethnic, among its citizens; and
Whereas, since its inception, the
United States has been a “melting
pot” and a multilingual nation;
and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
contains a diverse community with
a
multiracial,
multicultural
and
multilingual history and tradition;
and
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland recognizes and takes
great pride in this diversity and the
benefits that it brings to all residents of the City; and
Whereas, the Council acknowledges an unfortunate and unacceptable increase in outward manifestations of racial, cultural and linguistic intolerance which is often
accompanied by violent acts that

threaten the public safety and welfare; and
Whereas,
this
intolerance
for
diversity is evident in H.B. 94, currently pending before the Ohio legislature, that requires that the English language be used in the official
actions and proceedings of state
agencies and political subdivisions;
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland welcomes all residents and celebrates racial, cultural and language diversity as evidence of the great pluralistic tradition and history of our city and
nation.
Section 2. That this Council is
opposed to House Bill 94 and other
similar legislative initiatives that
discourage diversity and promote
misunderstanding and isolation of
divergent cultures and this Council
further urges state legislators to
oppose H.B. 94.
Section 3. That the Clerk is hereby requested to forward a copy of
this Resolution to JoAnn Davidson,
Speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives and to Dennis Dove,
Director of Community Relations for
the City of Cleveland.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted March 8, 1999.
Effective March 17, 1999.
Res. No. 383-99.

Permit to 2780 E. 116th St. & Gas
Pumps, be and the same is hereby

Whereas, Council has been notified by the Director of Liquor Control of an application for the transfer of ownership of a D5 and D6
