use its best efforts to award Fifteen
percent (15%) of the construction
contracts
and
supplier
purchase
orders for the Network to minority
owned business enterprises and five
percent (5%) of the construction
contracts
and
supplier
purchase
orders for the Network to female
owned
business
enterprises
(“MBE/FBE”), as those phrases are
defined in Section 187.01 of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Cleveland, that have been certified by the
City’s Office of Equal Opportunity
(“MBE/FBE Participation Requirements”). Exemptions may be granted by the City on contracts for purchase and installation of specialized
equipment or materials installed by
the manufacturer. Company shall
make a good faith effort to obtain
any exemption from the City prior
to the execution of the contract for
the purchase and installation of
such specialized equipment or materials, but in no event shall an
exemption be obtained later than
the commencement of construction
of the Network component for which
the exemption is being sought.
The MBE/FBE Participation Requirement shall be equal to the total
dollar amount of construction contracts, and supplier purchase orders
less approved exemptions multiplied
by fifteen percent (15%) and five
percent (5%), respectively. To verify the award of MBE/FBE contracts, Company shall submit to the
City copies of all contracts, subcontracts, purchase orders, lien waivers
or other evidence of payment acceptable to the City.
Materials and supplies obtained
from MBE/FBE suppliers and manufacturers may be counted towards
fulfilling the MBE/FBE Participation Requirements if the MBE/FBE
assumes the actual and contractual
responsibility for the provision of
the materials and supplies. The total
dollar value will be counted in the

case of MBE/FBE manufacturers
and suppliers, provided that the
MBE/FBE supplier performs a commercially useful function in the supply process. An MBE/FBE firm who
performs
a
commercially
useful
function is one who supervises, manages or actually performs a distinct
element of the work.
18.2 This Agreement is a “contract”, and Company is a “contractor” within the meaning of Chapter
187 of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland. During the term of this

Whereas, the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) owns the Belvoir-Cliffs, a 160
unit apartment building, located at
the intersection of Belvoir Blvd. and
Cliffview Road in the Euclid Park
community of the City of Cleveland;
and
Whereas, HUD was forced to
assume ownership and control of the
building because its previous owner
let the property fall into severe disrepair, as evidenced by numerous
significant code violations and its
very low occupancy rate; and
Whereas, Belvoir-Cliffs has become a haven for illegal drug activities and prostitution, presenting a

profound safety risk to the surrounding neighborhood; and
Whereas, the configuration of
the buildings lacks recreational
and structural amenities and presents a barracks-like appearance,
detracting
from
the
aesthetic
appearance of the neighborhood
and making it markedly different
from the surrounding ranch-style
houses; and
Whereas, the citizens of the community, in the interest of safety and
well-being
of
the
neighborhood,
have expressed their desire to have
the facility demolished, as opposed
to HUD performing a cosmetic alteration of the apartment building;
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges HUD to act
in the best interest of the residents
of the City of Cleveland and to
demolish the Belvoir-Cliffs apartment building, as it unsafe and
undesirable for low income housing.
Section 2. That, upon demolition of
Belvoir-Cliffs, HUD grant title to the
property to the City of Cleveland so
that it may be developed in a use
that is compatible with and meets
the needs of the surrounding community.
Section 3. That the Clerk of Council is hereby requested to transmit
a copy of this Resolution to Andrew
Cuomo, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; Mayor Michael White; and
Linda Hudecek, Director of Community Development.
Section 4. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

consider the construction and development of new single family housing and a Recreational swimming
pool and walking track for the residents of the Union-Miles community at the present John Adams High
School site.
Whereas,
John
Adams
High
School was a cornerstone in providing secondary education to residents

and
Whereas, many of the local and
business leaders who have made
significant contributions to the City
of Cleveland attended and graduated from John Adams High School;
and
Whereas,
John
Adams
High
School made significant contributions to the Mount Pleasant and
Union-Miles neighborhood in promoting extra-curricular and recreational activities such as football
and track events at the football
field for local area high schools,
community
organizations
and
youth sports leagues, thus making

it a landmark for the community;
and
Whereas, the school board made
the difficult decision to close the
John Adams School building, which
saddened the hearts of all school
alumnus who were part of the
school’s rich tradition and proud history; and
Whereas, the John Adams High
School building is presently undergoing demolition in order to create
development opportunities for the
City of Cleveland; and
Whereas, the demolition of John
Adams High School could create
development opportunities such as
construction of new single family
housing units for Union-Miles residents, including a swimming pool
and walking track for the children
and adults of the Union-Miles neighborhood; and
Whereas, such new development
could further promote the UnionMiles
neighborhood
to
make
it
become more attractive to potential
new homeowners and businesses,
thus making this community very
viable; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council urges the
