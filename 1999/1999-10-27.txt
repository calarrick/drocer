ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 1864-99.
By Mayor White and Councilmen
Westbrook, Jones, White, Robinson,
Johnson, Jackson, Britt, Lewis, Patmon, Willis, Coats, Polensek, Rybka,
Cimperman, Cintron, Gordon, O’Malley,
Melena, Zone, Sweeney and Dolan.
An emergency resolution supporting the revised eligibility requirements of the Linked Deposit Loan
Program to include all residential
properties in the City of Cleveland.
Whereas, pursuant to Ordinance
No. 1062-99, passed by the Council of

the City of Cleveland on July 14,
1999, the City entered into a Linked
Deposit Loan Program Agreement
with the Cuyahoga County Treasurer; and
Whereas,
through
the
Linked
Deposit Loan Program, qualified
financial institutions provide low
interest rate loans to eligible borrowers for certain housing repairs
and improvements; and
Whereas, the County has committed a total of $40 million for loans
to be made through the Linked
Deposit Loan Program; and
Whereas, in its first three months
of operation, a total of 1066 loans in
the amount of $13,221,283.00, or 33%
of the total amount allocated for the
program, have been processed for
the City of Cleveland and its innerring suburbs, with the majority of
the loans being made to the innerring suburban areas; and
Whereas, in the City of Cleveland,
eligibility for the Linked Deposit
Loan Program has been limited to 5
unit-or-more multi-family structures;
and
Whereas, in order to provide
greater benefits to the residents of
the City of Cleveland, the County
and the City have sought to expand
the Linked Deposit Loan Program to
also include all single family homes
and 1-4 unit multi-family structures;
and
Whereas, the Linked Deposit Loan
Program will work in tandem with
the Cleveland Action to Support
Housing (CASH) program to offer
low interest loans to residents for
home improvements, but will be able
to provide additional loans through
the Linked Deposit Loan Program
since that program has a broader
definition of home improvements,
including landscaping, decks, driveway and sidewalk repair and room
additions; and
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland supports the revised
eligibility
requirements
of
the
Linked Deposit Loan Program to
include all residential properties;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that the revised eligibility requirements will help spur
the necessary investment to renovate many Cleveland homes and aid
in the development of additional
move-up housing in the City; now,
therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of
the City of Cleveland supports the
expansion of the Linked Deposit
Loan Program with the Cuyahoga
County Treasurer to include all
residential housing in the City of
Cleveland and urges residents to
avail
themselves
of
the
loans

By Councilmen Cimperman, Melena, Sweeney, Coats, White and Zone.
An emergency resolution urging
the State of Ohio Lottery Commission to reconsider its decision to
hold a second Pick 3 and Pick 4
drawing.
Whereas, the State of Ohio Lottery
Commission has recently decided to
expand its Pick 3 and Pick 4 number games in Ohio, and specifically
in Cleveland; and
Whereas, pursuant to an article
appearing in the Plain Dealer on
October 10, 1999, the lottery is generating an incredible amount of
money from the residents of the City
of Cleveland; and
Whereas, while this Council of the
City of Cleveland respects the rights
of citizens to freely choose the manner in which to spend their money
and to take part in these state sponsored games of chance, Council is
deeply concerned about the Ohio
Lottery Commission taking money
from working families who could
more wisely spend their money on
other expenditures such as food,
housing and clothing; and
Whereas, a second Pick 3 and
Pick 4 drawing of the lottery may
unfairly and unwisely target residents of neighborhoods in which
other
economic,
community
and
human
developments
should
be
funding
priorities,
rather
than
games of chance; now, therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland urges the State
Lottery Commission to reconsider its
decision to hold a second Pick 3 and
Pick 4 drawing, and to weigh the
potential for minimal winnings with
the tremendous negative side effects
in our neighborhoods.
Section 2. That the Council hereby requests that the Lottery Commission provide a full accounting of
its expenditures that benefit the
neighborhoods and residents of the
City of Cleveland and that the Director
of
the
Lottery
Commission
appear before the Council to present
that accounting.
Section
3.
That
the
Council
requests that the Lottery Commission identify the amount of money
generated by the Pick 3 and Pick 4
in each neighborhood and expend a
proportionate amount for the betterment of that specific neighborhood.
Section 4. That, in the interest of
our residents, the Lottery Commission meet with local elected officials
to discuss the proposed expansion of
any lottery games prior to their
expansion.
Section
5.
That
this
Council
urges
the
State
legislature
to
review the advantages and disadvantages of holding a state sponsored lottery.
Section 6. That the Clerk of
Council is hereby requested to
transmit a copy of this Resolution
to the following: Governor Robert
Taft; all Cleveland area State Representatives and State Senators;
Ohio Secretary of State J. Kenneth
Blackwell; and Mitchell Brown,
Director of the Lottery Commission.
